CONVERSION OF SHARES

 

Section 3.1 _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Initial Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, the
Merger Subs or the holder of any of the following securities:

(a) All outstanding limited liability company interests of Sub One held
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become (in
the aggregate) one fully paid and nonassessable share of the common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) Each Parent Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding from and after the
Effective Time.

(c) All shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Company Common Stock_ ") that are owned by Parent or the Company or any
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent or the Company (other than shares of Company
Common Stock held in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like, or
otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are beneficially owned
by third parties) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(d) Subject to _Section 3.1(c)_, each share of Company Common Stock
(including each Restricted Share which shall vest in full upon the Effective
Time) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (subject
to _Section 3.1(c_) and Section 3.4) shall be automatically converted into
and exchanged for the right to receive: (i) a number of Parent Common Shares
equal to $4.521 divided by the greater of (A) the Net Asset Value per Parent
Common Share computed no more than 48 hours (excluding Sundays and holidays)
before the Closing Date and (B) the Merger Share Price (such number, the "
_Exchange Ratio_ "), (ii) $0.226 in cash, and (iii) if the Merger Share Price
is less than the Net Asset Value per Parent Common Share computed pursuant to
clause (i), a cash payment in an amount equal to the lesser of (A) the
Exchange Ratio multiplied by $0.25 and (B) the Exchange Ratio multiplied by
the

 



14  difference between such Net Asset Value per Parent Common Share and the
Merger Share Price (collectively (ii) and (iii), the " _Cash Consideration_ ")
subject, in the case of clause (i), to payment of cash in lieu of fractional
Parent Common Shares as provided in _Section 3.3(e)_ (collectively, the "
_Merger Consideration_ "), without interest. As of the Effective Time, all
shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist and each holder of any such
shares of Company Common Stock (subject to _Section 3.1(c)_ and _Section
3.4_) shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, to be paid in consideration
therefor upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance
with _Section 3.3(a)_, as well as any dividends to which holders of Company
Common Stock become entitled in accordance with _Section 3.3(c)_. Sample
computations of the Merger Consideration are included as Schedule 3.1(d)
hereto. For the avoidance of doubt, the Cash Consideration payable under
clauses (ii) and (iii) of the first sentence of this Section 3.1(d) shall
under no circumstance exceed $8.339 million and $3.000 million, respectively,
for a maximum aggregate Cash Consideration of $11.339 million.

(e) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding number of Parent Common Shares shall have been increased,
decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares
or securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other
similar change in capitalization, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment
shall be made to the Merger Consideration payable per share of Company Common
Stock, if necessary and without duplication, to reflect such change.

 

Section 3.2 _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. Prior to the Effective Time,
(i) Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange
Agent, certificates representing the number of Parent Common Shares to be
issued pursuant to _Section 3.1(d)_ and the payment of any cash payable in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to  _Section 3.3(e)_ and (ii) the
Investment Adviser shall deposit with the Exchange Agent an amount in cash
sufficient to fund the Cash Consideration, in exchange for outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock (such cash and certificates for Parent Common Shares
being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). No payment made by
the Investment Adviser shall be subject to recoupment by the Investment
Adviser.

 

Section 3.3 _Delivery of Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than the second Business Day following the Effective Time,
the Surviving Company or Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
(the " _Certificates_ ") or Book-Entry Shares which were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(d)_, (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, as

 



15  applicable, to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, in exchange for the Merger Consideration as well as any dividends
or distributions to be paid pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_.

(b) Upon proper surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with
a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required
pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share, as applicable, shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable,
and such Company Common Stock so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.3_, each Certificate and
Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest, into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, have been
converted pursuant to _Section 3.1_. No interest will be paid or accrued on
any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable to the holders of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares.

 

(c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Shares
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry
Share, in each case unless and until the surrender of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share, as applicable, in accordance with this _Article III_. After
the surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable,
in accordance with this _Article III,_ the record holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive, without interest, the amount of dividends or other
distributions which theretofore had become payable with respect to the whole
Parent Common Shares which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by
such Certificate have been converted into the right to receive.

(d) The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this
_Article III_ as a result of the conversion of any shares of Company Common
Stock shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. At and after the Effective
Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company
of the shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Company or
the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article III_ , except as otherwise
provided by Law.

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, neither
certificates nor scrip for fractional Parent Common Shares shall be issued
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable. No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or
any other rights in respect of any fractional share. In lieu of the issuance
of any such fractional share, Parent shall pay to

 



16  each holder of Company Common Stock who otherwise would have been entitled
to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (without interest)
determined by multiplying (i) the fractional share interest to which such
holder would otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all shares of
Company Common Stock owned by such holder at the Effective Time to be
converted into Parent Common Shares) to receive pursuant to  _Section 3.1_
by (ii) the volume weighted average price per share (calculated to the nearest
one-thousandth of one cent) for the Parent Common Shares on the NASDAQ for the
consecutive period of five trading days concluding at the close of trading on
the second trading day immediately preceding the date of the Effective Time,
as calculated by Bloomberg Financial LP under the function "VWAP" (the "
_Parent Share Price_ ").

 

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of the
Company one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Parent. Any holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not
theretofore complied with this _Article III_ with respect to such Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares shall thereafter look only to the Parent for payment of
Merger Consideration and any unpaid dividends and other distributions on the
Parent Common Shares deliverable in respect of each former shares of Company
Common Stock such stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement,
in each case, without any interest thereon.

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any party
hereto shall be liable to any Person for any amount delivered in good faith to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall not have been
surrendered prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration in respect
thereof would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Entity, any such Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Parent, and any holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
who has not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ with respect thereto
shall thereafter look only to the Parent for payment of its claim for Merger
Consideration in respect thereof.

(h) The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by
Parent or the Surviving Company; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that any such
investments shall be in securities issued or directly and fully guaranteed or
insured by the United States government or any agency or instrumentality
thereof and having maturities of not more than one month from the date of
investment. Earnings on the Exchange Fund shall be the sole and exclusive
property of Parent and the Surviving Company and shall be paid to Parent or
the Surviving Company, as Parent directs. No investment of the Exchange Fund
shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent from making
the payments required by this _Article III_, and following any losses from
any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the
Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock at the Effective Time in the amount of such losses, which additional
funds will be deemed to be part of the Exchange Fund.

 



17 (i) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact (such affidavit shall be in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Exchange Agent) by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required by
the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which such Person
is entitled in respect of such Certificate pursuant to this _Article III_.

Section 3.4 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder who is entitled to demand and has properly
demanded appraisal for such Company Common Stock in accordance with, and who
complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such Shares, the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, and shall instead represent the right to receive
payment of the consideration due to such Dissenting Shares in accordance with
and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such holder
fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses his right to
appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or other applicable Law, then the
right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such Dissenting Shares shall
cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted, as of
the Effective Time, into and shall be exchangeable solely for the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, without interest and subject to any
withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law. The Company shall give Parent
prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Company
Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to rights to
be paid the fair value of Dissenting Shares, and the Parent shall have the
right to participate in and to control all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of the Parent, voluntarily make any
payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or
compromise, any such demands, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands,
or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

Section 3.5 _Withholding Taxes_. Each of the Surviving Company, each Merger
Sub, Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares, cash dividends or
other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_ or any other cash
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares
of Company Common Stock (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Cash
Consideration) such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law. Amounts so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
or withholding was made.

 

Section 3.6 _Net Asset Value Calculation_. Parent shall provide the Company
with a written statement setting forth its calculation of Net Asset Value,

 



18  including reasonable supporting detail, (a) as of a date mutually agreed
between Parent and the Company that is estimated to be seven Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, calculated as of such date (provided that Parent
agrees to update such calculation in the event that the Closing is
subsequently materially delayed and provided further that the board of
directors of Parent shall not be required to approve such computation of
Net Asset Value) and (b) not later than the Business Day prior to the Closing
Date, calculated as of the date that shall be applicable to the calculation of
Net Asset Value for purposes of Section 3.1(d). In each case, Parent shall
give the Company and its Representatives reasonable access to the individuals
who have prepared such calculation and to such information, books, records and
work papers as may be reasonably requested in order to assist the Company with
its review of such calculation. Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause
their respective Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with each other to
resolve any disputes over any aspect of the calculation of Net Asset Value.
Parent and the Company shall cooperate in good faith following the date of
this Agreement to agree on the form of such statement and backup materials.

 

Section 3.7 _Conversion of Shares in the Second Merger_. All outstanding
limited liability company interests of Sub Two held immediately prior to the
effective time of the Second Merger shall remain outstanding as limited
liability company interests in the Surviving Company and all shares of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation shall no longer be outstanding and shall
be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefor.

standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by

hereof by the other parties hereto), is a valid and binding obligation of the
Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except
that (i) such enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws, now or

for such violations, breaches, defaults, terminations, cancellations or

payable in connection therewith. As of their respective filing dates,
the Company SEC Reports (i) complied as to form in all material respects
with, to the extent in effect at the time of filing, the applicable

Entity.

(b) Except as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect, neither the

controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the
Exchange Act) to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by
the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is

Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure, and (ii) has disclosed to the Companys
auditors and the audit committee of the Companys board of directors (A) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of

its Subsidiaries, (ii) increase the amount or value of any benefit or
compensation otherwise payable or required to be provided to any such
employee, director, or independent contractor, or (iii) result in the
acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or funding of any such benefit or
compensation. No payment which is or may be made by, from or with respect to
any Company Benefit Plan either alone or in conjunction with any other
payment, event or occurrence under any Company Benefit Plan, (i) will or
could reasonably be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" under
Section 280G of the Code and (ii) will not be fully deductible as a result
of Section 162(m) of the Code.

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability with

suit, proceeding or governmental investigation (each an "Action") pending or,

exemptive relief from the SEC with respect to any such disqualification.

 

(d) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, the Company and its Subsidiaries (i) are and have

Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports filed by Parent prior to the

by reference therein, but excluding any disclosures set forth in any "risk
factors" or "forward-looking statements" sections to the extent they are
cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature) or in the Parent
Disclosure Letter (provided that disclosure of any item in any section or
subsection of the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosed with
respect to any other section or subsection to the extent that the relevance
of such disclosure is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure),
Parent and the Merger Subs jointly and severally represent and warrant to the
Company as follows:

 

Section 5.1 _Organization_. Each of Parent and each Merger Sub is a
corporation, partnership or other entity duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization and has the requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease
and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being
conducted, except where the failure to be so existing and in good standing or
to have such power and authority would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of Parent and each Merger Sub is
duly qualified or licensed to do business and in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing would not, individually or in the

be regulated as a BDC pursuant to the Investment Company Act and such election
has not been revoked or withdrawn and is in full force and effect. Parent has
made available to the Company a copy of the charter and bylaws or other
equivalent organizational documents of Parent and the Merger Subs, as

and free of preemptive rights. As of April 28, 2015, there were no existing
(i) options, warrants, calls, subscriptions or other rights, convertible

contractual obligations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase,

Meeting, assuming that a quorum is present (the " _Parent Stockholder
Approval_ "), to perform its obligations hereunder and consummate the

receipt of the Parent Stockholder Approval (and assuming due and valid
authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the Company) is a valid and
binding obligation of each of Parent and each Merger Sub, enforceable against
them in accordance with its terms, except that (i) such enforcement may be
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent

under such contract, agreement, commitment or arrangement would exceed
$50,000, or whereby such contract, agreement, commitment or arrangement would
otherwise constitute a Company Material Contract, or amend any
contract, agreement, commitment or arrangements in existence on the date
hereof that, after giving effect to such amendment, would impose an obligation
or liability on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under such contract,
agreement, commitment or arrangement in excess of $50,000 or constitute a
Company Material Contract;

(xv) other than in the ordinary course of business, terminate, cancel, renew
or agree to any material amendment of, change in or waiver under any Company
Material Contract;

 

(xvi) commence or settle any material claim, suit, action or proceeding;

incorporation or by-laws of the Company or similar governing documents of any
of its subsidiaries; or

any of the foregoing.

Section 6.2 _Interim Operations of Parent_.

 

(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the
Effective Time and the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section 8.1_, except (i) as may be required by Law, (ii) with
the prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, (iii) as contemplated or
permitted by this Agreement or (iv) as set forth in the Parent Disclosure

business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice and use
reasonable best efforts to preserve intact its business organization, keep
available the services of its current officers and employees, maintain in
effect all material licenses and permits required to carry on their respective
businesses, maintain in effect any exemptive orders or exemptive relief which
they have received from the SEC and which are currently in effect and preserve
their material business relationships; _provided_ , _however_ , that no action
by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to matters addressed
specifically by any provision of this _Section 6.2_ shall be deemed a breach
of this sentence unless such action would constitute a breach of such specific
provision.

 



43 (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the period from
the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the Effective Time and the date,
if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_,
except (i) as may be required by Law, (ii) with the prior written consent of
the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned, (iii) as required, contemplated or permitted by this Agreement or
(iv) as set forth in the Parent Disclosure Letter, Parent shall not, and shall
not permit any of its Subsidiaries to:

(i) except (A) for shares of Parents capital stock to be issued or delivered
pursuant to options outstanding on the date hereof, pursuant to the Parent
Benefit Plans, (B) as provided for in Parents dividend reinvestment plan and
(C) issuances of Parent Common Shares at a price per share at or above the
Parents then current Net Asset Value per Parent Common Share in one or more
underwritten offerings for cash, issue, deliver, sell, dispose of, pledge or
otherwise encumber, or authorize or propose the issuance, sale, disposition or
pledge or other encumbrance of (i) any shares of capital stock of any class
or any other ownership interest of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or any
securities or rights convertible into, exchangeable for, or evidencing the
right to subscribe for any shares of capital stock or any other ownership
interest of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or any rights, warrants,
options, calls, commitments or any other agreements of any character to
purchase or acquire any shares of capital stock or any other
ownership interest of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any securities or
rights convertible into, exchangeable for, or evidencing the right to
subscribe for, any shares of capital stock or any other ownership interest of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) any other securities of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries in respect of, in lieu of, or in substitution for,
capital stock outstanding on the date hereof;

 

(ii) split, combine, subdivide or reclassify any Parent Common Shares or

or otherwise make any payments to stockholders in their capacity as such,
other than dividends by a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or
regular quarterly dividends in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice, and special dividends in such amounts as determined by the
Parents board of directors in its sole discretion (but not to exceed Parents
undistributed net investment income at the time of such dividend), in each
case, on the Parent Common Shares;

(iii) acquire or agree to acquire by merging or consolidating with, or by
purchasing an equity interest in or assets or properties of, or by any other
manner, any business or any corporation, partnership, association or other
business organization or division thereof, if such transaction would
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
Merger;

(iv) enter into any new line of business;

 



44 (v) commence or settle any material claim, suit, action or proceeding;

 

(vi) take any action that would, or would reasonably be expected to, (i)
result in the failure of any condition set forth in _Article VII_ or (ii)
prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the Merger
and/or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

(vii) directly or indirectly take any action, or knowingly fail to take any
action, which action or failure to act is reasonably likely to cause Parent
to fail to qualify or not be subject to tax as a RIC;

(viii) make any material change in any of the tax or financial accounting
principles, practices or methods used by the Parent unless required by GAAP or
applicable law;

 

(ix) except as contemplated by this Agreement, amend the charter or bylaws or
similar organizational documents of the Parent or Merger Subs;

(x) take any action that would reasonably be expected to delay materially or
adversely affect the ability of any of the parties hereto to obtain any
consent, authorization, order or approval of any Governmental Entity or the

(xi) enter into any contract, agreement, commitment or arrangement to do any

Section 6.3 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice, each of the Company and Parent shall (and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to) afford to officers, employees, counsel,
investment bankers, accountants and other authorized representatives ("
_Representatives_ ") of the other party reasonable access, in a manner not
disruptive to the operations of its and its Subsidiaries business,
during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice throughout the period
prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this
Agreement, to its and its Subsidiaries properties, books and records and,
during such period, shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to)
furnish promptly to such Representatives all information concerning its and
its Subsidiaries business as may reasonably be requested; _provided_ _,_
_however_ , that nothing herein shall require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to disclose any information
to the other party if such disclosure would, in the reasonable judgment of the
Company or Parent, as applicable, (i) cause significant competitive harm to
it or its Subsidiaries or portfolio companies if the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement are not consummated, (ii) violate applicable Law or the
provisions of any agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries or
portfolio companies is a party or (iii) jeopardize any attorney-client or
other privilege or trade secret protection. If any of the information or

 



45  material furnished pursuant to this _Section 6.3_ includes material or
information subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or
any other applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened Litigation or
governmental investigations, each party hereto understands and agrees that the
parties hereto have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters and
it is the desire, intention and mutual understanding of the parties hereto
that the sharing of such material or information is not intended to, and shall
not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or
information or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All such information
provided by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is entitled to
protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine
or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under
these privileges, this Agreement, and the joint defense doctrine.

 

(b) The Company and Parent will not, and will cause its Representatives not
to, use any information obtained pursuant to this  _Section 6.3_ for any
competitive or other purpose unrelated to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(c) Parent hereby agrees that the confidentiality agreement, dated February 9,
2015, between the Company and the Adviser shall apply with respect to
information furnished by the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Companys
officers, employees and other Representatives hereunder. Company hereby agrees
that the confidentiality agreement, dated April 7, 2015 (together with the
confidentiality agreement referenced in the previous sentence, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between Parent and the Company shall apply
with respect to information furnished by Parent, its Subsidiaries, the Adviser
and Parents officers, employees and other Representatives hereunder.

Section 6.4 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) Subject to the provisions of this _Section 6.4_, the Company will not,
and will cause its Subsidiaries not to, and will instruct the Companys and
its Subsidiaries respective officers, directors, employees and other
Representatives not to, (i) initiate or solicit or knowingly encourage any
inquiries with respect to, or the making of, any Acquisition Proposal or (ii)
except as permitted below, (A) engage in negotiations or discussions with or
provide any information or data to, any Person relating to an Acquisition
Proposal, (B) approve, endorse or recommend, or propose publicly to approve,
endorse or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or (C) execute or enter into
any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement or other similar agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal
(other than a confidentiality agreement contemplated by _Section 6.4(b)_).
The Company shall, and shall direct each of its Representatives to,
immediately cease any solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any
Person (other than Parent or Merger Subs) conducted heretofore with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal and promptly request return or destruction of
confidential information related thereto.

 



46 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, in the event that the
Company receives a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that is not received in
violation of this _Section 6.4_, the Company and its board of directors may
participate in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish any information
to, any Person making such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives or
potential sources of financing if the Companys board of directors determines
in good faith, after consultation with its counsel and financial advisor,
that such Person is reasonably likely to submit to the Company a Superior
Proposal and that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to
be inconsistent with the board of directors fiduciary duties; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, prior to providing any nonpublic information to such Person,
the Company shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such
Person on terms that are substantially similar to the confidentiality
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement between the Company and the
Adviser and that any nonpublic information concerning the Company and its
Subsidiaries provided to such Person, to the extent not previously provided to
Parent, is promptly provided to Parent. In addition, nothing herein shall
restrict the Company from complying with its disclosure obligations with
regard to any Acquisition Proposal under applicable Law.

 

(c) The Company will promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) notify Parent
of the receipt by the Company of any Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall
include the material terms of and identity of the Person(s) making such
Acquisition Proposal. The Company will (subject to the fiduciary duties of the
board of directors) keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and
material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal and of any
material amendments or proposed material amendments thereto and will promptly
notify Parent of any determination by the Companys board of directors that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal.

(d) The board of directors of the Company may, at any time prior to obtaining
the Company Stockholder Approval, (i) approve, endorse or recommend a
Superior Proposal or enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal or (ii) modify or amend in a manner adverse to Parent or
withdraw the Company Recommendation ((i) or (ii) above being referred to as a
" _Change in Recommendation_ "), _provided_ that (x) prior to such Change in
Recommendation, the board of directors of the Company determines, in good
faith (after consultation with its counsel), that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and (y) such Change in Recommendation is in connection with a
Superior Proposal.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company may not terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement
with respect to a Superior Proposal unless (i) it notifies Parent in writing
of its intention to take such action at least three (3) Business Days prior to
taking such action, specifying the material terms of any applicable Superior
Proposal and identifying the Person(s) making such Superior Proposal, (ii)
Parent does not make, after being provided with reasonable opportunity to
negotiate with the Company and its Representatives, 

 



47  within such three (3) Business Day period, irrevocable adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement that the board of directors of the
Company determines, in good faith after consultation with its counsel and
financial advisors, is at least as favorable to the Companys stockholders as
such Superior Proposal and (iii) the Company is not in material breach of this
_Section 6.4_.

 

Section 6.5 _Employee Matters_. The Company shall cause the employment or
services of all employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries to be
terminated immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that
such termination shall be contingent upon the Effective Time occurring. Upon
the Effective Time, the cash severance payments and benefits provided
under the applicable Company Benefit Plans (based on a termination without
"cause" or "qualifying termination" as applicable) shall be paid in full in a
lump sum to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries and to any
former employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who is receiving
severance payments and/or benefits that have not been previously paid in full
as of the Effective Time (collectively the " _Affected Employees_ "), with the
amount in respect of health, dental, vision and hospitalization benefits to
equal the full premium amount for such benefits for the applicable coverage
period plus the amount necessary so that after the payment of all income and
employment taxes, the Affected Employee retains the full aggregate premium
amount (with such amounts determined in a manner consistent with the
methodology used in the summary of such payments previously provided by the
Company to Parent); provided, however, that any and all payments to be made
under this Section 6.5 shall be made in accordance with the requirements of
Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. Parent and
the Company agree to cooperate during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing Date to assist the Affected Employees in obtaining
post-Closing health, dental, vision and hospitalization benefits, which
benefits, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be the exclusive expense of each
such Affected Employee. Parent is externally-managed and therefore has no
employees and is not capable of hiring employees. The Investment Adviser
intends to meet with employees of the Company to discuss potential employment
opportunities with the Investment Adviser. The parties acknowledge and agree
that the Merger shall constitute a "change of control" within the meaning of
each Company Benefit Plan.

 

Section 6.6 _Reserved_.

 

Section 6.7 _Reserved_.

 

Section 6.8 _Publicity_. The initial press release by each of Parent and the
Company with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be in a form
reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company. Neither the Company nor
Parent (nor any of their respective controlled Affiliates) shall issue any
other press release or make any other public announcement with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior
agreement of the other party, except as may be required by Law or by any
listing agreement with a national securities exchange, in which case the party
proposing to issue

 



48  such press release or make such public announcement shall use its reasonable
best efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before making any
such public announcements;  _provided_ that the Company will no longer be
required to obtain the prior agreement of or consult with Parent in connection
with any such press release or public announcement if the Companys board of
directors has effected a Change in Recommendation (including in connection
with any press release or public announcement relating to such Change in
Recommendation).

 

Section 6.9 _Directors  and Officers Insurance and Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Company shall
indemnify and hold harmless each current and former director, officer or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each Person who served
at the Companys request as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary
of another corporation, limited liability company, partnership,
joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise
(each, together with such Persons heirs, executors or administrators, an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or
threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of, relating to or in
connection with actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, and Parent and the Surviving Company shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, promptly advance expenses as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted by Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced shall undertake to repay
such advanced expenses to the Parent and the Surviving Company , if it is
ultimately determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _Section 6.9(a)_. The limited liability
company agreement of the Surviving Company shall contain the provisions with
respect to indemnification and advancement of expenses set forth in the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company on the date of this
Agreement (subject to any applicable distinctions between the DGCL and the
DLLCA), which provisions thereafter shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of the Indemnified Parties.

(b) Parent and the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Company to, maintain in effect for not less than six (6) years from
the Effective Time the current policies of directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (including the policies listed
on  _Section 6.9_ of the Company Disclosure Letter) maintained by the
Company and the Companys Subsidiaries for the Indemnified Parties and any
other employees, agents or other individuals otherwise covered by such
insurance policies prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Insured
Parties_ ") with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); _provided_
that Parent and the Surviving Company may substitute therefor policies of
substantially the same coverage containing terms and conditions that are no
less advantageous to the Insured Parties and _provided_ ,

 



49   _further_ , that in no event shall Parent and the Surviving Company be
required to pay annual premiums for insurance under this _Section 6.9(b)_ in
excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the
date hereof for its existing directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance (the " _Maximum Premium_ "), it being understood
that if such terms and conditions cannot be obtained or can be obtained only
by paying an annual premium in excess of the Maximum Premium, Parent shall
only be required to obtain as much similar insurance as may be obtained for
such Maximum Premium. At the Companys option, the Company may purchase prior
to the Effective Time a six-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions
providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance (including the policies listed on _Section 6.9_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter) maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect
to matters arising on or before the Effective Time, covering without
limitation the transactions contemplated hereby. If the Company does not elect
to purchase a prepaid "tail" policy, Parent may, at its option, at or after
the Effective Time, purchase a "tail" policy. If such "tail" prepaid policy
has been obtained by the Company (or Parent pursuant to the preceding
sentence) prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause such policy to be
maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause
all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Company, and no
other party shall have any further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance
hereunder.

 

(c) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 6.9_.

(d) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have
under the certificates of incorporation or bylaws or other organization
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Company,
any other indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise.

(e) This _Section 6.9_ is intended to benefit the Insured Parties and the
Indemnified Parties, and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of
Parent, Merger Subs, the Company and the Surviving Company. Parent hereby
guarantees the payment and performance by the Surviving Company of
the indemnification and other obligations pursuant to this _Section 6.9_ and
the limited liability company agreement of the Surviving Company.

 

(f) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers or conveys a majority of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors, assigns and transferees of Parent or the Surviving
Company or their respective successors or assigns, as the case may be, assume
the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.9_.

 

Section 6.10 _Proxy Statement; Special Meetings_.

 



50 (a) The Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law and its certificate
of incorporation and by-laws, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
special meeting of the Companys stockholders (including any adjournment or
postponement thereof, the " _Company Special Meeting_ ") as soon as
practicable following the date hereof, for the purpose of considering the
adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger. The Company shall,
subject to a Change in Recommendation in accordance with _Section 6.4_, use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval at the
Company Special Meeting; _provided_ , _however_ that if the Companys board of
directors effects a Change in Recommendation, the Company may cease to use
such efforts. A Change in Recommendation effected in accordance with the
provisions of _Section 6.4_ will not constitute a breach by the Company of
this Agreement. The Company shall, upon the request of Parent, adjourn the
Company Special Meeting on one or more occasions to the extent necessary to
solicit additional proxies in favor of adoption of this Agreement for such
time period as determined by Parent; provided that (i) such adjournment shall
not exceed 15 days for each such adjournment and (ii) no such adjournment
shall be permitted if the Company shall have received an aggregate number of
proxies voting for the adoption of this Agreement sufficient to adopt this
Agreement and approve the Merger. Once a record date has been chosen for
the Company Special Meeting, the Company shall not change such record date or
establish a different record date without the prior written consent of Parent
(not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless required to
do so by the DGCL. 

(b) Parent shall, in accordance with applicable Law and its charter and
bylaws, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of
Parents stockholders (including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the
" _Parent Special Meeting_ ") as soon as practicable following the date
hereof, for the purpose of considering the approval of the issuance of Parent
Common Shares in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Parent
Stockholder Approval at the Parent Special Meeting. Unless otherwise agreed to
in writing by the Company, the proposal to issue Parent Common Shares in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall be
submitted to the stockholders of Parent at the Parent Special Meeting for the
purpose of approving such proposal. Parent shall, upon the request of the
Company, and may, if the Company does not make such request, adjourn the
Parent Special Meeting on one or more occasions to the extent necessary to
solicit additional proxies in favor of adoption of this Agreement for such
time period as determined by the Company; provided that (i) such adjournment
shall not exceed 15 days for each such adjournment and (ii) no such
adjournment shall be permitted if Parent shall have received an
aggregate number of proxies voting to approve the issuance of Parent Common
Shares in the Merger sufficient to approve such proposal. Once a record date
has been chosen for the Parent Special Meeting, Parent shall not change such
record date or establish a different record date without the prior written
consent of the Company (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) unless required to do so by the Maryland General Corporation Law.

 

(c) As soon as practicable following the date hereof (but in no case later
than 30 days after the date hereof), Parent and the Company shall cooperate
to

 



51  prepare and file with the SEC the Form N-14 and furnish the information
required to be provided to the stockholders of Parent and the Company pursuant
to the DGCL and any other applicable Laws. Each of Parent and the Company
shall furnish all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors,
officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable in connection with the Form N-14. Subject to a Change
in Recommendation, the Proxy Statement included in the Form N-14 shall include
the Company Recommendation and the Parent Recommendation.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company may, from time to time, adjourn the Company Special Meeting,
including to solicit additional proxies in favor of the Agreement or to ensure
that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement or the Form N-14 is
provided to the stockholders of the Company sufficiently in advance of the
vote to be held at such meeting.

Section 6.11 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall each use
their reasonable best efforts to promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or to cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with
the other parties in doing all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) obtain from any Governmental Entities any
actions, non-actions, clearances, waivers, consents, approvals,
authorizations, licenses, permits or orders required to be obtained by the
Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the
authorization, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and obtain from third
parties all waivers, consents, approvals and authorizations that are necessary
or advisable in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; (iii) make all necessary registrations and filings, and
thereafter make any other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement
and the Merger required under (A) any applicable federal or state securities
Laws, (B) any applicable competition, antitrust or investment Laws and (C)
any other applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company and Parent
will cooperate with each other in connection with the making of all such
filings, including providing copies of all such filings and attachments to
outside counsel for the non-filing party; (iv) furnish all information
required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant to any
applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (v) keep the other party informed in all material respects of any
material communication received by such party from, or given by such party to,
any Governmental Entity and of any material communication received or given
in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (vi) permit the other parties
to review any material communication delivered to, and consult with the other
party in advance of any meeting or conference with, any Governmental Entity
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or in connection
with any proceeding by a private party relating thereto, and give the other
party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences (to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity or private
party); (vii) avoid the entry of, or have vacated or terminated, any decree,
order, or judgment that

 



52  would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, including defending any
lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; and (viii) execute and deliver any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No
parties to this Agreement shall consent to any voluntary delay of the Closing
at the behest of any Governmental Entity without the consent of the other
parties to this Agreement, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Without limiting this _Section 6.11_, Parent agrees to take, or to cause to
be taken, any and all steps and to make any and all undertakings necessary to
avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust, merger
control, competition, or trade regulation Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to
occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event, no later than the
Outside Date), including proposing, negotiating, committing to, and effecting,
by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture,
licensing or disposition of such assets or businesses of Parent (or its
Subsidiaries) or the Surviving Company or otherwise taking or committing to
take actions that limit Parents or its Subsidiaries freedom of action with
respect to, or their ability to retain, any of the businesses, product lines
or assets of Parent (or its Subsidiaries) or the Surviving Company, in each
case, as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect
the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order, or other
order in any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of
preventing or delaying the Closing.

 

Section 6.12 _Merger Subs and Surviving Company_. Parent will take all actions
necessary to (a) cause each of the Merger Subs and the Surviving Company to
perform promptly their respective obligations under this Agreement, (b) cause
each of the Merger Subs to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement and (c) ensure that, prior to the Effective Time,
the Merger Subs shall not conduct any business, make any investments or incur
or guarantee any indebtedness.

 

Section 6.13 _Takeover Statute_. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "business
combination," "control share acquisition," "interested person," "interested
stockholder" or other form of anti-takeover statute or regulation shall become
applicable to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, each
of the Company and Parent and the members of their respective boards of
directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably
necessary so that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated herein
and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation on this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 6.14 _Listing of Parent Common Shares_. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Parent Common Shares to be issued in the
Merger to be approved for listing on the NASDAQ, subject to official notice of
issuance, as promptly as practicable, and in any event prior to the Effective
Time.

 

Section 6.15 _Rule 16b-3_. The Company and Parent shall each take such steps
as may be necessary or advisable to cause dispositions of Company equity
securities (including derivative securities) and acquisitions of Parent Common

would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect;

all material respects with all of the respective obligations and covenants
hereunder required to be performed or complied with by Parent or the Merger

or the Merger Subs may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in
_Section 7.1_, _Section 7.2_ or _Section 7.3_, as the case may be, to be
satisfied if such failure was caused by such partys failure to act in good
faith or use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as required by and subject
to _Section 6.11_.

 



57 ARTICLE VIII

 

TERMINATION

 

Section 8.1 _Termination_. Anything herein or elsewhere to the contrary
notwithstanding, this Agreement may be terminated and the Merger contemplated
herein may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether
before or after stockholder approval of this Agreement:

 

(a) by the mutual written agreement of the Company and Parent.

 

(b) by either the Company or Parent:

 

(i) if the Merger shall not have occurred on or prior to January 28, 2016 (the
" _Outside Date_ ");  _provided however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to any party
whose failure to perform or comply with the covenants and agreements of such
party set forth in this Agreement has been the proximate cause of the failure
of the Merger to occur on or prior to such date;

(ii) if any Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over the Company, Parent
or the Merger Subs shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any
other action, in each case permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such
order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and
nonappealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the party seeking to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ shall have used its
reasonable best efforts to contest, appeal and remove such order, decree,
ruling or other action in accordance with _Section 6.11_;

 

(iii) if the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the
Company Special Meeting duly convened therefor or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof at which a vote on the approval and adoption of this
Agreement was taken; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ if the
Company has breached in any material respect any of its obligations under this
Agreement, in each case in a manner that caused the failure to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Special Meeting, or at any
adjournment or postponement thereof; or

(iv) if the Parent Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the
Parent Special Meeting duly convened therefor or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof at which a vote on the approval and adoption of this
Agreement was taken; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parent may not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)(iv)_ if the Parent
has breached in any material respect any of its obligations under this
Agreement, in

 



58  each case in a manner that caused the failure to obtain the Parent
Stockholder Approval at the Parent Special Meeting or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof.

 

(c) by the Company:

 

(i) if Parent or either Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to perform
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform, either individually or in
the aggregate, (A) would give rise to the failure of the conditions set forth
in _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ (assuming that the date of such
determination is the Closing Date) and (B) cannot be or has not been cured, in
all material respects, within twenty (20) days after the giving of written
notice to Parent (or, if less than twenty (20) days prior to the Outside
Date, prior to the Outside Date); _provided_ that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this _Section 8.1(c)(i)_ shall not be available to the
Company if it has failed to perform in any material respect any of its
obligations under this Agreement required to be performed by it at or prior to
the Closing; or

 

(ii) prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, and subject to the
terms and conditions of  _Section 6.4(e)_, in order to accept a Superior
Proposal.

(d) By Parent:

 

(i) if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform, either individually or in the
aggregate, (A) would give rise to the failure of the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_ (assuming that the date of such
determination is the Closing Date) and (B) cannot be or has not been cured, in
all material respects, within twenty (20) days after the giving of written
notice to Parent (or, if less than twenty (20) days prior to the Outside
Date, prior to the Outside Date); _provided_ that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this _Section 8.1(d)_ shall not be available to Parent if it
or either Merger Sub is then in material breach of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement; or

(ii) if the Companys board of directors shall have effected a Change in
Recommendation.

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall terminate and become void and have no
effect, and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be abandoned
without further action by the Parties, _provided_ that _Section 6.3(c)_, this
_Section 8.2_, _Section 9.8_,  _Section 9.9_, _Section 9.10_ and _Section
9.14_ shall survive the termination of

 



59  this Agreement and _provided_ , _further_ , the Confidentiality Agreement
shall survive any such termination in accordance with its terms. Nothing
contained in this  _Section 8.2_ shall relieve Parent, either Merger Sub or
the Company from liability for any breach of this Agreement, or as provided
for in the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated:

 

(i) by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_;

 

(ii) by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii);_ or

 

(iii) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ or
_Section 8.1(b)(iii)_, (A) (I) in the case of _Section 8.1(b)(i)_, there
has been publicly disclosed prior to the Outside Date an Acquisition Proposal
which is not withdrawn prior to the time of such termination or (II) in the
case of  _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_, there has been publicly disclosed prior to
the time of the Company Special Meeting an Acquisition Proposal which is not
withdrawn prior to the time of the Company Special Meeting and (B) within
twelve (12) months after such termination, the Company enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to a transaction pursuant to any Acquisition
Proposal, which transaction is later consummated,

 

then the Company shall pay to Parent a termination fee of $7 million in cash
(the " _Company Fee_ "), concurrently with any termination pursuant to
_Section 8.1(c)(ii)_, and within two (2) Business Days after the consummation
of the transaction contemplated by _Section 8.2(b)(iii)_ or any termination
by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_, as applicable; _provided_ ,
that, solely for the purposes of this _Section 8.2(b)_, the term "Acquisition
Proposal" shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in _Section 1.1_, except
that all references in such definition to 25% shall be changed to 50%.

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to 
_Section 8.1(b)(iv)_, then Parent shall pay to the Company a termination fee
of $7 million in cash (the " _Parent Fee_ ") on the date of any such
termination.

 

(d) All payments contemplated by this _Section 8.2_ shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
applicable party and shall be reduced by any amounts required to be deducted
or withheld therefrom under applicable Law in respect of Taxes. The parties
hereto agree that in no event shall the Company or Parent be required to
pay the Company Fee or Parent Fee, as the case may be, on more than one
occasion.

(e) The Company and Parent acknowledge that each of the Company Fee and the
Parent Fee is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable
amount that will compensate the other party for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and
in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, which amounts would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision. Subject to _Section 9.12_ and 
_Section 8.2(a)_, (i) Parent and the Merger Subs

 



60  acknowledge and agree that, in circumstances in which the Company Fee is
payable, receipt of the Company Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for
money damages of Parent and the Merger Subs against the Company, and shall in
all cases be the sole and exclusive remedy against any of the Companys
officers, employees, stockholders, Representatives, agents or advisors
(collectively, the " _Company Covered Persons_ "), and upon payment of the
Company Fee, none of the Company nor any Company Covered Persons, as the case
may be, shall have any further monetary liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and
(ii) the Company acknowledges and agrees that, in the circumstances in which
the Parent Fee is payable, receipt of the Parent Fee shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy for damages of the Company against Parent and the Merger
Subs, and shall in all such cases be the sole and exclusive remedy for money
damages of the Company against Parent and the Merger Subs, and shall in all
cases be the sole and exclusive remedy against any of Parents or the Merger
Subs officers, employees, stockholders, members, Representatives, agents or
advisors (collectively, the " _Parent Covered Persons_ "), and upon payment of
the Parent Fee under such circumstances, none of Parent, the Merger Subs, nor
any of the Parent Covered Persons, as the case may be, shall have any further
monetary liability or obligations relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby.

any Business Day after 5:00 P.M. (addressees local time) shall be deemed to
have been received at 9:00 A.M. (addressees local time) on the next Business
Day A partys rejection or other refusal to accept notice hereunder or the

partys changed address or facsimile number of which no notice was given by
such party shall be deemed to be receipt of the notice by such party as of the
date of such rejection, refusal or inability to deliver. Nothing in this
section shall be deemed to constitute consent to the manner or address for
service of process in connection with any legal proceeding, including
litigation arising out of or in connection with this Agreement.

 

Section 9.4 _Interpretation_. The parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship
of any provisions of this Agreement. Disclosure of any fact, circumstance or
information in any section of the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent
Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosed for the purposes of any sections
of this Agreement to which such section relates and any other sections of
this Agreement to the extent it is reasonably apparent that such disclosure
also qualifies or applies to such other sections of this Agreement. The
inclusion of any item in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent
Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to be an admission or evidence of
materiality of such item, nor shall it establish any standard of materiality
for any purpose whatsoever.

 



63 Section 9.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, all of which shall together be considered one and the same
agreement.

Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter and the
exhibits hereto, together with the other instruments referred to herein) and
the Confidentiality Agreement (a) constitute the entire agreement and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and (b) except as
provided in _Article III_ (which, from and after the Effective Time, shall be
for the benefit of the holders of the Company Common Stock) and _Sections 6.5_
and _6.9_ , are not intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties
hereto any rights or remedies hereunder; _provided_ that the Indemnified
Parties and the Insured Parties shall have the right to seek specific
performance and pursue monetary damages in the event of Parents or the
Surviving Companys breach of _Section 6.9_. The representations
and warranties set forth in _Articles IV_ and _V_ and the covenants and
agreements set forth in _Article VI_ have been made solely for the benefit of
the parties to this Agreement and (a) may be intended not as statements of
fact, but rather as a way of allocating risk to one of the parties if those
statements prove to be inaccurate; (b) have been qualified in certain
instances by references to the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent
Disclosure Letter, which contain certain disclosures not reflected in the
text of this Agreement; and (c) may apply standards of materiality in a way
that is different from what may be viewed as material by the stockholders of,
or other investors in, the Company or Parent. 

Section 9.7 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy,
the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way
be affected, impaired or invalidated.

Section 9.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts to
be made and performed entirely therein without giving effect to the principles
of conflicts of law thereof or of any other jurisdiction.

 

Section 9.9 _Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto hereby (a) expressly
and irrevocably submits to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the
Delaware Court of Chancery, and any state appellate court therefrom within the
State of Delaware (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery shall decline to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, in which case, in any
Delaware state or federal court within the State of Delaware) (each, a "
_Chosen Court_ ") in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that it will
not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court, (c) agrees that it will not bring any
action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in any court other than a Chosen Court and (d) each of the
parties hereto agrees that each of the other parties shall have the right to
bring any action or proceeding for enforcement of a judgment entered by Chosen
Court in any other court or jurisdiction.

 



64 Section 9.10 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE
PARTIES HERETO ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND
SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS CONTAINED IN THIS _SECTION 9.10_.

Section 9.11 _Service of Process_. Each party irrevocably consents to the
service of process outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred
to in _Section 9.9_ hereof in any such action or proceeding by mailing copies
thereof by registered United States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt
requested, to its address as specified in or pursuant to _Section 9.3_
hereof. However, the foregoing shall not limit the right of a party to effect
service of process on the other party by any other legally available method.

Section 9.12 _Specific Performance_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges
and agrees that, in the event of any breach of this Agreement, each
nonbreaching party would be irreparably and immediately harmed and could not
be made whole by monetary damages. Each party agrees that, in the event of any
breach or threatened breach by any other party of any covenant or obligation
contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching party shall be entitled (in
addition to any other remedy that may be available to it whether in law or
equity, including monetary damages) to seek (a) a decree or order of specific
performance to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant or
obligation, and (b) an injunction restraining such breach or threatened
breach. In circumstances where Parent and the Merger Subs are obligated
to consummate the Merger and the Merger has not been consummated and Parent
Stockholder Approval has been obtained, Parent and the Merger Subs expressly
acknowledge and agree that the Company and its stockholders shall have
suffered irreparable harm, that monetary damages may be inadequate to
compensate the Company its stockholders, and that the Company on behalf of
itself and its stockholders shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy
that may be available to it whether in law or equity, including monetary
damages) to enforce specifically Parents and Merger Subs obligations to
consummate the Merger. Each party further agrees that no other party or any
other person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy
referred to in this Section 9.12, and each party irrevocably waives any rights
it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such
bond or similar instrument.

Section 9.13 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

 



65 Section 9.14 _Expenses_. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with
the Merger, this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such costs and
expenses, whether or not the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby is consummated, except that all fees paid in respect of any regulatory
filing shall be borne by Parent and all fees paid in respect of the
preparation, filing and mailing of the Proxy Statement and the Form N-14 and
the conduct of the special meetings shall be shared equally between the
parties.

Section 9.15 _Headings_. Headings of the articles and sections of this
Agreement and the table of contents, schedules and exhibits are for
convenience of the parties only and shall be given no substantive or
interpretative effect whatsoever.

 

Section 9.16 _Waivers_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any
failure of any of the parties to comply with any obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition herein may be waived by the party or parties entitled
to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party
expressly granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist
upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition
shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent
or other failure.
