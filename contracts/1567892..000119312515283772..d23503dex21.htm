v _STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT_

 

THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of August 9,
2015, is made by and among TGG Medical Solutions, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ "), Mallinckrodt Enterprises LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (the " _Purchaser_ "), Mallinckrodt plc, an Irish
public limited company (" _Parent_ ") (solely for purposes of _Section
12.20_), and TGG Medical Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
(the " _Seller_ "). Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein
have the meanings set forth in _Article XI_ below.

WHEREAS, the Seller is the record and beneficial owner of 1,000 shares of
Series A common stock, $0.001 par value, of the Company (the " _Shares_ ");

WHEREAS, the Shares represent all of the issued and outstanding equity
securities (and rights to acquire equity securities) of the Company;

WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to enter into this Agreement pursuant to
which the Seller shall sell to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall purchase
from the Seller, all of the Shares; and

 

WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

_SALE AND PURCHASE OF SHARES_

1.01 _Sale and Purchase of Shares_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Seller agrees to sell, assign,
transfer and deliver to the Purchaser at the Closing, and the Purchaser agrees
that it shall purchase and accept delivery from the Seller of all of the
Shares, which Shares shall constitute all of the outstanding equity
securities (and rights to acquire equity securities) of the Company, free and
clear of any Liens.

1.02 _Consideration_. As consideration for the Shares, the Purchaser shall
pay to the Seller, in the manner described herein, an amount equal to the
Closing Cash Consideration (which shall be paid at the Closing) plus the
Additional Consideration (which shall be paid if and when payable in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement).

1.03 _Closing Calculations_. Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to
the anticipated Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to the Purchaser, its
written estimate and supporting calculations (the " _Closing Statement_ ") of
(i) Cash (the " _Estimated Cash_ "), (ii) Indebtedness (the " _Estimated
Indebtedness_ "), (iii) Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Net Working
Capital Amount_ ") and (iv) Transaction Expenses (the " _Estimated
Transaction Expenses_ ").

 



1  During the preparation of the Closing Statement (if requested by Purchaser)
and after the delivery of the Closing Statement, Purchaser and its
Representatives shall have a reasonable opportunity to review and to discuss
with the Company and its Representatives the Companys and its Subsidiaries
working papers and other books and records and the working papers of the
Companys independent accountants, if any, relating to the preparation of the
Closing Statement and the calculation of the Estimated Cash, Estimated
Indebtedness, Estimated Net Working Capital Amount and Estimated Transaction
Expenses.

 

1.04 _Final Closing Balance Sheet Calculation_. Within ninety (90) days after
the Closing Date, the Purchaser will deliver to the Seller a consolidated
balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to
the Closing (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and a statement showing the
calculation of Cash, Indebtedness and Net Working Capital derived from the
Closing Balance Sheet and of Transaction Expenses (together with the Closing
Balance Sheet, the " _Preliminary Statement_ "). The Closing Balance Sheet
shall be prepared and Cash, Indebtedness and Net Working Capital shall be
determined (including by the Company for purposes of _Section 1.03_) on a
consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied, using the
same accounting methods, policies, principles, practices and procedures, with
consistent classifications, judgments and estimation methodology, as were used
in the preparation of the calculation of Net Working Capital set forth on
_Exhibit A_ , and to the extent not specified on _Exhibit A_ , in the
preparation of the Latest Balance Sheet, and shall not include any changes in
assets or liabilities as a result of purchase accounting adjustments or other
changes arising from or resulting as a consequence of the transactions
contemplated hereby. After delivery of the Preliminary Statement and until
the end of the Review Period, the Seller and its accountants and other
Representatives shall be permitted reasonable access to review the Companys
and its Subsidiaries books and records and any work papers related to the
preparation of the Preliminary Statement. The Seller and its accountants and
other Representatives may make reasonable inquiries of the Purchaser, the
Company and their respective accountants regarding questions concerning or
disagreements with the Preliminary Statement arising in the course of their
review thereof, and the Purchaser shall use its, and shall cause the Company
and its Subsidiaries to use their, commercially reasonable efforts to cause
any such accountants to cooperate with and respond to such inquiries. At the
request of the Seller, the Company shall provide the Seller with reasonable
access to the financial and accounting staff of the Company and all
information reasonably requested by Seller in each case in connection with
Sellers review of the Preliminary Statement and any objections or disputes
with respect thereto pursuant to this _Section 1.04_. If the Seller has any
objections to the Preliminary Statement, the Seller shall deliver to the
Purchaser a statement setting forth in reasonable detail its objections
thereto, including (if Seller has sufficient substantiating information) its
calculation of each disputed item (an " _Objections Statement_ "). If an
Objections Statement is not delivered (or is delivered only as to a specific
portion or portions of the Cash, Indebtedness, Net Working Capital or
Transaction Expenses calculation) to the Purchaser within sixty (60) days
after delivery of the Preliminary Statement to the Seller (such sixty (60) day
period, the " _Review Period_ "), the Preliminary Statement (or such portion
of it that is not in dispute) shall be final, binding and non-appealable by
the parties hereto. The Seller and the Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith
to resolve any such objections, but if they do not reach a final resolution
within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the Objections Statement (the "
_Negotiation Period_ "), the Seller and the Purchaser shall, within fifteen
(15) days after the end of the Negotiation Period, submit such dispute to
Grant Thornton LLP or, if Grant Thornton LLP is unavailable or is unwilling
to serve,

 



2  another firm (other than a Big Four accounting firm) mutually agreed upon by
the parties (the " _Valuation Firm_ "); _provided_ that if Purchaser and the
Seller are unable to agree upon such firm within ten (10) days after the end
of the Negotiation Period, then the Valuation Firm shall be an accounting or
valuation firm of national standing (other than a Big Four accounting firm)
appointed by the American Arbitration Association in New York, New York
(provided that such firm shall not be the independent auditor of (or otherwise
provide services under a contractual arrangement with) either Purchaser (or
any of its Affiliates) or the Seller (or any of its Affiliates (excluding
private equity fund portfolio companies)). Any further submissions to the
Valuation Firm must be written and delivered to each party to the dispute. The
Valuation Firm shall consider only those disputes submitted to it
for resolution. In resolving each such dispute, the Valuation Firm (i) shall
make its determination based solely on the presentations and supporting
material provided by Purchaser and Seller and not pursuant to any independent
review and (ii) may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest
value for such item claimed by either Purchaser or Seller or less than the
smallest value for such item claimed by either Purchaser or Seller. The
Valuation Firm shall make a final determination of Cash, Indebtedness, Net
Working Capital and Transaction Expenses, and the resulting Final Cash
Consideration calculated with reference to such amounts to the extent such
amounts are in dispute. The parties will cooperate with the Valuation Firm
during the term of its engagement. The determination of Cash, Indebtedness,
Net Working Capital and Transaction Expenses, and the resulting Final Cash
Consideration calculated with reference thereto, shall become final and
binding on the parties on the date the Valuation Firm delivers its final
resolution in writing to the parties (which final resolution the Valuation
Firm shall deliver to Purchaser and Seller as promptly as practicable and in
any event shall endeavor to do so within thirty (30) days after its
appointment). The Purchaser and the Seller will retain the Valuation Firm and
each pay 50% of any retainer. During the engagement, the Valuation Firm will
bill 50% of the total charges to the Purchaser and 50% of the total charges
to the Seller. The Valuation Firm shall allocate the final fees and expenses
of such firms work based upon the percentage of the contested amount not
awarded to each party ( _i.e._ , if the Seller submits an Objections
Statement for $1,000, the Purchaser contests only $500 of the amount claimed
by the Seller, and the Valuation Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by
awarding the Seller $300 of the contested amount, then the costs and expenses
of the Valuation Firm will be allocated 60% to the Purchaser and 40% to the
Seller).

1.05  _Post-Closing Adjustment Payment_. If the Final Cash Consideration is
greater than the Closing Cash Consideration, the Purchaser shall promptly (but
in any event within two (2) Business Days) pay to the Seller the amount of
such excess, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated in writing by the Seller to the Purchaser. If the Final
Cash Consideration is less than the Closing Cash Consideration, the Seller
shall promptly (but in any event within two (2) Business Days) pay to the
Purchaser the absolute value of such shortfall by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to one or more accounts designated in writing by the Purchaser
to the Seller. If the Final Cash Consideration is less than the Closing Cash
Consideration and the Seller does not pay the amount due pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence when due, Purchaser may, at its option, cause
funds to be released from the Escrow Account in an amount equal to such
amount, whereupon Seller shall promptly fund the Escrow Amount with the amount
so released.

account(s) designated by the holders of such Indebtedness (provided that all
such amounts repaid by Purchaser shall be included in Indebtedness for
purposes of _Article I_ );

(d) the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser stock certificates representing
all of the Shares, free and clear of all Liens, which certificates shall be
duly endorsed to Purchaser or accompanied by transfer powers duly executed in
blank;

 



4 (e) unless Purchaser requests in writing otherwise, a resignation from each
director and officer of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, effective
as of the Closing, resigning from his or her position(s) as a director and/or
officer of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries;

 

(f) the Purchaser, the Company and the Seller shall make such other deliveries

(g) simultaneously with the Closing, the Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be

2.03 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the
contrary, Purchaser, the Company and the Escrow Agent shall be permitted and
entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount otherwise payable to any
Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted
and withheld under applicable Tax Law. Any amounts so deducted and withheld
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
such Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware, and the Company has all requisite power and authority and
all authorizations, licenses and permits necessary to own and operate its

standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with full power and
authority to enter into this Agreement and perform its obligations hereunder.
The Company is qualified to do business and is in good standing in every

Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Seller is qualified to do business and is
in good standing in every jurisdiction in which its ownership of property or
the conduct of business as now conducted requires it to qualify, except where
the failure to be so qualified and in good standing would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to materially hinder, impair or
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
to have a material adverse effect on the ability of Seller to perform its
obligations under this Agreement in a timely manner. True and complete copies
of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (each as amended to date) of

Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. True and complete copies of
the organizational documents of each of the Companys Subsidiaries have been
made available to the Purchaser. The organizational documents of each of the

validly authorized by all requisite corporate or other action, and no other
corporate or other proceedings or actions on the part of the Company or the

Seller, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, except solely with
respect to clauses (ii) and (iii) of this sentence for violations, breaches,
rights, defaults or Liens which would not, individually or in the aggregate,

the Purchaser, this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of

audited consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014, and the related
audited statements of income and cash flows for the twelve-month period ended
December 31, 2014 (collectively, the " _Financial Statements_ "). The
Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistently
applied, and present fairly in all material respects the financial condition
and results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a
whole) as of the times and for the periods referred to therein except, with
respect to the unaudited financial statements, for the lack of footnotes and
changes resulting from normal year-end adjustments that will not be material
to the Company. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
any material liability or obligation, whether or not required by GAAP to be
reflected or reserved against in a consolidated balance sheet prepared as of
such date, other than any liability or obligation (v) not required to be
disclosed in Article IV of the Disclosure Schedules because of a dollar,
knowledge or materiality qualifier in the representations and warranties in
this Article IV, (w) included or disclosed in the audited Financial Statements
or the footnotes thereto, (x) incurred in the ordinary course of business

infringement or violation of Law), (y) to perform in the future under any
Contract, except to the extent arising from a breach thereof prior to the
Closing, or (z) incurred in connection with the performance of this Agreement
or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. The Companys and

reporting is sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP, consistently applied. Since January 1, 2013, to the
knowledge of the Company, no officer, director, or employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries has refused to execute any certification of any nature

4.10  _Intellectual Property_.

(a) _Schedule 4.10(a)_ contains a true and correct list of registered
Intellectual Property owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any
pending applications therefor (collectively, " _Company Intellectual Property_
"), separated into subcategories corresponding to the clauses in the
definition of "Intellectual Property". The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries owns all of the Company Intellectual Property indicated as being
owned by such entity, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens,
and, where applicable, applications are in good standing with, and all
applicable fees have been paid to, the Governmental Entity with which they are
registered or pending. Except (i) as set forth on _Schedule 4.10(a)_ or (ii)
in the case of clauses (A) and (B) below, for any nonconformance therewith
which is not material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole:
(A) during the twelve (12) month period prior to the date of this Agreement,
neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries has received any written notices of
infringement, violation, dilution or misappropriation from any other Person
with respect to any Intellectual Property owned by such Person; (B) to the
Companys knowledge, the Companys businesses as currently conducted do not
infringe, violate, dilute or misappropriate the Intellectual Property of any
other Person; and (C) to the Companys knowledge, there is no infringement,
misappropriation, violation, dilution or such other conflict by any other
Person involving the Company Intellectual Property. To the Companys
knowledge, all of the Company Intellectual Property is valid and enforceable.

 

(b) The Company takes reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of
its trade secrets and confidential and proprietary information. The Company
and each of its Subsidiaries have executed valid written confidentiality and
invention assignment contracts with all of its past and present employees,
contractors and consultants engaged or retained by the Company or its
Subsidiaries since January 1, 2013, and involved in the development or
creation of material Intellectual Property, pursuant to which they have
assigned to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries all their rights in and to
all Intellectual Property they develop and agreed to hold all trade

 



16  secrets and confidential and proprietary information of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in confidence both during and after their engagement. The Company
or one of its Subsidiaries owns all right, title and interest in and to all
material Intellectual Property developed or created since January 1, 2013 by
any employee, contractor or consultant engaged or retained by the Company.

 

(c) With respect to any Intellectual Property not constituting Company
Intellectual Property but reasonably necessary for the operation of
the Companys and any of its Subsidiaries business as currently conducted,
the Company has a valid and enforceable license to use such Intellectual
Property pursuant to a written license agreement set forth on _Schedule
4.10(c)_ (other than commercially available, off-the-shelf, click-wrap,
shrink-wrap or similar licenses). The Company Intellectual Property, together
with the Intellectual Property licensed pursuant to a written license
agreement set forth on _Schedule 4.10(c)_ (each, an " _IP License Agreement_

been notified in writing of any claims for (and, to the knowledge of the
Company, there are no threatened claims for) any product returns, warranty
obligations or product services relating to any of the Companys products or
services. There are no conditions that would reasonably be expected to form
the basis for an enforcement action by the FDA or other Governmental Entity

Debt Fee Letter have not been amended or modified, except as permitted
pursuant to _Section 10.03_. As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt
Commitment Letter, in the form so delivered, is in full force and effect and
is the legal, valid and binding obligation of Mallinckrodt International
Finance S.A. (" _MIFSA_ "), an Affiliate of Purchaser, and, to the knowledge
of Purchaser, the other parties thereto, in each case except as may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws
relating to creditors rights generally or by general principles of equity.
Purchaser or Purchasers ultimate parent has caused MIFSA to fully pay (or
cause to be paid) any and all commitment fees or other fees that are required
to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter and the Debt
Fee Letter on or prior to the date of this Agreement. The net proceeds of the
Bridge Financing, if funded in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter,
together with cash and cash equivalents available to Purchaser and its
Affiliates, including under its committed credit facilities, shall, in the
aggregate, be sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement upon the terms contemplated by this Agreement. As of the date of
this Agreement, Purchaser has no reason to believe that MIFSA will be unable
to satisfy any term or condition to be satisfied by it as a condition to the
availability of the Bridge Financing contained in the Debt Commitment Letter.
As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a
default or breach or failure to satisfy a condition on the part of MIFSA (or
to MIFSAs knowledge, any other party thereto) under the Debt Commitment
Letter. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that its obligations hereunder are
not subject to the receipt or availability of any funds or financing
by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

contemplated by this Agreement expeditiously and lawfully. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, if a suit or other action is threatened
or instituted by any Governmental Entity or any other entity challenging the

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Purchaser, the Company and
the Seller shall use their reasonable best efforts to avoid, resist, resolve

and in obtaining any Governmental Entity or third party consents, waivers,
authorizations or approvals which may be required to be obtained by the
Purchaser, the Seller, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (which assistance and
cooperation shall include timely furnishing to each other all information
concerning the Purchaser, the Company or the Seller, as the case may be,

regulations applicable to the Purchaser. The parties shall cause the filings
under the HSR Act to be considered for grant of "early termination."

parties hereby agree that nothing in this Agreement shall require, or be
construed to require, the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to (and the

consent) propose, negotiate, offer, make or consent to any dispositions,
licenses, divestitures, or holding separate of any assets, rights, product
lines, or supply agreements in order to obtain any required approval from any

individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, (ii) Parent and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, but deemed for this
purpose to be the same size as the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or (iii) the Company, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, but deemed for this purpose to be the same size as the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the parties hereby agree that nothing in this
Agreement shall require, or be construed to require, the Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates to (and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not, without
Purchasers prior written consent) incur any liability or obligation in order
to obtain the approval contemplated by _Section 3.01(e)(ii)_ to the extent
any such liability or obligation, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to be material relative to the Companys
business or operations in the jurisdiction in which such approval is sought.

 



31 (c) The Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company and the Seller on the
other shall keep each other reasonably informed of the status of their
respective efforts to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,

participate thereat, (iv) furnishing the other with copies of all
correspondence, filings and communications between it and any such
Governmental Entities with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and (v) furnishing the other with such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as each of them may reasonably request

information to any such Governmental Entities; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
to the extent permitted under applicable Laws, documents provided pursuant to
this  _Section 6.03_ may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the
valuation of the Company, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements, and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable privilege
concerns. 

(d) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, Purchaser and its Affiliates
shall not enter into agreements providing for the acquisition of (or acquire)
an equity interest in or the assets of, or the merger with, any Person that

Companys products, services or lines of business, if such action would be
reasonably likely to prevent or materially delay the Closing pursuant to any
Antitrust Laws.

6.04 _Conditions_. The Company and the Seller shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to cause the conditions set forth in _Section 3.01_
to be satisfied as soon as practicable following the date hereof, to cause the

through the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.01_, the Seller shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates

purchase of the Shares or any merger, sale of substantially all of the assets
of the Company and its Subsidiaries or similar transactions involving the
Company.

 



32 6.06 _Confidentiality_. For a period of five (5) years following the Closing

shall cause its Affiliates to, keep confidential all confidential and
proprietary information of the Company, its Subsidiaries and the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, " _Confidential Information_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) the foregoing obligation shall not apply
to any Confidential Information that (i) is or becomes generally available to
the public (other than as a result of a breach of this _Section 6.06_), or
(ii) is or becomes available to Seller or its Affiliates on a non-
confidential basis from a source other than Seller or the Company or any of
their respective Affiliates, so long as such source is not known by such
Person (after reasonable inquiry) to be subject to another confidentiality
obligation to the Company or its Affiliates, (y) nothing herein shall
restrict Seller or any its Affiliates from disclosing (A) financial return or
other financial performance or statistical information (e.g., levels of debt,
debt paydown or cash flows) in connection with its normal fundraising,
marketing, informational or reporting activities to current and potential
equityholders or investors, provided that any recipient thereof is subject to
a confidentiality obligation with respect thereto and/or (B) Confidential
Information in connection with any dispute with Purchaser, the Company or any
of their Subsidiaries related to this Agreement and (z) Seller and its
Affiliates may disclose Confidential Information to the extent required by
applicable Law or legal or administrative process, provided that Seller shall
promptly notify Purchaser (to the extent legally permissible) in advance of
such disclosure so that Purchaser may seek, at Purchasers sole expense (and
Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Purchaser
in seeking) a protective order or other appropriate remedy in lieu of or with
respect to such disclosure and/or waive compliance with this _Section 6.06_,
and to the extent legally permissible, Seller will attempt to obtain reliable
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to the information
ultimately furnished.

 

6.07 _Section 280G_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall seek
approval by the stockholders, in accordance with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the
Code, of the right of any "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of
Section 280G(c) of the Code and the regulations thereunder) to receive or
retain any payments that would, in the absence of such stockholder approval,
constitute "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of
the Code. Prior to seeking such approval, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from each disqualified individual
waivers that provide that no payments and/or benefits that would separately or
in the aggregate constitute "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of
Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code (" _Parachute Payments_ ") with respect to
such disqualified individual shall, in the absence of such stockholder
approval referred to in the immediately preceding sentence, be payable to or
retained by such disqualified individual to the extent such Parachute
Payments would not be deductible by reason of the application of Section 280G
of the Code or would result in the imposition of the excise tax under Section
4999 of the Code on such disqualified individual. All materials produced by
the Company in connection with the implementation of this _Section 6.07_
shall be provided to the Purchaser at least three (3) Business Days in advance
for the Purchasers review and comment, and the Company shall consider any of
the Purchasers requested changes or comments in good faith and not
unreasonably omit them. At least three (3) Business Days prior to seeking the
stockholder approval described in this _Section 6.07_, with respect to
each "disqualified individual" of the Company, the Company shall furnish (a)
a schedule that sets forth (i) the Companys reasonable, good faith estimate
of all payments or benefits that could be provided to such
disqualified individual as a result of any of

 



33  the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in combination
with any other event) (other than any such amounts to be provided pursuant to
arrangements entered into with the Purchaser), and (ii) the "base amount" (as
defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) for each such individual, and (b)
the underlying data and documentation on which such schedule is based. The
Purchaser acknowledges that the Company cannot compel any disqualified
individual to waive any existing rights under any contract or agreement that
such disqualified individual has with the Company, and, provided that the
Company has sought waivers from such disqualified individuals pursuant to
this _Section 6.07_, the Company shall not be deemed in breach of this
_Section 6.07_ if any such disqualified individual refuses to waive any such
right and the Company shall not be required to pay any amount to any such
individual in connection with seeking such waivers.

6.08 _Retention of Funds_.

 

(a) Following Closing, until the expiration of Sellers obligation to
indemnify Purchaser with respect to the Specified Matters, Seller shall
retain $50,000,000 of the proceeds received at the Closing; provided, however,
that Seller may provide for a portion of such $50,000,000 to be represented by
capital commitments of Sellers members in the form set forth in _Exhibit D_
(each, a " _Capital Commitment_ ") (copies of which shall be provided to
Purchaser upon execution), in which case the amount of proceeds that Seller is
required to retain pursuant to this sentence shall be reduced by the amount
of such Capital Commitments (but Seller shall not be released from any of its
indemnification obligations); _provided_ that any party executing any such
Capital Commitment shall have sufficient resources to satisfy the full amount
of such Capital Commitment (the determination thereof being reasonably agreed
to by the Purchaser). The amount of any such Capital Commitment shall be equal
to the Specified Matters Distribution Amount set forth therein. It is
acknowledged and agreed that Seller shall make separate distributions out of
the $50,000,000 referred to in this _Section 6.08(a)_ in connection with the
execution of Capital Commitments, and out of and the remaining proceeds in
connection with the execution of Assumption Agreements pursuant to _Section
6.08(b)_, respectively, such that any Specified Matters Distribution Amount in
a Capital Commitment entered into by a member of Seller shall not include any
amount constituting all or any portion of a Distribution Amount in an
Assumption Agreement entered into by such member, and vice versa.

(b) Seller shall not distribute any funds to any of its members unless such
member receiving a distribution enters into an agreement in the form set forth
in _Exhibit E_ (an " _Assumption Agreement_ ") (copies of which shall be
provided to Purchaser upon execution) obligating such member to pay its Pro
Rata Share of any indemnification obligations in respect of Fundamental
Rep/Covenant Claims, in which case Sellers aggregate maximum liability for
indemnification in respect of Fundamental Rep/Covenant Claims shall be
reduced by the Distribution Amount set forth in such Assumption Agreement, and
Purchasers recourse for indemnification in respect of such Pro Rata Share of
indemnification in respect of any Fundamental Rep/Covenant Claim shall
thereafter be to the counterparty of such Assumption Agreement until such
counterpartys aggregate liability thereunder is equal to such Distribution
Amount (but Seller shall not otherwise be released from any of its
indemnification obligations).

 

(c) Until the Final Cash Consideration has been finally determined in
accordance with _Section 1.04_ and any amounts required to be paid pursuant
to _Section 1.05_ have been paid, Seller shall retain sufficient funds from
the proceeds received at Closing in order to satisfy any payment obligation it
may have pursuant to _Section 1.05_.

 



34 6.09 _Termination of Affiliate Arrangements_. Except as otherwise agreed in
writing by the Seller and the Purchaser, the Seller shall procure the
termination of all Affiliate Arrangements effective as of no later than the
Closing, without any liability (contingent or otherwise) to the Company or any
of its Affiliates, and shall deliver to the Purchaser documentation
reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser to the foregoing effect.

of seven (7) years, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company to,
provide the Seller and its authorized Representatives with reasonable access,
during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, for the purposes of
complying with applicable Tax Laws and for defending any third-party claims
against Seller in each case to the extent related to transactions involving
the Company occurring prior to the Closing or to the extent arising out of or
related to the ownership of the Company by Seller (in each case other than
with respect to litigation or other disputes between the parties), to (i) the
books and records (for the purpose of examining and copying) of the Company
and its Subsidiaries with respect to periods or occurrences prior to the
Closing and (ii) employees of the Purchaser, the Company and their Affiliates
for purposes of better understanding such books and records; _provided_ that
Seller and its authorized Representatives shall conduct any such activities in
such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or
operations of the Company; _provided_ , _further_ , that Purchaser and the
Company shall not be obligated to provide such access or information if the
Company determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing so would violate
applicable Law or a Contract or obligation of confidentiality owing to a third
party, or jeopardize the protection of the attorney-client privilege
(provided, in the case of obligations of confidentiality owing to a third
party, that the Company shall request a waiver of any such obligation of
confidentiality or permit Seller to request such a waiver and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide such access or information in an
alternative manner that does not have the foregoing effects). Unless
otherwise consented to in writing by the Seller, the Purchaser shall not, and
shall not permit the Company or its Subsidiaries to, for a period of seven (7)
years following the Closing Date, destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any
of the books and records of the Company or its Subsidiaries for any period
prior to the Closing Date without first giving reasonable prior notice to the
Seller and offering to surrender to the Seller such books and records or any
portion thereof which the Purchaser or the Company may intend to destroy,
alter or dispose of.

7.02  _Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification_.

not, and shall not permit the Company or its Subsidiaries to amend, repeal or
otherwise modify any provision in the Companys or its Subsidiaries
certificate of formation, certification of incorporation, operating agreement,
bylaws, or equivalent governing documents relating to the exculpation or
indemnification (including fee advancement) of any officers and/or directors
(unless required

 



35  by Law), it being the intent of the parties that the officers and directors
of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall continue to be entitled to such
exculpation and indemnification (including fee advancement) to the full
extent of the Law. Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to, honor and perform under all indemnification obligations owed
to any of the individuals who were officers and/or directors of the Company
or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Closing Date and which were provided to
the Purchaser and are listed on _Schedule 7.02(a)_.

 

(b) Prior to or at the Closing, Purchaser shall purchase (or cause to be
purchased) a prepaid insurance policy ( _i.e._ , "tail coverage") which
policy provides liability insurance coverage for the individuals who were
officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries at or prior to the
Closing Date on no less favorable terms (including in amount and scope)
as the policy or policies maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Closing for the benefit of such individuals for an
aggregate period of not less than six (6) years with respect to claims arising
from acts, events or omissions that occurred at or prior to the Closing,
including with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall not be required to pay an
aggregate annual premium for such insurance policy in excess of 300% of the
annual premium paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year
for such insurance. Such policy shall be from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as the Companys or its Subsidiaries current
insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance.

(c) If the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) is to consolidate with or merges into any other Person and will
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of their properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.02_. The
provisions of this _Section 7.02_ are intended for the benefit of, and will
be enforceable by, each current and former officer, director or similar
functionary of the Company or its Subsidiaries and his or her heirs and
representatives. The rights granted pursuant to this _Section 7.02_ are in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such person may have had by contract or otherwise.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the
Closing Date) is made against any individuals who were officers and directors
of the Company and its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Closing Date or any
other party covered by directors and officers liability insurance, on or
prior to the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date, the provisions of this
_Section 7.02_ shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

7.03 _Employment and Benefit Arrangements_.

 

(a) For at least twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, the Purchaser
shall cause the Company to provide each continuing employee of the Company
and its Subsidiaries with (i) a base salary or base wage rate, as applicable,
that is equivalent to the base salary or base wage rate, as applicable,
provided to such employee prior to the Closing, and (ii) all
other compensation and employee benefits (other than any equity-based
compensation) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the other
compensation and employee benefits (excluding equity-based compensation)
provided to similarly situated employees of Purchaser.

 



36 (b) Employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries participating in The Gores
Group, LLC 401(k) Plan (the " _Seller 401(k) Plan_ ") and any Gores Group,
LLC welfare plans (the " _Seller Welfare Plans_ ") shall cease active
participation in the Seller 401(k) Plan and Seller Welfare Plans effective as
of the Closing Date. Without limiting the generality of the other provisions
of this _Section 7.03_, the Purchaser shall cause such employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries to become immediately eligible to participate in
a 401(k) plan and welfare plans sponsored or maintained by the Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates. For a period of six (6) months following the Closing
Date, at the election of such employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
Purchaser shall cause its 401(k) plan (or a 401(k) plan maintained by any of
its Affiliates) to accept any "eligible rollover distributions" (as defined
under Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) made from the Seller 401(k) Plan to such
employees. Prior to the Closing, the Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) to, provide all
cooperation reasonably requested by the Purchaser to effectuate the
Purchasers obligations under this _Section 7.03(b)_;  _provided_ that such
cooperation shall not require the Seller to make any payments or otherwise
expend funds.

(c) The Purchaser shall take all actions necessary so that employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall receive service credit for all purposes
(other than for purposes of benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension
plan) under any compensation or benefit plans, programs, arrangements,
agreements and policies sponsored by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in
which such employees are eligible to participate, except to the extent
duplication of benefits would result. To the extent that the Purchaser
modifies any welfare benefit coverage or plan under which the employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries participate, the Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to waive any applicable waiting periods, pre-
existing conditions or actively-at-work requirements and shall give such
employees credit under the new coverages or benefit plans for deductibles, co-
insurance and out-of-pocket payments that have been paid during the year in
which such welfare benefit coverage or plan modification occurs.

(d) Nothing in this _Section 7.03_ shall be construed to (i) establish,
amend, or modify any Employee Benefit Plan or any other benefit or
compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement of the Purchaser, the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates, (ii) alter or limit
Purchasers, the Companys or any of their Affiliates ability to amend,
modify or terminate any such Employee Benefit Plan or other benefit or
compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement in accordance with their
terms, (iii) give any third party, including any employees of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof, any right
to enforce the provisions of this _Section 7.03_ as a third-party
beneficiary, including with respect to a right to employment or continued
employment for any period of time by reason of this Agreement.

7.04 _Conditions_. The Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the conditions set forth in _Section 3.02_ to be satisfied as soon as
practicable following the date hereof, to cause the Closing to occur as
expeditiously as possible following the execution of this Agreement and
to consummate the transactions contemplated herein as soon as possible after
the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Article III_ (other than
those to be satisfied at the Closing

 



37  itself); _provided_ , that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Purchaser shall only be required to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the approval contemplated by _Section 3.01(e)(ii)_.

7.05 _Contact with Customers, Employees and Suppliers_. Prior to the Closing,
the Purchaser and the Purchasers Representatives (acting on Purchasers
behalf) may only contact and communicate with the employees, customers,
service providers and suppliers of the Company and its Subsidiaries in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby after prior consultation
with and written approval of the Seller (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ that the foregoing shall not
limit Purchasers and the Purchasers Representatives from undertaking the
foregoing activities in the ordinary course of business with the customers,
service providers and suppliers of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

ARTICLE VIII

 

 _INDEMNIFICATION_

8.01  _Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements_.
The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement or
in any Exhibit, Schedule or certificate or other instrument delivered
hereunder shall survive the Closing and shall terminate on the date that is
twelve (12) months after the Closing Date; _provided_ that the Fundamental
Representations shall survive the Closing and shall terminate on the third
anniversary of the Closing Date;  _provided_ , _further_ , that the covenants
and agreements to the extent required to be performed following the Closing
shall survive until sixty (60) days following the last date on which such
covenant or agreement was required to be performed. Sellers indemnification
obligation in respect of Specified Matters shall survive the Closing and shall
terminate on the tenth anniversary of the Closing Date. The date to which any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, or any indemnification
obligation in respect of Specified Matters, is to survive pursuant to the
preceding two sentences is referred to herein as the " _Survival Period
Termination Date_ ". Notwithstanding the foregoing, if on or prior to the
applicable Survival Period Termination Date, a Valid Claim Notice has been
delivered, the claim alleged in the Valid Claim Notice shall survive until
such claim for indemnification is resolved. No claim for
indemnification hereunder for breach of any such representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements, or in respect of Specified Matters, may be made after
the expiration of the applicable survival period.

 

8.02 _Indemnification for the Benefit of the Purchaser_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing (but subject to the provisions of this _Article
VIII_ and the Escrow Agreement), Seller shall indemnify the Purchaser and its
Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents (each, a " _Purchaser
Indemnified Person_ ") and hold them harmless against any loss, liability,
obligation, Taxes, claim, damage or expense (" _Losses_ "; _provided_ that,
for the avoidance of doubt, the reduction of, or the unavailability of, any
net operating loss or other Tax asset shall not constitute a Loss) suffered or
incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Persons to the extent relating to or
arising from (i) any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty
made by the Seller or the Company herein or in any Exhibit, Schedule or
certificate 

 



38  delivered hereunder (disregarding, except in the case of _Section 4.05_ (
_Financial Statements_ ), clause (y) of the first sentence of _Section 4.06_
( _Absence of Certain Developments_ ), clause (e) of the second sentence of
_Section 4.06_, _Section 4.09(a)(iii)_, and _Section 4.15_ ( _Healthcare
Laws and Regulations_ ), all references to "material", "Material Adverse
Effect" and similar qualifications as to materiality set forth therein) as of
the date hereof or as of the Closing Date as though then made (or, in the case
of those representations and warranties that address matters as of particular
dates, as of such dates), subject to the last sentence of _Section 8.02(c)_
hereof or (ii) a breach of or a failure by Seller or the Company to perform
any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the case of claims arising from a breach of a representation or
warranty (other than a Fundamental Representation or any representation or
warranty in respect of Taxes), no such claims by the Purchaser shall be
so asserted unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses that would
otherwise be payable hereunder from the Escrow Account exceeds on a cumulative
basis an amount equal to $13,250,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), and then only to
the extent such Losses exceed the Deductible. In no event shall any party be
entitled to recover or make a claim for, and in no event shall Losses include,
any amounts in respect of consequential, special, incidental, punitive or
indirect damages, loss of goodwill or possible business or lost profits,
except in each case to the extent awarded to a third party.

(b) The aggregate maximum liability for indemnification under Section 8.02(a)
in respect of inaccuracies in or breaches of representations and warranties
(other than Fundamental Representations) shall not exceed $19,875,000 and any
such claims shall be satisfied solely and exclusively from the Escrow Account
in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The aggregate maximum
liability for indemnification under _Section 8.02(a)_ in respect of
inaccuracies in or breaches of Fundamental Representations or breaches of or
failures by Seller or the Company to perform any covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement (any such inaccuracy, breach or failure to
perform, a " _Fundamental Rep/Covenant Claim_ ") shall not exceed the Final
Cash Consideration, less the aggregate of the Distribution Amounts set forth
in any Assumption Agreements entered into pursuant to _Section 6.08(b)_.

 

(c) From and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify each Purchaser
Indemnified Person and hold them harmless against all out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including any and all fines, penalties, Judgments (as defined in the
Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of October 5, 2012, by and among Ortho-
Clinical Diagnostics, Inc., TGG Medical Solutions, Inc. and Gores
Capital Partners III, L.P. (as amended, the " _Asset Purchase Agreement_ "),
awards, relators(s) attorneys fees, costs, and settlements) imposed by any
Judgment or settlement resulting from, and any out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred in defending, the Specified Matters; _provided_ that
the aggregate maximum liability for indemnification under this _Section
8.02(c)_ shall not exceed $50,000,000, less any amounts received by Purchaser
under any Capital Commitment entered into pursuant to _Section 6.08(a)_;
_provided_ , _further_ , that no indemnification shall be provided under this
_Section 8.02(c)_ for any costs or expenses arising from compliance of
the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) with any CIA (as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement)
entered into in connection with a settlement of, or Judgment arising from, the
Specified Matters. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the indemnification provided pursuant to this _Section 8.02(c)_
shall be the sole source of indemnification under this Agreement for any of
the matters described in this  _Section 8.02(c)_.

 



39 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Purchaser
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover any Losses for any claim under
clause (i) of the first sentence of _Section 8.02(a)_ unless and until the
amount of Losses that otherwise would be payable pursuant to clause (i) of the
first sentence of _Section 8.02(a)_ with respect to such claim exceeds
$250,000 (the " _Per Claim Threshold_ "), and then Purchaser shall be entitled
to recover from the first dollar of such claim, it being understood that
claims that arise out of substantially related facts or circumstances shall
be aggregated for purposes of this sentence and that any Losses for amounts
less than the Per Claim Threshold shall be ignored in determining whether the
Deductible has been exceeded. From and after the Closing, indemnification
pursuant to this _Section 8.02_ and the Escrow Agreement constitutes the
parties sole and exclusive monetary remedies for any and all Losses or other
claims relating to or arising from this Agreement or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (including in any Exhibit, Schedule or
certificate delivered hereunder), it being understood that any and all other
monetary remedies with respect thereto are expressly waived and released by
the parties on behalf of themselves and each of their respective Affiliates,
officers, directors, employees and agents, in each case to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law. The Purchaser and the Seller each agrees that
other than indemnification of the Purchaser Indemnified Persons and the
Seller Indemnified Persons, respectively, if and as required by the terms of
this Agreement, under no circumstances will the Seller or any of its
Affiliates, or their respective officers, directors, partners, members,
employees, agents, representatives, successors and permitted assigns
(collectively, the " _Seller Parties_ ") have any liability to the Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates, or their respective officers, directors, partners,
members, employees, agents, representatives, successors and permitted assigns
(collectively, the " _Purchaser Parties_ "), or will any Purchaser Party have
any liability to any Seller Party, in each case relating to or arising from
this Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
including in any Exhibit, Schedule or certificate delivered hereunder or the
conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the
Closing. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing
in this Agreement shall limit any rights and remedies under _Article I_, with
respect to the right to an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief (including pursuant to _Section 12.17_) or with respect to
claims or remedies for fraud.

(e) None of the Purchaser Parties or the Seller Parties may avoid the
limitations on liability set forth in this _Article VIII_ by seeking damages
for breach of contract, tort or pursuant to any other theory of liability and,
except as contemplated by this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, each of the
Purchaser, for itself and the other Purchaser Parties, and the Seller, for
itself and the other Seller Parties, hereby waives, from and after the
Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all
other rights, claims and causes of action it may have against the Seller
Parties and the Purchaser Parties, respectively, relating (directly or
indirectly) to the subject matter of this Agreement or the conduct of
the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing arising
under or based upon any Law or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Purchaser shall have no right to
indemnification hereunder for the amount of any Loss or alleged Loss to the
extent such amount of such Loss or alleged Loss is included in the calculation
of Transaction Expenses paid at Closing or the calculation of Cash,
Indebtedness or Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to
_Section 1.04_.

 



40 (f) All payments made from the Escrow Account shall be treated by the parties
as an adjustment to the proceeds received by the Seller and paid by the
Purchaser pursuant to _Article II_ hereof.

(g) (i) Except for the Purchaser pursuant to _Section 2.02(b)_ or by Seller
pursuant to the last sentence of _Section 1.05_, no Person (including any
Seller Party) shall have any obligation to fund the Escrow Account and (ii)
title and all rights to all funds in the Escrow Account shall automatically
transfer to the Seller on the Survival Period Termination Date in accordance
with the terms of the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ that if prior to such date
a Valid Claim Notice has been delivered, an amount sufficient to satisfy any
pending claims set forth in such notice shall be retained in the Escrow
Account until such claims are finally resolved and then distributed in
accordance with such resolution; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that if a
Purchaser Indemnified Person is entitled to an indemnification payment in
respect of a Fundamental Rep/Covenant Claim or pursuant to _Section 8.02(c)_
and such amount is not paid to the Purchaser within ten (10) Business Days,
Seller shall, at Purchasers election, execute joint escrow instructions with
Purchaser causing funds to be released to Purchaser from the Escrow Account in
the amount of such payment, whereupon, provided that the obligation under
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement to maintain any amount in escrow has
not terminated at the time of such release, each Person that was obligated to
make such indemnification payment (i.e., Seller and/or the
applicable counterparty to an Assumption Agreement) shall promptly fund the
Escrow Account with an amount equal to the indemnification payment that such
Person was obligated to make.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any claim for
Losses made by the Purchaser against the Escrow Account pursuant to _Section
8.02(a)_ prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date
that results in funds being retained in the Escrow Account beyond such date
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement shall be deemed to have been withdrawn
unless such claim is asserted by a Purchaser Indemnified Person against the
applicable indemnifying party(ies) in a formal action, suit or proceeding
before a Governmental Authority (whether directly, by counterclaim, defense to
a declaratory action or otherwise) within twelve (12) months of the
notification of Seller of such Losses pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
(or, in the case of a notification in respect of a Third Party Claim not by or
before a Governmental Authority, eighteen (18) months); _provided_ , that
this _Section 8.02(h)_ shall not apply to any Third Party Claim by or before
any Governmental Authority or any Tax Claim.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, none of the
Purchaser or the other Purchaser Parties shall have any right
to indemnification under this Agreement from and against any Losses of any
Person with respect to the matters identified in _Section 2.02(d)(ix)_ (
_Specified Proceeding Liabilities_ ) of the Asset Purchase Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not limit the indemnification
obligations hereunder in respect of Specified Matters.

8.03 _Indemnification by the Purchaser for the Benefit of the Seller_. From
and after the Closing (but subject to the provisions of this _Article VIII_ ),
the Purchaser shall indemnify the Seller and its Affiliates, officers,
directors, employees and agents (each, a " _Seller Indemnified Person_ ") and
hold them harmless against any Losses suffered or incurred by the Seller

 



41  Indemnified Persons to the extent arising from: (a) any breach of any
representation or warranty of the Purchaser under this Agreement and (b) any
nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant or agreement by the Purchaser in
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of claims arising
from a breach of a representation or warranty, no such claims by the Seller
shall be so asserted unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses that
would otherwise be payable hereunder exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount
equal to the Deductible, and then only to the extent such Losses exceed the
Deductible. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
aggregate maximum liability for indemnification under this _Section 8.03_
shall not exceed the Final Cash Consideration.

 

8.04 _Procedures for Claims_.

 

(a) _Third Party Claims._ Any Person making a claim for indemnification under
_Section 8.02_ or _8.03_ is referred to herein as an " _Indemnitee_ " and
any indemnifying Person under _Section 8.02_ or _8.03_ is referred to herein
as an " _Indemnitor_ " (it being understood that Seller shall be deemed to be
the Indemnitor in respect of indemnification for purposes of this _Section
8.04_ even if a counterparty to an Assumption Agreement entered into pursuant
to _Section 6.08(b)_ may have an indemnification obligation in respect of
the applicable claim). The Indemnitee shall notify the Indemnitor in writing
promptly after receiving written notice of any action, lawsuit, proceeding,
investigation or other claim against it by a third party (each, a " _Third
Party Claim_ ") in respect of which indemnification may be sought under
_Section 8.02_ or _8.03_ , describing, to the extent practicable, the claim,
the amount thereof (if known and quantifiable) and the basis thereof. The
failure by an Indemnitee to promptly deliver such written notice to the
Indemnitor shall not affect the Indemnitees right to receive indemnification
hereunder with respect to such Third Party Claim, except to the extent the
Indemnitor is prejudiced by such failure. Any Indemnitor shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of such action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation
or other claim giving rise to an Indemnitees claim for indemnification at
such Indemnitors expense, and such Indemnitor, at its option, shall be
entitled to assume the defense thereof; _provided_ that (i) any Indemnitor
shall continue to be entitled to assert any limitation on any claims contained
herein and (ii) the Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate (but not
control or make decisions related thereto) in the defense of such claim and to
employ counsel of its choice for such purpose at the Indemnitees expense.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that (A) the Indemnitor shall
elect not to undertake such defense, (B) after the date that is thirty (30)
days following the provision of a claim notice in accordance with this
_Section 8.04(a)_, the Indemnitor shall have failed to notify the Indemnitee
that it has elected to undertake the defense of such Third Party Claim, (C)
after undertaking such defense, the Indemnitor fails to defend diligently such
Third Party Claim within ten (10) Business Days after receiving notice of
such failure from the Indemnitee or (D) other than with respect to any
Specified Matter, the Third Party Claim (1) seeks non-monetary relief (except
where non-monetary relief is merely incidental to a primary claim or claims
for monetary damages), (2) involves criminal allegations, (3) is one in which
the Indemnitor has conflicting or adverse interests or is also a party and
joint representation would, in the reasonable opinion of the Indemnitee,
be inappropriate, or (4) except with respect to Specified Matters, is one
which the Indemnitee reasonably believes that it will, after giving effect to
the indemnification limitations set forth in this _Article VIII_, bear in
excess of 50% of the Losses with respect to such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnitee (upon written notice to the Indemnitor) shall have the right to
undertake, assume and direct the defense of such Third Party Claim, using
counsel of its own choosing reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitor, and
the

 



42  Indemnitor shall be responsible for the fees and disbursements of one
counsel in any jurisdiction with respect to such Third Party Claim and any
other Third Party Claims related thereto. If the Indemnitor shall control the
defense of any such claim then the Indemnitor shall keep the Indemnitee
reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of such claim
and the defense thereof and the Indemnitor shall be entitled to settle such
claim; _provided_ , that, the Indemnitor shall obtain the prior written
consent of the Indemnitee (which consent, except with respect to Specified
Matters, shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before
entering into any settlement or compromise of a claim, consenting to any
judgment with respect to or ceasing to defend such claim if, pursuant to or as
a result of such settlement, judgment or cessation, (A) injunctive or other
equitable relief will be imposed against any Indemnified Person or any of its
Affiliates, including obligations (other than payment of settlement amounts
and civil penalties) imposed pursuant to any settlement agreement or CIA (as
defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement), (B) any Indemnified Person or any
of its Affiliates shall be required to admit wrongdoing, enter into any
criminal plea, incur any criminal liability or enter into a deferred
prosecution agreement or non-prosecution agreement, (C) Indemnitor does not
pay all amounts to be paid in connection therewith, (D) such settlement or
consent to judgment does not expressly and unconditionally release the
Indemnified Persons and their Affiliates from any liability or obligation
with respect to such claim or (E) any Indemnified Person or any of its
Affiliates (or the treatments performed using their products) are excluded
from reimbursement from the Medicare program in accordance with 42 USC §
1320a-7. Regardless of which party assumes the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the parties shall cooperate with one another in connection therewith.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, and without limiting any
rights of Purchaser Indemnified Persons hereunder, the Purchaser Indemnified
Persons and their Representatives shall have the right to (v) participate in
all substantive communications between Seller or any of its Affiliates or any
of their respective Representatives and any Governmental Entity regarding any
Specified Matter, including telephone calls, meetings, presentations, notices,
demands and other written communications (and, to the extent Purchaser does
not participate in such communications, Seller shall inform Purchaser in a
timely manner of the contents of such communications and provide copies of any
written communications), (w) consult with Seller and its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives before any of them initiates any
substantive communication with any Governmental Entity regarding any
Specified Matter or makes any material decision regarding the defense thereof,
(x) access to all documents and information material to the defense of any
Specified Matter, including all documents produced to a Governmental Entity,
(y) participate in all interviews or similar communications with fact
witnesses regarding any Specified Matter or, to the extent Purchaser elects
not participate, access to written summaries thereof and (z) participate in
the negotiation of the terms and conditions of any CIA (as defined in the
Asset Purchase Agreement) entered into in connection with a settlement of, or
Judgment arising from, any Specified Matter.

 

(b) _Other Claims_. The Indemnitee shall notify the Indemnitor in writing
promptly upon becoming aware of the event or circumstance that forms the
basis of any claim (other than a Third Party Claim) (each, an " _Other Claim_
") in respect of which indemnification may be sought under _Section 8.02_ or
_8.03_ , describing, to the extent practicable, the claim, the amount thereof
(if known and quantifiable) and the basis thereof. The failure by an
Indemnitee to promptly deliver such written notice to the Indemnitor shall not
affect the Indemnitees right to receive indemnification hereunder with
respect to such Other Claim, except to the extent the Indemnitor is prejudiced
by such failure.

 



43 8.05 _Determination of Loss Amount_. The amount of any Loss subject to
indemnification under  _Section 8.02_ or _8.03_ shall be calculated net of
any insurance proceeds or any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment
recovered by the Indemnitee from any third party with respect thereto (less
any costs incurred in connection with enforcing the right to or obtaining
such proceeds or similar payment). The Indemnitee shall seek full recovery
under all insurance policies covering any Loss to the same extent as it would
if such Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder. In the event that
an insurance or other recovery is made by any Indemnitee with respect to any
Loss for which any such Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund
equal to the lesser of (x) any indemnification payment that has been made in
respect of such Loss hereunder and (y) the aggregate amount of the recovery
(net in each case of any costs incurred in connection with enforcing the right
to or obtaining such recovery) shall be made promptly to the Indemnitor.
Purchaser shall not be entitled to indemnification under _Section 8.02_ for
the amount of any Loss (i) to the extent of any provision or reserve
established in respect of the specific matters giving rise to such Loss that
has been made in the Financial Statements or (ii) to the extent the matter
giving rise to such indemnification claim was disputed and resolved and such
amount of such Loss was used in the calculation of the Final
Cash Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.04_.

8.06 _Acknowledgment of the Purchaser_. The Purchaser acknowledges that it
has conducted to its satisfaction an independent investigation and
verification of the financial condition, results of operations, assets,
liabilities, properties and projected operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and, in making its determination to proceed with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Purchaser has relied solely
on the representations and warranties of the Company and the Seller expressly
and specifically set forth in this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and any
Exhibits, Schedules, certificates or other instruments delivered in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Disclosure Schedules
attached hereto. Such representations and warranties by the Company or
the Seller, as applicable, along with such representations and warranties as
are contained in the certificates delivered pursuant to _Section 3.01(h)_,
constitute the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of the
Company or the Seller, as applicable, to the Purchaser in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, and the Purchaser understands, acknowledges
and agrees that all other representations and warranties of any kind or nature
expressed or implied (including any relating to the future or historical
financial condition, results of operations, assets or liabilities of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, or the quality, quantity or condition of the
Companys and its Subsidiaries assets) are specifically disclaimed by the
Company and the Seller. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement and any Exhibits, Schedules, certificates or other
instruments delivered in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Disclosure Schedules attached hereto, none
of the Seller nor the Company makes or provides, and the Purchaser hereby
waives, any warranty or representation, express or implied, as to the quality,
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, conformity to samples, or
condition of the Companys and its Subsidiaries assets or any part thereof.
In connection with the Purchasers investigation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries the Purchaser has received certain projections, including
projected statements of operating revenues and income from operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and certain business plan information. The
Purchaser acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to
make such projections and other forecasts and plans, that the Purchaser is
familiar with such uncertainties and that, except as expressly provided in
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and any Exhibits, Schedules, certificates
or other instruments delivered in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Disclosure Schedules attached hereto, the
Purchaser is taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the
adequacy and accuracy of all projections and other forecasts and plans so
furnished to it, including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
such projections and forecasts. Accordingly, the Purchaser hereby
acknowledges, represents, warrants and agrees that, except as expressly
provided in this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and any Exhibits, Schedules,
certificates or other

 



44  instruments delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Disclosure Schedules attached hereto, it has not relied
upon, and that none of the Seller Parties is making any representation or
warranty with respect to, such projections and other forecasts and plans,
including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such projections
and forecasts. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement and any Exhibits, Schedules, certificates or other instruments
delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Disclosure Schedules attached hereto, the Purchaser further (i)
agrees, acknowledges, represents and warrants for itself and the other
Purchaser Parties, that it has not relied upon the accuracy or completeness of
any express or implied representation, warranty, statement or information of
any nature made or provided by or on behalf of the Seller or the Seller
Parties, and (except in the event of fraud) none of the Seller Parties or any
other Person will have or be subject to any liability to any Purchaser Party
or any other Person resulting from the distribution to the Purchaser or any

ARTICLE IX

 

 _TERMINATION_

9.01  _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Closing:

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Purchaser and the Seller;

(b) by the Purchaser, if there has been a violation or breach by the Company
or the Seller of any covenant, agreement, representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement that has prevented the satisfaction of any
condition to the obligations of the Purchaser at the Closing and such
violation or breach cannot be cured by the Company or Seller by the Outside
Date or, if capable of being cured, is not cured by the Company or the Seller
within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt by the Company of written
notice thereof from the Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchaser
is not then in material breach of this Agreement so as to cause any of the
conditions set forth in _Section 3.02_ not to be satisfied;

 

(c) by the Seller, if there has been a violation or breach by the Purchaser of
any covenant, agreement, representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement that has prevented

 



45  the satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of the Seller at the
Closing and such violation or breach cannot be cured by the Purchaser by the
Outside Date or, if capable of being cured, is not cured by the Purchaser
within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt by the Purchaser of written
notice thereof by the Seller; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the
Company nor the Seller are then in material breach of this Agreement so as to
cause any of the conditions set forth in _Section 3.01_ not to be satisfied;
or

(d) by the Purchaser or the Seller, if the transactions contemplated hereby
have not been consummated on or before February 9, 2016 (such date, the "
_Outside Date_ "); _provided_ that, in each case, the right to terminate this
Agreement under this  _Section 9.01(d)_ shall not be available to any party
whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the
cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing of the transactions
contemplated hereby to occur on or prior to such date.

9.02 _Effect of Termination_. In the event this Agreement is terminated by
either the Purchaser or the Seller as provided in _Section 9.01_, the
provisions of this Agreement shall immediately become void and of no further
force and effect (other than this _Section 9.02_ and the second and third
sentences of _Section 12.11_ ( _Third Party Beneficiaries_ ), _Section
12.12_ ( _Waiver of Trial by Jury_ ), _12.15_ ( _Governing Law_ ), _12.16_ (

on the part of the Purchaser, the Company or the Seller to one another, except
for fraud or Willful Breaches of this Agreement prior to the time of such
termination. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Willful Breach_ " means an
intentional and willful material breach, or an intentional and willful
material failure to perform, in each case that is the consequence of an act or
omission by a party with the actual knowledge that the taking of such act or
failure to take such act would cause a breach of this Agreement.

ARTICLE X

 

 _ADDITIONAL COVENANTS_

 

10.01 _Provision Respecting Legal Representation_. It is acknowledged by each
of the parties hereto that each of the Company and the Seller have retained
KandE to act as its counsel in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby and that KandE has not acted as counsel for any other party hereto in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and that none of the
other parties hereto has the status of a client of KandE for conflict of
interest purposes as a result thereof, and that the fact that KandE has acted as
counsel for the Company shall not restrict KandE from acting as counsel for
the Seller in any dispute after the Closing with Purchaser or the Company
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and KandE may represent
the Seller, The Gores Group, LLC and/or such Affiliates in such dispute even
though the interests of the Seller, The Gores Group, LLC and/or such
Affiliates may be directly adverse to the Purchaser, the Company or its
Subsidiaries, and even though KandE may have represented the Company or its
Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to such dispute. The parties
further agree that the attorneyclient privilege of the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall continue to belong to them following the Closing and shall
not pass to or be claimed by Seller (and any attorney-client privilege of
Seller shall continue to belong to Seller following the Closing and shall not
pass to or be claimed by the Company or its Subsidiaries), provided that, as
to all communications

 



46  prior to the Closing among KandE, on the one hand, and Seller, the Company
and/or its Subsidiaries and/or their respective Affiliates, on the other hand,
that relate in any way to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
are subject to the attorneyclient privilege, none of Purchaser, the Company
or any of their Affiliates shall disclose (nor shall Seller or any of its
Affiliates be required to disclose) any such communications in any Litigation
in support of a claim by any of them against Seller or any of its Affiliates
(unless such communication is no longer subject to attorney-client privilege
for reasons other than the actions of Purchaser, the Company or any of their
Affiliates).

10.02 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates shall have
the right to make any election under Section 338 of the Code (or any similar
provision under state, local or foreign law) with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, provided that none of the Purchaser, the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates shall make any such election to
the extent such election would decrease the Final Cash Consideration, give
rise to Taxes for the Pre-Closing Tax Period for which Seller is required to
make an indemnification payment hereunder, or otherwise increase the Tax
liability of Seller or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective
direct or indirect equity owners.

(b) The Purchaser shall not take any action with respect to the Company that
would cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to constitute part
of a transaction that is the same as, or substantially similar to, the
"Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter" described in Internal Revenue Service
Notices 2001-16 and 2008-111.

(c) The Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or
cause to be filed all Tax Returns for each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for all periods ending prior to or including the Closing Date the
due date of which (including extensions) is after the Closing Date. Each such
Tax Return shall be prepared and timely filed (taking into account
extensions) in a manner consistent with past practice, except as otherwise
required by applicable Law or as would not give rise to incremental Taxes for
the Pre-Closing Tax Period for which Seller is required to make
an indemnification payment hereunder. At least thirty (30) Business Days
prior to the date on which each such Tax Return is required to be filed, the
Purchaser shall submit such Tax Return to the Seller for the Sellers review
and comment, and, provided that the Seller provides comments to the Purchaser
within fifteen (15) Business Days following receipt of such Tax Return by the
Seller, the Purchaser shall reflect such comments from the Seller on such Tax
Returns to the extent such comments are reasonable and not inconsistent with
past practice and applicable Law; _provided_ , that Purchaser shall not be
required to reflect any such comments from the Seller if doing so would give
rise to Taxes for any taxable period for which Seller is not required to make
an indemnification payment hereunder. The Purchaser shall cause the Company
and its Subsidiaries to timely file (taking into account extensions) all such
Tax Returns prepared pursuant to this  _Section 10.02(c)_.

(d) Without the prior written consent of the Seller, the Purchaser will not
(i) amend or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to amend any Tax
Return for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or (ii) make or change any Tax election
or accounting method or practice that has retroactive effect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period, in the case of each of clause (i) and (ii), to the extent
such action would give rise to Taxes for the Pre-Closing Tax Period for which
Seller is required to make an indemnification payment hereunder.

 



47 (e) Each of the Seller and the Purchaser will pay and be responsible for, and
will indemnify and hold the other party harmless against, fifty percent (50%)
of any transfer, documentary, sales, use, registration and real property
transfer or gains tax, stamp tax, excise tax, stock transfer tax, or other
similar Tax imposed on the Company or the Seller as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_
"), and any penalties or interest with respect to the Transfer Taxes. The
Seller agrees to cooperate with the Purchaser in the filing of any returns
with respect to the Transfer Taxes, including by supplying any information in
its possession that is reasonably necessary to complete such returns.

 

(f) The Purchaser and the Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the preparation
and filing of any Tax Return and any audit, litigation or other proceeding
with respect to Taxes, and the computation and verification of any amounts
paid or payable under this Agreement with respect to Taxes (including any
supporting workpapers, schedules and documents). Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of
records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return,
audit, litigation or other proceeding or any tax planning, and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any materials provided hereunder.

 

(g) If a notice of deficiency, proposed adjustment, assessment, audit,
examination or other administrative or court proceeding, suit, dispute or
other claim shall be delivered, sent, commenced, or initiated to or against
Purchaser or any of the Company or its Subsidiaries by any Taxing authority
with respect to Taxes that results in or may result in a loss for which
indemnification may be claimed under this Agreement (a " _Tax Claim_ "), the
party first receiving such notice shall promptly notify the other party in
writing of such Tax Claim. The failure by the party receiving such notice to
promptly notify the other party shall not affect the receiving partys right
to receive indemnification hereunder with respect to such Tax Claim, except to
the extent the other party is prejudiced by such failure. The Purchaser will
have the right to control any Tax Claim and any other Tax proceeding with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , that with
respect to any Tax Claim that would reasonably be expected to result in a loss
in respect of which Seller would be required to make an indemnification
payment hereunder, (x) the Seller will have the right, directly or through its
designated representatives, to review in advance and comment upon all
submissions made in the course of any such Tax Claim and (y) Purchaser shall
not settle or otherwise dispose of any such Tax Claim without the prior
consent of the Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 

(h) Any and all existing Tax sharing or similar agreements between the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any Affiliate of the Company
other than one of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall be terminated and
all payables and receivables arising thereunder shall be settled, in each case
prior to the Closing Date. After the Closing Date, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have any further rights, obligations or
liability thereunder or under any payables or receivables arising thereunder.

 



48 (i) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the procedures with
respect to any proceedings in respect of Taxes shall be governed by this
_Section 10.02_ and not by _Section 8.04_.

(j) Any payment made pursuant to _Section 1.05_ or _Article VIII_ shall be
treated as an adjustment to the purchase price for all Tax purposes except to
the extent otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning
of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any similar provision of state, local or
non-U.S. Tax Law).

10.03 _Financing_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Purchaser will and
will cause MIFSA to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Debt Fee Letter
(including any "flex" provisions related thereto) on or prior to the Closing
Date, and will cause MIFSA not to, without the Companys prior written
consent, agree to any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy under, the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Fee Letter
if such amendment, modification or waiver (i) reduces the aggregate amount of
the Bridge Financing to an amount that, together with the Purchasers and its
Affiliates cash on hand or available committed credit facilities, would be
less than an amount that would be required to fund the cash payments required
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) changes the
conditions to obtaining the Bridge Financing or adds new or additional
conditions precedent to obtaining the Bridge Financing, unless such amendment,
modification or waiver results in conditions that are in the aggregate
substantially equivalent to the conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter
and the Debt Fee Letter immediately prior to such amendment, modification or
waiver (or that are more favorable to the Purchaser and its Affiliates) or
(iii) would reasonably be expected to (A) delay or prevent the Closing, (B)
make the funding of the Bridge Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions
to obtaining the Bridge Financing) less likely to occur or (C) adversely
impact the ability of MIFSA or its Affiliates to enforce its rights against
the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements
with respect thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser may cause MIFSA
to amend or replace the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Fee Letter to (i)
add lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents, managers or similar
entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of
this Agreement or (ii) implement or exercise any "flex" provisions provided in
the Debt Fee Letter as in effect on the date of this Agreement. Purchaser
will cause MIFSA to use its reasonable best efforts to (I) maintain in effect
the Debt Commitment Letter, (II) satisfy (or, if deemed advisable by MIFSA,
obtain the waiver of, and cause each of its Affiliates to satisfy) on a
timely basis all conditions to the Bridge Financing that are within Purchaser
and its Affiliates control, (III) negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect to the Financing on the terms and conditions
contained in the Debt Commitment Letter or consistent in all material respects
with the Debt Commitment Letter and the Debt Fee Letter (including any "flex"
provisions contained therein) and (IV) draw a sufficient amount of the
Financing to enable Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, in the event that the conditions set forth in _Section 3.01_ and
_Section 3.02_ and the conditions to the availability of the Financing have
been satisfied or, upon funding, would be satisfied or waived. Upon the
request of the Company or Seller, Purchaser will keep Seller and the Company
reasonably informed on a reasonably current 

 



49  basis of the status of Purchasers and MIFSAs efforts to obtain the
Financing, including providing Seller with prompt notice of (x) any
repudiation, termination or breach of the Debt Commitment Letter by any party
thereto, of which Purchaser becomes aware and (y) the occurrence of any other
event or development that would reasonably be expected to materially adversely
impact the ability of MIFSA to obtain all or any portion of the Financing.
Purchaser shall have the right to substitute the proceeds of consummated
offerings or other incurrences of debt (including unsecured notes) for all or
any portion of the Bridge Financing by reducing commitments under the Debt
Commitment Letter; _provided_ , that to the extent any such debt has a
scheduled special or mandatory redemption right, such right is not exercisable
prior to the earlier of the consummation of the Closing Transactions on the
Closing Date, the termination of this Agreement or the Outside Date (as it
may be extended pursuant to this Agreement). Further, Purchaser shall have the
right to substitute commitments in respect of other debt financing for all or
any portion of the Bridge Financing from the same and/or alternative bona
fide third-party financing sources (" _Replacement Financing Sources_ ") so
long as (i) all conditions precedent to effectiveness of definitive
documentation for such debt financing have been satisfied and the conditions
precedent to funding of such debt financing are in the aggregate, in respect
of certainty of funding, substantially equivalent to (or more favorable to the
Purchaser and its Affiliates than) the conditions in the Debt Commitment
Letter and the Debt Fee Letter, and (ii) prior to funding of any loans
thereunder, the commitments in respect of such debt financing are subject to
restrictions on assignment which are in the aggregate
substantially equivalent to or more favorable to the Purchaser and its
Affiliates than the corresponding restrictions set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter (any such debt financing which satisfies the foregoing
clauses (i) and (ii), the " _Replacement Financing_ "; the definitive
documentation for any such Replacement Financing, the " _Replacement Financing
Documents_ "), of which true, complete and correct copies of such Replacement
Financing Documents shall be provided by Purchaser to the Company promptly
after such Replacement Financing commitment letter or other Replacement
Financing Documents are fully executed. The representations, warranties,
covenants and other restrictions of Purchaser contained in this Agreement and
any other provisions herein with respect to the Bridge Financing and the Debt
Commitment Letter shall apply equally to any Replacement Financing and
Replacement Financing Documents. Upon the request of the Company or Seller,
Purchaser will keep the Seller and the Company reasonably informed on a
reasonably current basis of the status of Purchasers efforts to obtain the
Financing.

 

(b) The Company agrees to, and to cause its Subsidiaries to use reasonable
best efforts to, provide, such assistance (and to use reasonable best efforts
to cause its and its Subsidiaries Representatives, to provide such
assistance), with the Financing as is customary with Financings of the type
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (including the senior notes
offering contemplated thereby) and reasonably requested by Purchaser,
including: (i) participation in, and assistance with, the marketing efforts
related to the Financing, including assisting Purchaser with Purchasers
preparation of customary confidential information memoranda, private
placement memoranda, prospectuses, offering memoranda and other customary
marketing materials and information reasonably deemed necessary by the
Financing Sources to complete a successful syndication or offering for
delivery to potential syndicate members, purchasers and participants; (ii)
participation by senior management, Representatives and advisors of the
Company in, and assistance with, the preparation of rating agency
presentations and meetings with rating agencies, roadshows, due diligence
sessions, drafting sessions and meetings with prospective lenders and debt
investors (including, for the avoidance of doubt, direct contact with 

 



50  such rating agencies and prospective lenders and debt investors), in each
case, at such times as coordinated reasonably in advance thereof; (iii)
delivery to Purchaser and its Financing Sources as promptly as reasonably
practicable of (A) the documentation and other information requested by the
Financing Sources with respect to (x) applicable "know-your-customer" and
anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the PATRIOT Act and
(y) the U.S. Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control and the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (and, in any event, at least three (3) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, to the extent requested at least nine (9)
days prior to the Closing Date), (B) the Financing Information relating to the
Company and (C) such other financial information relating to the Company
customary or reasonably necessary for the completion of the Financing to the
extent reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection with the preparation of
customary offering or information documents to be used for the Financing
(which financing information, for the avoidance of doubt, may be included in
any such offering or information documents used for or distributed in
connection with the Financing); (iv) direct its independent auditors to
cooperate with the Financing consistent with their customary practice,
including by providing customary "comfort letters" (including customary
"negative assurances") and customary assistance with the due diligence
activities of Purchaser and its Affiliates and the Financing Sources, and
customary consents to the inclusion of audit reports in any relevant
marketing materials, registration statements and related government filings;
(v) assisting Purchaser with Purchasers preparation of pro forma financial
information and pro forma financial statements for Mallinckrodt plc and its
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis (provided that neither the Company nor
any of the Companys Subsidiaries or Companys Representatives shall be
responsible in any manner for information relating to the proposed debt and
equity capitalization that is required for such pro forma financial
information) and other materials for rating agency presentations, bank
information memoranda (confidential and public), offering or private placement
memoranda, lender and investor presentations, prospectuses and financial
projections for the Company as part of the consolidated business of
Mallinckrodt plc and its Subsidiaries, and not on a stand-alone basis, to the
extent reasonably requested by the Financing Sources, and providing customary
management and representation letters to its accountants in relation to its
accountants providing "comfort letters" in connection with any securities
offering made as part of the Financing (" _Representation Letters_ "); (vi)
executing and delivering definitive financing documents (but excluding, for
the avoidance of doubt, authorization letters) necessary and customary in
connection with the Financing, including customary pledge and security
documents, customary certificates (but not solvency certificates),
Representation Letters and other customary documents, to the extent reasonably
requested by Purchaser; (vii) otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledging
of collateral required to be delivered as a condition precedent to the
Financing; and (viii) assisting Purchaser and its Affiliates in causing the
conditions precedent set forth in Exhibit C to the Debt Commitment Letter to
the Bridge Financing to be satisfied.

(c) The Company hereby consents to the use of all of its and its Subsidiaries
logos in connection with the Financing, provided that such logos are used
solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or
disparage the Company or its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the
Company or its Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that Purchaser, the
Financing Sources and their respective affiliates and Representatives shall
obtain no rights in such logos. Notwithstanding any other provision set forth
herein or in any other agreement between the Company and Purchaser (or its
Affiliates), the Company agrees that Purchaser and its Affiliates may share
customary projections with respect to the Company and its business with the
Financing Sources identified in the Debt Commitment Letter, and that
Purchaser, its Affiliates

 



51  and such Financing Sources may share such information with potential
Financing Sources in connection with any marketing efforts in connection with
the Financing, _provided_ that the recipients of such information agree to
customary confidentiality arrangements. Notwithstanding the requirements of
_Section 10.03(b)_, (i) neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates or
their respective Representatives shall be required to enter into or approve
any letter, certificate, document, agreement or instrument or approve or
consent to resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the Financing, in
each case, that will be effective prior to the Closing (other than
Representation Letters), (ii) nothing herein shall require cooperation
contemplated thereby to the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the
business or operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii)
nothing herein shall require Seller to cause the delivery of any legal
opinions or any certificate as to solvency by Seller or the Company or its
Subsidiaries, and (iv) nothing herein shall require any officer, director or
other representative of the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries to
deliver any certificate or opinion that such officer, director or other
representative reasonably believes, in good faith, contains any untrue
certifications or opinions, as applicable.

 

(d) Whether or not the Closing occurs, Purchaser will promptly, upon request
by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-
of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than with respect to any
costs associated with preparing quarterly and annual financial statements)
in connection with the cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries
contemplated by _Section 10.03(b)_. Purchaser will indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives from
and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered
or incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing
(including any action taken in accordance with this _Section 10.03_) and any
assistance or activities in connection therewith, in each case other than to
the extent any of the foregoing arises from the bad faith, gross negligence or
willful misconduct of, or breach of this Agreement by any such Person.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall any
failure to obtain any Financing nor any failure to fund any Financing relieve
Purchaser of any obligation under or in respect of this Agreement, including
the obligation to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as required hereby, and neither the obtaining nor the availability
or funding of any Financing shall constitute a condition to Purchasers
obligation to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as required hereby. Purchaser reaffirms its obligation to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and
independently of the availability of the Financing, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein.

12.05 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, except that neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be
assigned or delegated by the Purchaser without the prior written consent of
the Company and the Seller, or by the Company or the Seller without the prior
written consent of the Purchaser, in each of the foregoing cases, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



64 12.06 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be
prohibited by or invalid under applicable Law, such provision shall be
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of
this Agreement. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be
completed to the extent possible.

12.07 _References_. The table of contents and the section and other headings
and subheadings contained in this Agreement and the Exhibits hereto are
solely for the purpose of reference, are not part of the agreement of the
parties hereto, and shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement or any Exhibit hereto. All references to days or months
shall be deemed references to calendar days or months. All references to "$"
shall be deemed references to United States dollars. Unless the context
otherwise requires, any reference to a "Section," "Article," "Exhibit,"
"Disclosure Schedule" or "Schedule" shall be deemed to refer to a section or
article of this Agreement, exhibit to this Agreement or a schedule to this
Agreement, as applicable. Capitalized terms used in the Disclosure Schedules
and not otherwise defined therein have the meanings given to them in this
Agreement. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar
import referring to this Agreement refer to this Agreement as a whole and not
to any particular provision of this Agreement. The word "including" or any
variation thereof means "including, without limitation" and shall not be
construed to limit any general statement that it follows to the specific or
similar items or matters immediately following it. Unless the context
otherwise clearly indicates, each defined term used in this Agreement shall
have a comparable meaning when used in its plural or singular form.

12.08 _Construction_. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to
be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent,
and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any Person. The
specification of any dollar amount in the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement is not intended to imply that the amounts, or
higher or lower amounts, are or are not material, and no party shall use the
fact of the setting of the amounts in any dispute or controversy between the
parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described
or included in the Disclosure Schedules or any Exhibit is or is not material.
The inclusion of any item in the Disclosure Schedules is not intended to imply
that the items so included, or other items, are or are not required to be
disclosed (including whether such items are required to be disclosed as
material or threatened) or are within or outside of the ordinary course of
business, and no party shall use the fact of the inclusion of any item the
Disclosure Schedules in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to
whether any obligation, item or matter not described or included in the
Disclosure Schedules is or is not required to be disclosed (including whether
the items are required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or is
within or outside of the ordinary course of business. The information
contained in this Agreement and in the Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits
hereto is disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no information
contained herein or therein shall be deemed to be an

 



65  admission by any party hereto to any third party of any matter whatsoever
(including any violation of Law or breach of contract). For purposes of this
Agreement, a document shall be deemed to have been "delivered," "furnished"
or "made available" (or any phrase of similar import) to the Purchaser by the
Company only if the Company or a Person acting on its behalf posts such
document to the online data room hosted on behalf of the Company and located
at datasite.merrillcorp.com or provided such document to the Company by
electronic mail or physical delivery, in each case, prior to 5:00 p.m. in New
York, New York on the day prior to the date hereof. 

12.09 _Amendment and Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement or the
Disclosure Schedules or Exhibits hereto may be amended or waived only in a
writing signed by the Purchaser, the Company and the Seller. No waiver of any
provision hereunder or any breach or default thereof shall extend to or affect
in any way any other provision or prior or subsequent breach or
default. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this
_Section 12.09_, _Section 12.11_ (as it relates to third-party
beneficiaries), _Section 12.12_ and _Section 12.18_ may not be
amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified, nor may this Agreement
be otherwise modified in a manner that in substance constitutes such a
modification, in each case in a manner adverse to the Financing Sources,
without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.

12.10 _Complete Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents referred to
herein (including the Confidentiality Agreement) contain the complete
agreement between the parties hereto and supersede any prior understandings,
agreements or representations by or between the parties, written or oral,
which may have related to the subject matter hereof in any way.

12.11 _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. _Section 7.02_ shall be enforceable by
the current and former officers and directors of the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries and his or her heirs and representatives. The Financing Sources
shall be express third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 12.11_ and 
_Sections 12.09_ , _12.12_ and _12.18_ , each of such Sections shall expressly
inure to the benefit of the Financing Sources and the Financing Sources shall
be entitled to rely on and enforce the provisions of such Sections. Except
as otherwise expressly provided herein, nothing expressed or referred to in
this Agreement will be construed to give any Person other than the parties to
this Agreement any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or with
respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement.

12.12 _Waiver of Trial by Jury_. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY WAIVES,
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY
CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION (A) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE ESCROW AGREEMENT OR (B) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL
TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF
THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO (INCLUDING ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST ANY FINANCING SOURCE), IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING
OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE.
EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM,
DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A
JURY, AND THAT THE

 



66  PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE FINANCING SOURCES MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS
AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES
HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

12.13 _Delivery by Electronic Transmission_. This Agreement and any signed
agreement entered into in connection herewith or contemplated hereby, and any
amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a
facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to
electronic mail, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original
contract and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effects as if
it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the
request of any party hereto or to any such contract, each other party hereto
or thereto shall reexecute original forms thereof and deliver them to all
other parties. No party hereto or to any such contract shall raise the use of
a facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to
electronic mail to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or
contract was transmitted or communicated through the use of facsimile machine
or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to electronic mail as a
defense to the formation of a contract and each such party forever waives any
such defense.

12.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts,
any one of which need not contain the signature of more than one party, but
all such counterparts taken together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

 

12.15 _Governing Law_. All issues and questions concerning the construction,
validity, interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement and the
Exhibits and Schedules hereto shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
any choice of law or conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the State
of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of
the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 

12.16 _Jurisdiction_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in _Section
1.04_, any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or
based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware (or, solely if such court declines jurisdiction, in
the United States District Court for the District of Delaware), and each of
the parties hereto hereby consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of
the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action
or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of
any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit,
action or proceeding which is brought in any such court has been brought in
an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party
agrees that service of process on such party as provided in _Section 12.04_
shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

 

12.17 _Specific Performance_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the
rights of each party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are
unique and recognizes and affirms that in the event of a breach of this
Agreement by any party, money

 



67  damages may be inadequate and the non-breaching party may have no adequate
remedy at law. Accordingly, the parties agree that such non-breaching party
shall have the right, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in
their favor at law or in equity, to enforce their rights and the other partys
obligations hereunder not only by an action or actions for damages but also
by an action or actions for specific performance, injunctive and/or other
equitable relief (without posting of bond or other security). Except as
expressly set forth herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred
on a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any remedy
conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a
party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. 

12.18 _Liability of Financing Sources_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) the Company (on
behalf of itself and each Company Related Person) and each of the other
parties hereto agrees that any claim, controversy or dispute of any kind or
nature (whether based upon contract, tort or otherwise) against a Financing
Source that is in any way related to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any
way to the Financing shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflict of law principles
(other than Sections 5-1401 and 5-1402 of the New York General Obligations
Law); _provided_ that (x) the interpretation of the definition of Material
Adverse Effect and whether or not a Material Adverse Effect has occurred, (y)
the determination of the accuracy of any Acquisition Agreement Target
Representations (as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter) and whether as a
result of any inaccuracy thereof Purchaser or its Affiliates have the right to
terminate its obligations under this Agreement, or to decline to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby and (z) the determination of whether the
transactions contemplated hereby have been consummated in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, in each case, shall be governed by, and construed
and interpreted solely in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware
without giving effect to conflicts of laws principles that would result in the
application of the Law of any other state and (ii) the Company (on behalf
of itself and each Company Related Person) and each of the other parties
hereto (A) agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against the Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Financing or the performance thereof or the
transactions contemplated thereby, in any forum other than exclusively in the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under
applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in the
County of New York (and appellate courts thereof), (B) submits for itself and
its property with respect to any such action to the exclusive jurisdiction
of such courts, (C) agrees that service of process, summons, notice or
document by registered mail addressed to it at its address provided in
_Section 12.04_ shall be effective service of process against it for any such
action brought in any such court, (D) waives and hereby irrevocably waives,
to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of, any such action in any such court and (E) agrees
that a final judgment in any such action shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law.

 



68 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company (on
behalf of itself and each Company Related Person (other than Purchaser and
MIFSA)) agrees that neither it nor any other Company Related Person (other
than Purchaser and MIFSA) shall have any rights or claims against any
Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the Financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; _provided_ that, following the
Closing, the foregoing will not limit the rights of the parties to the
Financing under the Debt Financing Documents. In addition, in no event will
any Financing Source be liable for consequential, special, exemplary, punitive
or indirect damages (including any loss of profits, business or anticipated
savings) or damages of a tortious nature.

 

12.19 _Prevailing Party_. In the event any suit, action or proceeding (a "
_Proceeding_ ") is commenced by any party (the " _Claiming Party_ ") hereto
to enforce its rights under this Agreement against any other party (the "
_Defending Party_ "), the non-prevailing party in such Proceeding shall
reimburse all fees, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees
and court costs, incurred by the prevailing party in such Proceeding;
_provided_ , that if a party prevails in part, and loses in part, in such
Proceeding, the court presiding over such Proceeding shall award a
reimbursement of the fees, costs and expenses incurred by the parties on an
equitable basis. For purposes hereof, and without limitation, the Defending
Party shall be deemed to have prevailed in any Proceeding described in the
immediately preceding sentence if the Claiming Party commences any such
Proceeding and (i) the underlying claim(s) are subsequently dropped or
voluntarily dismissed and/or (ii) the Defending Party defeats such claim(s).

 

12.20 _Guarantee_. Parent hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees,
as primary obligor and not as surety, the due and punctual payment and
performance by the Purchaser of all of its obligations to the Seller pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement (the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ "). The
foregoing sentence is an absolute, unconditional and continuing guaranty of
the full and punctual discharge and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations.
Should Purchaser default in the discharge or performance of all or any portion
of the Guaranteed Obligations, the obligations of Parent hereunder shall
become immediately due and payable to the Seller. Parent hereby represents
and warrants to the Company that (i) it is a public limited company, validly
existing under the laws of Ireland, and it has all power and authority to
execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this _Section 12.20_;
(ii) the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by it has been
duly and validly authorized and approved by all necessary corporate action,
and no other proceedings or actions on the part of it are necessary therefor;
and (iii) this Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
it and, assuming that this Agreement is a valid and binding obligation of the
other parties hereto, constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of
it, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy Laws, other similar Laws affecting
creditors rights and general principles of equity affecting the availability
of specific performance and other equitable remedies. Until the Payment in
full of the Guaranteed Obligations, Parent waives (i) any of the following
rights it may have against Purchaser: subrogation, set-off, reimbursement,
exoneration, contribution or indemnification, and (ii) any right to
participate in any claim or remedy of the Seller against Purchaser, in the
case whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under
contract, statute or common law.
