the stockholders of any of the foregoing, the securities of the constituent
corporations shall be converted as follows:    

 (i) Each share of LifePoint Merger Sub Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged for the right to receive one share of common stock of the LifePoint Surviving Corporation.    

  (ii) Each share of LifePoint Common Stock (excluding shares held
by any Province Entity or any LifePoint Entity, which will be
canceled pursuant to Section 3.3) issued and outstanding at the Effective
Time shall cease to be outstanding and shall be deemed to be converted
into and exchanged for one share of Holding Company Common Stock (the "
_LifePoint Merger Consideration_ " and, together with the Province
Merger Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "), without the
requirement for the surrender of any certificate previously representing any
such shares of LifePoint Common Stock or issuance of new certificates
representing Holding Company Common Stock, with each certificate representing
shares of LifePoint Common Stock prior to the Effective Time being deemed
to represent automatically an equivalent number of shares of Holding
Company Common Stock.    

  (iii) Pursuant to the Holding Company Rights Agreement, each share of
Holding Company Common Stock issued in connection with the LifePoint Merger
upon conversion of LifePoint Common Stock shall be accompanied by a Holding
Company Right.   

  (c) _Holding Company Common Stock_. Each share of Holding Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be contributed to Holding Company, without payment of any consideration
therefor, and thereupon retired.   

3.2 Anti-Dilution Provisions.    

 In the event LifePoint or Province changes the number of shares of LifePoint Common Stock or Province Common Stock, as the case may be, issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock split, stock dividend, or similar recapitalization with respect to such stock and the record date therefor (in the case of a stock dividend) or the effective date thereof (in the case of a stock split or similar recapitalization for which a record date is not    ##### 

  

    

established) shall be prior to the Effective Time, each of the Province Cash
Consideration, the Province Stock Consideration, the Province Exchange Ratio
and the LifePoint Merger Consideration, as the case may be, shall
be proportionately adjusted, without duplication, to provide the holders
of Province Common Stock and LifePoint Common Stock the same economic effect
as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such stock split, stock dividend,
or similar recapitalization.   

3.3 Shares Held by Province or LifePoint.    

 Each of the shares of Province Common Stock and/or shares of LifePoint Common Stock held by any Province Entity or by any LifePoint Entity shall be canceled and retired at the Effective Time and no consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor.   

3.4 Dissenting Stockholders.    

 Any holder of shares of Province Common Stock who does not vote for adoption of this Agreement and who perfects such holders appraisal rights, if applicable and available, in accordance with and as contemplated by Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to receive from the Province Surviving Corporation the value of such shares in cash as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, that no such payment shall be made to any such dissenting stockholder unless and until such dissenting stockholder has complied with the applicable provisions of the DGCL and surrendered to the Province Surviving Corporation the certificate or certificates representing the shares for which payment is being made. Province shall give LifePoint prompt notice of any demands received by Province for appraisal of shares of Province Common Stock, and LifePoint shall have the right to participate in any and all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Province shall not, without the prior written consent of LifePoint, make any payment with respect to, or settle, offer to settle or otherwise negotiate any demand for appraisal. In the event that after the Effective Time a dissenting stockholder of Province fails to perfect, or effectively withdraws or loses, such holders right to appraisal of and payment for such holders shares, Holding Company or the Province Surviving Corporation shall issue and deliver the consideration to which such holder of shares of Province Common Stock is entitled under this ARTICLE 3 (without interest) upon surrender by such holder of the certificate or certificates representing the shares of Province Common Stock held by such holder.   

3.5 Fractional Shares.    

 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Province Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Province Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Holding Company Common Stock (after taking into account all certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share of Holding Company Common Stock multiplied by the market value of one share of Holding Company Common Stock at the Closing Date. The market value of one share of Holding Company Common Stock at the Closing Date shall be the last sale price of one share of LifePoint Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market (as reported by _The Wall Street Journal_ or, if not reported thereby, any other authoritative source reasonably selected by LifePoint) on the last trading day preceding the    ##### 

  

    

Closing Date. No such holder will be entitled to dividends, voting rights, or
any other rights as a stockholder in respect of any fractional shares of
Holding Company Common Stock. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Holding Company Common Stock.   

3.6 Stock Options.    

 (a) _Province Stock Options_. As compensation for services rendered to Province, at the Effective Time, each option or other Equity Right to purchase shares of Province Common Stock pursuant to stock options or stock appreciation rights (" _Province Options_ ") granted by Province under Province Stock Plan and outstanding at the Effective Time, whether or not exercisable, shall be canceled in exchange for a cash payment by the Province Surviving Corporation or Holding Company for each share of Province Common Stock subject to such Province Option (" _Option Settlement Payment_ ") equal to the amount, if any, by which the " _Per Share Purchase Price_ " exceeds the per share exercise price of Province Common Stock subject to such Province Option, subject to any applicable withholding tax. At the Effective Time, each such Province Option shall no longer represent the right to purchase shares of Province Common Stock, but in lieu thereof shall represent only the nontransferable right to receive the Option Settlement Payment referred to above. For purposes of this Section 3.6, the " _Per Share Purchase Price_ " shall equal the per share Province Merger Consideration received for each share of Province Common Stock, with the value of the Holding Company Common Stock based on the last sale price for LifePoint Common Stock on the trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date. Province shall take all actions necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 3.6(a).   

 (b) _LifePoint Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each option or other Equity Right to purchase or receive shares of LifePoint Common Stock (" _LifePoint Options_ ") granted by LifePoint under the LifePoint Stock Plans and outstanding at the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged for an option or other Equity Right to purchase or receive an equal number of shares of Holding Company Common Stock. All other terms and conditions of the LifePoint Options shall remain the same.   

3.7 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.    

 Province shall take all actions with respect to the ESPP necessary (a) to provide that the current exercise period scheduled to end on December 31, 2004 (the " _Final Exercise Period_ ") shall end on the earlier of (i) December 31, 2004, or (ii) a date prior to, but as close as is practicable to, the Effective Time, (b) to terminate the ESPP as of the Effective Time and (c) to provide that no new exercise periods shall be commenced under the ESPP following the termination of the Final Exercise Period.   

ARTICLE 4 EXCHANGE OF SHARES    

4.1 Exchange Procedures.    

 (a) Promptly after the Effective Time, Holding Company shall cause its transfer agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which represented shares of Province Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (the    ##### 

  

    

" _Province Certificates_ ") (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to such
Province Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such
Province Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Province Certificates in exchange for the
Province Merger Consideration. The Province Certificate or Province
Certificates so delivered shall be duly endorsed as the Exchange Agent may
require. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Province Common
Stock represented by a Province Certificate that is not registered in the
transfer records of Province, the Province Merger Consideration may be issued
to a transferee if the Province Certificates representing such shares are
delivered to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence such transfer and by evidence satisfactory to the Exchange Agent
that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. If any Province
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, mislaid or destroyed, upon receipt
of (x) an affidavit of that fact from the holder claiming such Province
Certificate to be lost, mislaid, stolen or destroyed, (y) such bond, security
or indemnity as Holding Company and the Exchange Agent may reasonably require
and (z) any other documents necessary to evidence and effect the bona fide
exchange thereof, the Exchange Agent shall issue to such holder the
consideration into which the shares represented by such lost, stolen, mislaid
or destroyed Province Certificate shall have been converted. The Exchange
Agent may establish such other reasonable and customary rules and procedures
in connection with its duties as it may deem appropriate. Holding Company
shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in
connection with the distribution of the consideration provided in Section
3.1.   

 (b) After the Effective Time, each holder of shares of Province Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.3 or as to which statutory appraisal rights have been perfected as provided in Section 3.4) issued and outstanding at the Effective Time shall surrender the Province Certificate or Province Certificates representing such shares to the Exchange Agent, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, and shall promptly thereafter receive in exchange for such shares the Province Merger Consideration. Holding Company shall not be obligated to deliver the Merger Consideration to which any former holder of Province Common Stock is entitled as a result of the Province Merger until such holder surrenders such holders Province Certificate or Province Certificates for exchange, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, as provided in this Section 4.1.   

 (c) Each of Holding Company, the Exchange Agent and any other Person involved in the payment of Merger Consideration shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Province Common Stock such amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that any amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Province Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.   

 (d) Any other provision of this Agreement notwithstanding, none of Holding Company, the Province Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to a holder of Province    ##### 

  

    

Common Stock for any amounts paid or property delivered in good faith to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Law.   

 (e) Promptly after the Effective Time, Holding Company shall provide to the Exchange Agent appropriate instructions and grant to the Exchange Agent authorization to issue a sufficient number of shares of Holding Company Common Stock in exchange for outstanding shares of Province Common Stock required to be paid pursuant to Section 3.1 and shall deposit with the Exchange Agent sufficient funds to pay a reasonable estimate of the cash payments necessary to make all fractional share payments as required by Section 3.5 and the aggregate Cash Consideration required to be paid pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(ii). Any portion of the cash that has been made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 4.1(e) that remains unclaimed by the holder of any Province Certificate or Province Certificates six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Holding Company, and any such holder who has not exchanged such holders Province Certificate or Province Certificates prior to such time shall thereafter look only to Holding Company for any claim for Merger Consideration hereunder.   

4.2 Rights of Former Stockholders.    

 At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of each of Province and LifePoint shall be closed as to holders of Province Common Stock and LifePoint Common Stock, respectively, and no transfer of Province Common Stock or LifePoint Common Stock by any such holder shall thereafter be made or recognized. All Merger Consideration delivered upon the surrender of Province Certificates in accordance with the terms of this ARTICLE 4 shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Province Common Stock theretofore represented by such Province Certificates. Until surrendered for exchange in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.1, each Province Certificate theretofor representing shares of Province Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.3 or as to which statutory appraisal rights have been perfected as provided in Section 3.4) shall from and after the Effective Time represent for all purposes only the right to receive the Province Merger Consideration in exchange therefor. Each certificate previously representing shares of LifePoint Common Stock (and each uncertificated share of LifePoint Common Stock in book-entry form, if any, prior to the Effective Time) shall be deemed to represent an equivalent number of shares of Holding Company Common Stock without any action on the part of the holder thereof; provided, however, that if an exchange of certificate previously representing shares of LifePoint Common Stock for new certificates is required by Law, or is requested by any holder thereof, Holding Company will arrange for such exchange on a one-share-for-one-share basis. Whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by Holding Company on the Holding Company Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, the declaration shall include dividends or other distributions on all shares of Holding Company Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement, but no dividend or other distribution payable to the holders of record of Holding Company Common Stock as of any time subsequent to the Effective Time shall be delivered to the holder of any Province Certificate until such holder surrenders such Province Certificate for exchange as provided in Section 4.1. However, upon surrender of such Province Certificate, both the Holding Company Common Stock certificate (together with all such undelivered dividends or other distributions without interest) and any undelivered dividends and cash payments payable hereunder (without interest) shall be delivered and paid with respect to each share represented by such Province Certificate, less any required withholding Taxes.    #####

compliance with the terms of all such Contracts to which they are a party and
under which they are in occupancy, each such Contract is in full force and
effect, and no other party to any such Contract is, to the Knowledge of
Province, in Default in any respect, has alleged that any Province Entity is
in Default in any material respect under any such Contract, has notified any
Province Entity of an intention to modify, cancel or not to renew any such
Contract or has repudiated or waived any material provision thereunder.
Province and each Province Subsidiary enjoy peaceful and undisturbed
possession under all such Contracts.   

5.12 Insurance.    

 Province and its Subsidiaries have insurance policies, including without limitation fire, casualty and other liability insurance policies, in amounts and on terms that are customary for the industry in which it operates and such policies are in full force and effect. None of the Province Entities has received notice from any insurance carrier that (i) any policy of insurance will be canceled or that coverage thereunder will be reduced or eliminated, or (ii) premium costs with respect to such policies of insurance will be substantially increased.   

5.13 Intellectual Property.    

 Each Province Entity owns, free and clear of all Liens, or has a valid license to use, all of the Intellectual Property used or held for use by such Province Entity in the course of its business, including sufficient rights in each copy possessed by each Province Entity (" _Province Intellectual Property_ "). Each Province Entity is the owner of or has a license, with the right to sublicense, to any Intellectual Property licensed (or sublicensed, as applicable) to a third party by such Province Entity in connection with such Province Entitys business operations, and such Province Entity has the right to grant licenses (or sublicenses, as applicable) of any Intellectual Property so licensed (or sublicensed, as applicable). No Province Entity is in Default under any of its Intellectual Property licenses or other Contracts. No Litigation has been instituted or are pending or, to the Knowledge of Province, are threatened, which challenge the rights of any Province Entity with respect to Province Intellectual Property. The conduct of the business of the Province Entities does not infringe any Intellectual Property of any Person, and no Litigation has been instituted, or are pending or to the Knowledge of Province threatened, which allege any such infringement. Except for generally available off-the-shelf software licensed at standard commercial rates, no Province Entity is obligated to pay any recurring royalties to any Person with respect to any Province Intellectual Property. Every officer and director of each Province Entity, and every other employee of each Province Entity that could reasonably be expected to participate in the creation of any Intellectual Property, is a party to a Contract which requires such officer, director or employee to assign any interest in any Intellectual Property to a Province Entity, and no such officer, director or employee is party to any Contract with any Person other than a Province Entity which requires such officer, director or employee to assign any interest in any Intellectual Property to any Person other than a Province Entity. Every officer and director of each Province Entity, and every other employee of each Province Entity that could reasonably be expected to have access to any trade secrets, proprietary data, customer information, or other    ##### 

  

    

business or confidential information (collectively, " _Trade Secrets_ ") of
a Province Entity, is party to a Contract which requires such officer,
director or employee to keep such Trade Secrets confidential. Without
limitation to the preceding sentence, no Province Entity has disclosed any
Trade Secrets to any other Person without prior thereto having obtained a
written agreement of confidentiality regarding such Trade Secrets. No
officer, director or employee of any Province Entity is party to any Contract
which restricts or prohibits such officer, director or employee from engaging
in activities competitive with any Person, including any Province Entity.
Section 5.13 of the Province Disclosure Memorandum sets forth a complete and
accurate list of all material Province Intellectual Property, except for
Trade Secrets and generally available off-the-shelf software.

 (c) During the period of (i) any Province Entitys ownership or operation of any of their respective current or former properties, (ii) any Province Entitys participation in the management of any Participation Facility, or (iii) any Province Entitys holding of a security interest in any Operating Property, there have been no releases, discharges, spillages, or disposals of Hazardous Material in, on, under, adjacent to, or affecting (or potentially affecting) such properties, except such as are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Province Material Adverse Effect. Prior to the period of (i) any Province Entitys ownership or operation of any of their respective current or former properties, (ii) any Province Entitys participation in the management of any Participation Facility, or (iii) any Province Entitys holding of a security interest in any Operating Property, to the Knowledge of Province, there were no releases, discharges, spillages, or disposals of Hazardous Material in, on, under, or affecting any such property, Participation Facility or Operating Property, except such as are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Province Material Adverse Effect.    ##### 

  

  

5.15 Compliance with Laws.    

 (a) Each Province Entity has in effect all Permits necessary for it to own, lease, or operate its Assets and to carry on its business as now conducted, except for those Permits the absence of which are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Province Material Adverse Effect, and there has occurred no Default under any such Permit, other than Defaults which are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Province Material Adverse Effect. None of the Province Entities:    

 (i) is in Default under any of the provisions of its Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws (or other governing instruments);    

 (ii) is in Default under any Laws, Orders, or Permits applicable to its business or employees conducting its business, except for Defaults which are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Province Material Adverse Effect; or

 (b) Each Province Entity and each of their respective officers and directors are in compliance with, and have complied, in all material respects with (i) the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Exchange Act and (ii) the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the NYSE. There are no outstanding loans made by Province or any of its Subsidiaries to any executive officer (as defined under Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or director (or any Person holding an equivalent position) of Province or any of its Subsidiaries. Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, neither Province nor any Province Subsidiary has made any loans to any executive officer or director (or any Person holding an equivalent position) of Province or any of its Subsidiaries. Province has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to Province, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to Provinces principal executive officer and its principal financial officer by others within those entities; and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting Provinces principal executive officer and its principal financial officer to material information required to be included in Provinces periodic reports required under the Exchange Act. Provinces principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed, based on their most    ##### 

  

    

recent evaluation, to Provinces auditors and the audit committee of
the Board of Directors of Province that (i) there are no significant
deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls which could
adversely affect Provinces ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial data, (ii) there are no material weaknesses in internal controls
and (ii) there exists no fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Provinces
internal controls. For purposes of this paragraph, "principal executive
officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to
such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.   

5.16 Labor Relations.    

 (a) No Province Entity is the subject of any Litigation asserting that it or any other Province Entity has committed an unfair labor practice (within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act or comparable state Law) or other violation of state or federal labor Law, except as could not reasonably be anticipated to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Province Material Adverse Effect, or seeking to compel it or any other Province Entity to bargain with any labor organization or other employee representative as to wages or conditions of employment, nor is any Province Entity party to any collective bargaining agreement or subject to any bargaining order, injunction or other Order relating to Provinces relationship or dealings with its employees, any labor organization or any other employee representative. There is no strike, slowdown, lockout or other job action or labor dispute involving any Province Entity pending or, to the Knowledge of Province, threatened and there has been no such actions or disputes in the past five years. To the Knowledge of Province, in the past five years, there have not been any attempt by any Province Entity employees or any labor organization or other employee representative to organize or certify a collective bargaining unit or to engage in any other union organization activity with respect to the workforce of any Province Entity. The employment of each employee of each Province Entity is terminable at will by the relevant Province Entity without any penalty, liability or severance obligation incurred by any Province Entity.

obligation or Liability. Any of Province Benefit Plans which is an "employee
pension benefit plan," as that term is defined in ERISA Section 3(2), is

Each Province ERISA Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS that is still in effect and applies to Province ERISA Plan as amended and as administered or, within the time permitted under Internal Revenue Code Section 401(b), has timely applied for a favorable determination letter which when issued will apply retroactively to Province ERISA Plan as amended and as administered. No Province Entity is aware of any circumstances likely to result in revocation of any such favorable determination letter. No Province Entity has received any communication (written or unwritten) from any government agency questioning or challenging the compliance of any Province Benefit Plan with applicable Laws. No Province Benefit Plan is currently being audited by a Regulatory Authority for compliance with applicable Laws or has been audited with a determination by the Regulatory Authority that Province Benefit Plan failed to comply with applicable Laws.   

 (d) There has been no written, or to Provinces Knowledge, oral representation or communication with respect to any aspect of the Province Benefit Plans made to employees of any of the Province Entities which is not in accordance with the written or otherwise preexisting terms and provisions of such plans.

There are no unresolved claims or disputes under the terms of, or in connection with, the Province Benefit Plans other than claims for benefits which are payable in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and no action, proceeding, prosecution, inquiry, hearing or investigation has been commenced with respect to any Province Benefit Plan.    #####

 (g) None of the Province Entities nor any ERISA Affiliate of a Province Entity maintains, contributes to or is required to contribute to any plan that is subject to the provisions of Title IV of ERISA.   

 (h) No Province Entity has any Liability for retiree health and life benefits under any of the Province Benefit Plans and there are no restrictions on the rights of such Province Entity to amend or terminate any such retiree health or benefit Plan without incurring any Liability thereunder except to the extent required under Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or Internal Revenue Code Section 4980B. To the Knowledge of Province, no Tax under Internal Revenue Code Sections 4980B or 5000 has been incurred with respect to any Province Benefit Plan and no circumstance exists which could give rise to such Taxes.   

 (i) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will, either alone on in conjunction with another event, (i) result in any payment (including severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute, or otherwise) becoming due to any director or any employee of any Province Entity from any Province Entity under any Province Benefit Plan or otherwise, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Province Benefit Plan, or (iii) result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefit. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no amount paid or payable by any Province Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code.   

 (j) The actuarial present values of all accrued deferred compensation entitlements (including entitlements under any executive compensation, supplemental retirement, or employment agreement) of employees and former employees of any Province Entity and their respective beneficiaries, other than entitlements accrued pursuant to funded retirement plans subject to the provisions of Internal Revenue Code Section 412 or ERISA Section 302, have been fully reflected on the Province Financial Statements to the extent required by and in accordance with GAAP.

otherwise preexisting terms and provisions of such plans. To the Knowledge of
the LifePoint, neither the LifePoint nor any administrator or fiduciary
of any LifePoint Benefit Plan (or any agent of any of the foregoing) has
engaged in any transaction, or acted or failed to act in any manner, which
could subject any of Province Entities or LifePoint Entities to any direct
or indirect Liability (by indemnity or otherwise) for breach of any
fiduciary, co-fiduciary or other duty under ERISA. There are no unresolved
claims or disputes under the terms of, or in connection with, the LifePoint
Benefit Plans other than claims for benefits which are payable in the

directly or indirectly, in cash or kind, to any Person to induce such Person
(A) to refer an individual to a Person for the furnishing or arranging for
the furnishing of any item or service for which payment may be made in whole
or in part under any federal or state health care program or (B) to purchase,
lease, order, or arrange for or recommend purchasing, leasing, or ordering
any good, facility, service, or item for which payment may be made in whole
or in part under any federal or state health care program.

As of their respective dates, such reports filed with the SEC will comply in all material respects with the Securities Laws and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

or Group, and (2) Province receives from such Person or Group an executed
confidentiality agreement containing terms no less favorable to
the disclosing Party than the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and
(E) contemporaneously with furnishing any such nonpublic information to such
Person or Group, Province furnishes such nonpublic information to LifePoint
(to the extent such nonpublic information has not been previously furnished
by Province to LifePoint). In addition to the foregoing, Province shall

Directors of Province is reasonably expected to consider any Acquisition

Province shall keep LifePoint informed promptly of material amendments or modifications to any such request or Acquisition Proposal.   

 (c) Province and Province Subsidiaries shall immediately cease any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and will use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

In the event any Litigation is threatened or instituted challenging the Mergers as violative of Antitrust Laws, each of LifePoint and Province shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to avoid the filing of, or resist or resolve, such Litigation. Each of LifePoint and Province shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, and to cooperate with each other with respect to, all other actions and do, or cause to be done, (i) all things necessary, proper or appropriate under the Antitrust Laws and any other applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) any other such action as may be required by: (A) the DOJ and/or the FTC in order to resolve such objections as either of them may have to the Mergers under the Antitrust Laws, or (B) any federal or state court of the United States, or similar court of competent jurisdiction in any foreign jurisdiction, in any suit brought by any Regulatory Authority or any other Person challenging the Mergers as violative of the Antitrust Laws, in order to avoid the entry of any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) which has the effect of preventing the consummation of the Mergers and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any such Order. "Reasonable efforts" for the purposes of this Section 8.4(a) shall not include any obligation to accept an Order agreeing to the divestiture, or the holding separate, of any Assets of any LifePoint Entity or any Province Entity which LifePoint reasonably determines to be material to LifePoint or to the benefits of the transaction for which it has bargained for hereunder. LifePoint shall be entitled to direct any proceedings or negotiations with any Regulatory Authority relating to any of the foregoing, provided that it shall afford Province a reasonable opportunity to consult with LifePoint in connection therewith.   

 (b) LifePoint and Province shall cooperate with each other and use their commercially reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings (which shall include the filings pursuant to subsection (a) above), and to obtain as promptly as practicable all Consents of all Regulatory Authorities and other Persons which are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Mergers).

Consents of all Regulatory Authorities and other Persons necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
each of LifePoint and Province will use their commercially reasonable efforts
to keep the other reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to
contemplation of the transactions contemplated herein. Each of LifePoint and
Province also shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly
advise the other upon receiving any material communication from any
Regulatory Authority whose Consent is required for consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which causes such Party to
reasonably believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any requisite
Consent will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such Consent will be
materially delayed.   

8.5 Filings with State Offices.    

 Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, LifePoint shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to execute and file the Certificates of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in connection with the Closing.   

8.6 Agreement as to Efforts to Consummate.    

 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party agrees to use, and to cause each of its Subsidiaries to use all commercially reasonable efforts (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper, or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective, as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using its reasonable efforts to lift or rescind any Order adversely affecting its ability to consummate the transactions contemplated herein and to cause to be satisfied the conditions referred to in ARTICLE 9, and (b) to cause the satisfaction of all conditions to Closing; provided, that nothing herein shall preclude either Party from exercising its rights under this Agreement. Province shall (i) cooperate with LifePoint and its Affiliates in connection with any tender offer or consent solicitation involving any of Provinces outstanding indebtedness or (ii) at LifePoints or its Affiliates direction, commence, or cause to be commenced, a tender offer or consent solicitation for any or all of Provinces outstanding indebtedness, which tender offer or consent solicitation shall be conditioned on the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, in each case, that LifePoint or its Affiliate shall pay for all expenses and payments to holders of indebtedness incurred in connection with any such tender offer or consent solicitation.   

8.7 Investigation and Confidentiality.    

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, each Party shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to keep the other Parties advised of all material developments relevant to its business and to consummation of the Mergers. Province shall permit LifePoint (and its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives) to make or cause to be made such investigation of the business, properties, personnel, offices, books and records of Province and Province Subsidiaries and each of their respective financial, legal and operating conditions as LifePoint reasonably requests, provided that such investigation shall be reasonably related to the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not interfere unreasonably with normal operations of Province or any Province Subsidiary, as the case may be. No investigation by LifePoint shall    ##### 

  

    

affect the ability of LifePoint to rely on the representations and warranties
of Province in this Agreement.   

 (b) In addition to the Parties respective obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, which is hereby reaffirmed and adopted, and incorporated by reference herein, each Party shall, and shall cause its advisers and agents to, maintain the confidentiality of all confidential information furnished to it by the other Party concerning its and its Subsidiaries businesses, operations, and financial positions and shall not use such information for any purpose except in furtherance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time, each Party shall promptly return or certify the destruction of all documents and copies thereof, and all work papers containing confidential information received from the other Party.   

8.8 Public Announcements.    

 Prior to the Effective Time, Province and LifePoint will each use their reasonable efforts to consult with each other as to the form and substance of any press release or other public disclosure materially related to this Agreement or any other transaction contemplated hereby before issuing any such press release or public disclosure; provided, that nothing in this Section 8.8 shall be deemed to prohibit any Party from making any disclosure which its counsel reasonably deems necessary or advisable in order to satisfy such Partys disclosure obligations imposed by Law or the requirements of any listing agreement with any applicable stock exchange.   

8.9 Tax Treatment.    

 With respect to the LifePoint Merger, this Agreement is a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Section 1.368-2(g) of the Treasury regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code. None of the Parties will take any action that is reasonably likely to cause (i) the LifePoint Merger to fail to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code or (ii) the Province Merger and the LifePoint Merger, when taken together, to fail to qualify as an exchange under Section 351 of the Internal Revenue Code. Further, each of the Parties will use its reasonable best efforts (including the provision of officers certificates containing reasonably requested representations) to permit counsel to render the opinions described in Section 9.2(i) and Section 9.3(d). None of the Parties shall take or cause to be taken any action which would cause to be untrue (or fail to take or cause not to be taken any action which would cause to be untrue) any representations set forth in officers certificates delivered to such counsel.   

8.10 State Takeover Laws.    

 Each of the Parties shall (i) take all necessary action to ensure that no Takeover Law or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any state Takeover Law or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, take all reasonable action to ensure that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be promptly consummated on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and    ##### 

  

    

otherwise to minimize the effect of, or challenge the validity
or applicability of, any applicable Takeover Law.   

8.11 Charter Provisions.    

 Each of the Parties shall take all necessary action to ensure that the entering into of this Agreement and the consummation of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not result in the grant of any rights to any Person under the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws or other governing instruments of any of the Parties or their respective Affiliates or restrict or impair the ability of Holding Company to vote, or otherwise to exercise the rights of a stockholder with respect to, shares of any Party or its respective Affiliates that may be directly or indirectly acquired or controlled by them.   

8.12 Rights Agreements.    

 (a) Province shall take all necessary action (including, if required, redeeming all of the outstanding Province Rights or amending or terminating Province Rights Agreement) so that the entering into of this Agreement and consummation of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not result in any Person becoming able to exercise any Province Rights under Province Rights Agreement or enabling or requiring Province Rights to be separated from the shares of Province Common Stock to which they are attached or to be triggered or to become exercisable.   

 (b) LifePoint shall take all necessary action (including, if required, redeeming all of the outstanding LifePoint Rights or amending or terminating LifePoint Rights Agreement) so that the entering into of this Agreement and consummation of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not result in any Person becoming able to exercise any LifePoint Rights under LifePoint Rights Agreement or enabling or requiring LifePoint Rights to be separated from the shares of LifePoint Common Stock to which they are attached or to be triggered or to become exercisable.   

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, Holding Company shall adopt and have in full force and legal effect a stockholder rights agreement (the " _Holding Company Rights Agreement_ " ) substantially identical in all material respects to the LifePoint Rights Agreement, and which exempts LifePoint as an "Acquiring Person" prior to the Effective Time, and shall take all such action as is necessary to declare, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a dividend of one (1) preferred share purchase right (a " _Holding Company Rights_ ") for each outstanding share of Holding Company Common Stock.   

8.13 Employee Benefits and Contracts.    

 For a period of 12 months following the Effective Time, Holding Company shall provide generally to officers and employees of the Province Entities employee benefits under employee benefit and welfare plans (other than incentive compensation plans, bonus plans, or stock option or other plans involving the potential issuance of Holding Company Common Stock), on terms and conditions which when taken as a whole are substantially comparable to either (i) those currently provided to such employees by the Province Entities or (ii) those currently provided by the LifePoint Entities to their similarly situated officers and employees. For purposes of    ##### 

  

    

eligibility, participation, vesting and pre-existing condition limitations
under the LifePoint Benefit Plans, as well as paid vacation and paid time off
purposes, the service of the employees of Province Entities prior to the
Effective Time shall be treated as service with a LifePoint Entity
participating in such LifePoint Benefit Plans to the extent service is taken
into consideration generally under such plans for similarly situated
employees of the LifePoint Entities. Holding Company also shall cause the
Province Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor in accordance
with their terms (i) all employment, severance, consulting and
other compensation Contracts disclosed in Section 8.13 of Province
Disclosure Memorandum to LifePoint between any Province Entity and any
current or former director, officer, or employee thereof, and (ii) all
provisions for vested benefits or other vested amounts earned or accrued
through the Effective Time under Province Benefit Plans, including the
payment of annual incentive bonuses to employees of Province not later than
the date LifePoint pays its equivalent incentive compensation for 2004 for
amounts accrued during the quarterly periods ended prior to the Effective
Time to the extent an employee is employed by the Province Surviving
Corporation or its Affiliates as of December 31, 2004 and at the time such
amounts are to be paid.   

8.14 Indemnification; Insurance.    

 (a) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Holding Company shall, and shall cause the Province Surviving Corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, the present and former directors and officers of Province Entities (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against all Liabilities arising out of actions or omissions arising out of the Indemnified Partys service or services as a director or officer of Province or, at Provinces request, of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware Law, Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and by Provinces Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws as in effect on the date of this Agreement, including provisions relating to advances of expenses incurred in the defense of any Litigation and whether or not Holding Company is insured against any such matter, but only to the extent permitted under and by the foregoing. Without limiting the foregoing, in any case in which approval by the Province Surviving Corporation is required to effectuate any indemnification, the Province Surviving Corporation shall direct, at the election of the Indemnified Party, that the determination of any such approval shall be made by independent counsel mutually agreed upon by Holding Company and the Indemnified Party.   

 (b) Holding Company shall, or shall cause the Province Surviving Corporation to, use its reasonable efforts (and Province shall cooperate prior to the Effective Time in these efforts) to maintain in effect for a period of six years after the Effective Time Provinces existing directors and officers liability insurance policy (provided that Holding Company or the Province Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor (i) policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are substantially no less advantageous or (ii) with the consent of Province given prior to the Effective Time, any other policy) with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred prior to the Effective Time and covering Persons who are currently covered by such insurance; provided, that neither Holding Company nor the Province Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to make aggregate annual premium payments for such six-year period in respect of such policy (or coverage replacing such policy) which exceed, for the portion related to Provinces directors and officers, 300% of the annual    ##### 

  

    

premium payments on Provinces current policy in effect as of the date of
this Agreement (the "Maximum Amount"). If the amount of the premiums
necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum
Amount, Holding Company or the Province Surviving Corporation shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the most advantageous policies of
directors and officers liability insurance obtainable for a premium equal
to the Maximum Amount.   

 (c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a) of this Section 8.14, upon learning of any such Liability or Litigation, shall promptly notify Holding Company and the Province Surviving Corporation thereof. In the event of any such Litigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) Holding Company or the Province Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and neither Holding Company nor the Province Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any such Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, except that if Holding Company and the Province Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or counsel for Holding Company advises that there are substantive issues which raise conflicts of interest between Holding Company or the Province Surviving Corporation, on the one hand, and the Indemnified Party, on the other hand, the Indemnified Party may retain counsel satisfactory to it and Holding Company and/or the Province Surviving Corporation, and Holding Company or the Province Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Party; provided, that Holding Company and the Province Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph (c) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction; (ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such Litigation; and (iii) neither Holding Company nor the Province Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent; provided, further, that neither Holding Company nor the Province Surviving Corporation shall have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law, and such determination shall have been final.   

 (d) If Holding Company or the Province Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger, or shall transfer all or substantially all of its Assets to any Person, then in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Holding Company or the Province Surviving Corporation shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 8.14.   

8.15 Affiliates.    

 Not less than twenty Business Days prior to the date of Province Stockholders Meeting, Province shall deliver to LifePoint a letter identifying all Persons who, in the reasonable judgment of Province, may be deemed, at the time this Agreement is submitted for adoption to the stockholders of Province, to be "affiliates" of Province for purposes of Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act and applicable SEC rules and regulations, and such list shall be updated thereafter as necessary to reflect changes from the date thereof. Province shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Person identified on such list to deliver to    ##### 

  

    

LifePoint, not later than ten Business Days prior to the Effective Time, a
written agreement substantially in the form attached as Exhibit C
hereto.   

8.16 Board of Directors.    

 Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Holding Company shall take the required action to appoint one member of the current Board of Directors of Province, as mutually agreed to by the Parties, to the Board of Directors of Holding Company as a Class III Director, to be effective immediately after the Effective Time, whose term will expire at the 2005 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Holding Company. It is the current intention of the Parties that such director shall be nominated for election at the 2005 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Holding Company.   

8.17 Alternative Financing.    

 LifePoint will use its commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy the conditions to funding contained in, and otherwise obtain and incur the financing contemplated by, the Commitment Letter. If Lender terminates the Commitment Letter or indicates to LifePoint that any condition to Lenders obligation to provide the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter is reasonably likely to be unavailable at the Closing, LifePoint will promptly notify Province of such fact and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from another source or sources, on substantially the same terms as those contained in the Commitment Letter (including the "flex" provisions), funding to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   

8.18 Rule 16(b).    

 LifePoint and Province shall take all such steps reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated hereby and any other acquisitions of equity securities of Holding Company (including derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by each individual who (a) is a director or officer of LifePoint or (b) on the Closing Date, will become a director or officer of Holding Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.   

8.19 Alternative Transaction Structure.    

 (a) Each Party hereto agrees that it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the tax opinions referred to in Sections 9.2(i) and 9.3(d). If for any reason the tax opinion referred to in Section 9.2(i) or Section 9.3(d) cannot be obtained on or prior to the Closing, the Parties shall, subject to the receipt of tax opinions as described below, implement a Forward Subsidiary Merger Transaction (as defined below) otherwise on the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement (preserving the economic, financial and business terms and conditions of this Agreement including, but not limited to, all rights, liabilities, obligations and covenants contained herein). A " _Forward Subsidiary Merger Transaction_ " means a transaction in which the aggregate value of the Province Net Stock Consideration is not less than forty percent (40%) of the Base and whereby the following shall occur: (i) Province shall be merged with and into an entity wholly owned or formed by LifePoint to effect the Forward Subsidiary Merger Transaction in accordance with the DGCL, whereupon the separate existence of Province shall cease and such wholly owned entity shall be the surviving entity and a wholly owned    ##### 

  

    

subsidiary of LifePoint and (ii) in lieu of shares of Holding Company Common
Stock, an equal number of shares of LifePoint Common Stock shall be issued as
the Province Stock Consideration, and conforming changes shall be made to
this Agreement. It shall be a condition precedent to the Forward Subsidiary
Merger Transaction that each of Province and LifePoint shall have received a
written opinion of its counsel, in form reasonably satisfactory to the
receiving party, to the effect that (i) the Forward Subsidiary Merger
Transaction will constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and (ii) the exchange in the Forward
Subsidiary Merger Transaction of Province Common Stock for LifePoint Common
Stock and cash will not give rise to gain recognition to the stockholders of
Province with respect to such exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes
except to the extent of any cash received (the " _Forward Subsidiary Merger
Opinions_ "). For purposes of this Section 8.19, the " _Province Net Stock
Consideration_ " shall be the aggregate Province Stock Consideration
excluding fractional shares for which cash is to be received pursuant to
Section 3.5, and the "Base" shall be the sum of (x) the aggregate fair market
value of Province Merger Consideration, (y) the fair market value of payments
to dissenting Province stockholders (deemed to be the aggregate fair market
value of the Pacer Merger Consideration that such dissenting
Pacer stockholders would have received if they had not elected to exercise
their appraisal rights) and (z) the fair market value of the Convertible
Notes. For purposes of this Section 8.19, the fair market value of Province
Stock Consideration shall be computed using the lesser of (A) the trading
price of Parent Common Stock on Nasdaq as of the Effective Time (or, if the
Effective Time is after the close of trading on Nasdaq for the date on which
the Effective Time occurs, the closing trading price on such date), and (B)
the average of the trading price determined under the foregoing clause (A)
and the opening trading price of Parent Common Stock on the date on which the
Effective Time occurs. The Parties agree that each will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the Forward Subsidiary Merger Opinions and will
provide reasonably requested representation letters.   

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if for any reason the tax opinion referred to in Section 9.2(i) or Section 9.3(d) cannot be obtained on or prior to the Closing and the Forward Subsidiary Merger Opinions cannot be obtained on or prior to the Closing, the Parties shall implement a Reverse Subsidiary Merger Transaction (as defined below) otherwise on the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement (preserving the economic, financial and business terms and conditions of this Agreement excluding the Tax consequences of the transaction, but including all other rights, liabilities, obligations and covenants contained herein). A " _Reverse Subsidiary Merger Transaction_ " means a transaction whereby the following shall occur: (i) an entity wholly owned or formed by LifePoint to effect the Reverse Subsidiary Merger Transaction shall be merged with and into Province in accordance with the DGCL, whereupon the separate existence of such wholly owned entity shall cease and Province shall be the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of LifePoint and (ii) in lieu of shares of Holding Company Common Stock, an equal number of shares of LifePoint Common Stock shall be issued as the Province Stock Consideration, and appropriate conforming changes shall be made to this Agreement.    #####

notice to LifePoint and a new three Business Day period under this proviso);
(C) Province is, and at all times has been, in compliance in all material
respects with Section 8.2 and (D) (1) at or prior to such termination,

 The respective representations, warranties, obligations, covenants, and agreements of the Parties shall not survive the Effective Time except Sections 10.3, 8.13 and 8.14 and ARTICLE 1, ARTICLE 2, ARTICLE 3 and ARTICLE 11.   

ARTICLE 11 MISCELLANEOUS    

11.1 Definitions.

11.9 Governing Law; Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial.    

 Regardless of any conflict of law or choice of law principles that might otherwise apply, the Parties agree that this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in all respects in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. The Parties all expressly agree and acknowledge that the State of Delaware has a reasonable relationship to the Parties and/or this Agreement. The Parties hereby irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and the Federal courts of the United States of America located in the State of Delaware solely in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any Litigation for the interpretation or enforcement of this Agreement or of any such document, that it is not subject thereto or that such Litigation may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the Parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to such Litigation shall be heard and determined in such a Delaware State or Federal court. The Parties hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over such Parties solely for such purpose and over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such Litigation in the manner provided in this Section 11.9 or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient service thereof. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that any controversy which may arise under this Agreement is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each such Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such Party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any Litigation directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each Party certifies and acknowledges that (i) no Representative of any other Party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other Party would not, in the event of Litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver, (ii) each Party understands and has considered the implications of this waiver, (iii) each Party makes this waiver voluntarily, and (iv) each Party has been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 11.9.    #####

11.11 Captions; Articles and Sections.    

 The captions contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and are not part of this Agreement. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to particular Articles or Sections shall mean and refer to the referenced Articles and Sections of this Agreement.   

11.12 Interpretations.    

 Neither this Agreement nor any uncertainty or ambiguity herein shall be construed or resolved against any Party, whether under any rule of construction or otherwise. No Party to this Agreement shall be considered the draftsman. The Parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement has been reviewed, negotiated, and accepted by all Parties and their attorneys and shall be construed and interpreted according to the ordinary meaning of the words used so as fairly to accomplish the purposes and intentions of all Parties hereto.   

11.13 Enforcement of Agreement.    

 The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement was not performed in accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached.

11.14 Severability.    

 Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction.
