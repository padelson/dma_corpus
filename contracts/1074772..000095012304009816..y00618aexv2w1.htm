previously representing shares of LifePoint Common Stock for new certificates
is required by Law, or is requested by any holder thereof, Holding Company will

distributions without interest) and any undelivered dividends and cash payments
payable hereunder (without interest) shall be delivered and paid with respect
to each share represented by such Province Certificate, less any required

action in respect thereof on the part of Holding Company, LifePoint Merger Sub
and Province Merger Sub. This Agreement represents a legal, valid, and binding

insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or similar Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors&#146; rights generally and except that the availability of
the equitable remedy of specific performance or injunctive relief is subject to
the discretion of the court before which any proceeding may be brought).

Stock upon consummation of the Mergers, when issued in accordance with the

Company Common Stock to be issued in exchange for shares of Province Common

Delaware and the Federal courts of the United States of America located in the
State of Delaware solely in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of
the provisions of this Agreement and of the documents referred to in this
Agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby
waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any Litigation for the
interpretation or enforcement of this Agreement or of any such document, that
it is not subject thereto or that such Litigation may not be brought or is not
maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate or
that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such
courts, and the Parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims with respect
to such Litigation shall be heard and determined in such a Delaware State or
Federal court. The
Parties hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over such
Parties solely for such purpose and over the subject matter of such dispute and
agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such
Litigation in the manner provided in this Section&nbsp;11.9 or in such other manner
as may be permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient service thereof. Each
Party acknowledges and agrees that any controversy which may arise under this
Agreement is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues, and therefore
each such Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such
Party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any Litigation directly or
indirectly arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each Party certifies and acknowledges that (i)
no Representative of any other Party has represented, expressly or otherwise,
that such other Party would not, in the event of Litigation, seek to enforce
the foregoing waiver, (ii)&nbsp;each Party understands and has considered the
implications of this waiver, (iii)&nbsp;each Party makes this waiver voluntarily,
and (iv)&nbsp;each Party has been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among
other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section&nbsp;11.9.

broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so
broad as is enforceable.
