the dollar amount of the Assumed Sales Rebate Liabilities as of the
Adjustment Determination Effective Time determined in accordance with GAAP
and the Net Working Capital Guidelines (the " _Estimated Rebate Amount_ ").
In connection with the delivery of the Estimated Net Working Capital
Statement, Sellers shall deliver to U.S. Buyer a certificate executed by the
Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer or Controller of Tronox
Incorporated certifying that the Estimated Net Working Capital Statement was
prepared and calculated in conformance with the Net Working Capital
Guidelines. The Estimated Net Working Capital Statement and the Estimated
Rebate Statement shall be subject to the review of U.S. Buyer and, during the
period of such review prior to the Closing Date, (1) Sellers shall give U.S.
Buyer and its Representatives reasonable access to all Records, facilities
and personnel of the Business as reasonably necessary to undertake such
review and (2) U.S. Buyer may in good faith dispute any items set forth on
the Estimated Net Working Capital Statement (or specific calculations or
methods contemplated thereby) or the Estimated Rebate Statement. If U.S. Buyer
in good faith disputes the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount or the
Estimated Rebate Amount, as applicable, then U.S. Buyer and Sellers shall
reasonably cooperate and negotiate in good faith to resolve any dispute
regarding the Estimated Net Working Amount or the Estimated Rebate Amount, as
applicable, prior to the Closing (the results of any such resolution to be
reflected on a new Estimated Net Working Capital Statement or Estimated
Rebate Statement, as applicable, which shall be considered the Estimated Net
Working Capital Statement or Estimated Rebate Statement, as applicable, for
all further purposes); _provided_  that if any item of dispute regarding the
Estimated Net Working Capital Statement or Estimated Rebate Statement, as
applicable, is not resolved by agreement in writing between U.S. Buyer and
Sellers on the date that is at least two Business Days prior to the Closing,
then Sellers estimate of such disputed item shall be deemed final for
purposes of Closing absent manifest error; _provided_ that the Net Working
Capital Escrow Amount shall be increased by the amount of any aggregate
unresolved difference between Sellers estimate and U.S. Buyers estimate of
the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount and/or the Estimated Rebate Amount.
To the extent that the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount exceeds the
Target Net Working Capital Amount, the Initial Purchase Price payable at the
Closing shall be increased by the amount of the excess, and to the extent
that the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount is less than the Target Net
Working Capital Amount, the Initial Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
amount of such deficiency. To the extent the Estimated Rebate Amount is
greater than $0, the Initial Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount of
the Estimated Rebate Amount.

  

### 

  

### (iv) _Post-Closing Net Working Capital Statement_. Within thirty Business
Days after the Closing Date, U.S. Buyer shall cause to be prepared and
delivered to Sellers (A) a statement (the " _Post-Closing Net Working Capital
Statement_ ") setting forth the Net Working Capital as of the Adjustment
Determination Effective Time, and a worksheet showing the components and
calculation thereof as of the Adjustment

  



        
   

  



  

### Determination Effective Time as well as supporting documentation for such
Post-Closing Net Working Capital Statement and (B) a statement (the " _Post-
Closing Rebate Statement_ ") setting forth the dollar amount of the Assumed
Sales Rebate Liabilities as of the Adjustment Determination Effective Time
determined in accordance with GAAP (the " _Rebate Amount_ "). In connection
with the delivery of the Post-Closing Net Working Capital Statement, U.S.
Buyer shall deliver to Sellers a certificate executed by the Chief Financial
Officer of Guarantor certifying that the Post-Closing Net Working Capital
Statement was prepared and calculated in conformance with the Net Working
Capital Guidelines.

  

### 

  

### (v) _Determination of Conclusive Net Working Capital Statement_. Sellers
will have fifteen Business Days following the receipt of the Post-Closing Net
Working Capital Statement and the Post-Closing Rebate Statement to review the
Post-Closing Net Working Capital Statement and the Post-Closing Rebate
Statement and, during such time, (A) U.S. Buyer shall give Sellers and their
Representatives reasonable access to all Records, facilities and personnel of
U.S. Buyer (including the Business) as is reasonably necessary to undertake
such review and (B) Sellers may dispute any items set forth on the Post-
Closing Net Working Capital Statement or the Post-Closing Rebate Statement,
as applicable (including the specific calculations and methods contemplated
thereby).  Unless Sellers deliver written notice(s) to U.S. Buyer of
dispute thereof on or prior to the fifteenth Business Day after Sellers
receipt of the Post-Closing Net Working Capital Statement, Sellers will be
deemed to have accepted and agreed to the Post-Closing Net Working Capital
Statement and such statement (or specific calculations or methods
contemplated thereby) will be final, binding and conclusive. Unless Sellers
deliver written notice(s) to U.S. Buyer of a dispute of the Rebate Amount
prior to the fifteenth Business Day after Sellers receipt of the Post-
Closing Rebate Statement, Sellers will be deemed to have accepted and agreed
to the Rebate Amount and such Rebate Amount will be final, binding
and conclusive. If Sellers notify U.S. Buyer in writing of disputed items
contained in the Post-Closing Net Working Capital Statement (or specific
calculations or methods contemplated thereby) or that Sellers dispute the
Rebate Amount within such fifteen Business Day-period, then for ten Business
Days following delivery of such notice by Sellers to U.S. Buyer (the "
_Resolution Period_ "), U.S. Buyer and Sellers shall attempt in good faith to
resolve their differences with respect to the disputed items (the " _Disputed
Items_ "). Any resolution by U.S. Buyer and Sellers during the Resolution
Period as to any Disputed Items shall be set forth in writing and will be
final, binding and conclusive. If U.S. Buyer and Sellers do not resolve
all Disputed Items by the end of the Resolution Period, then all Disputed
Items remaining in dispute shall be submitted within ten calendar days after
the expiration of the Resolution Period to an international independent
accounting firm mutually acceptable to U.S. Buyer and Sellers (the " _Neutral
Arbitrator_ "). The Neutral Arbitrator shall act as an arbitrator to
determine only those Disputed Items remaining in dispute as of the end of the
Resolution Period. In resolving such Disputed Items, the Neutral Arbitrator
may not assign a value to any Disputed Item greater than the greatest value
for such Disputed Item claimed by any Party or less than the lowest value for
such Disputed Item claimed by any Party upon presentment to the Neutral
Arbitrator. All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be
performed by the Neutral Arbitrator will be allocated between U.S. Buyer and
Sellers in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of the Disputed
Items so submitted to the Neutral Arbitrator that is

  



        
   

  



  

### unsuccessfully disputed by each such Party (as finally determined by the
Neutral Arbitrator) bears to the total amount of such Disputed Items so
submitted. In addition, U.S. Buyer and Sellers shall submit to the Neutral
Arbitrator any supporting materials and calculations relating to the Disputed
Items. In the event U.S. Buyer or Sellers shall participate in
teleconferences or meetings with or make presentations to the Neutral
Arbitrator, the other Party shall be entitled to participate in such
teleconferences, meetings or presentations except as otherwise required by
the Neutral Arbitrator. U.S. Buyer and Sellers shall use their reasonable
best efforts to cause the Neutral Arbitrator to deliver to U.S. Buyer and
Sellers a written determination (such determination to include a work sheet
setting forth all material calculations and methods used in arriving at such
determination) of the Disputed Items submitted to the Neutral
Arbitrator within ten calendar days of receipt of such Disputed Items, which
determination will be final, binding and conclusive and upon which judgment
may be entered. The final, binding and conclusive Post-Closing Net Working
Capital Statement based either upon agreement or deemed agreement by U.S.
Buyer and Sellers or the written determination delivered by the Neutral
Arbitrator in accordance with this _Section 2(h)(v)_ will be the "
_Conclusive Net Working Capital Statement_." The final, binding and conclusive
Rebate Amount based either upon agreement or deemed agreement by U.S. Buyer
and Sellers or the written determination delivered by the Neutral Arbitrator
in accordance with this _Section 2(h)(v)_ will be the " _Conclusive Rebate
Amount_."

  

### 

  

### (vi) _Post-Closing Adjustment_.  If (a) the Net Working Capital on the
Conclusive Net Working Capital Statement plus the Estimated Rebate Amount
exceeds (b) the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount plus the Conclusive
Rebate Amount, then U.S. Buyer shall pay Sellers the amount of such excess by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to Sellers Accounts. If (a) the
Estimated Net Working Capital Amount plus the Conclusive Rebate Amount
exceeds (b) the Net Working Capital on the Conclusive Net Working Capital
Statement plus the Estimated Rebate Amount, then Sellers shall, and Sellers
and U.S. Buyer shall provide written instructions to the Escrow Agent to,
remit to U.S. Buyer the amount of such excess out of the Net Working Capital
Escrow Amount and, in the event such excess, if any, exceeds the Net Working
Capital Escrow Amount held in the Escrow Account, then Sellers shall pay U.S.
Buyer the amount of such excess by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to a bank account designated by U.S. Buyer in writing at least three
Business Days prior to the date of such payment. All payments to be
made pursuant to this _Section 2(h)(vi)_ shall be made no later than the
second Business Day following the date on which U.S. Buyer and Sellers agree,
or are deemed to have agreed to, or the Neutral Arbitrator delivers,
the Conclusive Net Working Capital Statement and the Conclusive Rebate
Amount. Following the determination of the Conclusive Net Working Capital
Statement and the Conclusive Rebate Amount and the payment of any amount
required pursuant to this _Section 2(h)(vi)_, the Parties shall cause the
Escrow Agent to remit to Sellers the remaining balance, if any, of the Net
Working Capital Escrow Amount remaining under the Net Working Capital Escrow
Agreement ( _i.e._ , the remaining Net Working Capital Escrow Amount, if any,
together with all accrued investment income or interest on the Net Working
Capital Escrow Amount), all in accordance with the provisions of the Net
Working Capital Escrow Agreement.

  



         
 

  



  

(i) _Allocation_. Within thirty calendar days after the Closing Date, Buyers
shall prepare an allocation of the Purchase Price as determined for
applicable Tax purposes among the Acquired Assets, the Target Interests, the
Henderson Lease Agreement and the Acquired Tiwest Joint Venture Interests in
accordance with Section 1060 of the IRC and the Treasury
regulations thereunder (and any similar provision of United States state or
local or non-United States law, as appropriate).  Sellers shall have thirty
calendar days to review and consent to such allocation which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Buyers and Sellers
shall report, act and file Tax Returns (including Internal Revenue
Service Form 8594 and any other applicable non-United States Tax Returns
required to be filed in connection with any asset or equity sale) in all
respects and for all purposes consistent with any agreed upon allocation.
None of Buyers or Sellers shall take any position (whether in audits, Tax
Returns or otherwise) which is inconsistent with such allocation unless
required to do so by applicable law.

  



  

(j) _Non-Assignment of Assumed Contracts_.  Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, (i) this Agreement shall not constitute an
agreement to assign any Contract if, after giving effect to the provisions of
sections 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, an attempted assignment thereof,
without obtaining a required consent, waiver, confirmation, novation or
approval of any third party, would constitute a breach thereof or in any way
negatively affect the rights of Sellers or either Buyer, as the assignee of
such Contract, and (ii) no breach of this Agreement shall have occurred by
virtue of such non-assignment unless the failure to assign any Contracts
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Acquired Business. If, after giving effect to
the provisions of sections 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, such
consent, waiver, confirmation, novation or approval is required but not
obtained prior to the Closing, Sellers shall use their reasonable best
efforts to obtain as expeditiously as possible the written consent, waiver,
confirmation, novation or approval, as applicable, of the other party or
parties to such Contract necessary for the assignment thereof to either Buyer
post-Closing. Unless and until any such consent, waiver, confirmation,
novation or approval is obtained, Seller shall reasonably cooperate with
Buyers in any reasonable arrangement satisfactory to Buyers designed to
provide to Buyers the claims, rights, benefits and obligations of or under
any such Contract, including by means of any subcontracting, sublicensing or
subleasing arrangement and enforcement for the benefit of Buyers, with Buyers
assuming and agreeing to pay Sellers obligations, of any and all rights of
Sellers against a third party thereto. In such event, (i) Sellers will hold
in trust for and promptly pay to the applicable Buyer, when received, all
moneys received by them under any such Contract or any claim, right or
benefit arising thereunder and (ii) Buyers will promptly pay, perform or
discharge, when due, any and all obligations and Liabilities arising
thereunder. Notwithstanding any other provision in this _Section
2(j)_, nothing in this _Section 2(j)_ shall (A) require any Seller to make
any more than immaterial expenditure or incur any more than
immaterial obligation on its own or on either Buyers behalf unless one of
Buyers agrees to fully reimburse such Seller promptly or (B) prohibit any
Seller from ceasing operations or winding up its affairs following the
Closing. Contracts covered by this _Section 2(j)_ shall not be deemed to
constitute Excluded Assets solely by virtue of this _Section 2(j)_.

  



  

3. _Sellers  Representations and Warranties_.  Subject to Bankruptcy Court approval of this Agreement, evidenced by entry of the Sale Order, Sellers severally but not jointly represent and warrant to Buyers that the statements contained in this _Section 3_ are true and correct, except (x) as disclosed in the Tronox Filed SEC Documents filed on or after March 14,

Sellers are under no obligation or liability with respect to accepting
returns of Inventory in the possession of their customers other than in the
Ordinary Course of Business. The Inventory is in good and
merchantable condition in all material respects, is suitable and usable in
all material respects for the purposes for which it is intended and is in a
condition in all material respects such that it can be sold in the Ordinary
Course of Business. Except for fluctuations and variations in Inventory due
to normal business factors, including production schedules and market demand
(including seasonal factors affecting the same), the Inventory comprises
broadly the same mix of types and grades of products as are required for the
trading requirements of the Acquired Business, and the Inventory has been
maintained at levels which in the Ordinary Course of Business have been
appropriate to meet the then current level of sales in the Acquired Business.

(iv) Sellers have made available to Buyers accurate and complete copies of
(A) each of the Tiwest Joint Venture Documents to which any of Sellers, the
Target Companies, their Subsidiaries or Tiwest are, as at the date hereof, a
party, and (B) all Liens created under the Tiwest Joint Venture Documents
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any cross charges over the Tiwest
Joint Venture Interests and any Liens that the Tiwest Joint Venture
Participants or any of their Subsidiaries may have with respect to the
accounts receivable of Tronox Pigments Bahama Islands) and the Exxaro Joint
Venture Interest.

  



  

(v) All of the Owned Real Property in which Tronox Australia has an interest

(vi) To Sellers Knowledge, (A) no Tiwest Joint Venture Participant has
leased, licensed or otherwise granted to any Person the right to occupy any
of the property owned by Tronox Australia and the applicable Tiwest Joint

Documents, the Tiwest Joint Venture Participants are not a party to an
agreement or option to purchase any real property, or any interest in real

(vii) To Sellers Knowledge, Tiwest does not (A) lease any land, buildings,

(ix) Other than pursuant to that certain Share Sale Agreement, dated May 29,

Australia has no Liability to any Person in connection with the sale by it of
one-half of the equity interests held by it in Tiwest Sales.

  



  

(s) _Conduct in the Ordinary Course of Business; Absence of Certain Changes,
Events and Conditions_.  Since September 30, 2008, (i) there has not been a
Material Adverse Effect on the Acquired Business, and (ii) the Acquired
Business has been conducted in the Ordinary Course of Business, except as may
have been authorized by the Bankruptcy Court in connection with or as a
result of U.S. Sellers or their Affiliates status as debtors under Chapter
11 of the Bankruptcy Code.

  



  

(t) _Tax_. Each Seller with respect to its Acquired Assets, each Target
Company and Tiwest has timely filed all Tax Returns with the appropriate
Taxing Authority in accordance with all applicable laws, and all such Tax
Returns are correct and complete in all material respects. All Taxes due
from each Seller with respect to its Acquired Assets, each Target Company and
Tiwest have been timely paid. There are no Liens with respect to any
Acquired Assets, any Target Company or Tiwest or their assets as a result of
failure to pay Taxes. No investigation, audit, proceeding or
other examination by any Taxing Authority is in progress, pending or to
Knowledge of Seller threatened with respect to any Tax Return filed by, or
Taxes relating to any Seller with respect to its Acquired Assets, each Target
Company Tiwest or the Tiwest Joint Venture. No agreement, consent,
clearance, or other Tax ruling or agreement has been executed or entered into
relating to Taxes by any Seller in connection with any Acquired Asset, any
Target Company or Tiwest, including any IRS private letter rulings or
comparable rulings of any Taxing Authority and closing agreements pursuant to
Section 7121 of the IRC or any similar law. Each Target Company has withheld

  



        
   

  



  

and timely remitted all material Taxes required to have been withheld and
remitted in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee,
independent contractor, creditor, stockholder, or other third party. No
dispute or claim concerning any Tax Liability of any Seller with respect to
its Acquired Assets, any Target Company or Tiwest has been proposed,
threatened or claimed by any Taxing Authority. No Seller with respect to its
Acquired Assets, no Target Company or Tiwest has waived any statute of
limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with
respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency. No Seller with respect to its
Acquired Assets, no Target Company or Tiwest is a party to any Tax
allocation, sharing, or similar arrangement or agreement (whether or not in
writing). No Target Company or Tiwest is required to include in income any
adjustment in its current or in any future taxable period by reason of a
change in accounting method; nor, to the Knowledge of Sellers, has a Taxing
Authority proposed or is considering proposing, any change in accounting
method. No Target Company or Tiwest is a party to any agreement, Contract, or
arrangement that (individually or in the aggregate) could reasonably be
expected to give rise to the payment of any compensation (whether in cash or
property, including stock or other equity interests) that would not be
deductible in full when paid or accrued. Each of Tronox LLC,
Tronox Worldwide, Tronox Netherlands, Tronox Holland and Tronox Pigments
Bahama Islands is currently disregarded for U.S. federal income tax purposes
and, except as set forth in _Section 3(t) of the Disclosure Schedule_, has
been since the date of its formation. Each of Tronox Incorporated and Tronox
Australia is, and has always been since the date of its formation, properly
treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Tronox Holland
has not in the current fiscal year or in any of the preceding five fiscal
years claimed, utilized or requested exemptions of deferrals in relation to
Tax, including exemptions or deferrals of Tax relating to reorganizations or
mergers.

  



  

(u) _Target Companies; Books and Records_.

  



  

(i) (A) No administrator, receiver or administrative receiver or any
equivalent officer has been appointed in respect of any Target Company or in
respect of any part of the assets or undertakings of any Target Company, and
(B) no petition has been presented, no order has been made, no resolution has
been passed and no meeting has been convened for the winding up of any Target
Company or for an administration order or the equivalent in the relevant
jurisdiction of incorporation of any Target Company.

  



  

(ii) The statutory books (including registers and minute books) of each
Target Company are accurate and complete in all material respects.

  



  

(iii) The Products are being, or have been, pre-registered and registered
within the meaning of the Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006 concerning the
Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals ("
_REACH_ ") of the European Union and all rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, and do and will comply with all statutory and EC requirements and
regulations relating to the Products or to the sale of the Products in the
European Union.

  



  

(v) _Insurance_. _Section 3(v) of the Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth as of
the date hereof a true and complete list of all insurance policies applicable
to the Acquired Business which are in the name of any of Sellers or Target
Companies (the " _Insurance Policies_ "), together with the

  



        
   

  



  

name of the insurer, policy number, type of coverage, limits, date of issue
and applicable business unit deductible.  All premiums due and payable with
respect to Sellers material insurance policies which provide coverage
relating to the Acquired Assets or Assumed Liabilities and the operations of
the Target Companies, the Tiwest Joint Venture and Tiwest have been paid in
full (including with proceeds of any financing or credit arrangements which
may exist), and no Seller nor any Target Company nor, to Sellers Knowledge,
Tiwest has received a written claim under such policies which remains
outstanding as of the date hereof. All such policies are in full force
and effect, and Sellers and Target Companies have complied in all material
respects with the terms thereof. To the Knowledge of Sellers, there exists
no event, occurrence, condition or act (including the purchase of the
Acquired Assets hereunder) that, with the giving of notice, the lapse of time
or the happening of any other event or condition, would entitle any insurer
to terminate or cancel any Insurance Policy.

  



  

(w) _Brokers  Fees_.  None of Sellers has entered into any Contract to pay
any fees or commissions to any broker, finder or agent with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement for which either Buyer could
become liable or obligated to pay.

  



  

(x) _Information Technology_.

  



  

(i) There are no known defects in the IT Systems which could reasonably be
expected to have a materially detrimental effect on the conduct of the
Acquired Business.

  



  

(ii) In the last twenty-four months, there have been no failures, breakdowns,
continued substandard performance or other adverse events affecting the IT
Systems that have caused, or reasonably could have been expected to cause,
and, to Sellers Knowledge, there are no circumstances that could reasonably
be expected to cause, the substantial disruption or interruption in or to the
use of such IT Systems or the conduct of the Acquired Business.

  



  

(y) _Products Liability_.  To Sellers Knowledge, there are no Liabilities
with respect to any product liability claim that relates to any product
manufactured and sold by Sellers, Target Companies, Tiwest or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to others in the conduct of the Business.

  



  

(z) _Foreign Corrupt Practices Act_.  None of Sellers or the Target Companies
or, to the Knowledge of Sellers, Tiwest, or to the Knowledge of Sellers, any
of their respective Representatives, has made, offered, promised, authorized,
requested, received or accepted, with respect to the Acquired Assets, the
Acquired Business, or any other matter which is the subject of this
Agreement, any payment, gift, promise or other advantage, whether directly or
indirectly through any other Person, to or for the use or benefit of any
Person, where such payment, gift, promise or advantage would violate (i) the
FCPA, (ii) the principles set out in the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development Convention Combating Bribery of Foreign Public
Officials in International Business Transactions, or (iii) any other similar
or equivalent anti-corruption and/or anti-bribery law of any jurisdiction
applicable to Sellers or the Target Companies. Sellers further represent and
warrant that none of Sellers nor their respective Affiliates has made any
such offer, payment, gift, promise, or advantage to or for the use or benefit
of any Person if it knew, had a firm belief, or was aware that there was a
high probability

  



        
   

  



  

that such Person would use such offer, payment, gift, promise, or advantage
in violation of the preceding sentence.

  



  

(aa) _No Other Representations or Warranties; Disclosed Materials_. Except
for the representations and warranties contained in this _Section 3_ (as
qualified by the Disclosed Materials), neither Sellers nor any other Person
makes (and neither Buyer is relying upon) any other express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to Sellers, the Target Companies, the
Tiwest Joint Venture, the Tiwest Joint Venture Participants, the Business,
the Acquired Business, the Acquired Assets (including the value, condition or
use of any Acquired Asset or any asset of any Target Company), the Assumed
Liabilities or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Sellers
disclaim any other representations or warranties not contained in this
_Section 3_, whether made by Sellers, any Affiliate of Sellers or any of
their respective officers, directors, employees, agents or Representatives.
Except for the representations and warranties contained in this _Section 3_
(as qualified by the Disclosed Materials), each Seller (i) expressly
disclaims and negates any representation or warranty, express or implied, at
common law, by statute or otherwise, relating to the condition of the
Acquired Assets or the assets of the Target Companies (including any implied
or expressed warranty of title, merchantability or fitness for a particular
purpose, or of the probable success or profitability of the ownership, use or
operation of the Target Companies, use or operation of the Tiwest Joint
Venture, the Business, the Acquired Business or the Acquired Assets by Buyers
after the Closing), and (ii) disclaims all liability and responsibility for
any representation, warranty, projection, forecast, statement or information
made, communicated or furnished (orally or in writing) to either Buyer or any
of their respective Affiliates or Representatives (including any opinion,
information, projection or advice that may have been or may be provided to
either Buyer by any director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or
Representative of any Seller or any of their Affiliates). The disclosure of
any matter or item in the Disclosed Materials shall not be deemed to
constitute an acknowledgment that any such matter is required to be disclosed
or is material or that such matter would or would reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect.

or any Related Agreement to which either Buyer or Guarantor is a party, nor

an "accredited investor" as defined in Regulation D promulgated by the SEC
under the Securities Act. Each Buyer acknowledges that it is informed as to
the risks of the transactions contemplated hereby and of ownership of the

whatsoever, express or implied, beyond those expressly given by Sellers in
_Section 3_ (as amended, supplemented and modified by the Disclosed
Materials), and each of Buyers and Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that,
except for the representations and warranties contained therein, the Acquired
Assets and the Acquired Business are being transferred on a "where is" and,

Venture, the Acquired Business, the Business or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement not expressly set forth in this Agreement, and none of
Sellers, any of their Affiliates or any other Person will have or be subject
to any liability to either Buyer, Guarantor or any other Person resulting

information, including any confidential memoranda distributed on behalf of
Sellers relating to the Business, the Target Companies, Tiwest, the Tiwest
Joint Venture, the information made available to either Buyer in the Data
Room or any other publications or data room information provided to either

sophisticated entity that was advised by knowledgeable counsel and financial
and other advisors and hereby acknowledges that it has conducted to its
satisfaction, its own independent investigation and analysis of the Business
(including its financial condition), the Target Companies, Tiwest or the
Tiwest Joint Venture, the Acquired Assets and the Assumed Liabilities and, in
making the determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, each of Buyers and Guarantor has relied solely on the results
of its own independent investigation and the express representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

(j) _GST Law_. Australia Buyer will be registered under the GST Law as of the
Closing.

  



  

5. _Pre-Closing Covenants_.  The Parties and, where specified, Guarantor agree as follows with respect to the period between the execution of this Agreement and the Closing (except as otherwise expressly stated to apply to a different period):

  



  

(a) _Reasonable Best Efforts; Cooperation_.  Subject to Sellers right prior
to entry of the Sale Order to solicit and consummate a Competing Transaction
or a Restructuring Transaction to the extent permitted by _Section 5(l)_ and
except as otherwise provided in _Section 5(b)_, each of the Parties and
Guarantor will use its reasonable best efforts to take all action and to do
all things necessary in order to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement promptly (but in any case on or
prior to the End Date) (including satisfaction, but not waiver, of the
conditions to the obligations of the Parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby set forth in _Section 7_ and, in the case of Sellers and
the Target Companies, by providing commercially reasonable assistance and
cooperation in connection with Buyers efforts to seek debt financing for a
portion of the Initial Purchase Price (the " _Debt Financing_ ")).  Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject to the provisions of
_Section 5(b)_, (i) Sellers shall not take any action, or permit any of
their Subsidiaries to take any action, to materially diminish the ability of
Buyers or of Guarantor to consummate, or to materially delay Buyers or
Guarantors ability to consummate, the transactions contemplated hereby,
including taking any action that is intended or would reasonably be expected
to result in any of the conditions to Buyers or Guarantors obligations to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby set forth in _Section 7(a)_
to not be satisfied, and (ii) Buyers and Guarantor shall not take any action,
or permit any of their Subsidiaries to take any action, to materially
diminish the

  



        
   

  



  

ability of Sellers to consummate, or to materially delay Sellers ability to
consummate, the transactions contemplated hereby, including taking any action
that is intended or would reasonably be expected to result in any of the
conditions to Sellers obligations to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby set forth in _Section 7(b)_ to not be satisfied.

  



  

(b) _Notices and Consents_.

  



  

### (i) Each Seller will give, and use reasonable best efforts to cause
Tiwest to give, any notices to third parties, and each Seller will use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain, and use reasonably best efforts to cause
Tiwest to obtain, any third party consents or sublicenses, in connection with
the matters referred to in _Section 5(b)(i) of the Disclosure Schedule_.

  

### 

  

### (ii) In accordance with the terms and conditions of the Tiwest Joint
Venture Documents, promptly following the entry of the Sale Order (or at such
earlier time as Tronox Australia reasonably believes that it is required to
do so), Tronox Australia shall deliver to the Tiwest Joint Venture
Participants a notice of an offer to purchase the Tiwest Joint Venture
Interests at the Tiwest Amount and otherwise in accordance with the Tiwest
Joint Venture Documents.  Tronox Australia shall give Australia Buyer a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such notice and offer in
advance of such delivery to the Tiwest Joint Venture Participants and
incorporate Australia Buyers reasonable comments thereto.

  

### 

  

### (iii) Subject to, in the case of Sellers, the Bankruptcy Code and the
orders of the Bankruptcy Court, each of Sellers and Australia Buyer will
give, and Sellers shall use reasonable best efforts to cause Tiwest to give,

obtain, and Sellers shall use reasonable best efforts to cause Tiwest to
obtain, any authorizations, consents, and approvals of Governmental Entities
(A) referred to in _Section 5(b)(iii) of the Disclosure Schedule_ or (B) as
are otherwise necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
(other than matters related to the HSR Act or any other
Competition/Investment Laws or filings with the Bankruptcy Court which, in
each case, are exclusively governed by _Sections 5(b)(iv)_ through _(vi)_
and _Section 5(c)_). With respect to Sellers and Buyers obligations in
clause (B) of the preceding sentence, the Parties will reasonably cooperate
with one another (1) in promptly determining whether any filings are required
to be or should be made or consents, approvals, permits or authorizations are
required to be or should be obtained under any other federal, state or
foreign law in addition to those contemplated by _Section 5(b)(iv)_ of this
Agreement and (2) in promptly making any such filings, furnishing information
required in connection therewith and seeking to obtain timely any such
consents, permits, authorizations, approvals or waivers.

  

### 

  

### (iv) The Parties and Guarantor shall (A) make or cause to be made all
filings required of each of them or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates under the HSR Act with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby within ten Business Days following the entry
of the Bidding Procedures Order and make other required filings pursuant to
the Competition/Investment Laws listed on _Section 5(b)(iv) of the
Disclosure Schedule_ with respect to this Agreement and the transactions 

  

### 

  

### 65   

     
   

  

### 

  

### contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable after entry of the Bidding
Procedures Order and (B) supply any additional information and documentary
materials that may be requested from the United States Federal Trade
Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice (the " _Antitrust Division_ ") or any other
Governmental Entity pursuant to the HSR Act or other Competition/Investment
Laws, and to use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all
actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination
of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act or obtain the relevant
approvals under such Competition/Investment Laws as soon as practicable after
the entry of the Sale Order (and in any event prior to the End Date). Buyers
shall pay the filing fees required under the HSR Act and any applicable
Competition/Investment Law in connection with such filings.

  

### 

  

### (v) Buyers and Guarantor, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other
hand, shall (A) promptly notify the other party of any communication to that
party from any Governmental Entity in respect of any filing, investigation or
inquiry concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (B) if practicable, permit the other party the opportunity to
review in advance all the information (to exclude voluminous document
production in response to a request from a Governmental Entity pursuant to
the HSR Act or other Competition/Investment Laws, although select documents
of interest will be exchanged) relating to Sellers and their
respective Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or Buyers and their respective
Affiliates, on the other hand, as the case may be, that appears in any filing
made with, or written materials submitted to, any Governmental Entity in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and incorporate the other partys reasonable comments; (C) not
participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental
Entity in respect of any filing, investigation, or inquiry concerning this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless it
consults with the other party in advance, and to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend; and (D)
furnish the other party with copies of all correspondences, filings, and
written communications (to exclude voluminous document production in response
to a request from a Governmental Entity pursuant to the HSR Act or other
Competition/Investment Laws, although select documents of interest will be
exchanged) between them and their Subsidiaries and Representatives, on the
one hand, and any Governmental Entity or its respective staff, on the other
hand, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that any materials may be redacted
before being provided to the other party (1) to remove references concerning
the valuation of Buyers, Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates, (2)
to exclude financing arrangements, (3) as necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements, and (4) as necessary to address reasonable
privilege or confidentiality issues. Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyers
and Guarantor, on the other hand, may, as each deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided
to the other under this _Section 5(b)(v)_ as "outside counsel only"
or otherwise in conformance with the joint defense agreement entered into by
the Parties and Guarantor. Such designated materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel and any
retained consultants or experts of the recipient and will not be disclosed by
such outside counsel

  



        
   

  



  

### to employees, officers or directors of the recipient, unless express
written permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials
(Sellers, on the one hand, or Buyers and Guarantor, on the other hand, as the
case may be). Each of the Parties and Guarantor shall promptly notify the
other parties if such party becomes aware that any third party has any
objection or intends to object to this Agreement on antitrust or anti-
competitive grounds.

  

### 

  

### (vi) Each of the Parties and Guarantor shall use its reasonable best
efforts to resolve objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental
Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under
any applicable Competition/Investment Law in order to enable the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated as soon as practicable
following the entry of the Sale Order (and in any case prior to the End
Date). If any Litigation is instituted or objection made (or threatened in
writing to be instituted or made) challenging that any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement is in violation of any
applicable Competition/Investment Law, then each of the Parties and Guarantor
shall reasonably cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to contest and
resist such Litigation or resolve any such objections, and to have vacated,
lifted, reversed or overturned any Decree, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including by
pursuing all reasonably available avenues of administrative and judicial
appeal and all reasonably available legislative action, unless, by mutual
agreement, the Parties and Guarantor decide that litigation is not in their
respective best interests. For purposes of this _Section 5(b)(vi)_ and
_Section 5(b)(iv)_, reasonable best efforts shall require that Guarantor,
Buyers or their respective Affiliates shall, to the extent required to
resolve objections as may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any applicable
Competition/Investment Law, divest their interest in Louisiana Pigment
Company, L.P. (" _LPC_ ") to its partner or another Person at a discount to
fair value and shall further agree that, with respect to LPC, Buyers,
Guarantor or their respective Affiliates will enter into reasonable long-term
supply agreements or tolling agreements for its portion of the titanium
dioxide produced by LPC to or with an independent third party; establish
protections to ensure that Buyers, Guarantor or their respective Affiliates
obtain no competitively sensitive information of the other owner of LPC;
and/or extend on current terms or cancel existing customer contracts for
Buyers, Guarantors or their respective Affiliates portion of titanium
dioxide produced by LPC.  In furtherance of the preceding sentence, (A)
Buyers shall engage, within fourteen days of the date hereto, a nationally
recognized investment bank with experience in asset sales to market the sale
of Buyers, Guarantors or their respective Affiliates interest in LPC, and
(B) Buyers and Guarantor shall use reasonable best efforts, prior to the
entry of the Sale Order, to enter into a letter of intent with its partner in
LPC or a bona fide third party purchaser (each, a " _Potential Purchaser_ "),
to sell the LPC interests to such Potential Purchaser, conditioned upon the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, entry into
definitive documentation with such Potential Purchaser and other customary
conditions, unless based on (1) the Parties and Guarantors discussions
with Governmental Entities, (2) the arguments of the Parties and Guarantor
in favor of expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act, and (3)
facts then available to the Parties, it is reasonably likely that the

  



        
   

  



  

### waiting period under the HSR Act will expire on or prior to the End Date;
_provided_ that nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require
Guarantor, Buyers or their respective Affiliates to agree to or to make any
other divestiture or any agreement to hold separate with respect to any other
asset of Guarantor, Buyers or Sellers in order to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act or to obtain
the relevant approvals under any other Competition/Investment Laws or to
resolve or settle any objection or Litigation of any Governmental Entity or
to have lifted, vacated, reversed or overturned any Decree.

  

### 

  

(c) _Bankruptcy Approval_.

  



  

### (i) No later than three Business Days following the execution of this
Agreement, Sellers shall file a motion seeking the issuance and entry by the
Bankruptcy Court of the Bidding Procedures Order (the " _Bidding Procedures
Motion_ ") and the Sale Order (the " _Sale Motion_ "), including all
supporting pages, each in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Buyers, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to have the Bankruptcy
Court issue and enter the Bidding Procedures Order (with only such changes
thereto as Buyers shall approve or request) within fifteen days from the
filing date of the Bidding Procedures Motion. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Sale Motion and the Bidding Procedures Motion may be consolidated into a
single motion. Each of Sellers and Buyers agree to take any action reasonably
necessary or appropriate to obtain the issuance and entry of the Bidding
Procedures Order and the Sale Order, including furnishing affidavits,
declarations or other documents or information for filing with the Bankruptcy
Court; _provided_ , _however_ , in no event shall Buyer or Sellers be
required to agree to any amendment of this Agreement or changes to the
Bidding Procedures Order or Sale Order that are materially adverse to
such Party.

  

### 

  

### (ii) The Sale Order will provide, among other things, that pursuant to
sections 105, 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code: (A) the Acquired Assets

encumbrances (whether known or unknown, secured or unsecured or in the nature

Chapter 11 Cases, and whether imposed by agreement, understanding, law,
equity, or otherwise, including claims otherwise arising under doctrines of
successor liability), including Liens, (except for Permitted Liens), and the

### (F) Buyers shall have no liability or responsibility for any liability or
other obligation of Sellers arising under or related to the Acquired Assets
other than as expressly set forth in this Agreement, including successor or
vicarious liabilities of any kind or character, including any theory of
antitrust, environmental, successor or transferee liability, labor law, de
facto merger or substantial continuity; (G) Buyers shall have no liability
for any Excluded Liability; and (H) the releases in _Section 6(p)_
are valid, binding and enforceable against Debtors, their estates and
successors and assigns.

have asserted any Liens (other than Permitted Liens) in or upon the interests
of Sellers specifically in the Acquired Assets, including all applicable
Taxing Authorities; (G) all other parties that have filed a notice of
appearance and demand for service of papers in the Chapter 11 Cases under
Rule 2002 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure promulgated under the
Bankruptcy Code; and (H) any other Persons required by the Bankruptcy Court
or the Guidelines of the Southern District of New York, including as required
by General Order M-331 of the Bankruptcy Court, or as reasonably requested by
Buyers.

  

### 

  

### (iv) Sellers acknowledge and agree that Buyers have expended considerable
time and expense in connection with this Agreement and the negotiation
thereof and the identification and quantification of assets to be included in
the Acquired Assets.  In consideration therefor, the Bidding Procedures
Motion shall include a request from Sellers for approval of the Bidding
Incentives as administrative priority expenses under sections 503(b) and
507(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code.

  

### 

  

### (v) _Non-Solicitation_.  From the time of execution and delivery by each
Seller and Buyer of this Agreement until the Bidding Procedures Order is
entered by the Bankruptcy Court and following entry of the Sale Order (both
periods being referred to as the " _Non-Solicitation Period_ "), Sellers
shall not, and shall cause each of the Target Companies and, to the extent
permitted in the Tiwest Joint Venture Documents, Tiwest not to, nor shall

Sale Order from responding to any unsolicited inquiries from or engaging in
discussions with the official committees appointed in the Chapter 11 Cases or
engaging in discussions with any third parties in consultation with such
official committees, with respect to such Restructuring Transaction to the
extent Tronox Incorporated determines, in good faith, that such action is

Buyers with copies of applications, pleadings, notices, proposed orders and

reasonably practicable prior to any submission thereof to the Bankruptcy
Court. Sellers further covenant and agree that, after the entry of the Sale
Order the terms of any reorganization or liquidation plan they submit to the
Bankruptcy Court or any other court for confirmation or sanction shall not
conflict with, supersede, abrogate, nullify or restrict the terms of this
Agreement, or in any way prevent or interfere with the consummation or
performance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any
transaction contemplated by or approved pursuant to the Bidding Procedures
Order and the Sale Order. In the event any other party in interest proposes
in any filing with the Bankruptcy Court any such plan, Sellers shall take all
reasonable action to oppose the plan and any related relief and to enforce
the Sale Order.

## 

  

(f) _Notice of Developments_.  From the date hereof until the Closing Date,
(i) Sellers shall disclose to Buyers in writing any material breach or
variances from Sellers representations and warranties contained in _Section

in any material respect any covenant or agreement to be performed, complied
or satisfied by them and (ii) Buyers shall disclose to Sellers in writing any
material breach or variance from Buyers and Guarantors representations and
warranties contained in _Section 4_ promptly upon discovery thereof and

or agreement to be performed, complied or satisfied by them. No notification
under this _Section 5(f)_ shall affect in any way the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties hereto or the conditions
to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement nor shall such
notification alter the effect of such breach (to the extent not cured) with
respect to the provisions of _Section 7_.

  



  

(g) _Access_.

  



  

### (i) Upon reasonable advance written request by Buyers, Sellers will, and
will permit and cause the Target Companies (and will use reasonable best
efforts to cause Tiwest and the Tiwest Joint Venture Participants), (A) to
permit, Buyers and their respective Representatives to have reasonable access
during normal business hours, and in a manner so as not to interfere
unreasonably with the normal business operations of Sellers, Target
Companies, Tiwest or the Tiwest Joint Venture Participants to all premises,
properties, personnel, Records, IT Systems and Contracts used or held for use
in the operation of the Business and the Tiwest Joint Venture, in each case,
for the purpose of evaluating, and reviewing the Business, the Tiwest Joint
Venture and each Target Companys and Tronox Australias
business, properties, the Acquired Assets and the Assumed Liabilities and (B)
to furnish reasonably promptly to Buyers such information concerning
Sellers, the Target Companies and the Tiwest Joint Ventures business,
properties, contracts, records and personnel as may be reasonably requested,
from time to time, by or on behalf of Buyers; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
for avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not require any Party to waive,
or take any action with the affect of waiving, its attorney client privilege
or any confidentiality obligation to which it is bound with respect thereto
or take any action in violation of applicable law.  During the period from
the date hereof and ending upon the Closing, Buyers shall not, and shall
cause their respective Representatives not to, contact any customers,
suppliers or licensors of the Business in connection with or pertaining to
the acquisition of the Acquired Assets under this Agreement except with the
prior written consent of Tronox Incorporated (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  

### 

  

### (ii) All information obtained pursuant to this  _Section 5(g)_ shall be
subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

### 

  

(h) _Press Releases and Public Announcements_.  Prior to the Closing, the
parties hereto will consult with each other and in relation to the Tiwest
Joint Venture, with the Tiwest Joint Venture Participants, before issuing,
and will provide each other reasonable opportunity to review and comment
upon, any press release or, to the extent practicable, other written public
statements with respect to the existence or subject matter of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any party may make (and permit the making of)
any public disclosure that is required by the

  



        
   

  



  

Bankruptcy Court or that it believes in good faith is required by applicable
law or any listing or trading agreement concerning its or any of its
respective Affiliates publicly traded securities (in which case the
disclosing party will use its reasonable best efforts to advise the other
parties prior to making the disclosure).

  



  

(i) _Bulk Transfer Laws_.  Buyers acknowledge that the Asset Sellers will not
comply with the provisions of any bulk transfer laws of any jurisdiction in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and hereby
waive all claims related to the non-compliance therewith.

  



  

(j) _Cure Amounts_.

  



  

### (i) U.S. Sellers have delivered, or will deliver as soon as practicable
after the date hereof, to U.S. Buyer a schedule containing Sellers
reasonable estimate of the Cure Amounts for each Contract that is listed on
_Annex B_ as of the date hereof. U.S. Sellers have set forth in _Annex C_ , a
list of each Contract that U.S. Sellers reasonably believe in good
faith require Cure Amounts in excess of $50,000 along with U.S. Sellers
reasonable good faith estimate of the Cure Amount for each such Contract.
U.S. Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with and provide such additional
information to U.S. Buyer so to identify and provide to U.S. Buyer as
promptly as practicable all Contracts relating to the Business (and the
related Cure Amounts) and subject to assumption or rejection (each, an "
_Assumable Contract_ ").

  

### 

  

### (ii) On or before the hearing on the Bidding Procedures, U.S. Buyer will
provide U.S. Sellers with a list of Assumable Contracts on _Annex B_ that
represents U.S. Buyers reasonable best efforts to identify the Assumable
Contracts that U.S. Buyer desires to assume from U.S. Sellers at such time.
From and after the date hereof, (A) U.S. Buyer may add any Assumable Contract
to _Annex B_ from and after the date hereof until the earlier to occur of (1)
March 31, 2010 or (2) the Closing, subject to _Section 2(j)_ and _6(b)_
, and (B) U.S. Buyer may delete any Assumable Contract from _Annex B_  from
and after the date hereof until the later to occur of (1) the Closing or (2)
three Business Days following entry of a Final Order determining all Cure
Amounts and adequate assurance (if any) required for such Assumable Contract
(with respect to each Assumable Contract, the " _Applicable Assumption
Deadline_ "). In the event that U.S. Buyer shall determine to reject or
refuse assignment of any Assumable Contract, U.S. Buyer shall have no
obligations with respect to such Assumable Contract, including any obligation
to cure any defaults thereunder. Any Assumable Contract listed on _Annex B_
 at the close of business on the Applicable Assumption Deadline shall be
an Assumed Contract designated to be assumed and assigned to U.S. Buyer, with
U.S. Buyer being responsible for all Cure Amounts associated therewith. U.S.
Buyers shall not be required to make any payment for Cure Amounts for any
Assumable Contracts removed from _Annex B_.

  

### 

  

### (iii) With respect to each Assumable Contract listed on _Annex B_ , at
the Applicable Assumption Deadline, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy
Court pursuant to the Sale Order, or such other order of the Bankruptcy Court
and/or the consent of the applicable counterparties to the extent necessary
to effect the assignment for such Assumable Contract in any case, U.S.
Sellers shall assume and assign to U.S.

  



        
   

  



  

### Buyer and U.S. Buyer shall assume from U.S. Sellers all such Assumable
Contracts, unless previously removed from _Annex B_ pursuant to this _Section
5(j)_.

  

### 

  

### (iv) U.S. Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts, including the
filing and prosecution of any and all appropriate proceedings in the
Bankruptcy Court, to establish the Cure Amount, if any, for each Assumable
Contract that Buyer adds to _Annex B_ from and after the date hereof. Any
motions filed with, and any proposed orders submitted to, the Bankruptcy
Court seeking authorization after the date hereof to assume or reject any
Contracts shall be in form and substance satisfactory to U.S. Buyer. To the
extent that any counterparty objects to a proposed Cure Amount or to
the assumption and assignment on any other grounds (each, an "
_Objecting Counterparty_ "), U.S. Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with
U.S. Buyer to negotiate with such Objecting Counterparty, including attending
meetings and conferences with such Objecting Counterparty and its
representatives as U.S. Buyer reasonably requests, and providing U.S. Buyer
with reasonable access to the books and records of U.S. Sellers to defend the
proposed assignment and assumption and Cure Amount. Under no circumstances
shall U.S. Sellers, without the written consent of U.S. Buyer, (A)
compromise or commence any action with respect to a negotiated Cure Amount
required to be made under the Bankruptcy Code to effectuate the assumption of
any Assumable Contract, (B) agree to any other amendments, supplements or
modifications of, or waivers with respect to, any Assumable Contract as part
of a negotiated Cure Amount, or (C) reject or take any action (or fail to
take any action that would result in rejection, repudiation or disclaimer by
operation of law) to reject, repudiate or disclaim any Assumable Contract.

  

### 

  

### (v) At the Applicable Assumption Deadline, to the extent not previously
paid, U.S. Buyer shall cure any monetary defaults under each Assumed Contract
by payment of any Cure Amounts related to Assumed Contracts as ordered by the
Bankruptcy Court, and U.S. Sellers shall have no Liability for any Cure
Amounts related to Assumed Contracts; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the
Cure Amount with respect to any Assumable Contract with a vendor of U.S.
Sellers that is not listed on _Annex C_ as of the date hereof exceeds $50,000
(an " _Excluded Cure Amount_ ") and U.S. Buyer agrees to assume such
Assumable Contract, then U.S. Sellers shall be responsible for the payment of
such Excluded Cure Amount;  _provided_ , _further_ , that the immediately
preceding proviso shall not apply if Sellers could not have reasonably known
as of the date hereof that the Cure Amount of such Assumable Contract would
exceed $50,000 unless, in each case, such Assumable Contract is a Contract
(A) containing pricing terms that are below market pricing terms for the same
goods, materials or services or (B) that Buyers would be unable to replace on
substantially similar terms and conditions.

  

### 

  

### (vi) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each Contract
to which Tronox Australia is party (other than Contracts with other Sellers)
shall be an Acquired Asset and shall be assumed by and assigned to Australia
Buyer and shall be an Assumed Contract.

  

### 

  

### (vii) Any Contract of the Asset Sellers that is not assumed by U.S. Buyer
as provided in this _Section 5(j)_ shall be an Excluded Asset.

  



        
   

  



  

(k) _Replacement Bonding Requirements_.  On or prior to the Closing Date,
Buyers agree to provide replacement guarantees, standby letters of credit or
other assurances of payment with respect to all Bonding Requirements, in form
and substance satisfactory to the respective banks or other counterparties,
and, both prior to and following the Closing Date, Buyers and Sellers shall
reasonably cooperate to obtain a release of Sellers in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Buyers and Sellers with respect to all Bonding
Requirements.

  



  

(l) _Competing Transaction_.  From and after the date the Bidding Procedures
Order is entered by the Bankruptcy Court, Sellers and Target Companies are
permitted, and are permitted to cause their Representatives and Affiliates,
to (i) initiate contact with, solicit or encourage submission of any
inquiries, proposals or offers by, respond to any unsolicited inquiries,
proposals or offers submitted by, and enter into any discussions or
negotiations regarding any of the foregoing with, any Person (in addition to
Buyers and their respective Affiliates, agents and Representatives) in
connection with any Competing Transaction, _provided_ , _however_ , that any
such solicitation may occur only in accordance with the Bidding Procedures
Order, and (ii) engage in discussions with the official committees appointed
in the Chapter 11 Cases or third parties in consultation with such official
committees with respect to a Restructuring Transaction to the extent that
Tronox Incorporated determines, in good faith, that such action is required
by the Tronox Incorporated board of directors fiduciary duties to Tronox
Incorporateds stakeholders. In addition, Sellers may supply information
relating to the Business and the Acquired Assets to prospective purchasers
and other third parties in connection with a Restructuring Transaction;
_provided_ that no non-public information may be furnished until Sellers
receive an executed confidentiality agreement from any such Person containing
terms and provisions that in the aggregate are no less favorable in any
material respect to Sellers (other than with respect to the effective periods
( _ _e.g.__ , the term of such agreement or any other provisions related to
timing limitations therein) and the non-disclosure and non-solicitation
provisions contained therein, all of which terms shall be commercially
reasonable) than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (each, an "
_Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ "). Subject to any restrictions under
applicable Competition/Investment Law, any non-public information provided to
such third Persons after entry into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
that has not previously been provided to Buyers shall be delivered to Buyers
promptly after delivery of such information to a third Person.  Sellers
and the Target Companies shall not, and shall not permit any of their
respective Subsidiaries to, terminate, amend, modify or waive, and shall seek
to enforce to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, such
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreements. At the Closing, Sellers shall either
assign the Acceptable Confidentiality Agreements to Buyer (to the extent such
agreements relate to the Acquired Business or the Acquired Assets), in which
case such agreements (or portions thereof) shall constitute Assumed
Contracts, or seek to enforce, upon Buyers request and at Buyers sole cost
and expense, any Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement. Sellers shall notify
Buyers within twenty-four hours after receipt of any proposal with respect to
any Competing Transaction or Restructuring Transaction and shall deliver to
Buyers by email transmission or same day courier service true and complete
copies of all documents related to any such offer. Sellers shall (i) keep
Buyers informed on a reasonably prompt basis of the status of any such
proposal or offer and (ii) provide Buyers reasonably promptly, and in any
event with forty-eight hours, with copies of all significant correspondence
and other written material sent or received in connection with any such offer
or proposal.

  



        
   

  



  

(m) _Pre-Closing Assistance_.

  



  

### (i) If requested by Buyers from and after the date hereof, Sellers shall:

  

### 

  

#### (A) engage Ernst and Young LLP, Sellers auditor, to provide U.S. Buyer
with audited historical financial statements for the Acquired Business for
the fiscal years 2006, 2007 and 2008 on or prior to ninety days after the
entry of the Bidding Procedures Order and to provide unaudited financial
statements for the Acquired Business for the nine-month periods ended
September 30, 2009 and September 30, 2008 on or prior to ninety days after
the entry of the Bidding Procedures Order (the " _Carve-Out Financial
Statements_ "). Sellers shall also provide such direction and assistance as
is required to support their auditors reasonable needs under the above-
referenced engagement and meeting the above-referenced deadline, including
(1) executing and delivering management representation letters as reasonably
agreed upon by Sellers and Sellers auditor ( _provided_ that nothing herein
shall require a representation as to the amount of or need for an accrual for
environmental Liabilities or any other contingent reserves for liabilities
not to be assumed by Buyers), (2) providing prepared relevant financial
statements to be the subject of the audit, (3) providing all reasonably
required supporting accounting records and (4) providing reasonable access to
relevant systems, files and persons. Nothing in this  _Section 5(m)(i)(A)_
shall require any Seller to pay or incur Liability for any fee or other
expense of Sellers auditor that is not advanced or simultaneously reimbursed
by U.S. Buyer. In the event Sellers auditor declines to be engaged or the
audited portion of the Carve-Out Financial Statements is not delivered by the
above-mentioned deadline or it becomes reasonably apparent that such deadline
will not be met, Sellers shall (a) engage and provide such assistance as is
required to support Buyers auditors reasonable needs in order to provide an
audit within a reasonably prompt timeframe, including (i) executing and
delivering management representation letters as reasonably agreed upon by
Sellers and U.S. Buyers auditor ( _provided_ that nothing herein shall
require a representation as to the amount of or need for an accrual for
environmental Liabilities or other contingent reserves for Liabilities not to
be assumed by Buyers), (ii) providing prepared relevant financial statements
to be the subject of the audit, (iii) providing all reasonably required
supporting accounting records and (iv) providing reasonable access to
relevant systems, files and persons and (b) pay U.S. Buyer promptly after
receiving an invoice $1,000,000 towards the audit fees of Buyers auditor,
except in the case that U.S. Buyers auditor is Ernst and Young LLP or one of
its Affiliates;

  

#### 

  

#### (B) following the entry of the Sale Order, communicating to those
employees listed on _Section 5(m)(ii)(B) of the Disclosure Schedule_ a
commitment to pay retention bonuses at such times and in such amounts and
subject to such conditions as may be determined by U.S. Buyer; _provided_
that in no event shall Sellers be required to obligate themselves to make
payments that are not advanced or simultaneously reimbursed by U.S. Buyer.
U.S. Buyer hereby agrees to assume such obligations at Closing;

  



        
   

  



  

#### (C) as soon as reasonably possible following the date of this Agreement,
but in no event later than thirty days following the date hereof, provide
U.S. Buyer with a reasonably comprehensive description of the processes used
in Sellers order to cash activities;

  

#### 

  

#### (D) subject to U.S. Buyer providing Sellers with a reasonably
comprehensive description of its order to cash process descriptions, required
field definitions, formats, system interface table formats, and examples of
data and documentation used in U.S. Buyers order to cash process and systems
(the " _Buyer Master Data Description_ ") (such deliverable to be due as soon
as reasonably possible following the date of this Agreement, but in no event
later than thirty days following the date hereof), Sellers will provide to
U.S. Buyer the Seller Master Data with respect to the Acquired Business (in a
format that reasonably matches the Buyer Master Data Description or other
format reasonably requested by U.S. Buyer) to U.S. Buyer by the later to
occur of (1) December 15, 2009 or (2) five days after the date of the entry
of the Sale Order.  If, subsequent to U.S. Buyer providing the Buyer Master
Data Description, Sellers believe U.S. Buyer has not fully complied with
its obligations in this _Section 5(m)(i)(D)_, then Sellers shall
promptly notify U.S. Buyer of the specific deficiencies with respect to the
U.S. Buyers provision of the Buyer Master Data Description.
 Notwithstanding the above, prior to the Closing Date, U.S. Buyer shall only
permit U.S. Buyers IT Clean Team to have access to, view or use such Seller
Master Data or any portion thereof.  If this Agreement is terminated for any
reason prior to the Closing, then U.S. Buyer shall, and shall cause the IT
Clean Team to, promptly destroy or return to Sellers, at U.S. Buyers
election, all such Seller Master Data (and all copies and derivative products
thereof) and, in the case of destruction, U.S. Buyer shall certify such
destruction to Sellers in writing;

  

#### 

  

#### (E) assign to such Buyer (or to an Affiliate of such Buyer as such Buyer
may direct) as of the Closing, to the extent assignable, any lockboxes and
accounts used by any Target Company, Tronox Australia or Tiwest in the
Acquired Business, and execute and deliver such documentation reasonably
required by such Buyer to establish the collection accounts as collateralized
accounts for such Buyers proposed participation in a securitization or
asset-backed lending program; and

  

#### 

  

#### (F) within ten Business Days prior to the Closing, execute and deliver
customary instructions to those customers of the Acquired Business identified
by such Buyer to make payments to bank accounts designated by such Buyer from
and after the Closing.

  

#### 

  

### (ii) Nothing in _Section 5(m)(i)_ shall require such cooperation to
the extent it would unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of
any Seller, Target Company or Tiwest and nothing in this _Section 5(m)_
shall require any Seller, any Affiliate of any Seller, any Target Company or
Tiwest to pay or incur Liability for any fee or other expense that is not
advanced or simultaneously reimbursed by Buyers.  Sellers and the Target
Companies hereby consent to the use of any such Persons logo, subject to the

  



        
   

  



  

### prior written approval of its use (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), in connection with the Debt Financing.

  

### 

  

### (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither any breach of this _Section
5(m)_ nor the unavailability or terms of any Debt Financing shall affect
Buyers obligation to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or be deemed to be a breach of a covenant of any Seller for purposes of
_Section 7(a)_ and  _Section 8(a)_. Failure by Sellers to comply with
_Sections 5(m)(i)(A)_ and/or _(B)_ above shall result in a reduction
to the Initial Purchase Price of $3,000,000, which reduction shall be Buyers
sole remedy for such breach or breaches; _provided_ that no such
reduction shall be made if the Carve-Out Financial Statements are available
to Buyers at the time of the Closing. Failure by Sellers to comply with
_Sections 5(m)(i)(C)_ , _(D)_ , (E) and/or _(F)_ shall result in
a reduction to the Initial Purchase Price of $5,000,000, which reduction
shall be Buyers sole remedy for such breach or breaches; _provided_ that no
such reduction shall be made if financing of receivables of the Acquired
Business through the securitization or asset-backed lending program of
Buyers Affiliates is consummated or could reasonably have been consummated
by Buyer at or prior to the Closing.

  

### 

  

(n) _Indebtedness of Target Companies_. Immediately prior to the Closing,
all outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money, together with any interest
accrued thereon and any other amounts that may come due and payable as of the
Closing Date owed by any Target Company to any Seller (other than any
Retained Intercompany Balances) will be contributed to the equity capital of
such Target Company. Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall cause the Target
Companies and their Subsidiaries to pay off in full all of the outstanding
indebtedness for borrowed money, together with any interest accrued thereon
and any other amounts that may come due and payable as of the Closing Date
owed by any Target Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person (other
than a Target Company or a Seller) other than any Retained Intercompany
Balances. As of the Closing Date, the Target Companies and their Subsidiaries
shall have no outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money, other than any
Retained Intercompany Balances, and all Liens related to such indebtedness,
other than any Retained Intercompany Balances, shall be fully terminated,
cancelled and extinguished.  For the avoidance of doubt, the only
Intercompany indebtedness owed between Tronox Australia and any Seller that
will be assumed by Australia Buyer will be any such indebtedness scheduled on
_Annex J_. Sellers, Target Companies and their Subsidiaries shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to preserve the tax attributes of the Target
Companies in connection with taking all actions required by this _Section
5(n)_.

  



  

(o) _Transfer of Excluded Subsidiaries_.  Prior to the Closing, Sellers
shall, and shall cause Tronox Holland to, transfer, sell, convey, assign or
otherwise dispose of all of the equity interests directly or indirectly held
by Tronox Holland in the Excluded German Subsidiaries and, in the case that
the election to purchase Tronox Netherlands is exercised pursuant to _Section
5(s)_, the Excluded Danish Subsidiaries. As of the Closing Date, no Seller,
Target Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or the
Acquired Business shall have any obligation or Liability arising out of or
relating to Tronox Hollands ownership of equity interests in the Excluded
German Subsidiaries or, in the case that the election to purchase Tronox
Netherlands is exercised pursuant to _Section 5(s)_, Tronox
Netherlands ownership of equity interests in the Excluded Danish
Subsidiaries.

  



        
   

  



  

(p) _Target Companies  Asset Sales_.

  



  

### (i) If Sellers are unable to obtain the PBGC Release at least thirty days
prior to the Closing, then U.S. Buyer may elect (the " _Asset Sale Option_
"), by delivering a written notice to Sellers at least twenty days prior to
the Closing Date, at its sole discretion, to restructure the acquisition of
any of the Target Companies by acquiring all of the properties and assets
(the " _Target Companies  Assets_") and Liabilities of such Target Companies
in an asset acquisition rather than the acquisition of the Target Interests
as contemplated by this Agreement, in which case U.S. Buyer and Sellers
shall, and Sellers shall cause the Target Companies to, enter into one or
more separate asset purchase agreements in the form set forth as _Exhibit O_
with each of the Target Companies (each, a " _Target Company APA_ ") with
respect to the Target Companies Assets and all of Target Companies
Liabilities, and any reasonably required transfer documents, pursuant to
which, among other things, each Target Company shall assign, to the extent
permitted under applicable Law, all Permits required by the applicable
Governmental Entities to operate the business of such Target Company and
assign all Contracts to which such Target Company is a party.

  

### 

  

### (ii) If a consent of any third party or Governmental Entity with respect
to the transfer or assignment to and operation by U.S. Buyer of any of the
Target Companies Assets (including any Contracts) is required but cannot, in
the opinion of Sellers or the relevant Target Companies, be obtained as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the entry of the Sale Order (but
in any case on or prior to the End Date), so long as all other conditions in
_Section 7_ are satisfied or anticipated to be satisfied at the Closing, the
provisions set forth in _Section 2(j)_ shall apply to such Target
Companies Assets _mutatis mutandis_.

  

### 

  

### (iii) The U.S. Buyer and Sellers agree that it is the intent of the
Parties that the transactions contemplated under this _Section 5(p)_ will
not in any way expand the Liabilities of Sellers and their Affiliates under
this Agreement or any other Related Agreement, and that the
transactions contemplated under this _Section 5(p)_ shall (A) not
be conditioned upon any consents, approvals or notices to or from any third
party or Governmental Entity (provided that Sellers shall comply with
_Section 5(b)(i)_ and _Section 5(b)(iii)_), (B) require the U.S. Buyer to
offer employment to all employees who are employed by such Target Company (or
Target Companies, as the case may be) at Closing, and (C) require U.S. Buyer
to indemnify the Target Company (or Target Companies, as the case may be) for
any Liabilities of such Target Company that arise prior to the Closing. For
the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement, U.S. Buyer shall be responsible for all Transfer Taxes pursuant to
_Section 6(h)(i)_ arising out of the transactions contemplated under this
_Section 5(p)_.

  

### 

  

### (iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless U.S. Buyer has exercised the
Asset Sale Option within the time period set forth in _Section 5(p)(i)_, at
the Closing, Sellers shall transfer to U.S. Buyer the Target Interests
pursuant to this Agreement.

  



        
   

  



  

(q) _Insurance_.

  



  

### (i) Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall use reasonable best efforts (A)
to amend all casualty and property insurance policies in the name of any of
Tronox Australia or Tiwest so as to name Australia Buyer or its designee as
an additional insured on each such Insurance Policy where Tronox Australia or
Tiwest is a named party, and (B) to enter into a tail directors and
officers insurance policy with a reputable insurance company on customary
terms, which insurance policy shall be in effect for a period of at least six
years following the Closing Date.

  

### 

  

### (ii) From and after the Closing, Sellers shall reasonably assist Buyers
with claims for recovery of damages for breaches of representations,
warranties or covenants contained in Contracts related to the Acquired
Business that have not been assigned to Buyers (the " _Contract Indemnities_
") with respect to claims arising out of pre-Closing events or occurrences in
the Acquired Business. Seller will pay such Contract Indemnities proceeds to
Buyers net of deduction and reasonable expense of recovery.

  

### 

  

### (iii) As necessary to enable Buyers to exercise their respective rights
under _Section 5(q)(ii)_, Sellers shall (A) provide information in its
possession regarding any such claim under applicable Contract or reasonably
required under the applicable Contract and (B) at Buyers cost and expense,
provide any further reasonable assistance in connection with prosecution of
claims. Buyers shall provide Sellers prompt written notice of any claims that
it desires to submit pursuant to _Section 5(q)(ii)_ and shall provide to
Sellers all information as may be required by the applicable Contract or
reasonably required under the applicable Contract in connection with such
claim.

  

### 

  

(r) _PBGC Release_. Sellers shall, and shall cause the Target Companies and
their Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate in good faith to assist Buyers in
obtaining an agreement, waiver and release from PBGC (the " _PBGC Release_
"), pursuant to which PBGC shall (i) waive its rights, covenant not to sue,
release and discharge the Target Companies, Tiwest and each of their
respective Representatives of and from any and all actions, suits, causes of
action, contracts, debts, sums of money, controversies, claims,
demands, Liabilities, losses, judgments, costs, attorneys fees, damages and
expenses of any kind whatsoever, whether in law, equity or otherwise, known
or unknown, actual or contingent, including any claims, actions or
Liabilities with respect to or arising from any Employee Benefit Plan subject
to Title IV of ERISA (" _Pension Plans_ "), including any Liabilities imposed
or that could be imposed under ERISA or the Code, which the PBGC may now
have, ever has had or ever will have, from the beginning of the world
relating to or arising from the Pension Plan ~~s~~  (collectively, the "
_Released Matters_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that this subsection excludes
any of the U.S. Sellers and certain of their Affiliates who (A) seek relief
in the Chapter 11 Cases (" _Debtors_ "); (B) agree not to pursue or perfect
any Lien or claim with respect to the Pension Plans, whether arising before
or after the date of this Agreement, against the Target Companies or any of
their assets or equity or any of the proceeds from the sale thereof; and (C)
forever waive its rights, covenants not to sue, releases, and discharges
Buyers, Guarantor and each of their respective Representatives or against any
other party who is selected as the winning bidder pursuant to the bidding
procedures approved by the Bankruptcy Court or otherwise with respect to the
sale of (1) substantially all of the assets of the Debtors and (2) the stock
or assets of the Target Companies (collectively, the

  



        
   

  



  

" _Third Party Beneficiaries_ "), of and from any and all Released Matters,
which the PBGC may now have, ever has had or ever will have, from the
beginning of the world relating to or arising from the Pension Plans, any
Released Matter or Buyers, Guarantor or their respective Affiliates (or any
Third Party Beneficiaries) purchase of the Debtors assets, including the
stock and assets of the Target Companies. Notwithstanding any other provision
herein, if the PBGC Release is conditional upon the payment of any monies,
then U.S. Buyer, in its discretion, may make any necessary payment to PBGC;
it being understood and agreed that Sellers shall be responsible for the
first $2,000,000 of any such payment to PBGC, which amount shall be included
in the calculation of the Assumed Current Liabilities with respect to
the determination of the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount and the Net
Working Capital on the Conclusive Net Working Capital Statement hereunder
(such amount, the " _Sellers PBGC Amount_ ").

  



  

(s) _Election to Purchase Tronox Netherlands_. U.S. Buyer may elect at least
thirty Business Days prior to the Closing Date to purchase all of the issued
and outstanding equity interests of Tronox Netherlands instead of all of the
issued and outstanding equity interests, or assets, of Tronox Holland. In the
event of such election, Tronox Netherlands shall be treated as a Target
Company for all purposes of this Agreement, including, for the avoidance of
doubt, _Section 5(p)_; it being understood and agreed, however, that Sellers
make no representations or warranties with respect to Tronox Netherlands and
that Tronox Netherlands shall not be required to perform any covenants or
other agreements hereunder.

  



  

(t) _Covered Employees_. _Section 5(t) _ _of the Disclosure Schedule_ sets
forth a list of each of the Covered Employees, other than Covered Employees

forth as of the date hereof a list of employee layoffs, by date and site of

three days prior to the Closing Date and again on the Closing Date.

  



  

(v) _Seller Retained Employees_. No later than thirty days before
the Closing Date, U.S. Sellers shall deliver to U.S. Buyer a list of
Covered Employees who are primarily involved in legacy environmental
remediation and who U.S. Sellers intend to continue to employ after the
Closing (such employees, the " _Seller Retained Employees_ ") to aid in
environmental issues and the wind-down of the estate and to whom Buyers will
not offer employment pursuant to _Section 6(g)_ without the prior
written consent of U.S. Sellers.

  



        
   

  



  

6. _Other Covenants_.

  



  

(a) _Cooperation_.  From and after the Closing, the Parties shall reasonably
cooperate with each other, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cause their respective controlled Affiliates and Representatives to
reasonably cooperate with each other, to provide an orderly transition of the
Acquired Business from Sellers and the Target Companies to Buyers and to
minimize the disruption to the Business resulting from the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  



  

(b) _Further Assurances_.  In case at any time from and after the Closing any
further action is necessary or reasonably required to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
the terms and conditions of the Sale Order, at any Partys request and sole
cost and expense, each other Party shall take, and shall cause to be taken,
such further action (including the execution and delivery to any other Party
of such other reasonable instruments of sale, transfer, conveyance,
assignment, assumption and confirmation and providing materials and
information) as another Party may reasonably request as shall be necessary to
transfer, convey and assign to Buyers all of the Acquired Assets and Target
Interests, to confirm Buyers assumptions of the Assumed Liabilities and to
confirm Sellers retention of the Excluded Assets and Excluded Liabilities.
 Without limiting the generality of this _Section 6(b)_, to the extent that
any Buyer or Seller discovers any additional assets or properties which
should have been transferred or assigned to Buyers as Acquired Assets
but were not so transferred or assigned, Buyers and Sellers shall
reasonably cooperate and execute and deliver any instruments of transfer or
assignment necessary to transfer and assign such asset or property to the
applicable Buyer. Without limiting the generality of this _Section 6(b)_,
to the extent that any Buyer or Seller discovers any assets or properties
which is an Excluded Asset which was inadvertently or otherwise mistakenly
transferred or assigned to the applicable Buyer, Buyers and Sellers shall
reasonably cooperate and execute and deliver any instruments of transfer or
assignment necessary to transfer and assign such asset or property back to
Sellers.

  



  

(c) _Litigation Support_.  From and after the Closing, in the event and for
so long as any Party actively is contesting or defending against any
Litigation commenced by any Person that is not a Party (or a party to any
other Related Agreement) with respect to (i) any transaction contemplated by
this Agreement or any other Related Agreement or (ii) any fact, situation,
circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event,
incident, action, failure to act or transaction on or prior to the Closing
Date involving the Business, each other Party will reasonably cooperate with
the contesting or defending Party and its counsel in the contest or defense,
make available its personnel on a reasonable basis and provide such testimony
and access to its books and records as shall be reasonably necessary in
connection with the contest or defense, all at the sole cost and expense of
the contesting or defending Party; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, for
avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not require any Party to waive, or
take any action with the affect of waiving, its attorney-client privilege
with respect thereto.  As a condition to providing the cooperation required
pursuant to this _Section 6(c)_, the Party to provide such cooperation or
assistance may require the Party receiving such cooperation or assistance to
enter into a non-disclosure agreement reasonably satisfactory in form and
substance to the providing Party.

  



  

(d) _Run-Off_. From and after the Closing and until the first anniversary
thereof:

  



        
   

  

## 

  

### (i) if U.S. Sellers receive any payment relating to any Accounts
Receivable outstanding on or after the Closing Date related to the Acquired
Business reflected on the Conclusive Net Working Capital Statement (or if not
yet determined, the Estimated Net Working Capital Statement), such payment
shall be the property of Buyers and shall be held in trust by U.S. Sellers,
and U.S. Sellers shall promptly forward and remit such payment to Buyers by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Buyers (which account Buyers may change from time to time by delivering
notice to Sellers). U.S. Sellers shall promptly endorse and deliver to Buyers
any cash, checks or other documents received by U.S. Sellers on account of
any such Accounts Receivable; and

  

### 

  

### (ii) each U.S. Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to refer all
customer or supplier inquiries received by such U.S. Seller relating to the
Acquired Business to Buyers.

  

### 

  

(e) _Prorations_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Closing:

  



  

### (i) Buyers and Sellers shall prorate all installments of real property
Taxes and personal property taxes, special assessments, water and sewer
rentals, vault charges and other real property related charges incurred in
the Ordinary Course of Business with respect to the Owned Real Property and,
to the extent constituting an obligation under the applicable Leases, the
Leased Real Property leased pursuant to such Leases. The Parties shall
calculate such proration using current year real estate Tax information, if
available. If current year Tax information is not available, then the Parties
shall calculate such proration using the amount due and payable in the year
immediately preceding the year of Closing, subject to subsequent adjustment
when the current Tax bills become available. Sellers prorated portion of such
Taxes shall be included in the calculation of the Tax Amount. At such time as
Tax bills for such property Taxes are received, the Parties shall calculate
any necessary adjustments to such prorations in order to reflect differences
between such estimated Taxes and the actual Taxes as reflected in such Tax
bills, and the Parties shall make the necessary payments to each other to
account for such differences, which payments shall be treated as a
supplemental Purchase Price Adjustment. All property and similar Taxes (but
not including any Transfer Taxes covered by _Section _ _6(h)_ , and for the
sake of clarity, not including any income Taxes) shall be prorated between
Sellers and Buyers as of the Closing Date. For this purpose, the amount of
property and similar Taxes for any Tax year or period with respect
to Sellers, the Target Companies and Tiwest that begins on or before and
ends after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ ") allocated to the period
prior to the end of the Closing Date shall be the product of (A) the amount
of such property and similar Taxes due for the entire Straddle Period and (B)
a fraction with the numerator equal to the number of days in the Straddle
Period up to and including the Closing Date and the denominator equal to the
number of days in the entire Straddle Period. Buyers shall be
responsible for and control the conduct of any audit, litigation or other Tax
proceeding with respect to property Taxes for any Straddle Period.

  

### 

  

### (ii) For purposes of this _Section 6(e)_, the amount of any expense
credited by one Party to the other shall be deemed an expense paid by that
Party.

  



         
 

  



  

(f) _Availability of Business Records_.  From and after the Closing, each
Party shall promptly provide to the other Parties and their respective
Representatives (after reasonable notice and during normal business hours and
without charge to the other Parties) access to all Records, to the extent
permissible under Competition/Investment Law, included in the Acquired
Assets, and Records of the Target Companies and Tiwest used or held for use
in the Business, in each case, for periods prior to the Closing and shall
preserve such Records until the latest of (i) seven years after the Closing
Date, (ii) the required retention period for all government contact
information, records or documents, (iii) the conclusion of all bankruptcy
proceedings relating to the Chapter 11 Cases or (iv) in the case of Records
related to Taxes, the expiration of the statute of limitation applicable to
such Taxes.  Such access shall include access to any information in
electronic form to the extent reasonably available.  Buyers acknowledge that
Sellers have the right to retain originals or copies of all of Records
related exclusively to the Excluded Assets and Excluded Liabilities for
periods prior to the Closing. Prior to destroying any Records included in the
Acquired Assets for periods prior to the Closing, each Party shall notify the
other Parties thirty days in advance of any such proposed destruction of its
intent to destroy such Records, and each Party will permit the other Parties
to retain such Records. With respect to any litigation and claims that are
Excluded Liabilities, Buyers shall render, at Sellers expense, all
reasonable assistance that Sellers may request in defending such litigation
or claim and shall make available to Sellers personnel most knowledgeable
about the matter in question.

  



  

(g) _Offers of Employment to Covered Employees_.  Buyers shall offer
employment, effective as of the Closing Date, to substantially all of the
Covered Employees (other than the Seller Retained Employees, which neither
Buyer shall employ without the prior written consent of Sellers) as of the
Closing Date in sufficient numbers and at sufficient terms and conditions of
employment so as to give rise to no Seller obligation or liability under the
WARN Act with respect to any Covered Employee. Offers of employment will be
at substantially the same base salaries or hourly wages and with bonus
opportunities and employee benefit plan coverage that is substantially
similar, in the aggregate, to the opportunities and coverage as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyers, the
Target Companies, Tiwest and any of their Subsidiaries shall be under no
obligation to assume, adopt, create, provide or make payments with respect to
any defined benefit pension plan, defined superannuation fund or any post-
retirement welfare benefits unless required by law; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the foregoing provisions do not apply to (i) any Covered Employees
employed by any Target Company, which Covered Employees will continue to be
employed such Target Company after the Closing Date on terms and conditions
acceptable under applicable law or (ii) Covered Employees employed by Tiwest,
which Covered Employees will continue to be employed by Tiwest, after the
Closing Date on terms and conditions acceptable under applicable law. Each
Covered Employee (other than the Retained Seller Employees) who accepts
employment with Buyers and thereafter satisfies Buyers pre-employment
requirements, and each Covered Employee that remains in employment at any
Target Company or Tiwest shall hereafter be referred to as a " _Retained
Employee_."  Nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement shall obligate
Buyers to provide continued employment to any Retained Employees for any
period of time following the Closing Date. Buyers shall indemnify and hold
Sellers harmless from all Liabilities under the WARN Act arising against
Sellers as a result, in whole or in part, of Buyers actions after the
Closing Date with respect to any Retained Employees. Buyers shall grant all
Retained Employees credit after the Closing for all service with any of
Sellers or any of their Affiliates and their respective predecessors (to the
extent such service was recognized by Sellers and their Affiliates) for

  



        
   

  



  

purposes of (A) participation and vesting under any employee benefit or
compensation plans, programs, agreements or arrangements maintained by Buyers
or any of their respective Affiliates for the benefit of such Retained
Employees and (B) the Long Service Leave Act 1958 (WA).  For each Retained
Employee previously employed by a U.S. Seller, to the extent applicable,
Buyers shall recognize up to twenty-five days worth of such Retained
Employees unused vacation time that existed as of the Closing Date with such
Sellers (" _Assumed Vacation Liabilities_ ") and shall credit such vacation
time as unused vacation time under Buyers applicable vacation
policy, program or arrangement. Buyers will cause to be waived any waiting
period and preexisting condition limitations applicable to such Retained
Employees under any group health plan maintained by Buyers or any of their
respective Affiliates in which such Retained Employees are otherwise
permitted to participate, but only to the extent that a waiting period or
preexisting condition exclusion requirement under an analogous employee
welfare benefit plan sponsored by any Seller, Target Company, Tiwest or any
of their Subsidiaries did not exclude a Retained Employee from participation
in such plan of Sellers, Target Companies, Tiwest or any of their
Subsidiaries. Buyers will take all action necessary to ensure that such
Retained Employees are given full credit for all expenses and deductibles
incurred under any group health plan sponsored by any of Sellers or any of
their Affiliates for the plan year that includes the Closing Date
for purposes of satisfying any maximum out-of-pocket expense limitations
and deductibles under any group health plan sponsored by Buyers or any of
their respective Affiliates in which such Retained Employees participate
after the Closing. Buyers shall be solely responsible for satisfying the
continuation coverage requirements of COBRA for all Retained Employees.
Tronox Australia shall on the Closing make all necessary superannuation
contributions to avoid being liable to pay the superannuation guarantee
charge in respect of the employees employed by it in Australia and
attributable to any period prior to the Closing. The provisions of this
_Section 6(g)_ are solely for the benefit of the Parties, and no current or
former employee, director, independent contractor or consultant of any of
Sellers, Buyers, Target Companies, Tiwest or any of their Subsidiaries or any
other Person associated therewith shall be regarded as a third party
beneficiary of this _Section 6(g)_. No provision of this Agreement shall
be construed as amending any Assumed Employee Benefit Plan.

  



  

(h) _Transfer Taxes_.

  



  

### (i) Buyers shall pay (and shall indemnify and hold harmless Sellers and
their directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents, successors,
permitted assigns and Representatives against) any stamp, documentary, duty,
registration, transfer, added-value or similar Tax (but, for the avoidance of
doubt, not to include GST) (each, a " _Transfer Tax_ ") imposed under any
applicable law in connection with the conveyance of the Acquired Business to
Buyers contemplated by this Agreement that are not eliminated through the
application of section 1146(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, other than any
Transfer Taxes that arise out of the United States of America.

  

### 

  

### (ii) Sellers shall pay (and shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyers and
their directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents, successors,

connection with the conveyance of the Acquired Business to Buyers
contemplated by this Agreement that are not eliminated through
the application of section 1146(a) of the Bankruptcy Code.

  



        
   

  



  

### (iii) Sellers and Buyers shall cooperate to minimize such Taxes and to
prepare and timely file any Tax Returns required to be filed in connection
with Transfer Taxes described in the immediately preceding sentence. Buyers

applicable Taxing Authority.

  

### 

  

(i) _GST_.

  



  

### (i) Tronox Australia shall continue to carry on the Enterprise until the
Closing.

  

### 

  

### (ii) Sellers and Buyers agree that the supply of all things by Sellers
under or in connection with this Agreement so far as it relates to the Tiwest
Joint Venture Interest constitutes a GST-free supply of a going concern for
the purposes of Section 38-325 of the GST Law.

  

### 

  

### (iii) Australia Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to remain
registered under the GST Law until the Closing. Australia Buyer shall promptly
notify Sellers if it ceases to be so registered at any time prior to the
Closing.

  

### 

  

### (iv) If GST is or will be imposed on a supply made under or in connection
with this Agreement, then Sellers may, to the extent that the consideration
otherwise provided for that supply under this Agreement is not stated to
include an amount in respect of GST on the supply, increase the consideration
otherwise provided for that supply under this Agreement by the amount of GST
or otherwise recover from Australia Buyer the amount of GST; _provided_ ,
_first_ , that any such increase in consideration shall not be paid by
Australia Buyer until (i) Tronox Australia shall have provided Australia
Buyer with a copy of its proposed GST Tax Return for review and comment at
least ten Business Days prior to the due date for such GST Tax Return, which
Tronox Australia shall not file without Australia Buyers consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless
Australia Buyer fails to deliver its comments prior to due date of such GST
Tax Return, and (ii) Sellers shall used their reasonable efforts to permit
Australia Buyer to claim an Input Tax Credit to recover any GST imposed on
Sellers in connection with this Agreement (except for paying any GST);
_provided_ , _second_ , that Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with
Australia Buyer with respect to all filings necessary to claim an Input Tax
Credit, and Australia Buyer shall control all administrative proceedings and
contests with respect to whether Sellers are subject to GST as a result of
this Agreement and whether Australia Buyer is entitled to an Input Tax Credit
with respect to any such GST; _provided_ , _third_ , that Australia Buyer
will not take any such action that is adverse or otherwise prejudicial to any
Seller without such Sellers prior written consent.

  

### 

  

### (v) If the amount paid by the recipient of a Taxable Supply (the "
_Recipient_ ") to the party making the Taxable Supply (the " _Supplier_ ") in
respect of GST (whether because of an Adjustment or otherwise) (A) is more
than the GST on the Taxable Supply, then the Supplier shall refund the excess
to the Recipient, or (B) is less than the GST on the Taxable Supply, then the
Recipient shall pay the deficiency to the Supplier.

  



        
   

  



  

### (vi) The Recipient shall not be obligated to pay any amount in respect of
GST to the Supplier unless and until the Supplier issues a Tax Invoice to the
Recipient in respect of the Taxable Supply. If an Adjustment has occurred,
then the Supplier shall issue an Adjustment Note to the Recipient.

  

### 

  

### (vii) The amount of a Partys entitlement under this Agreement to
recovery or compensation for any of its costs, expenses or liabilities is
reduced by the Input Tax Credits to which such Party (or the Representative
Member of a GST Group of which such Party is a member) is entitled in respect
of such costs, expenses or liabilities.

  



  

(j) _Wage Reporting_.  Buyers and Sellers agree to utilize, or cause their
respective Affiliates to utilize, the alternate procedure set forth in
Internal Revenue Service Revenue Procedure 2004-53 with respect to wage
reporting.

  



  

(k) _Acknowledgements_.  Each Buyer acknowledges that it has received from
Sellers certain projections, forecasts and prospective or third party
information relating to Sellers, the Target Companies, the Business, the
Acquired Business, the Acquired Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or any
related topics. Each Buyer acknowledges that (i) there are uncertainties
inherent in attempting to make such projections and forecasts and in such
information, (ii) such Buyer is familiar with such uncertainties and is
taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and
accuracy of all projections, forecasts and information so furnished, and
(iii) neither Buyer nor any other Person shall have any claim against any
Seller or any of their respective directors, officers, Affiliates, agents or
Representatives with respect thereto. Accordingly, without limiting the
generality of _Section 3(aa)_, Sellers make no representations or
warranties with respect to such projections, forecasts or information.

  



  

(l) _Provisions Relating to Excluded Environmental Liabilities_.

  



  

### (i) Each Buyer shall provide written notice to Sellers promptly (and in
no event later than twenty-one days) upon becoming aware of any facts, events
or conditions allegedly constituting an Excluded Environmental Liability.

  

### 

  

### (ii) Upon receipt of timely written notice from either Buyer regarding an
Excluded Environmental Liability affecting any of the Acquired Assets,
Sellers shall promptly undertake and perform diligently until completion of
all actions required under Environmental Health and Safety Requirements to
address and resolve the Excluded Environmental Liability, including the
conduct of any environmental investigatory, corrective or remedial action
(collectively, " _Remedial Action_ ") with respect thereto. To the extent
necessary to address and resolve the Excluded Environmental Liability,
Sellers shall: select technical experts and counsel; evaluate, select and
implement remedial measures; defend and resolve third party claims, and
negotiate and reach agreements with Governmental Entities and third parties;
_provided_ , _however_ , that when or if any of the foregoing may in any way
affect either Buyers operation of the Acquired Assets or the Business,
Sellers shall consult with Buyers and keep Buyers reasonably apprised of
major developments with respect to such Excluded Environmental Liability and
Sellers shall not take any action that would adversely impair either Buyers
use of the Acquired Assets for industrial purposes without such Buyers
express written consent, not to be

  



        
   

  



  

### unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each Buyer agrees that it shall not
independently disclose, negotiate, or otherwise communicate with Government
Entities or other third parties as to such Excluded Environmental Liability,
unless Sellers have agreed, in writing, to such Buyers participation or
involvement in such communications or such communications are required under
Environmental Health and Safety Requirements. For avoidance of doubt, the
Parties agree that Sellers have received timely notice of, and have
undertaken principal management with respect to, the Henderson Legacy
Contamination.

  

### 

  

### (iii) In connection with any Remedial Action relating to any Excluded
Environmental Liability affecting any of the Acquired Assets: (A) each Buyer
agrees to provide Sellers with reasonable access to all relevant properties,
personnel, documents and other information, and Sellers agree to use
reasonable best efforts to minimize material interference with such Buyers
ongoing operation of any Acquired Assets or the Acquired Business to the
extent practicable; (B) each Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with Sellers
efforts in conducting the Remedial Action, and Sellers shall comply with such
Buyers reasonable requirements relating to the protection of any Acquired
Assets or the Business; (C) each Buyer agrees to facilitate any institutional
controls, deed notices or other risk-based remediation approaches permitted
by Environmental Health and Safety Requirements, provided that
such approaches reasonably seek to minimize any material limitations on the
such Buyers ability to use any Acquired Assets in connection with
continued operation of the Acquired Business; (D) each of Buyers and Sellers
shall use their reasonable best efforts to prevent any unreasonable
interference with business operations on the relevant property; and (E) the
Parties agree to reasonably cooperate with one another and keep one another
reasonably informed of material developments.

  

### 

  

### (iv) Sellers shall not have any obligation to Buyers to take or perform
Remedial Action with respect to an Excluded Environmental Liability affecting
any of the Acquired Assets after Closing unless (A) a third party claim has
been asserted, or (B) Remedial Action is required pursuant to Environmental
Health and Safety Requirements. Any obligation of Sellers to conduct or fund
any Remedial Action affecting any of the Acquired Assets shall be deemed
satisfied upon completion of such action in a manner which is acceptable to
the relevant Governmental Entity or otherwise attains compliance with
Environmental Health and Safety Requirements.

  

### 

  

### (v) Nothing in this _Section 6(l)_, nor any other provision of this
Agreement, shall be construed to indicate that either Buyer is in any way
liable or otherwise responsible for any Excluded Environmental Liabilities,
as it is the specific intention of the Parties that Buyers shall not assume,
or become liable or otherwise responsible for, any Excluded Environmental
Liabilities.

  

### 

  

(m) _Assumed Employee Benefit Plans_.  Sellers have delivered to Buyers
_Annex H_, which includes a list of all Employee Benefit Plans (or portions
thereof) currently anticipated to be assumed by and assigned to Buyers on the
Closing Date. Buyers shall have the right to add or remove any Employee
Benefit Plans from _Annex H_, until twenty Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, with the exception of any Employee Benefit Plans maintained or
contributed to by Tronox Australia, which Buyers will assume at the Closing.
Those Employee Benefit Plans set forth in _Annex H_ on such date shall be
assumed by and assigned to Buyers at the Closing (the

  



        
   

  



  

" _Assumed Employee Benefit Plans_ "). The foregoing provisions do not apply
to any Employee Benefit Plans sponsored or maintained by any Target Company,
which Employee Benefit Plans will continue to be sponsored and/or maintained
by such Target Company pursuant to their terms.

  



  

(n) _Removal of Certain Equipment_.

  



  

(i) Prior to the Closing, reasonably promptly following Buyers request,
Sellers shall engage a reputable third party reasonably acceptable to Sellers
and Buyers to disassemble, package, prepare for shipment and ship prior to
the Closing the Acquired Soda Springs Plant and Equipment, along with all
applicable records, to U.S. Sellers Henderson, Nevada site (or, in the event
that Buyers exercise their right to not acquire the Acquired Henderson Assets
and to enter into the Henderson Lease Agreement, as described in _Section
2(h)(ii)_, such other delivery location as Buyers may reasonably request) and
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause such third party to exercise the
standard of care of a reasonably prudent commercial shipper (including
insuring such Acquired Soda Springs Plant and Equipment in commercially
reasonable amounts), in each case, at Buyers sole cost, risk and expense,
and in no event shall Buyers be reimbursed by Sellers for any such cost or
expense.

  

### 

  

(ii) After the entry of the Sale Order and prior to the Closing, Sellers
shall allow U.S. Buyer reasonable access to the U.S. Sellers Savannah,
Georgia site to enable U.S. Buyer to verify the Acquired Savannah Equipment
which will be delivered to it pursuant to this _Section 6(n)(ii)_. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Closing and at such time that Sellers
reasonably deem it to be safe to take such actions, Sellers shall engage a
third party reasonably acceptable to Sellers and U.S. Buyer to disassemble,
package, prepare for shipment and ship the Acquired Savannah Equipment to a
location designated by U.S. Buyer, in each case, at Buyers sole cost, risk
and expense.

  

### 

  

(o) _Continuation of Coverage_.

  



  

(i) U.S. Sellers, Target Companies and any of their Subsidiaries shall
continue to provide post-retirement health and dental coverage under each
Employee Benefit Plan providing such coverage until January 13, 2010, and
neither U.S. Sellers or Target Companies nor any of their Subsidiaries will
cause any of their former employees to "lose coverage" (as described in
Treasury Regulation § 54.4980B-4, A-1(c)) under any Employee Benefit Plan
providing post-retirement health and dental coverage at any time after the
date of this Agreement while such coverage is to be provided by Sellers,
Target Companies or any of their Subsidiaries as set forth in this _Section
6(o)_.

  

### 

  

(ii) In addition, from and after the Closing Date, U.S. Sellers shall provide
coverage under a group health plan sponsored by U.S. Sellers to any
"qualified beneficiary" (as defined in COBRA) with respect to any former
employee of U.S. Sellers, Target Companies or any of their respective
Subsidiaries who experienced a "qualifying event" (as defined in COBRA) on or
prior to the Closing Date and who is not a Retained Employee, until the
earlier of (A) the date U.S. Sellers, and any member of the controlled group
of corporations or the group of trade or businesses under common control that
includes any U.S. Seller, cease to sponsor or maintain any group health plan
or (B) the end of the applicable coverage continuation period prescribed by
COBRA. At least five Business Days prior to the date U.S. Sellers, and any
member of the controlled group of corporations or the group of trades or
businesses under common control that

  



        
   

  



  

### includes any U.S. Seller, cease to sponsor or maintain any group health
plan, U.S. Sellers will provide U.S. Buyer with (1) a list of all "qualified
beneficiaries" who were eligible for or were receiving COBRA as of the
Closing Date, such list to include the name of each such qualified
beneficiary and the date he or she experienced a "qualifying event" and (2)
an updated list of such qualified beneficiaries as of the plan cessation
date.

  

### 

  

### (iii) If, following the Closing, any U.S. Seller or Target Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries fails to satisfy its obligations pursuant to
_Section 6(o)(i)_, then U.S. Sellers shall pay to U.S. Buyer as Buyers sole
remedy and as liquidated damages an aggregate amount equal to $5,000,000,
which amount shall then be paid by U.S. Sellers to U.S. Buyer as an
administrative priority expense under sections 503(b) and 507(a)(1) of the
Code.

  

### 

  

(p) _Bankruptcy Release_.  Except for rights granted under and claims
pursuant to this Agreement and all documents executed in connection herewith
or related hereto, the Confidentiality Agreement or any other agreement
between either Buyer or Guarantor, on the one hand, and Sellers or their
respective Subsidiaries (other than the Target Companies), on the other hand,
Sellers, on their own behalf and on the behalf of each of their Affiliates
(collectively, the " _Releasing Parties_ "), effective as of Closing, hereby
release, acquit and forever discharge Buyers, Guarantor, the Target Companies
and each of their respective Subsidiaries and each of their respective
present directors, officers and employees (collectively, the " _Released

including all Avoidance Actions, which the Releasing Parties have or may come
to have against the Released Parties, in each case, solely in connection to
the ownership or operation of the Business prior to the Closing, whether

any officers, directors or employees for any gross negligence, willful
misconduct, violation of state of federal securities laws, theft, fraud,

Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , this release shall not release (i) any
claim, known or unknown, by any Seller against the Tiwest Joint Venture
Participants or Tiwest and (ii) any claims relating to the creation and
formation of Sellers as a spin-off from Kerr-McGee Corporation, including all
claims against Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Kerr-McGee Corporation and

predecessors, successors, directors, officers or Representatives, including
all such claims that have been, could have been or could be asserted in civil
action _Tronox Worldwide LLC and Tronox LLC v. Anadarko Petroleum Corporation,
et al._ (Case No. 09 01198) against any parties other than the Target
Companies and their Subsidiaries (the " _Released Claims_ "). The Releasing
Parties covenant not to sue the Released Parties on account of any Released
Claim. The Sale Order shall provide that (A) the release of the Released
Claims shall be final upon entry of the Sale Order and such release shall
forever release, discharge and expunge such Released Claims, (B) no order
shall be entered in the Chapter 11 Cases that in any way waives, limits or
modifies the release or any rights of the Released Parties under the release
or this Agreement and (C) the release shall survive any dismissal of the
Chapter 11 Cases.

  



        
   

  



  

(q) _Confidentiality_.

  



  

(i) The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force
and effect until the Closing, at which time such Confidentiality Agreement
and the obligations of the Parties thereunder shall terminate.  If this
Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. Nothing in
this _Section 6(q)_ shall be deemed to limit Sellers right to comply with
the Bidding Procedures Order or any other order entered into in the Chapter
11 Cases or otherwise to discharge their duties as debtors in the Chapter 11
Cases.

  

### 

  

(ii) On or after the Closing, Sellers will, and will cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries (other than the Target Companies and Tiwest) to hold,

applicable law, regulation or court or other governmental order) all
confidential information concerning Buyers, the Target Companies, the Tiwest
Joint Venture, Tiwest, any of their respective Subsidiaries, the Acquired
Assets or the Acquired Business, (including any confidential information or
documents provided pursuant to _Section 6(f)_), except to the extent that

any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives, (B) later lawfully
acquired by Sellers on a non-confidential basis from sources other than
Buyers or their respective Affiliates or Representatives, but only to the
extent that any such source is not bound, to Sellers Knowledge, by a
confidentiality agreement with Buyers or any of their respective Affiliates
or Representatives or (C) produced under a protective order in response to a
valid discovery request in civil action _Tronox Worldwide LLC and Tronox LLC
v. Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, et al._ (Case No. 09 01198); _provided_
,  _however_ ; that Sellers shall exercise reasonable best efforts to
obtain assurance that confidential treatment shall be accorded to any
such confidential information that is being disclosed.

Department of Environmental Protection (the " _NDEP_ ") that provides
reasonable assurances to U.S. Buyer that the NDEP will not seek to hold U.S.
Buyer liable or otherwise responsible for the Henderson Legacy Contamination
unless the Henderson Legacy Contamination is materially exacerbated by the
actions of Buyer or its Representatives after the Closing. Sellers shall
reasonably assist U.S. Buyer in arranging such meetings and shall attend such
meetings with the NDEP as may be reasonably necessary to persuade the NDEP to
issue a comfort letter to U.S. Buyer, shall provide any and all information
and assurances reasonably requested by the NDEP in connection with the
comfort letter request, and shall use reasonable best efforts to assist U.S.
Buyer in obtaining a comfort letter reasonably acceptable to U.S. Buyer prior
to the Closing Date. Each Party shall be responsible for its own expenses
incurred in obtaining the comfort letter from the NDEP.

### 

  

### (iii) If Buyers terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8(a)(ii)_
(other than for failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7(a)(iii)_ or 
_7(a)(iv)_ (other than with respect to a Decree of the Bankruptcy Court)),
or _8(a)(x)_ , and a definitive agreement with respect to a Competing
Transaction or Restructuring Transaction is executed on or prior to twelve
months following the date of termination of this Agreement, then, in addition
to the Reimbursable Expenses, Buyers shall also be entitled to a cash fee
equal to three percent (3%) of the Sales Proceeds (the " _Break-Up Fee_

Business Days) following the consummation of such Competing Transaction or

### (iv) If Buyers terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8(a)(iv)_,

Affiliates in the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to the
terms hereof, and any claim, right or cause of action by either Buyer or any
other Person against Sellers or their respective Affiliates in excess of any
Break-Up Fee and Reimbursable Expenses is hereby fully waived, released
and forever discharged; _provided_ , _however_ , that no termination
or payment shall relieve Sellers from Liability for any losses or damages
(but subject to the limitation in _Section 8(c)(x)_) suffered as a
result of the transactions contemplated hereby not being consummated in the
event of (x) any willful termination of this Agreement by Sellers to pursue
(1) a Competing Transaction, (2) a Restructuring Transaction or (3) any other
sale of the Tiwest Joint Venture Interests, Target Companies or the assets of
the U.S. Sellers or Tronox Australia that would not constitute a Competing

Agreement, in each case of clause (x), (y) and (z), occurring after entry of
the Sale Order; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event shall Sellers and
their respective Affiliates be liable, at equity or at law, for any losses or

reduction of any kind whatsoever.

  



        
   

  



  

### (viii) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 9(j)_, the payment of

_however_ , that no termination or payment shall relieve either Buyer or
Guarantor from Liability for any losses or damages (but subject to the
limitation in _Section 8(c)(x)_) suffered as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby not being consummated in the event of (x) any willful,
grossly negligent or fraudulent breach of any representations and warranties
but solely to the extent such breach would result in a failure of the

any covenants which breach could reasonably be expected to result in a
failure of the condition set forth in _Section 7(b)(ii)_) set forth in this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall either Buyer,
Guarantor and their respective Affiliates be liable, at equity or at law, for
any losses or damages of any kind in excess of $62,250,000 in the aggregate.

  

###

Agreement shall be construed as an implied amendment or agreement to amend or
modify any provision of this Agreement. No waiver by any party hereto of any
default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder,
whether intentional or not, shall be valid unless the same shall be in
writing and signed by the party hereto making such waiver, nor shall such
waiver be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default,
misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in
any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent default,
misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant. No conditions, course
of dealing or performance, understanding or agreement purporting to modify,
vary, explain or supplement the terms or conditions of this Agreement shall
be binding unless this Agreement is amended or modified in writing pursuant
to the first sentence of this _Section 9(d)_ except as expressly provided

laws relating to creditors rights and general principles of equity to either
Buyer;

  

#### 

  

#### (B) any modification, amendment, consent, extension, forbearance or
waiver of or any consent to departure from this Agreement that may be agreed
to by either Buyer;

  

#### 

  

#### (C) any action or inaction by Sellers under or in respect of this
Agreement, any failure, lack of diligence, omission or delay on the part of
any Seller to enforce, assert or exercise any right, power or remedy
conferred on any Seller in this Agreement;

  

#### 

  

#### (D) any merger or consolidation of either Buyer, Guarantor or any of
their respective Affiliates into or with any Person, or any sale, lease or
transfer of any of the assets of the Parties or any other Person to any other
Person;

  

#### 

  

#### (E) any change in the ownership of any of the Parties or any Person; or

  



        
   

  



  

#### (F) any other occurrence, circumstance, happening or event, whether
similar or dissimilar to the foregoing and whether foreseen or unforeseen,
which otherwise might constitute a legal or equitable defense or discharge of
the liabilities of a guarantor or surety or which otherwise might limit
recourse against Guarantor or any other Person.

  

#### 

  

### (iii) Guarantor hereby unconditionally waives (A) any and all notices,
including promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance of this Agreement and
any other notice with respect to any of the Guarantied Obligations and this
Agreement, (B) any presentment, demand, performance, protest, notice of non-
payment as the same pertains to either Buyer, suit or the taking of other
action by any Seller against, and any other notice to, Guarantor with respect
to any of the Guarantied Obligations, (C) any right to require any Seller to
proceed against either Buyer or to exhaust any security held by any Seller or
to pursue any other remedy with respect to any of the Guarantied Obligations,
(D) any defense based upon an election of remedies by Sellers, unless the
same would excuse performance by either Buyer under this Agreement with
respect to any of the Guarantied Obligations and (E) any duty of Sellers to
advise Guarantor of any information known to Sellers regarding either Buyer
or its ability to perform under this Agreement with respect to any of the
Guarantied Obligations. Each Seller may at any time and from time to time
without notice to or consent of Guarantor and without impairing or releasing
the obligations of Guarantor hereunder, with respect to any of the Guarantied
Obligations, (1) agree with either Buyer to make any change in the terms of
the Guarantied Obligations, (2) take or fail to take any action of any kind
in respect of any security for the Guarantied Obligations, (3) exercise or
refrain from exercising any rights against either Buyer or others, or (4)
compromise or subordinate the Guarantied Obligations, including any security
therefor. Any other suretyship defenses are hereby waived by Guarantor with
respect to any of the Guarantied Obligations.

  

### 

  

### (iv) The provisions of this _Section 9(u)_ shall continue to be
effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if (A) at any time and to the
extent that any payment of any of the Guarantied Obligations is rescinded or
must otherwise be returned by the payee thereof to either Buyer or Guarantor
upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar event of either
Buyer or Guarantor, all as though such payment had not been made or (B) the
obligations of Guarantor under this _Section 9(u)_, with respect to any of
the Guarantied Obligations, are released in consideration of a payment of
money or transfer of property by either Buyer or any other Person and to the
extent that such payment, transfer or grant is rescinded or must otherwise be
returned by the recipient thereof to either Buyer or Guarantor upon the
insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar event of either Buyer or
Guarantor, all as though such payment, transfer or grant had not been made.
