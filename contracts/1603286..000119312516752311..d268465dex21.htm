(b) During the Interim Period, Contributor shall promptly notify Acquirer in
writing of:

 

(i) any event, condition or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to
result in any of the conditions set forth in  _Article VI_ not being
satisfied on or prior to the Closing Date;

(ii) any change, event or occurrence that has had or could reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; and

(iii) any material breach by Contributor of any covenant, obligation or
agreement contained in this Agreement;

_provided_ that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.1(b)
shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder of
Contributor or the conditions set forth in _Article VI_.

 

Section 5.2 Certain Tax Matters.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 5.2_, Contributor shall be
responsible for all Taxes incurred by or with respect to the Company, whether
resulting from the assets or operations of the Company or otherwise, for all
Tax periods or portions thereof ending on or before the Closing, other than
Taxes becoming due as a result of 

 



-20-  actions taken by or on behalf of Acquirer (including, for this purpose,
actions taken by the Company on or after the Closing Date). In the event
Acquirer pays any such Taxes, Contributor shall reimburse Acquirer therefor
within 15 days after the date on which the Taxes are paid and Contributor is
notified by Acquirer.

 

(b) Acquirer shall be responsible for all Taxes incurred by or with respect to
the Company, whether resulting from the assets or operations of the Company
or otherwise, for all Tax periods or portions thereof beginning after the
Closing. In the event Contributor pays any such Taxes, Acquirer shall
reimburse Contributor therefor within 15 days after the date on which
the Taxes are paid and Acquirer is notified by Contributor.

(c) The Parties agree that whenever it is necessary for purposes of this
_Section 5.2_ to determine the amount of any Taxes imposed or incurred by or
with respect to the contribution of the Interests for a taxable period
beginning before and ending after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ ")
that is allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on or before
the Closing Date, the determination shall be made, in the case of property or
_ad valorem_ or franchise Taxes (which are measured by, or based solely upon,
capital, debt, or a combination thereof), by prorating such Taxes ratably on a
per diem basis and, in the case of other Taxes, by assuming that such portion
of the Straddle Period ending on or prior to the Closing Date constitutes
a separate taxable period applicable to the Company and by taking into
account the actual taxable events occurring during such period (except that
exemptions, allowances, and deductions for a Straddle Period that are
calculated on an annual or periodic basis, such as the deduction for
depreciation, shall be apportioned to the period prior to and including the
Closing Date ratably on a per diem basis).

 

(d) With respect to any Tax Return attributable to a Straddle Period that is
required to be filed after the Closing Date with respect to the Company,
Acquirer shall cause such Tax Return to be prepared, cause to be included in
such Tax Return all items of income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit
required to be included therein, furnish a copy of such Tax Return
to Contributor, and cause such Tax Return to be timely filed with the
appropriate Tax Authority. Acquirer shall be responsible for the timely
payment of all Taxes due with respect to the period covered by such Tax
Return, but shall have the right to recover from Contributor the amount of
Taxes attributable to the portion of the taxable period ending on or prior to
the Closing Date pursuant to _Section 5.2(b)_.

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that transfer taxes arise
from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, such transfer taxes
shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Contributor and fifty percent (50%) by
Acquirer. Contributor shall pay or cause to be paid to the applicable Tax
Authority any transfer taxes that are required by Law to collect and remit.
Acquirer shall indemnify and hold Contributor harmless from and against its
share of any such transfer taxes within thirty (30) days of Contributors
written demand therefor. The Parties shall provide such certificates and
other information and otherwise cooperate to the extent reasonably required to
minimize transfer taxes.

 



-21- (f) Each Party shall file, to the extent required by applicable Tax Laws,
all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all Taxes
for which such Party is responsible hereunder. In addition, each Party shall
provide the other Parties with such assistance as may be reasonably requested
by such other Parties or otherwise required by applicable Tax Laws in
connection with the preparation, execution and/or filing of any Tax Return and
other related documentation, any audit or other examination by any
Governmental Authority, or any judicial or administrative proceedings
relating to liability for Taxes, and each will retain and provide the
requesting Party or Parties with any records or information which may be
relevant to such return, audit or examination, proceedings or determination. 

(g) The parties intend that for United States federal income tax purposes, (i)
the contribution of the Interests shall be treated as a contribution by
Contributor to Acquirer pursuant to Section 721(a) of the Code, subject to
Section 707 of the Code, and (ii) the distribution of the Debt Financed Cash
Consideration shall qualify as a "debt- financed transfer" under Section
1.707-5(b) of the Treasury Regulations pursuant to _Section 5.3_ of this
Agreement. Any Cash Consideration in excess of the amount treated as a "debt-
financed transfer" shall be treated (x) as a reimbursement of Contributors
preformation expenditures within the meaning of Section 1.707-4(d) of the
Treasury Regulations to the greatest extent applicable, and (y) in a
transaction subject to treatment under Section 707(a) of the Code, and its
implementing Treasury Regulations, as in part a sale, and in part a
contribution, by Contributor of the Interests. The Parties agree to file all
Tax Returns and otherwise act at all times in a manner consistent with this
intended treatment of the contribution of the Interests, the Cash
Consideration, and the Acquirer Debt, including disclosing the payment of the
Cash Consideration in accordance with the requirements of Section
1.707-3(c)(2) of the Treasury Regulations.

Section 5.3 Debt Financed Cash Consideration

 

(a) Prior to or simultaneous with the Closing and pursuant to the Term Loan
Agreement, Acquirer shall use its best efforts to borrow at least $300
million of the Cash Consideration (the " _Debt Financed Cash Consideration_ ")
under indebtedness for which Contributor bears all of the economic risk of
loss as defined by Treasury Regulation Section 1.752-2, in a manner such that
the proceeds of such borrowing are allocable to the distribution of the Debt
Financed Cash Consideration to Contributor pursuant to Treasury Regulation
Section 1.707-5(b)(1) and Temporary Treasury Regulation 1.163-8T (the full
amount of such borrowing, and any "refinancing" of such borrowing treated as
the liability it refinances pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.707-5(c), the " _Acquirer Debt_ "). 

(b) The Parties intend that, because Contributor will bear the economic risk
of loss as defined by Treasury Regulation Section 1.752-2 for the entire
amount of the Acquirer Debt, the entire amount of the Debt Financed Cash
Consideration made to Contributor shall qualify as a "debt-financed transfer"
under Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-5(b) and accordingly, such amount
will not be taken into account as part of a "disguised sale" of property
contributed to Acquirer under Treasury Regulations Section 1.707-3.

 



-22- (c) The Parties hereby agree (and agree on behalf of their respective
Affiliates) that, as of the Closing Date, the Parties (and their respective
Affiliates) have no plan to repay or otherwise reduce the principal balance of
the Acquirer Debt that is outstanding immediately after the Closing Date.

 

(d) The Parties shall act at all times in a manner consistent with the
foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.3_, except with the prior written
consent of Parent or as otherwise required by applicable Law following a final
determination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or a Governmental Authority
with competent jurisdiction.

 

Section 5.4 Repurchase of DM Common Units. The Parties shall use their best
efforts to cause 100% of the DMHC Existing Units to be repurchased by
Acquirer on the Closing Date in exchange for a cash payment from Acquirer
equal to the number of DMHC Existing Units multiplied by the volume-weighted
average trading price of a DM Common Unit on the New York Stock Exchange for
the 10-day trading period ending on the trading day immediately preceding the
Closing Date.

Section 5.5 Personnel and Services. Parent shall use its best efforts to make
arrangements reasonably satisfactory to Acquirer that provide Acquirer with
access to ongoing personnel and related services from QPC Services Company or
other Affiliates of Parent, on terms consistent with the projections provided
to the Acquirer Conflicts Committee as part of the Acquirer Conflicts
Committees evaluation of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, that are reasonably necessary or appropriate to replace the services
being performed by the employees of the Company and each Company Subsidiary as
of the Effective Date.

Section 5.6 Further Assurances; Financing Cooperation.

(a) At any time or from time to time after the Effective Date and without
further consideration, as and when requested by any Party, the requested Party
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take or to cause to be taken, all
action and to do, or cause to be done, or to execute and deliver, or cause to
be executed and delivered, all such further instruments of contribution,
transfer, conveyance, assignment, novation, confirmation or other documents,
and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other actions, as
such requesting Party may reasonably deem necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the Contemplated Transactions, as promptly as practicable or sooner
as required by this Agreement.

 

(b) Contributor shall, and shall cause the Company and each Company Subsidiary
to, provide commercially reasonable assistance with the preparation of and
any discussions regarding the business, financial statements, and management
discussion and analysis of Contributor, the Company and each Company
Subsidiary, all for use in connection with the Transaction Financings, where
Acquirer reasonably determines, in consultation with Parent, that the
inclusion of such information is required or desirable.

RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION RESULTING FROM, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND

the Parties. Except as expressly provided herein, no Party is or shall act as

adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in order that the Contemplated
