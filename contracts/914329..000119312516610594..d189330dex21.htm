THE MERGER

Section 2.01.  _The Merger_. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be
merged (the " _Merger_ ") with and into the Company in accordance with Oregon
Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and
the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_
"). The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions
of Oregon Law.

(b) Subject to the provisions of Article 9, the closing of the Merger (the "
_Closing_ ") shall take place in New York, New York at the offices of
Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West 52nd St., New York, New York 10019, as
soon as practicable (but in any event no later than four (4) Business Days)
after the date the conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of those conditions at the
Closing) have been satisfied or, to the extent permissible, waived by the
party or parties entitled to the benefit of such conditions, or at such other
place, at such other time or on such other date as Parent and the Company may
mutually agree (the " _Closing Date_ ").

 

(c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file articles of
merger with the Oregon Secretary of State and make all other filings or
recordings required by Oregon Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger
shall become effective at such time (the " _Effective Time_ ") as the articles
of merger are duly filed with the Oregon Secretary of State (or at such later
time as may be specified in the articles of merger).

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the separate existence of
Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Surviving Corporation shall possess
title to all real estate and other property owned by, and possess all
obligations, including contractual, tort, statutory and administrative
obligations of, the Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under
Oregon Law.

Section 2.02. _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof:

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b), Section 2.02(c) or
Section 2.04, (i) each Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, as well as each right to receive, or interest in, any Share or other
common equity of the Company, shall in each case be converted into the right
to receive $107.50 per Share in cash, without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "), and (ii) as of the Effective Time, all such Shares and
rights or interests shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

(b) Each Share held by the Company as treasury stock (other than Shares in an
Employee Plan of the Company) or owned by Parent or Merger Subsidiary
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment
shall be made with respect thereto.

 

(c) Each Share held by any Subsidiary of either the Company or Parent (other
than Merger Subsidiary) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into such number

 



8  of shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation such that each such
Subsidiary owns the same percentage of the outstanding capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time as such
Subsidiary owned in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d) Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock, no par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the
same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation (except for any such shares resulting from the conversion of
Shares pursuant to Section 2.02(c)).

 

Section 2.03. _Surrender and Payment_. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange
Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i)
certificates representing Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") or (ii)
uncertificated Shares (the " _Uncertificated Shares_ "). At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Certificates and the Uncertificated
Shares. Promptly after the Effective Time (but not later than five (5)
Business Days thereafter), Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange
Agent to send, to each holder of Shares at the Effective Time a letter of
transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery
of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange
Agent) for use in such exchange.

 

(b) Each holder of Shares that have been converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to
the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter
of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent
(or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated
Shares, the Merger Consideration payable for each Share represented by a
Certificate or for each Uncertificated Share, without interest. Until
so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid
or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates, Uncertificated
Shares, or any other securities pursuant to this Agreement.

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share
shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment
shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a
result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent and Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares are presented to the

 



9  Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with
the procedures set forth, in this Article 2\.

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) (and any interest or other income earned
thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares six (6) months after
the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such
holder who has not exchanged such Shares for the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this Section 2.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look
only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such
Shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none
of Parent, the Exchange Agent, Merger Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation
shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any amount paid to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 

Section 2.04. _Equity Awards_.

 

(a) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) each option to purchase
Shares outstanding under the Company Stock Plan (a " _Company Stock Option_
") that is fully vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "
_Vested Company Stock Option_ ") shall terminate and cease to represent a
right to acquire Shares, and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive
therefor an amount of cash equal to the product of (A) the number of Shares
that were purchasable upon exercise of such Vested Company Stock Option,
multiplied by (B) the excess (if any) of the Merger Consideration over the
per share exercise price of such Vested Company Stock Option, which amount
shall be payable as soon as practicable following the Effective Time (but not
later than ten (10) Business Days thereafter in any event); and (ii) each
Company Stock Option that is not fully vested as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (an " _Unvested Company Stock Option_ ") shall be assumed by
Parent and converted into an award (an " _Assumed Option_ ") representing a
right to receive a cash amount equal to the product of (x) the number of
Shares underlying the Unvested Company Stock Option that would have become
purchasable upon each future vesting date of such Unvested Company Stock
Option, multiplied by (y) the excess (if any) of the Merger Consideration
over the exercise price of such Unvested Company Stock Option (the " _Assumed
Option Merger Consideration_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, any Company Stock
Option, whether vested or unvested, with a per share exercise price greater
than or equal to the Merger Consideration shall be canceled for no
consideration as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. The right to
receive the Assumed Option Merger Consideration in respect of an
Assumed Option shall be subject to the vesting terms of the applicable
Company Stock Plan and the award agreements evidencing the corresponding
Unvested Company Stock Option, in each case, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and such Assumed Option Merger Consideration shall be
payable as soon as practicable following the applicable vesting dates (but not
later than ten (10) Business Days thereafter in any event). For purposes of
clarity, with respect to any Assumed Options held by a non-employee member of
the Board of Directors as of the date hereof, as a result of his or her
cessation of service as of the Effective Time, the Assumed Option shall
immediately vest and such director shall be entitled to be paid the
Assumed Option Merger Consideration as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Effective Time (but no later than ten (10) Business Days
thereafter in any event).

 



10 (b) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each restricted share unit
with respect to Shares granted under the Company Stock Plan, including those
units subject to performance criteria (each such unit, whether or not
performance-based, a " _Company RSU_ "), that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, whether or not vested, shall be assumed by Parent and
converted into an award (an " _Assumed RSU_ ") representing a right to receive
a cash amount equal to the product of (i) the number of Shares that would have
been delivered to the holder on each future vesting date of such Company RSU
(or on each future delivery date of such Company RSU, if such delivery date is
later than the related vesting date), multiplied by (ii) the Merger
Consideration (the " _Assumed RSU Merger Consideration_ "), and such Assumed
RSU Merger Consideration shall be payable as soon as practicable after the
applicable vesting date or delivery date applicable to the Assumed RSU (but
not later than ten (10) Business Days thereafter in any event). The right to
receive any Assumed RSU Merger Consideration in respect of Assumed RSUs shall
be subject to the vesting and delivery terms of the applicable Company Stock
Plan and the award agreements evidencing the corresponding Company RSU, in
each case, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the performance metrics relating to Company RSUs that,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, remain subject to the achievement of
such performance metrics (such Company RSUs, the " _Company PSUs_ ") shall be
deemed to have been achieved at target as of the Effective Time. For purposes
of clarity, with respect to any Assumed RSUs held by a non-employee member of
the Board of Directors as of the date hereof, as a result of his or her
cessation of service as of the Effective Time, the Assumed RSU shall
immediately vest and such director shall be entitled to be paid the Assumed
RSU Merger Consideration as soon as reasonably practicable following the
Effective Time (but no later than ten (10) Business Days thereafter in any
event).

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors (or, if appropriate,
any committee thereof administering the Company Stock Plan) shall adopt
resolutions and provide any notices as are necessary to provide for the
transactions contemplated by this Section 2.04.

(d) The Company shall ensure that (i) no new offering periods under the ESPP
will commence during the period from the date of this Agreement through the
Effective Time; (ii) there will be no increase in the amount of payroll
deductions permitted to be made by the participants under the ESPP during the
current offering periods, except those made in accordance with payroll
deduction elections that are in effect as of the date of this Agreement; and
(iii) no individuals shall commence participation in the ESPP during the
period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time.
The accumulated contributions of the participants in the current offering
periods shall be used to purchase Shares as of no later than ten (10) Business
Days prior to the Effective Time, and the participants purchase rights under
such offerings shall terminate immediately after such purchase. As of no
later than the Business Day immediately prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall terminate the ESPP.

 

Section 2.05. _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Shares shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class (including by
reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination,
exchange or readjustment of Shares or similar transaction, or stock dividend
thereon with a record date during such period, but excluding any change that
results from any exercise of options outstanding as of the date hereof to
purchase Shares granted under the

 



11  Companys stock option or compensation plans or arrangements), the Merger
Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall
be appropriately adjusted to provide Parent and the holders of Shares and
equity awards of the Company the same economic effect for the aggregate Shares
and equity awards of the Company held thereby, as applicable, as contemplated
by this Agreement prior to such event. For the avoidance of doubt, there
shall be no adjustment to the Merger Consideration as a result of any cash
dividend paid by the Company or its Subsidiaries in compliance with the
provisions of this Agreement.

 

Section 2.06. _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax law. If the
Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so
withholds amounts and remits such amounts to the applicable Governmental
Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the holder of Shares or other Person, as applicable, in
respect of which the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as
the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

Section 2.07. _Lost Certificates_ _._ _ _ If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the Shares represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article
2\.

ARTICLE 3

Section 3.01. _Articles of Incorporation_. The Company Articles shall be

action on the part of the Company and, except for the filing of articles of
merger with respect to the Merger with the Oregon Secretary of State pursuant
to Oregon Law and the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, no other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize
this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
Company has duly executed and delivered this Agreement and, assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Subsidiary, this
Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms (subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
other laws affecting creditors rights generally and general principles of
equity).

(b) At a meeting duly called and held, the Board of Directors has unanimously

Merger be submitted to a vote of the Companys stockholders, each of which
resolutions have not been rescinded, modified or withdrawn in any way as of
the date of this Agreement.

 

(c) The affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a majority
of the outstanding Shares, voting together as a single class (the " _Company
Stockholder Approval_ "), at the Company Stockholders Meeting, is the only
vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Company
necessary to approve this Agreement and approve the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 4.03. _Governmental Authorization_. The execution, delivery
and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby require no action by or in
respect of, filing with, notification to, or approval or consent of, any
Governmental Authority, other than (a) the filing of articles of merger with
respect to the Merger with the Oregon Secretary of State and appropriate
documents with the relevant authorities of other states in which the Company
is qualified to do business, (b) compliance with any applicable requirements
of the HSR Act and competition, merger control, antitrust or similar
Applicable Law of any jurisdiction outside of the United States (" _Foreign

laws, including the filing with the SEC of a proxy statement relating to the
Company Stockholders Meeting (as amended or supplemented from time to time,
the " _Proxy Statement_ "), (d) compliance with any applicable rule of Nasdaq
and (e) any actions or filings the absence of which would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company.

Section 4.04. _Non-contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance by
the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby do not and will not (a) contravene, conflict with, or
result in any violation or breach of any provision of the Company Articles or
bylaws of the Company or the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or
equivalent organizational documents) of any Subsidiary of the Company, (b)
assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 4.03, contravene,
conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any provision of any
Applicable Law, (c) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in

constitute a default under, or cause or permit the termination,
cancellation, acceleration or other change of any right or obligation or the
loss of any benefit to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
entitled under any provision of any agreement or other instrument binding upon
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their properties or assets
or (d) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any property or
asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, with only such exceptions, in
the case of each of clauses (b) through (d), as would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company.

 

Section 4.05. _Capitalization_. (a) The authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of 70,000,000 Shares and 500,000 shares of preferred stock,

similar) rights.

 

(b) Except as (i) set forth in this Section 4.05, (ii) as set forth in Section
4.05 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and (iii) for changes since May 25,
2016 resulting from the exercise of Company Stock Options outstanding on such
date or settlement of Company RSUs outstanding on such date, there are no

shares, stock appreciation rights, performance units, contingent value
rights, "phantom" stock or similar securities or rights that are derivative
of, or provide economic benefits based, directly or indirectly, on the value
or price of, any capital stock or voting securities of the Company (the items
in clauses (A) through (D) being referred to collectively as the " _Company
Securities_ ").

(c) None of (i) the Shares or (ii) the Company Securities are owned by any
Subsidiary of the Company.

(d) There are no stockholder agreements or voting trusts to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, and no outstanding obligations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire

rights, anti-dilutive rights, rights of first refusal or similar rights with
respect to any Shares. There is no stockholder rights plan, "poison pill" or
similar device in effect with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company.

Section 4.06. _Subsidiaries_. (a) Each Subsidiary of the Company has been duly
organized, is validly existing and (where applicable) in good standing (or
equivalent concept to the extent applicable) under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization, has all organizational powers and all
governmental licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and
approvals required to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and
carry on its business as now conducted, except for those licenses,
authorizations, permits, consents and approvals the absence of which has not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Each such Subsidiary is
duly qualified to do business

 



15  as a foreign entity and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such
qualification is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure to be
so qualified has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,

All Subsidiaries of the Company and their respective jurisdictions of
organization are set forth in Section 4.06(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

(b) All of the outstanding capital stock and other voting securities of, and
ownership interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company has been duly

preemptive (or similar) rights and is owned by the Company, directly or
indirectly, free and clear of any Lien and free of any transfer
restriction (other than transfer restrictions of general applicability as may

the Companys Subsidiaries that are owned by the Company or a wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company, there are no issued, reserved for issuance or

employment, severance or similar contract, plan, practice, arrangement or
policy and each other plan or arrangement (written or oral) providing for
compensation, bonuses, profit-sharing, stock option or other stock related
rights or other forms of incentive or deferred compensation,
vacation benefits, insurance (including any self-insured arrangements),

copies of all material Employee Plans (and, if applicable, all related trust

without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Company nor any
of its their ERISA Affiliates has engaged in any transaction described in
Section 4069 or Section 4204 or 4212 of ERISA.

obligated to contribute to, any "multiemployer plan," as defined in Section

contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control,
within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA, and neither the Company nor any
ERISA Affiliate nor any predecessor thereof has incurred any material
liability to a Multiemployer Plan as a result of a complete or partial
withdrawal from such Multiemployer Plan, as those terms are defined in Part I
of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA, that has not been satisfied in full.

not required to be paid, accrued in accordance with GAAP.

(e) Except as would not be material to the business of the Company or its

(either alone or together with any other event) (i) entitle any employee or
other service provider of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to severance
pay or accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or
funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits
under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation
pursuant to, any Employee Plan or (ii) result in any limitation on the right
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or

former employee or other service provider of the Company or any of its

Section 280G of the Code. No Employee Plan provides for the gross-up or
reimbursement of Taxes under Sections 4999 or 409A of the Code, or otherwise.

(f) No Employee Plan provides health, medical, life insurance or other
welfare benefits to current or former employees or other service providers of
the Company or its Subsidiaries beyond their retirement or other termination
of employment, except as required to avoid an excise tax under Section 4980B
of the Code or similar laws.

provided Parent with the identity of the Third Party making the Acquisition
Proposal, the terms and conditions thereof and an unredacted copy of any
written materials comprising such Acquisition Proposal, (y) if requested to
do so by Parent, for a period of five (5) days following

 



35  delivery of such notice, the Company shall have discussed and negotiated in
good faith, and shall have made its Representatives available to discuss and
negotiate in good faith, with Parent and Parents Representatives, any _bona
fide_ proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
(z) no earlier than the end of such five (5) day period, the Board of
Directors shall have concluded, after considering the terms of any amendment
or modification to this Agreement offered by Parent during such period in a
form capable of being accepted by the Company so as to become binding on
Parent, and after consultation with its financial advisor and outside
legal counsel, that such Superior Proposal still constitutes a Superior
Proposal and that the failure to either effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change or terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors under Oregon
Law (it being understood and agreed that any change to the financial or other
material terms of a proposal that was previously the subject of a notice
hereunder shall require a new notice to Parent as provided above; _provided,
however_ , that with respect to each such changed proposal, each reference in
the preceding clauses (w), (y) or (z) to a period of "five (5) days" shall be
changed to "two (2) days" in respect of such changed proposal).

(iii) In the event that an Intervening Event has occurred after the date
hereof, the Board of Directors may make an Adverse Recommendation Change in
respect of such Intervening Event; _provided_ that (A) the Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors under Oregon
Law, and (B) prior to effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change, (x) the
Company has given Parent at least five (5) days prior written notice of its
intention to effect such Adverse Recommendation Change (which notice shall
include a reasonable description of such Intervening Event and the reasons for
the Board of Directors intention to effect such Adverse Recommendation
Change), (y) if requested to do so by Parent, for a period of five (5) days
following delivery of such notice, the Company shall have discussed and
negotiated in good faith, and shall have made its Representatives available
to discuss and negotiate in good faith, with Parent and Parents
Representatives, any _bona fide_ proposed modifications to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, and (z) no earlier than the end of such five
(5) day period, the Board of Directors shall have concluded, after considering
the terms of any amendment or modification to this Agreement offered by Parent
during such period in a form capable of being accepted by the Company so as
to become binding on Parent, and after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that that the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in
respect of such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors under Oregon
Law (it being understood and agreed that any material change to the
circumstances giving rise to the Intervening Event that was previously the
subject of a notice hereunder shall require a new notice to Parent as
provided above; _provided, however_ , that with respect to each such material
change, each reference in the preceding clauses (x), (y) or (z) to a period of
"five (5) days" shall be changed to "two (2) days" in respect of such
materially changed circumstances).

 



36 In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors
from complying with Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation
M-A promulgated under the 1934 Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ that such Rules and Items will in no way eliminate or modify the
effect that any action taken or statement made pursuant thereto would
otherwise have under this Agreement; and _provided_ , _further_ , __ that any
such action taken or statement made that relates to an Acquisition Proposal
shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Board of
Directors publicly, definitively and without qualification reaffirms the
Company Board Recommendation in such statement or in connection with such
action.

 

(c) _Required Notices_. The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no
event later than twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt by the Company (or any
of its Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries with
respect thereto or that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, including the identity of the Third Party making the Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry, the material terms and conditions thereof and an
unredacted copy of any written materials, proposals or agreements received in
connection therewith, and all correspondence relating thereto, and shall keep
Parent reasonably informed as to the status (including changes to the terms)
of such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry on a reasonably prompt basis, and
within twenty-four (24) hours of any material developments or changes to the
material terms thereof. The Company shall also notify Parent promptly (but in
no event later than twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt by the Company of
any request for non-public information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets, books or
records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party that the
Company should reasonably be expected to believe may be considering making, or
has made, an Acquisition Proposal or inquiry with respect thereto.

(d) _Definition of Superior Proposal_. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Superior Proposal_ " means a _bona fide_ , unsolicited Acquisition Proposal
that was not solicited in violation of this Section 6.03, and (A) that if
consummated would result in a Third Party (or Third Parties as a group)
acquiring at least a majority of the outstanding Shares or all or
substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, (B) that, to the extent third party financing is required by the
party or parties proposing such Acquisition Proposal, is fully financed as
evidenced by binding customary financing commitments from one or more
nationally recognized financial institutions with cash and liquid assets in
the United States, taken together with cash and liquid assets held by the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries and by such party or parties
proposing such Acquisition Proposal, sufficient to secure funding and payment
in full of all consideration and other amounts contemplated by such
Acquisition Proposal, or to the extent third party financing is not required,
such Third Party (or Third Parties as a group) otherwise has cash and liquid
assets in the United States, taken together with cash and liquid assets held
by the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries, sufficient to secure
funding and payment in full of all consideration and other amounts
contemplated by such Acquisition Proposal, (C) is not subject to the
completion of due diligence, and (D) that the Board of Directors determines in
good faith by a majority vote, after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel, taking into account all financial, legal,
regulatory and other aspects of such proposal, including the expected timing
of such proposal and all conditions contained therein and the Third Party or
Third Parties making such Acquisition Proposal (and taking into account any
amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by Parent) is more
favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial point of view than
the Merger.

 



37 (e) _Obligation of the Company to Terminate Existing Discussions_. The Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives to, cease
immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party and its
Representatives conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry with respect thereto and shall promptly
request the return or destruction of all information furnished by the Company
or on its behalf to any such Third Party and its Representatives.

 

Section 6.04. _Proxy Statement; Company Stockholders_ __ _Meeting_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable, and no later than fifteen (15)
Business Days following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare
and file with the SEC the preliminary Proxy Statement. Subject to Section
6.03, the Company and the Board of Directors shall include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Each of the Company and Parent
shall furnish all information concerning itself and its Affiliates that is
required to be included in the Proxy Statement or that is customarily included
in proxy statements prepared in connection with transactions of the type
contemplated by this Agreement, and each covenants that none of the
information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation in
the Proxy Statement will, at the date it or any amendment or supplement
thereto is filed with the SEC or mailed to the Companys stockholders or at
the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments
of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement, and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed
to the Companys stockholders as promptly as practicable after the date on
which the Company learns that the Proxy Statement will not be reviewed or
that the SEC staff has no further comments thereon. The Company shall
promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its
staff or any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements
to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall give Parent and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement, including
all amendments and supplements thereto, prior to filing such documents with
the SEC or disseminating them to holders of Shares and a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on all responses to requests for additional
information, and shall consider any comments proposed by Parent in good faith.
If, at any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, any information
relating to the Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors should be discovered by the Company or Parent that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so
that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other parties and correct such information, and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed
with the SEC.

 



38 (b) Unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, and
notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall, as
promptly as practicable after the date on which the Company learns that the
Proxy Statement will not be reviewed or that the SEC staff has no further
comments thereon, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of
its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval
(the " _Company Stockholders_ __ _Meeting_ "), and, subject to Section
6.03(b), the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent; _provided_
, that if at any time following the dissemination of the Proxy Statement,
either the Company or Parent reasonably determines in good faith that the
Company Stockholder Approval is unlikely to be obtained at the
Company Stockholders Meeting, then on no more than two occasions (for
Company and Parent in the aggregate) and prior to the vote contemplated having
been taken, each of the Company and Parent shall have the right to require an
adjournment or postponement of the Company Stockholders Meeting for the
purpose of soliciting additional votes in favor of this Agreement; _provided,
further_ , that no such adjournment or postponement shall delay the Company
Stockholders Meeting by more than seven (7) days from the prior-scheduled
date or to a date on or after the fifth (5th) Business Day preceding the End
Date. Notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement
has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall submit
this Agreement to the stockholders of the Company for approval at the Company
Stockholders Meeting and shall not submit any Acquisition Proposal for
approval by the stockholders of the Company.

 

ARTICLE 7

COVENANTS OF PARENT

Parent agrees that:

 

Section 7.01. _Obligations of Merger Subsidiary_. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary to perform its obligations under this
Agreement.

Section 7.02. _Director and Officer Liability_. Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do the
following:

(a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers and
directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnified
Person_ ") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time in their capacity as an officer or director of the Company or
its Subsidiaries (including acts or omissions in connection with this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) to the
fullest extent permitted by Oregon Law or any other Applicable Law or
provided under the Company Articles or bylaws of the Company or the
certificate or articles of incorporation and bylaws or similar organizational
documents of the applicable Subsidiaries in effect on the date hereof;
_provided_ that such indemnification shall be subject to any limitation
imposed from time to time under Applicable Law.

 



39 (b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect provisions in the articles of incorporation and bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries (or in such
documents of any successor to the business of the Surviving Corporation or any
of its Subsidiaries) regarding elimination of liability of directors,
indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement of
expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the
corresponding provisions, as applicable, in the Company Articles or bylaws of
the Company or the articles of incorporation and bylaws or similar
organizational documents of the applicable Subsidiaries in effect on the date
of this Agreement. From and after the Effective Time, any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries regarding
elimination of liability, indemnification or advancement of expenses shall
constitute such an agreement of the Surviving Corporation or its applicable
Subsidiaries, and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with its terms.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, as of the Effective Time, obtain and fully pay the premium for
the non-cancellable extension of the directors and officers liability
coverage of the Companys existing directors and officers insurance
policies and the Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies
(collectively, " _D andO Insurance_"), in each case for a claims reporting or
discovery period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with
respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the
Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating
as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance
with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are
substantially similar to the coverage provided under the Companys existing
policies with respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading
statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed
against a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by
reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or
prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions or actions contemplated hereby); _provided_ that in no event
shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such
policies an aggregate premium amount in excess of 300% of the current annual
premium amount paid by the Company as set forth in Section 7.02(c) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if the amount of such
insurance coverage would exceed such Premium Cap, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for
a cost not exceeding such amount. If Parent and the Surviving Corporation
for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall continue to maintain in
effect, for a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with the Companys current
insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO
Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are
substantially similar to the coverage provided under the Companys existing
policies as of the date hereof, or Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall
purchase from the Companys current insurance carrier or from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current
insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance comparable DandO Insurance for
such six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are substantially similar to those provided in the Companys
existing policies as of the date hereof; _provided_ that in no event shall
Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for

 



40  such policies an aggregate premium amount in excess of the Premium Cap; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the aggregate premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such Premium Cap, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall
be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with
respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not
exceeding such amount.

 

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent
necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 7.02.

 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.02 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under, as applicable, the Company
Articles or bylaws of the Company or certificate or articles of incorporation
and bylaws or similar organizational documents of the applicable Subsidiaries,
under Applicable Law or under any agreement of any Indemnified Person with
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights shall survive
consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Person. The obligations of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation under this Section 7.02 shall not be terminated or
modified in such manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified
Person without the consent of such Indemnified Person.

 

(f) The Surviving Corporation shall pay all expenses, including reasonable
fees and expenses of counsel, that an Indemnified Person may incur in
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this Section
7.02.

(g) The Surviving Corporation shall pay on an as-incurred basis the fees and
expenses of such Indemnified Person (including the reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel) in advance of the final disposition of any action, suit,
proceeding or investigation that is the subject of the right
to indemnification, _provided_ that such Person shall undertake to reimburse
the Surviving Corporation for all amounts so advanced if a court of competent
jurisdiction determines, by a final, nonappealable order, that such Person is
not entitled to indemnification.

Section 7.03. _Employee Benefit Plan Matters_.

 

(a) As of and subsequent to the Effective Time, Parent shall: (i) assume and
honor employee bonus plans, change in control and severance plans and
agreements and other retention plans and agreements listed in Section 4.17(a)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule; _provided_ that nothing herein shall
prohibit Parent from amending, suspending or terminating any such plan
or arrangement to the extent permitted by its terms and Applicable Law; (ii)
for a period of not less than twelve (12) months after the Effective Time,
provide the employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time during the period they continue to be employed by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and/or its Subsidiaries on and after the
Effective Time (the " _Covered Employees_ ") base compensation, incentive
opportunities (other than equity incentive compensation opportunities, which
in all cases will be consistent with the

 



41  opportunities, policies and plans applicable to similarly situated employees
of Parent and its Subsidiaries), severance (based on severance arrangements as
in effect on the date of this Agreement and listed on Section 4.17(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule) and employee benefits (including retirement,
group health, life, disability, vacation and severance plans) that are not
less favorable in the aggregate to each Covered Employee than were provided
by the Company or its Subsidiaries to such Covered Employee immediately prior
to the Effective Time; (iii) provide all Covered Employees with service credit
for purposes of eligibility, participation, vesting and levels of
benefits under any employee benefit or compensation plan, program or
arrangement adopted, maintained or contributed to by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation and/or their Subsidiaries in which Covered Employees are eligible
to participate (the " _Parent Plans_ ") for all periods of employment with
the Company or its Subsidiaries (or any predecessor entities) prior to the
Effective Time to the same extent as such Covered Employee was entitled,
before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar
Employee Plan in which such Covered Employee participated or was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Effective Time, and with Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates on and
after the Effective Time; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply (A)
for any purpose under any defined benefit pension plan or retiree welfare
plan, (B) for purposes of any Parent Plan under which similarly-situated
employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior
service, (C) for purposes of any Parent Plan that is grandfathered or frozen,
either with respect to level of benefits or participation or (D) to
the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits
with respect to the same period of service; (iv) use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations, eligibility
waiting periods or required physical examinations under any Parent Plan to be
waived with respect to the Covered Employees and their eligible dependents, to
the extent waived under the corresponding plan in which the applicable Covered
Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (v) use
commercially reasonable efforts to give the Covered Employees and their
eligible dependents credit for the plan year in which the Effective Time (or
commencement of participation in a plan of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation) occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket
limits for expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time (or the date of
commencement of participation in any Parent Plan).

 

(b) If requested by Parent not less than ten (10) Business Days before the
Closing Date, the Company shall adopt resolutions and take such corporate
action as is necessary to terminate the Employee Plans that are United States
Tax-qualified defined contribution plans (collectively, the " _Company DC
Plan_ "), effective as of the day prior to the Closing Date. The form
and substance of such resolutions and any other actions taken in connection
with the foregoing termination shall be subject to the reasonable review and
approval of Parent. Upon the distribution of the assets in the accounts under
the Company DC Plan to the participants, Parent shall permit the Covered
Employees who are then actively employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries to make
rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the
meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code), in the form of cash, from the
Company DC Plan to the applicable tax-qualified defined contribution plans of
Parent or its Subsidiaries.

 

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof (and in any
event prior to the Closing Date), the Company shall, or shall cause its
applicable Subsidiary to, take all action necessary to fulfill all
consultation and notification requirements, and obtain all approvals from, any
unions, works councils or other labor organizations, whether required pursuant
to 

 



42  Applicable Law or otherwise. Any written or oral communications to the
employees, officers or directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that relate to or are affected
by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be previously
approved in writing by Parent, it being agreed that Parent and the Company
shall cooperate, including by providing Parent a reasonable period of time to
review and approve any such communication, in providing any such mutually
agreeable communication.

(d) Without limiting the generality of Section 11.07, the provisions of this
Section 7.03 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and
no current or former employee or other service provider or other individual
associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party
beneficiary of this Agreement. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall (i)
constitute or be deemed to be an amendment to any Employee Plan or any other
compensation or benefit plan, program or arrangement of the Company, Parent
or any of their respective Subsidiaries for any purpose; (ii) guarantee
employment for any period of time, or preclude the ability of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to terminate any employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any reason; or (iii) require Parent or
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to continue
any Employee Plan, employee benefits plans or arrangements or prevent the
amendment, modification or termination thereof, in accordance with the terms
thereof and Applicable Law.

effect as of the date hereof), any Applicable Law, the JPM Credit Agreement
(as in effect on the date hereof) or any Material Contract (so long as the

assistance with the preparation of materials for presentations, offering
memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents required in connection with the
Financing; (C) furnishing the report of the Companys auditor on the most
recent audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and using its reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of

placement agents, as applicable, in connection with the Financing; (D) as
promptly as reasonably practicable furnishing Parent and its financing sources
with (1) audited consolidated balance sheets and related consolidated
statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity and cash flows

least forty (40) days before the Closing Date, in each case prepared in
accordance with GAAP; and (E) furnishing any additional financial statements,
schedules or other financial data relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries

promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees, but
excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the costs of the Companys preparation
of its annual and quarterly financial statements) incurred by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives in connection
with the Financing pursuant to this Section 8.12(a), and shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs
or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing and any information used in connection therewith,
except with respect to any information provided by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any fraud or intentional misrepresentation, willful
misconduct or material breach of this Agreement by any such Persons.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein or in the
Confidentiality Agreement, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall be permitted to
disclose information about the Company and its Subsidiaries (including
information otherwise subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement)
as necessary and consistent with customary practices in connection with the
Financing subject to customary confidentiality arrangements in connection
therewith.

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, deliver all
notices, cooperate with Parent and take all other actions to facilitate the
termination at the Closing of all commitments in respect of the Existing
Credit Agreements, the repayment in full on the Closing Date of all
obligations in respect of the indebtedness under each Existing Credit
Agreement, and the release on the Closing Date of any Liens securing all such
indebtedness and guarantees in connection therewith. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall use
reasonable best efforts and shall cooperate with Parent to obtain and deliver
to Parent at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date an executed
payoff letter with respect to each Existing Credit Agreement (the " _Payoff
Letters_ "), in form and substance customary for transactions of this type,
from the applicable agent on behalf of the Persons to whom such indebtedness
is owed, which Payoff Letter together with any related release documentation
shall, among other things, include the payoff amount and provide that Liens
(and guarantees), if any, granted in connection with each Existing Credit
Agreement relating to the assets, rights and properties of the Company and
its Subsidiaries securing such indebtedness shall, upon the payment of the
amount set forth in the applicable Payoff Letter (and cash collateralization
or other arrangements with respect to the letters of credit or bank
guarantees) at or prior to the Closing, be released and terminated. The
obligations of the Company pursuant to this Section 8.12(b) shall be subject
to Parent providing all funds required to effect all such repayments (or other
arrangements) at or prior to the Closing.

representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the relevant
party that are contained in the corresponding Section of this Agreement and
(b) any other representations and warranties of such party that are contained
in this Agreement, but only if the relevance of that reference as an
exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and
warranties would be readily apparent to a reasonable person who has read that
reference and such representations and warranties, without any
independent knowledge on the part of the reader regarding the matter(s) so
disclosed. The inclusion of an item in either the Company Disclosure Schedule
or the Parent Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or
warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a
material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item

with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties and
may have been qualified by certain disclosures not reflected in the text of
this Agreement. Accordingly, Persons

 



56  other than the parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties

the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party
hereto, except that Parent or Merger Subsidiary may transfer or assign its
rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or, from time to time,
in part, to one or more of its Affiliates at any time;  _provided_ that such

tried and determined only in the Delaware Chancery Court or, if such court
shall not have jurisdiction, any federal court located within the State of
Delaware or other Delaware state court, and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding
and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection
that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such
suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or
proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any
party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any
such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of

Section 11.11. _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.

Section 11.13.  _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in
order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 11.14.  _Specific Performance_. _ _ The parties hereto agree that

 _Section 2.1._ _ _ _Annual Meetings._ Annual meetings of shareholders for
the election of directors, and for such other business as may be stated in
the notice of the meeting, shall be held at such place, either within or
without the State of Oregon, and at such time and date as the Board of

the meeting. At each annual meeting, the shareholders entitled to vote shall
elect a Board of Directors and they may transact such other corporate business
as shall be stated in the notice of the meeting.

 

 _Section 2.2._ _ _ _Special Meetings._ Special meetings of the shareholders
for any purpose or purposes may be called by the Chairman of the Board, the
President or the Secretary, or by resolution of the Board of Directors.

 

 _Section 2.3._ _ _ _Voting._ Each shareholder entitled to vote in accordance
with the terms of the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation and these
Bylaws may vote in person or by proxy, but no proxy shall be voted after
eleven months from its date unless such proxy provides for a longer period.
All elections for directors shall be decided by plurality vote; all other
questions shall be decided by majority vote except as otherwise provided by
the Articles of Incorporation or the laws of the State of Oregon.

 

A complete list of the shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged
in alphabetical order, with the address of each, and the number of shares
held by each, shall be open to the examination of any shareholder, for any
purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period
of at least ten days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city
where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice
of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to
be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the
meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any
shareholder who is entitled to be present.

_Section 2.4._ _ _ _Quorum._ Except as otherwise required by law, by the
Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation or by these Bylaws, the presence,
in person or by proxy, of shareholders holding shares constituting a majority
of the voting power of the Corporation shall constitute a quorum at all
meetings of the shareholders. In case a quorum shall not be present at any
meeting, a majority in interest of the shareholders entitled to vote thereat,
present in person or by proxy, shall have the power to adjourn the meeting
from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting,
until the requisite amount of stock entitled to vote shall be present. At any
such adjourned meeting at which the requisite amount of stock entitled to
vote shall be represented, any business may be transacted that might have been
transacted at the meeting as originally noticed; but only those shareholders
entitled to vote at the meeting as originally noticed shall be entitled to
vote at any adjournment or adjournments thereof. _Section 2.5_ _ _ _Notice Of Meetings._ Written notice, stating the place,
date and time of the meeting, and the general nature of the business to be
considered, shall be given to each shareholder entitled to vote thereat, at

thereat.

 

 _Section 2.6._ _ _ _Action Without Meeting._ If the Articles of Incorporation
of the Corporation so provide, any action required or permitted to be taken
at any annual or special meeting of shareholders may be taken without a
meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing,
setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of
outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would
be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares
entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Action taken by nonunanimous
written consent is effective when the consent or consents bearing sufficient
signatures are delivered to the Corporation, unless the consent or consents
specify an earlier or later effective date. The Corporation must give written
notice of the action taken by nonunanimous written consent promptly after the
action is taken to (a) shareholders who did not consent in writing to the
action and (b) if the Oregon Business Corporation Act requires that notice of
the proposed action be given to nonvoting shareholders (shareholders not
entitled to vote on the proposed action), to such nonvoting shareholders. Such
notice must be accompanied by the same material that, under the Oregon
Business Corporation Act, would have been required to be sent to such
shareholders in a notice of meeting at which the proposed action would have
been submitted to the shareholders for action.

 

If the Oregon Business Corporation Act requires that notice of proposed action
be given to nonvoting shareholders (shareholders not entitled to vote on the
proposed action) and the action is to be taken by unanimous written consent of
the voting shareholders, the corporation must give such nonvoting shareholders
written notice of the proposed action at least ten days before the action
is taken. Such notice, if required, must be accompanied by the same material
that, under the Oregon Business Corporation Act, would have been required to
be sent to such shareholders in a notice of meeting at which the proposed
action would have been submitted to the shareholders for action.

_ARTICLE III - DIRECTORS_

 

 _Section 3.1._ _ _ _Number And Term._ The business and affairs of the
Corporation shall be managed under the direction of a Board of Directors
which shall consist of not less than one person. The exact number of directors
shall initially be one and may thereafter be fixed from time to time by the

resignation shall be made in writing, and shall take effect at the time
specified therein, and if no time be specified, at the time of its receipt by

resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.

_Section 3.3._ _ _ _Vacancies._ If the office of any director becomes
vacant, the remaining directors in the office, though less than a quorum, by a
majority vote, may appoint any qualified person to fill such vacancy, who
shall hold office for the unexpired term and until his or her successor shall
be duly chosen. If the office of any director becomes vacant and there are no

of shares constituting a majority of the voting power of the Corporation, at a
special meeting called for such purpose, may appoint any qualified person to
fill such vacancy. _Section 3.4._ _ _ _Removal._ Except as hereinafter provided, any director
or directors may be removed either for or without cause at any time by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power entitled to

meeting, by the affirmative vote of holders of shares constituting a majority
of the voting power of the Corporation.

 

 _Section 3.5._ _ _ _Committees._ The Board of Directors may, by resolution
or resolutions passed by a majority of the whole Board of Directors,
designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more

Directors, or in these Bylaws, shall have and may exercise all the powers and
authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and
affairs of the Corporation, and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to
be affixed to all papers which may require it.

 

 _Section 3.6._ _ _ _Meetings._ The newly elected directors may hold their
first meeting for the purpose of organization and the transaction of
business, if a quorum be present, immediately after the annual meeting of the
shareholders; or the time and place of such meeting may be fixed by consent of
all the directors.

 

Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held without notice at such
places and times as shall be determined from time to time by resolution of
the Board of Directors.

Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by the Chairman of
the Board or the President, or by the Secretary on the written request of any
director (except that notice to any director may be waived in writing by such
director) and shall be held at such place or places as may be determined by
the Board of Directors, or as shall be stated in the call of the meeting. If
notice of a special meeting is delivered by personal delivery, by telephone,
in person, by facsimile transmission, or by private courier, the notice shall
be effective if delivered at least one day before the meeting. If notice of a
special meeting is delivered by mail, the notice shall be effective if
deposited in the official government mail at least five days before the
meeting.

 

Unless otherwise restricted by the Articles of Incorporation of the
Corporation or these Bylaws, members of the Board of Directors, or
any committee designated by the Board of Directors, may participate in any
meeting of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof by means of a
conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all
persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such
participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at the meeting.

_Section 3.7._ _ _ _Quorum._ A majority of the Directors shall constitute a
quorum for the transaction of business. If at any meeting of the Board of
Directors there shall be less than a quorum present, a majority of those
present may adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum is obtained,
and no further notice thereof need be given other than by announcement at the
meeting which shall be so adjourned. The vote of the majority of the
Directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act
of the Board of Directors unless the Articles of Incorporation of the
Corporation or these Bylaws shall require the vote of a greater number.

 

 _Section 3.8._ _ _ _Compensation._ Directors shall not receive any stated
salary for their services as directors or as members of committees, but by
resolution of the Board of Directors a fixed fee and expenses of attendance
may be allowed for attendance at each meeting. Nothing herein contained shall
be construed to preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any
other capacity as an officer, agent or otherwise, and receiving compensation
therefor. _Section 3.9._ _ _ _Action Without Meeting._ Any action required or
permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any
committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if a written consent thereto
is signed by all members of the Board of Directors or of such committee, as
the case may be, and such written consent is filed with the minutes of
proceedings of the Board of Directors or such committee.

stock of the Corporation shall be of such form and device as the Board of
Directors may from time to time determine. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Board of Directors of the Corporation may provide for and authorize the issue
of some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock without
certificates as uncertificated shares. Any such authorization shall not apply
to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered
to the Corporation. Notwithstanding the adoption of such a provision by the

certificate signed by, or in the name of, the Corporation by the officers of
the Corporation representing the number of shares registered in
certificate form.

_Section 5.2._ _ _ _Lost Certificates._ A new certificate of stock (or
uncertificated shares) may be issued in the place of any certificate
theretofore issued by the Corporation, alleged to have been lost or destroyed,
and the Board of Directors may, in its discretion, require the owner of the
lost or destroyed certificate, or such owners legal representatives, to give
the Corporation a bond, in such sum as they may direct, not exceeding double
the value of the stock, to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that
may be made against it on account of the alleged loss of any such
certificate, or the issuance of any such new certificate (or uncertificated
shares).

_Section 5.3._ _ _ _Transfer of Shares._ The shares of stock of the
Corporation shall be transferable only upon its books by the holders thereof
in person or by their duly authorized attorneys or legal representatives, and
upon such transfer any old certificates shall be surrendered to the
Corporation by the delivery thereof to the person in charge of the stock and
transfer books and ledgers, or to such other person as the Board of Directors
may designate, by whom they shall be cancelled, and new certificates (or
uncertificated shares) shall thereupon be issued. A record shall be made of
each transfer and whenever a transfer shall be made for collateral security,
and not absolutely, it shall be so expressed in the entry of the transfer.

_Section 5.4._ _ _ _Shareholders Record Date._ In order that the Corporation
may determine the shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting
of shareholders or any adjournment thereof, or to express consent to corporate
action in writing without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any
dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to
exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock
or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of   Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the
date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board
of Directors and which record date: (1) in the case of determination of
shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders or adjournment
thereof, shall, unless otherwise required by law, not be more than seventy nor
less than ten days before the date of such meeting; (2) in the case of
determination of shareholders entitled to express consent to corporate action
in writing without a meeting, shall not be more than ten days from the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Directors; and (3) in the case of any other action, shall not be more than
seventy days prior to such other action. If no record date is fixed: (1) the
record date for determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a
meeting of shareholders shall be at the close of business on the day next
preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is
held; (2) the record date for determining shareholders entitled to express
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting when no prior action
of the Board of Directors is required by law, shall be the first day on which
a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be
taken is delivered to the Corporation in accordance with applicable law, or,
if prior action by the Board of Directors is required by law, shall be at the
close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the
resolution taking such prior action; and (3) the record date for determining
shareholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the
day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.
A determination of shareholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at
a meeting of shareholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting;
provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for
the adjourned meeting. 

_Section 5.5._ _ _ _Dividends._ Subject to the provisions of the Articles of
Incorporation of the Corporation, the Board of Directors may, out of funds
legally available therefor at any regular or special meeting, declare
dividends upon stock of the Corporation as and when they deem appropriate.
Before declaring any dividend there may be set apart out of any funds of the
Corporation available for dividends, such sum or sums as the Board of
Directors from time to time in their discretion deem proper for working
capital or as a reserve fund to meet contingencies or for
equalizing dividends or for such other purposes as the Board of Directors
shall deem conducive to the interests of the Corporation.

_Section 5.6._ _ _ _Seal._ The corporate seal of the Corporation (if any)
shall be in such form as shall be determined by resolution of the Board of
Directors. Said seal may be used by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be
impressed or affixed or reproduced or otherwise imprinted upon the subject
document or paper.

_Section 5.7._ _ _ _Fiscal Year._ The fiscal year of the Corporation shall
end on December 31 unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors.

 

 _Section 5.8._ _ _ _Checks._ All checks, drafts or other orders for the
payment of money, notes or other evidences of indebtedness issued in the name
of the Corporation shall be signed by such officer or officers, or agent or
agents, of the Corporation, and in such manner as shall be determined from
time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors.

_Section 5.9._ _ _ _Notice and Waiver of Notice._ Whenever any notice is
required to be given under these Bylaws, personal notice is not required
unless expressly so stated, and any notice so required shall be deemed to be
sufficient if given by depositing the same in the United States mail, postage
prepaid, addressed to the person entitled thereto at his or her address as it
appears on the records of the Corporation, and such notice shall be deemed to
have been given on the day of such mailing. Shareholders not entitled to vote
shall not be entitled to receive notice of any meetings except as otherwise
provided by law. Whenever any notice is required to be given under the
provisions of any law, or under the provisions of the Articles of
Incorporation of the Corporation or of these Bylaws, a waiver thereof,
in writing and signed by the person or persons entitled to said notice,
whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to
such required notice. _ARTICLE VI - AMENDMENTS_

 

These Bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed at any annual meeting of the
shareholders (or at any special meeting thereof if notice of such proposed
alteration, amendment or repeal to be considered is contained in the notice of
such special meeting) by the affirmative vote of the holders of shares
constituting a majority of the voting power of the Corporation. Except
as otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation,
the Board of Directors may by majority vote of those present at any meeting at
which a quorum is present alter, amend or repeal these Bylaws, or enact such
other Bylaws as in their judgment may be advisable for the regulation and
conduct of the affairs of the Corporation; provided, however, that the
shareholders, in amending or repealing a particular Bylaw, may provide
expressly that the Board of Directors may not amend or repeal that Bylaw.

_ARTICLE VII - INDEMNIFICATION_

 

 _Section 7.1._ _ _ _Directors and Officers._ _ _ The Corporation shall
indemnify to the fullest extent not prohibited by law any current or former
officer or director who is made, or threatened to be made, a party to an
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative,
investigative or otherwise (including an action, suit or proceeding by or in
the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that the person is or was
acting as a director, officer or agent of the Corporation or as a fiduciary
within the meaning of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974 with respect to any employee benefit plan of the Corporation, or serves
or served at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer, or as a
fiduciary of an employee benefit plan, of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise. The indemnification specifically
provided hereby shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which
such person may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of shareholders
or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in the official
capacity of the person indemnified and as to action in another capacity while
holding such office.

 

 _Section 7.2. Employees and Other Agents_. The Corporation shall have power
to indemnify its employees and other agents as set forth in the Oregon
Business Corporation Act.

_Section 7.3._ _ _ _No Presumption of Bad Faith_. The termination of any
proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo
contendere or its equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that
the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which the person
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that the person had
reasonable cause to believe that the conduct was unlawful.

 

 _Section 7.4._ _ _ _Advances of Expenses_. The expenses incurred by a
director or officer in any proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in
advance at the request of the director or officer, in writing or by electronic
transmission, if the director or officer:



     | (a) | furnishes the Corporation a written affirmation of such
persons good faith belief that such person is entitled to be indemnified by
the Corporation; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | furnishes the Corporation a written undertaking to repay
such advance to the extent that it is ultimately determined by a court that
such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation. Such
advances shall be made without regard to the persons ability to repay such
expenses and without regard to the persons ultimate entitlement to
indemnification under this Article VII or otherwise. 
---|---|--- _Section 7.5._ _ _ _Enforcement._ Without the necessity of entering into an
express contract, all rights to indemnification and advances under this
Article VII shall be deemed to be contractual rights and to be effective to
the same extent and as if provided for in a contract between the Corporation
and the director or officer who serves in such capacity at any time while
this Article VII and relevant provisions of the Oregon Business Corporation
Act and other applicable law, if any, are in effect. Any right to
indemnification or advances granted by this Article VII to a director or
officer shall be enforceable by or on behalf of the person holding such right
in any court of competent jurisdiction if (a) the claim for indemnification or
advances is denied, in whole or in part, or (b) no disposition of such claim
is made within ninety (90) days of request therefor. The claimant in such
enforcement action, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be
paid also the expense of prosecuting a claim. It shall be a defense to any
such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses
incurred in connection with any proceeding in advance of its final disposition
when the required affirmation and undertaking have been tendered to
the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which
make it permissible under the Oregon Business Corporation Act for the
Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden
of providing such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of
the Corporation (including the Board of Directors, its independent legal
counsel or its shareholders) to have made a determination prior to a
commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in
the circumstances because the claimant has met the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in the Oregon Business Corporation Act, nor an actual
determination by the Corporation (including the Board of Directors,
its independent legal counsel or its shareholders) that the claimant has not
met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or
create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of
conduct.

 

 _Section 7.6._ _ _ _Non-Exclusivity of Rights._ The right conferred on any
person by this Article VII shall not be exclusive of any other right which
such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the
Articles of Incorporation, these Bylaws, agreement, vote of shareholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in the persons
official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office.
The Corporation is specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts
with any or all of its directors, officers, employees or agents respecting
indemnification and advances, to the fullest extent permitted by the law.

_Section 7.7._ _ _ _Survival of Rights._ The right conferred on any person by
this Article VII shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
director, officer, employee or other agent and shall inure to the benefit
of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

_Section 7.8._ _ _ _Insurance._ To the fullest extent permitted by the Oregon
Business Corporation Act, the Corporation, upon approval by the Board of
Directors, may purchase insurance on behalf of any person required or
permitted to be indemnified pursuant to this Article VII.

 

 _Section 7.9._ _ _ _Amendments._ Any repeal of or modification or amendment
to this Article VII shall only be prospective and no repeal or modification
hereof shall adversely affect the rights under this Article VII in effect at
the time of the alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that is
the cause of any proceeding against any agent of the Corporation.

_Section 7.10._ _ _ _Savings Clause._ If this Article VII or any
portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent
jurisdiction, the Corporation shall indemnify each director, officer or other
agent to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of this
Article VII that shall not have been invalidated, or by any other applicable
law.

_Section 7.11._ _ _ _Certain Definitions._ For the purposes of this Article
VII, the following definitions shall apply:



     | (a) | The term "proceeding" shall be broadly construed and shall
include, without limitation, the investigation, preparation, prosecution,
defense, settlement and appeal of any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative. 
---|---|--- include without limitation, expense of investigations, judicial or
administrative proceedings or appeals, attorneys fees and disbursements and
any expenses of establishing a right to indemnification under Section 7.5 of
this Article VII, but shall not include amounts paid in settlement by the
indemnified party or the amount of judgments or fines against the indemnified
party.  
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | The term "Corporation" shall include, in addition to the
resulting or surviving corporation, any constituent corporation (including any
constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if
its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to
indemnify its directors, officers, employees or agents, so that any person who
is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent
corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent
corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same
position under the provisions of this Article VII with respect to the
resulting or surviving corporation as the person would have with respect to
such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) | References to a "director," "officer," "employee," or
"agent" of the Corporation shall include, without limitation, situations where
such person is serving at the request of the Corporation as a director,
officer, employee, trustee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | References to "other enterprises" shall include employee
benefit plans; references to "fines" in the Oregon Business Corporation Act
shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an
employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the
Corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or
agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involved services by,
such director, officer, employee, or agent with respect to an employee
benefit plan, its participants, or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in
good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in the
interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan
shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests
of the Corporation" as referred to in this Article VII.
