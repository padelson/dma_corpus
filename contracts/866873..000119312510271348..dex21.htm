v AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of November 24, 2010 (this "
_Agreement_ "), among Blue Acquisition Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
_Parent_ "), Blue Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Del Monte Foods Company, a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ")
has (i) determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and the
stockholders of the Company, and declared it advisable, to enter into this
Agreement with Parent and Merger Sub providing for the merger (the " _Merger_
") of Merger Sub with and into the Company in accordance with the Delaware
General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein and (ii) approved this Agreement in accordance
with the DGCL;

WHEREAS, the respective board of directors of Parent and Merger Sub has each
determined that it is in the best interests of their respective stockholders,
and the board of directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub has declared it
advisable for Parent and Merger Sub, respectively, to enter into this
Agreement; and

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition to the willingness of the Company to enter into this
Agreement, each of KKR 2006 Fund L.P., Vestar Capital Partners V, L.P.,
Centerview Capital, L.P. and Centerview Employees, L.P. (collectively, the "
_Guarantors_ ") is entering into a guarantee with the Company
(collectively, the " _Guarantees_ ") pursuant to which each of the Guarantors
is guaranteeing certain obligations of Parent and Merger Sub in connection
with this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as
follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the
Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the "
_Surviving Corporation_ ").

Section 1.2 _Closing; Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of
Article VII, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place
at the offices of Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher LLP, 200 Park Avenue, New York, New
York, at 10:00 a.m. local time, on the second Business Day after the
satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable law) of the
conditions set forth in Article VII (excluding conditions that by their terms
cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of those conditions). Notwithstanding the immediately preceding
sentence, if the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than
those conditions that  by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
fulfillment or waiver of those conditions), then the Closing shall occur
instead on the date following the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions
that is the earlier to occur of (a) any Business Day before or during the
Marketing Period as may be specified by Parent on no less than two (2)
Business Days prior notice to the Company and (b) the final day of the
Marketing Period. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is hereinafter
referred to as the " _Closing Date_." At the Closing, the parties hereto shall
cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the
relevant provisions of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such
date and time as the Certificate of Merger is filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware or at such later time (or subsequent date and
time) as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of
Merger. The date and time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred
to in this Agreement as the " _Effective Time_."

 

Section 1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects
set forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective
Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the
Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_.

(a) Subject to Section 6.7(b), at the Effective Time, the certificate of
incorporation of the Company shall be amended so that it reads in its entirety
as set forth in _Exhibit A_ annexed hereto, and, as so amended, shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with its terms and as provided by law.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of
the Company or Merger Sub, the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger, be the bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with their
terms, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and as
provided by law.

Section 1.5 _Directors and Officers_. The directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until their respective successors
and assigns are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death,
resignation or removal. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation,
each to hold office until the earlier of their resignation or removal.

 



2 ARTICLE II

EFFECTS OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT

CORPORATIONS 

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities:

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company
(the " _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, other than any shares of Company Common Stock (" _Shares_
") described in Section 2.1(b) and any Dissenting Shares, shall be converted
into the right to receive $19.00 in cash (the " _Merger Consideration_ ")
payable to the holder thereof, without interest, in the manner provided in
Section 2.3. All Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 2.1 shall be automatically
cancelled and shall cease to exist. If, between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, there is any change in the number of outstanding Shares as
a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split,
stock dividend, subdivision, combination or exchange of shares with respect
to, or rights issued in respect of, Shares, the Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted accordingly, without duplication, to provide to the holders
of Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such event;

(b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share owned
by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Shares held on behalf of third parties) shall be canceled and shall cease to
exist without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be
made with respect thereto, and any Shares owned by any wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company shall remain outstanding, and no cash or other consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

 

(c) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become
one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation and, together with any Shares that remain outstanding
pursuant to Section 2.1(b), shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation; and

(d) Such Shares with respect to which appraisal shall have been properly
demanded in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ")
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at
or after the Effective Time unless and until the holder of such Shares
withdraws such holders demand for appraisal (in accordance with Section
262(k) of the DGCL) or becomes ineligible for such appraisal, but rather, the
holder of the Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to payment of the fair
value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. If
a holder of Dissenting Shares shall withdraw (in accordance with Section
262(k) of the DGCL) the demand for such appraisal or shall become ineligible
for such appraisal, then, as of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such
event, whichever last occurs, each of such holders Dissenting Shares shall
cease to be a Dissenting Share and shall be deemed to be converted into and
represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration. At the Effective
Time, the Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and

 



3  shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
such rights provided in the preceding two sentences. The Company shall give
Parent prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of Shares and Parent shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall
not make any payments with respect to, or compromise or settle any demand for,
appraisal without the prior written consent of Parent.

Section 2.2 _Stock Options, Performance Shares_.

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, unless otherwise agreed
between Parent and any individual holder, each then-outstanding option to
purchase Shares (a " _Company Stock Option_ ") granted under any director or
employee stock option or compensation plan or arrangement of the Company
(collectively, the " _Company Stock Plans_ "), whether or not vested or
exercisable, shall become fully vested and exercisable contingent upon the
Effective Time, and shall be converted into the right to receive, and the
Company shall pay to each former holder of any such fully vested converted
Company Stock Option at or promptly after the Effective Time an amount in
cash equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the applicable exercise price per Share of such Company
Stock Option and (ii) the number of Shares such holder could have purchased
had such holder exercised such Company Stock Option in full immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

 

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-outstanding
performance share unit (" _PSU_ ") shall become fully earned and vested
contingent upon the Effective Time with respect to the maximum number of
Shares underlying such award as set forth in the terms of the agreement
granting such PSU (" _PSU Agreement_ ") and the Company shall pay to each
grantee of each PSU, at or promptly after the Effective Time, an amount in
cash equal to the Merger Consideration for each such fully vested PSU (which
payment shall be deemed to be the issuance of the appropriate number of
Shares and receipt of the Merger Consideration, as provided in Section 2.1(a),
to the extent required by the terms of such PSUs PSU Agreement).

 

(c) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-outstanding
performance accelerated restricted stock unit award (" _PARS_ ") shall become
fully earned and vested contingent upon the Effective Time with respect to
100% of the Shares set forth in the terms of the agreement granting such PARS
(" _PARS Agreement_ ") and the Company shall pay to each grantee of each
PARS, at or promptly after the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the
Merger Consideration for each such fully earned and vested PARS (which payment
shall be deemed to be the issuance of the appropriate number of Shares and
receipt of the Merger Consideration, as provided in Section 2.1(a), to the
extent required by the terms of such PARS Agreement).

(d) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-outstanding
restricted stock unit or deferred stock unit that vests based on the passage
of time, other than PARSs or Deferred Equity Units (" _RSU_ ") shall, to the
extent not previously earned and vested, contingent upon the Effective Time,
be deemed fully earned and vested, and the Company shall pay to each grantee
of each RSU, at or promptly after the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal
to the Merger Consideration for each such RSU.

 



4 (e) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, all amounts held in
participant accounts and denominated in Company Common Stock under the
Companys AIP Deferred Compensation Plan or the Companys Non-Employee
Director Deferred Compensation Plans, shall become fully vested contingent
upon the Effective Time and shall, unless otherwise agreed by Parent and an
individual participant in one or more of such plans, be converted into an
obligation to pay cash with a value equal to the product of (i) the Merger
Consideration and (ii) the number of Shares deemed held in such participant
accounts (" _Deferred Equity Units_ "), which shall be deemed to be the
issuance of the appropriate number of Shares and receipt of the Merger
Consideration, as provided in Section 2.1(a), to the extent required by the
terms of the Companys AIP Deferred Compensation Plan and the Company Stock
Plans. Each of the Companys 2003 and 2005 Non-Employee Director Deferred
Compensation Plans, the Del Monte Corporation Executive Deferred Compensation
Plan, effective December 20, 2001 (as amended and restated as of December 31,
2004), the Deferred Compensation Plan, effective October 1, 2009 and the
elective deferral account of the Companys AIP Deferred Compensation Plan
shall be terminated prior to the Effective Time in accordance with the
provisions of Treas. Reg. 1.409A-3(j)(ix)(B) and all obligations thereunder
shall be paid at or before the Effective Time. 

(f) Unless a later time for payment is expressly provided in this Section
2.2 or is otherwise agreed to between Parent and an individual holder, the
Company shall pay the holders of Company Stock Options, PSUs, PARS, RSUs and
Deferred Equity Units the cash payments described in this Section 2.2 promptly
after the Effective Time, but in any event not later than the second (2nd)
Business Day after the Effective Time. 

Section 2.3 _Surrender of Shares_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement (in
a form reasonably acceptable to the Company) with a paying agent reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the stockholders of the Company
in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to receive the Merger
Consideration to which the stockholders of the Company shall become entitled
pursuant to Section 2.1. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent sufficient funds to
make all payments pursuant to Section 2.1. Such funds may be invested by the
Paying Agent as directed by Parent, _provided_ that (i) no such investment or
losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of
Company Common Stock and following any losses Parent shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the stockholders of
the Company in the amount of any such losses and (ii) such investments shall
be in short term obligations of the United States of America with maturities
of no more than 30 days or guaranteed by the United States of America and
backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America. Any
interest or income produced by such investments will be payable to the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as Parent directs.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event not later than
the third Business Day following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause to be mailed to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of
an outstanding certificate or outstanding certificates (" _Certificates_ ")
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares,
which have converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration with
respect 

 



5  thereto pursuant to Section 2.1(a), a form of letter of transmittal (which
shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such person shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of Certificates to the Paying Agent) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates. Upon
surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share
formerly represented by such Certificate and such Certificate shall then be
canceled. Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event not later than
the third Business Day following the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall
issue and deliver to each holder of uncertificated Shares represented by
book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") a check or wire transfer for the amount
of cash that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(a) of
this Agreement in respect of such Book-Entry Shares, without such holder
being required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal
to the Paying Agent, and such Book-Entry Shares shall then be canceled. No
interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer
of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of
the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that such Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred and that
the person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such
Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.3(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by this
Article II.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall cooperate
to establish procedures with the Paying Agent and the Depository Trust
Company (" _DTC_ ") to ensure that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to
11:30 a.m. (New York time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit
to DTC or its nominees on the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately
available funds equal to the number of Shares held of record by DTC or such
nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Merger
Consideration (such amount, the " _DTC Payment_ "), and (ii) if the Closing
occurs after 11:30 a.m. (New York time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent
will transmit to DTC or its nominees on the first Business Day after the
Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to the
DTC Payment.

(d) At any time following the date that is six (6) months after the
Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to it or its designee any funds (including any interest received with
respect thereto) that have been made available to the Paying Agent and that
have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares and
thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to Parent and the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws)
only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration
payable upon due surrender of their Certificates and Book-Entry Shares. The
Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of 

 



6  the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of Shares for the Merger
Consideration. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any person for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. All cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance
with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by
such Certificates.

 

(e) After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Shares that were outstanding prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for transfer such Certificates shall be canceled and exchanged
for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set
forth, in this Article II.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent,
the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement any amount as may be required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax laws. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of
whom such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Paying Agent.

(g) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the holders compliance with the replacement requirements
established by the Paying Agent, including making an affidavit to that effect
and, if necessary, the posting by the holder of a bond in customary amount as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to the Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in
exchange for the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the Shares represented by such Certificate
pursuant to this Article II.

that could adversely affect the availability of the Financing other than as
expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments delivered to the Company
prior to the date hereof. Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or
other fees in connection with the Financing Commitments that are payable on
or prior to the date hereof, and as of the date hereof the Financing
Commitments are in full force and effect and are the legal, valid, binding and
enforceable obligations of Parent and Merger Sub, as the case may be, and, to
the knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub, each of the other parties thereto.
There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the
funding of the full amount of the Financing, other than as expressly set forth
in the Financing Commitments. As of the date hereof, subject to the accuracy
of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article III,
no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on
the part of Parent or Merger Sub or, to the knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub,
any other party thereto under any of the Financing Commitments. As of the date
hereof, subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in Article III, Parent has no reason to believe that any of
the conditions to the Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments
applicable to it will not be satisfied. Assuming the Financing is funded

 



22  in accordance with the Financing Commitments, Parent and Merger Sub will
have at and after the Closing funds sufficient to (i) pay the Merger
Consideration, (ii) pay any and all fees and expenses required to be paid by
Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation in connection with the Merger
and the Financing, (iii) pay for any refinancing of any outstanding
indebtedness of the Company contemplated by this Agreement or the Financing
Commitments and (iv) satisfy all of the other payment obligations of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation contemplated hereunder.

Section 4.8 _Operations of Parent and Merger Sub_. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub has been formed solely for the purpose of engaging in
the transactions contemplated hereby and prior to the Effective Time will
have engaged in no other business activities and will have incurred no
liabilities or obligations other than as contemplated herein. The authorized
capital stock of Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of which 10 shares are validly issued and outstanding.
All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at the
Effective Time will be, owned by Parent. 

Section 4.9 _Ownership of Shares_. Neither Parent nor Merger
Sub beneficially owns any Shares and neither Parent nor Merger Sub holds any
rights to acquire or vote any Shares except pursuant to this Agreement.
Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is, and at no time during the last three years
has been, an "interested stockholder" of the Company, as such quoted terms
are defined in Section 203 of the DGCL.

 

Section 4.10 _Vote/Approval Required_. No vote or consent of the holders
of any class or series of capital stock of Parent is necessary to adopt this
Agreement or the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby. The vote or
consent of Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub (which shall have
occurred immediately following execution of the Agreement) is the only vote
or consent of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of Merger
Sub necessary to adopt this Agreement or the Merger or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

Section 4.11 _Solvency_. Assuming (i) satisfaction of the conditions to
Parents obligation to consummate the Merger, or waiver of such conditions,
(ii) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set
forth in Article III hereof (for such purposes, such representations and
warranties shall be true and correct in all material respects without giving
effect to any knowledge, materiality or "Material Adverse Effect"
qualification or expectation) and (iii) any estimates, projections or
forecasts of the Company and its subsidiaries have been prepared in good
faith based upon assumptions that were and continue to be reasonable, and
after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Financing, any alternative financing and the payment of the
Merger Consideration, any other repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated
in this Agreement or the Financing Commitments, payment of all amounts
required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and payment of all related fees and expenses, the
Surviving Corporation will be Solvent as of the Effective Time and immediately
after the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. For the
purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Solvent_ " when used with respect to
any person, means that, as of any date of determination, (a) the amount of the
"fair saleable value" of the assets of such person will, as of such date,
exceed the sum of (i) the value of all "liabilities of such person, including
contingent and other liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted terms are
generally determined in

 



23  accordance with applicable laws governing determinations of the insolvency
of debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay the probable
liabilities of such person, as of such date, on its existing debts (including
contingent and other liabilities) as such debts become absolute and mature,
(b) such person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount
of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or
proposed to be engaged following such date, and (c) such person will be able
to pay its liabilities, as of such date, including contingent and other
liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of this definition, "not have an
unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay its
liabilities, as of such date, including contingent and other liabilities, as
they mature" means that such person will be able to generate enough cash from
operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to
meet its obligations as they become due.

 

Section 4.12 _Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, the Guarantors have delivered to the Company the duly executed
Guarantees. As of the date hereof, the Guarantees are in full force and effect
and are valid, binding and enforceable obligations of the Guarantors. As of
the date hereof, no event has occurred, which, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, would constitute a default on the part of the Guarantors
under the Guarantees.

 

Section 4.13 _Absence of Certain Agreements_. As of the date hereof,
neither Parent nor any of its affiliates has entered into any agreement,
arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether oral or written), or
authorized, committed or agreed to enter into any agreement, arrangement or
understanding (in each case, whether oral or written), pursuant to which: (i)
any stockholder of the Company would be entitled to receive consideration of a
different amount or nature than the Merger Consideration or pursuant to which
any stockholder of the Company agrees to vote to adopt this Agreement or
agrees to vote against any Superior Proposal; or (ii) any current employee of
the Company has agreed to (x) remain as an employee of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries following the Effective Time at compensation levels in
excess of levels currently in effect (other than pursuant to any employment
Contracts with the Company and its subsidiaries in effect as of the date
hereof), (y) contribute or roll-over any portion of such employees
Shares, Company Stock Options, or other equity awards to the Company or its
subsidiaries or Parent or any of its affiliates or (z) receive any capital
stock or equity securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or Parent
or any of its affiliates.

Section 4.14 _Interests in Competitors_. As of the date hereof, neither
Parent nor Merger Sub owns any interest(s) in any entity or person that
derives a substantial portion of its revenues from a line of business within
the Companys principal lines of business.

 

Section 4.15 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Article IV, the Company
acknowledges that none of Parent, Merger Sub or any other person on behalf of
Parent or Merger Sub makes any other express or implied representation or
warranty with respect to Parent or Merger Sub or with respect to any other
information provided to the Company.

its officers, employees or representatives, including financing sources, may
from time to time reasonably request (it being agreed, however, that the
foregoing shall not permit Parent or its officers, employees or
representatives to conduct any environmental testing or sampling).

where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of
its clients, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the Company or its

parties will make appropriate substitute arrangements under circumstances in

proposals or offers that could constitute Acquisition Proposals, including by
way of providing access to non-public information to any person pursuant to
(but

 



29  only pursuant to) a confidentiality agreement on customary terms not
materially more favorable to such person than those contained in the
KKR/Centerview Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that such
confidentiality agreements need not prohibit the making or amendment of an
Acquisition Proposal) (an " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ ");

Merger Sub any material non-public information concerning the Company or its
subsidiaries that the Company provides to any person given such access that

or enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or

necessary to permit such person to make or amend an Acquisition Proposal or
otherwise engage with the Company in discussions regarding an Acquisition
Proposal or a proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal.

12:00 a.m. on the 46th calendar day after the date of this Agreement (the "
_No-Shop Period Start Date_ ") immediately cease any discussions or
negotiations with any persons that may be ongoing with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal and (ii) from the No-Shop Period Start Date until the
earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Article VIII, not (A) initiate, solicit or knowingly
encourage any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, (B) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions
or negotiations regarding, or provide any non-public information or data
concerning the Company or its subsidiaries to any person relating to, or that
could reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, (C)

Proposal.

 

(c) _Conduct Following No-Shop Period Start Date_. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary but subject to the last sentence
of this Section 6.5(c), at any time following the No-Shop Period Start Date
and prior to the time, but not after, the Company Requisite Vote is obtained,
if the Company receives a written Acquisition Proposal from any person the
Company and its Representatives may contact such person solely to clarify the
terms and conditions thereof and (i) the Company and its Representatives may
provide non-public information and data concerning the Company and its
subsidiaries in response to a request therefor by such person if the Company
receives from such person an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement;
_provided_ that the Company shall promptly make available to Parent and
Merger Sub any material non-public information concerning the Company or its
subsidiaries that the Company made available to any person given such access
which was not previously made available to Parent or Merger Sub, (ii)
the Company and its Representatives may engage or participate in any

authorize, 

 



30  adopt, approve, recommend, or otherwise declare advisable or propose to
authorize, adopt, approve, recommend or declare advisable (publicly or
otherwise) such an Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent that, (x)
prior to taking any action described in clause (i) or (ii) or (iii) above, the
Company Board or any committee thereof determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that failure to take such action could be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable law and (y)
in each such case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, the Company Board
or any appropriate committee thereof has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel) that such
Acquisition Proposal (together with any other Acquisition Proposals
contemplated by the proviso to the definition of "Superior Proposal", if
any, with respect to which discussions or negotiations remain active) either
constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to result in a
Superior Proposal, and (z) in the case referred to in clause (iii) above, the
Company Board or any appropriate committee thereof determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel) that such
Acquisition Proposal (together with any other Acquisition Proposals
contemplated by the proviso to the definition of "Superior Proposal", if any,
with respect to which discussions or negotiations remain active) is a Superior
Proposal. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding the occurrence of the
No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company may continue to engage in the
activities described in Section 6.5(a) with respect to any Excluded Parties,
including with respect to any amended proposal submitted by any Excluded
Parties following the No-Shop Period Start Date, and the restrictions in
Section 6.5(b) shall not apply with respect thereto; provided that the
provisions of Section 6.5(g) and (h) shall apply.

(d) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

 (i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any bona fide inquiry, proposal or
offer from any person or group of persons other than Parent or one of its
subsidiaries for, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, (A)
a merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
an acquisition of the Company (or any subsidiary or subsidiaries of the
Company whose business constitutes 15% or more of the net revenues, net income
or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole) or (B) the
acquisition in any manner, directly or indirectly, of over 15% of the equity
securities or consolidated total assets of the Company and its subsidiaries,
in each case other than the Merger.

 (ii) " _Excluded Party_ " means any person, group of persons or group
that includes any person (so long as such person and the other members of
such group, if any, who were members of such group immediately prior to the
No-Shop Period Start Date constitute at least 50% of the equity financing of
such group at all times following the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to
the termination of this Agreement) from whom the Company has received during
the Go-Shop Period a written Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board or
any appropriate committee thereof determines in its good faith judgment prior
to the No-Shop Period Start Date, after consultation with the Companys
financial advisor and outside counsel, is, or could reasonably be expected to
result in, a Superior Proposal, either individually or taken together with any
other Acquisition Proposals contemplated by the proviso to the definition of
"Superior Proposal", if any.

 



31 (iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means an Acquisition Proposal (with the
percentages set forth in the definition of such term changed from 15% to 50%),
that the Company Board or any appropriate committee thereof has determined in
its good faith judgment, after consultation with the Companys financial
advisor and outside counsel (A) is reasonably likely to be consummated in
accordance with its terms, taking into account all legal, financial (including
the financing terms thereof) and regulatory aspects of the proposal and the
person making the proposal, and (B) would result in a transaction more
favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial point of view than
the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (taking into account
the timing of consummation as compared to the transactions contemplated
hereby and after giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered
by Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to Section 6.5(h)); provided, however, that
a Superior Proposal may consist of multiple Acquisition Proposals that, taken
together, satisfy all of the requirements set forth in this definition.

(e) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_.
Except as set forth in this Section 6.5(e) or Section 8.3(a), the Company
Board and each committee thereof shall not:

 (i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose to
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Recommendation with respect to the Merger or authorize, adopt,
approve, recommend, or otherwise declare advisable (publicly or otherwise)
any Acquisition Proposal (it being understood that the Company Board may
refrain from taking a position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal until
the close of business as of the tenth (10th) Business Day after the
commencement of such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the
Exchange Act without such action being considered an adverse modification); or

 (ii) except if it concurrently terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.3(a), cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, acquisition agreement, merger agreement
or similar definitive agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement
referred to in Section 6.5(a) or Section 6.5(c)) (an " _Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ ") relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to
the time, but not after, the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, the Company
Board or any appropriate committee thereof may (A) withhold, withdraw, qualify
or modify the Company Recommendation or (B) approve, recommend or otherwise
declare advisable any Acquisition Proposal or publicly propose to do the
foregoing (either of clauses (A) or (B), a " _Change of Recommendation_ ")
that the Company Board or any appropriate committee thereof believes in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel) is
(together with any other Acquisition Proposals contemplated by the proviso to
the definition of "Superior Proposal", if any, with respect to which
discussions or negotiations remain active) a Superior Proposal (including any
Superior Proposal made by an Excluded Party) made after the date hereof
(giving effect to all of the adjustments to be offered to Parent pursuant to
Section 6.5(h)), if in either the case of clause (A) or (B), the Company
Board or any appropriate committee thereof determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that failure to do so

 



32  could be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law and may
also take action pursuant to Section 8.3(a) subject to compliance with this
Section 6.5.

 

 (f) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Section
6.5 shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or the Company Board or any
committee thereof from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under
U.S. federal or state law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, including
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to stockholders), or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen"
communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the
stockholders of the Company); _provided_ that the Company Board expressly
publicly reaffirms the Company Recommendation in such disclosure.

 (g) _Notice_. Within three (3) Business Days following the No-Shop
Period Start Date, the Company shall notify Parent of the number of Excluded
Parties and provide Parent with a written summary of the material terms and
conditions of any Acquisition Proposal received from an Excluded Party and,
if applicable, copies of all documents relating thereto received prior to such
date (which material terms and conditions do not have to include the identity
of the person or group of persons making the Acquisition Proposal). From and
after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company agrees that it will promptly
(and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days) notify Parent if any
proposals or offers with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are received by,
any non-public information is requested from, or any discussions or
negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, it or any of its
Representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the material terms
and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies
of any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements,
redacted, if necessary, to remove the identity of the person making the
proposal or offer or to comply with confidentiality obligations to
such person) and thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the
status and terms of any such proposals or offers (including any amendments
thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations.

 

 (h) The Company shall not be entitled to effect a Change of
Recommendation or to terminate this Agreement under 8.3(a) with respect to a
Superior Proposal unless (i) the Company has provided a written notice (a "
_Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") to Parent and Merger Sub that the Company
intends to take such action and describing the material terms and conditions
of the Superior Proposal that is the basis of such action and, if applicable,
copies of all documents relating thereto (it being understood that such
material terms need not include the identity of the person making such
proposal), (ii) during the three (3) Business Day period following Parents
and Merger Subs receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal, the Company
shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent and
Merger Sub in good faith (to the extent Parent and Merger Sub desire to
negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Financing Commitments and the Guarantees so that such Superior
Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal and (iii) following the end
of the three (3) Business Day period, the Board of the Company shall have
determined in good faith after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside counsel, taking into account any changes to this Agreement, the
Financing Commitments and the Guarantees proposed in writing by Parent and
Merger Sub in response to the Notice of Superior Proposal or otherwise, that
the Superior Proposal giving rise to the Notice of Superior Proposal
continues to constitute a

 



33  Superior Proposal. Any material amendment to the financial terms or any
other material amendment of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice
of Superior Proposal and the Company shall be required to comply again with
the requirements of this Section 6.5(h); _provided_ , _however_ , that
references to the three (3) Business Day period above shall be deemed to be
references to a two (2) Business Day period). 

Section 6.6 _Employment and Employee Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any Company Employee may
have under any Company Plan, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
each of its subsidiaries to maintain, for the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the last day of the Companys 2012 fiscal year
(the " _Protected Period_ "), the severance-related provisions of the Company
Plans set forth in Section 6.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and to
provide 100% of the severance payments and benefits provided thereunder to be
delivered to any Company Employee whose employment is terminated during such
Protected Period pursuant to circumstances that would give rise to severance
payments and benefits under such Company Plans.

(b) Without limiting any additional rights that any Company Employee may
have under any Company Plan, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
each of its subsidiaries to maintain for any Company Employee, during the
Protected Period, subject to paragraph (a) above: (i) annual cash compensation
levels (such term to mean (A) annual rate of cash base salary and wage rates,
as applicable and (B) target cash incentive opportunities (including for
participants in the AIP, opportunities based on a specified target percentage
of such Company Employees annual rate of cash base salary) that are each no
less favorable than such annual rates of base salary and wage rates, as
applicable and such target cash incentive compensation opportunities
maintained for and provided to such Company Employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (ii) health and welfare benefits and retirement benefits
provided under Company Plans, that for each category in the aggregate are no
less favorable than, such health and welfare benefits, and retirement benefits
maintained for and provided to such Company Employees immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

(c) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, give Company Employees full credit for purposes of
eligibility, participation, vesting and benefit accruals (but not for purposes
of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plans, to the extent
this credit would result in a duplication of benefits for the same period of
service), under any employee compensation and incentive plans, benefit
(including vacation but excluding for purposes of any equity incentive
compensation) plans, programs, policies and arrangements maintained for the
benefit of Company Employees as of and after the Effective Time by Parent, its
subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation for the Company Employees service
with the Company, its subsidiaries and their predecessor entities (each, a "
_Parent Plan_ ") to the same extent recognized by the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time. With respect to each Parent Plan that is a
"welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA, regardless as to
whether or not such Parent Plan is subject to ERISA), Parent or its
subsidiaries shall (i) cause there to be waived any pre-existing condition or
eligibility limitations and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible
and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by,
and amounts reimbursed to, Company

 



34  Employees under similar plans maintained by the Company and its subsidiaries
in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs.

 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will honor, and will cause
its subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with its terms, (i) each existing
Company Plan that is an employment, change in control, severance and
termination protection plan or agreement of or between the Company or any of
its subsidiaries and any officer, director or employee of that company,
equity-based or bonus plan, program or agreement and (ii) all obligations
pursuant to outstanding restoration plans, equity-based, bonus or bonus
deferral plans, programs or agreements and in respect of vested and accrued
benefits under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of the
Company or its subsidiaries and similar employment compensation and benefit
arrangements and agreements, in each of the foregoing cases referenced in
clauses (i) and (ii) above, to the extent legally binding on the Company or
any of its subsidiaries and outstanding as of the Effective Time.

(e) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its
subsidiaries, for a period commencing at the Effective Time and ending ninety
days thereafter, to not effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" as
those terms are defined in WARN affecting in whole or in part any site of
employment, facility, operating unit or Company Employee, without complying
with all provisions of WARN. 

(f) The provisions of Section 6.6(a) and 6.6(b) above shall not apply to
any Company Employee who is subject to a collective bargaining agreement set
forth on Section 3.11 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _CBAs_ "). The
terms and conditions of employment for Company Employees subject to the CBAs
shall be governed by the applicable provisions of the CBAs and any successor
agreements thereto.

 

(g) Nothing in this Section 6.6, express or implied, (i) is intended to
confer on any person (including any Company Employee) or entity, other than
the parties to this Agreement or their respective successors and assigns any
rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this
Agreement and (ii) shall constitute an amendment to any Company Plan.

Section 6.7 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any employee may have
under any employment agreement or Company Plan as in effect on the date hereof
and which has previously been made available to Parent, from the Effective
Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective
Time occurs, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (and in the
event the coverage under the directors and officers liability insurance
policies referred to in this Section 6.7 have been fully paid by all
applicable carriers or is otherwise not longer available, Parent shall)
indemnify and hold harmless each present (as of the Effective Time) and former
officer and director of the Company and its subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified
Parties_ "), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments,
inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys
fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to (i) the fact that an
Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries or is or was 

 



35  serving at the request of the Company or any of its subsidiaries as a
director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise or non-profit entity or
(ii) matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated
hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective
Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. In the event of
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (A) each
Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the
defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from the
Surviving Corporation within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by the
Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor;
_provided_ that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking, if and only to the extent then required by the DGCL, to repay
such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled
to indemnification, (B) neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall
settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any proceeding
or threatened action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim (and in which
indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder),
unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional
release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such
action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim or such Indemnified Party
otherwise consents, and (C) the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the
defense of any such matter.

(b) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present
directors and officers than are presently set forth in the Companys
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the
Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of any such individuals.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company
is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time, to obtain and fully pay the premium for the extension of (i) the
directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing
directors and officers insurance policies, and (ii) the Companys existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims reporting or
discovery period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time from
an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO
Insurance_") with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that
are no less favorable, in the aggregate, as the Companys existing policies
with respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading
statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed
against a director or officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries by
reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at
or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement
or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall the Company or the Surviving Corporation expend for
such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of
300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance
(which annual amount the Company represents and warrants is set forth on
Section 6.7(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule). If the Company and the
Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance
policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving 

 



36  Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six
years from and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the
date hereof with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that
are no less favorable, in the aggregate, as provided in the Companys existing
policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use reasonable best efforts to
purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable, in
the aggregate, as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date
hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent or the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies pursuant to this
sentence an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual
premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such
amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after
the Effective Time) is made against any Indemnified Party on or prior to the
sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions and benefits of
this Section 6.7 shall continue in full effect until the final disposition of
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

(e) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and
legal representatives. The indemnification provided for herein shall not be
deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is
entitled, whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise.

 

(f) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a
majority of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.

 

Section 6.8 _Further Action; Efforts_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each
of the parties shall use (x) its reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or

(including under any Antitrust Law) to consummate the transactions

a reasonable opportunity to discuss its content before it is filed with the
relevant Governmental Entities, and such first party shall consider and take
account of all reasonable comments timely made by the other party in this
respect;

 

(ii) furnishing to the other party all necessary information that the
other party may reasonably request in connection with filings required to be
made by such other party under Antitrust Laws;

 

(iii) promptly notifying each other of any material communications from
or with any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated

otherwise conveying particular assets, categories, portions or parts of assets

categories, portions or parts of assets or business of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time; and (iv) licensing, holding
separate or entering into similar arrangements with respect to its respective

and Parents on the other hand, compliance or failure of compliance with this

Section 6.13 _Treatment of Notes; Indentures_.

(a) If requested by Parent, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to assist Parent or an affiliate of Parent or the Company, or the
Companys operating subsidiary, Del Monte Corporation, a Delaware corporation
(" _DMC_ "), at Parents option, in commencing an offer to purchase, and
related consent solicitation with respect to, all of the outstanding aggregate
principal amount of the 6 3/4% Notes due 2015 and the 7 1/2% Notes due 2019
issued pursuant to the Indentures (as defined below) (collectively, the "
_Notes_ ") on the terms and conditions reasonably specified by Parent
(including amendments to the terms and provisions of the Indentures (as
defined below) as reasonably requested by Parent and reasonably satisfactory
to the Company)(the " _Debt Offer_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
closing of the Debt Offer

 



40  shall be conditioned on the completion of the Merger, shall provide that the
Notes shall be accepted for payment by the Surviving Corporation immediately
upon the completion of the Merger, and otherwise shall be in compliance with
applicable Laws and SEC rules and regulations.

 

(b) The Company covenants and agrees that, promptly following the consent
solicitation expiration date, assuming the requisite consents are received in
the consent solicitation constituting part of the Debt Offer, each of the
Company and its applicable subsidiaries as is necessary shall (and shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the applicable trustee to)

February 8, 2005, among DMC, as issuer, the Company, Mike Mac IHC, Inc.,
Star-Kist Samoa, Inc., Star-Kist Mauritius, Inc. and Marine Trading Pacific,
Inc., as guarantors, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (as amended or
supplemented, the " _2005 Indenture_ " and, together with the 2009 Indenture,
the " _Indentures_ "), which supplemental indentures shall implement the
amendments described in the offer to purchase, related letter of transmittal,
and other related documents (collectively, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and
shall become operative only concurrently with the Effective Time, subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the conditions to the
Debt Offer). Concurrent with the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to accept for payment and thereafter promptly pay for
the Notes that have been properly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant
to the Debt Offer and in accordance with the Debt Offer.

 

(c) Parent shall prepare all necessary and appropriate documentation in
connection with the Debt Offer, including the Offer Documents, and provide
the Company with a reasonable opportunity to comment on such documents. Parent
and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective subsidiaries to and
shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause their respective
Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with each other in the preparation of
the Offer Documents. The Offer Documents (including all amendments or
supplements) and all mailings to the holders of the Notes in connection with
the Debt Offer shall be subject to the prior review of the Company and Parent
and shall be reasonably acceptable to each of them. If at any time prior to
the completion of the Debt Offer any information in the Offer Documents
should be discovered by the Company and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, or
Parent, on the other, which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the Offer Documents, so that the Offer Documents shall not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of circumstances under which they are made, not misleading,
the party that discovers such information shall use reasonable best efforts
to promptly notify the other party, following which an appropriate amendment
or supplement describing such information shall be prepared and disseminated
to the holders of the Notes.

necessary to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their
respective obligations under this Agreement.

taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions described in or contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments and
shall not agree to any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver
of any provision or remedy under the Debt Financing Commitments without the
prior written consent of the Company if such amendments, modifications or
waivers would or would reasonably be expected to (w) reduce the aggregate
amount of the Debt Financing below the amount required to consummate the
Merger and repay or refinance the debt contemplated in this Agreement or the
Financing Commitments, (x) impose new or additional conditions to the receipt
of the Debt Financing, (y) prevent or materially delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (z) adversely impact the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against the other
parties to the Financing Commitments ( _provided_ , that, for the avoidance
of doubt, Parent and Merger Sub may replace or amend the Debt Financing
Commitments to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or
similar entities, if the addition of such additional parties, individually or
in the aggregate, would not prevent or materially delay or impair the
availability of the financing under the Debt Financing Commitments or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), including
using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt Financing
Commitments, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions and covenants
applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in the Debt Financing
Commitments (including by consummating the financing pursuant to the terms of
the Equity Financing Commitments) and otherwise comply with its obligations
thereunder, (iii) enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the
terms and conditions (including the flex provisions) contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitments (or terms and conditions no less favorable, in the
aggregate, to Parent and Merger Sub (in the reasonable judgment of Parent)
than the terms and conditions in the Debt Financing Commitments), (iv) in the
event that all conditions in the Debt Financing Commitments (other than the
availability or funding of any Equity Financing) have been satisfied,
consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to Closing, (v) enforce its rights
under the Debt Financing Commitments and (vi) in the event that all conditions
in the Debt Financing Commitments (other than the availability or funding of
any Equity Financing) have been satisfied, cause the lenders and other
persons providing Debt Financing to fund on the Closing Date the Debt
Financing required to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent
and Merger Sub shall give the Company prompt notice: (A) of any material
breach or material default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to
any material breach or material default) by any party to any Financing
Commitment or definitive document related to the Financing of which Parent or
Merger Sub become aware; (B) of the receipt of any written notice or other
written communication from any party to any Financing Commitment with respect
to any breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to any
Financing Commitment or any definitive document related to the Financing or
any provisions of the Financing Commitment or any definitive document related
to the Financing; and (C) if Parent or Merger Sub will not be able to obtain
all or any portion of the Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the
sources contemplated by the Financing Commitment or the definitive documents
related to the Financing. As soon as reasonably practicable, after the date
the Company delivers Parent or Merger Sub a written request, Parent and Merger
Sub shall provide

 



42  notice of the circumstances referred to in clauses (A), (B) or (C) of the
immediately preceding sentence. If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions)
contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitments, Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative debt financing from
alternative debt sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement upon terms and conditions not less
favorable, taken as a whole, to Parent and Merger Sub (in the reasonable
judgment of Parent) than those in the Debt Financing Commitments as promptly
as practicable following the occurrence of such event but no later than the
Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date. For the avoidance of
doubt, in no event shall any Guarantor be required to provide any financing
other than equity financing, which equity shall in no event exceed the amount
set forth in its respective Equity Commitment Letter, and in no event shall
Parent or Merger Sub be required to seek or obtain equity financing other than
the Equity Financing. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Marketing Period_ "
shall mean the first period of twenty (20) consecutive calendar days
throughout which (x) Parent shall have all of the Required Financial
Information and (y) the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 shall be
satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature can only
be satisfied at the Closing) and nothing has occurred and no condition exists
that would cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 to fail to be
satisfied, assuming that the Closing Date were to be scheduled for any time
during such twenty (20) consecutive calendar day period (provided, with
respect to Section 7.2(b), only failures to perform or comply with agreements
contained in this Agreement that would impair the ability of Parent and Merger
Sub to arrange the Debt Financing shall be considered for purposes of
determining whether such condition has been satisfied); _provided_   _that_
the Marketing Period will not be deemed to commence if prior to the completion
of the Marketing Period, (x) the Companys auditors shall have withdrawn their
audit opinion contained in the Required Financial Information or (y) the
financial statements included in the Required Financial Information that is
available to Buyer on the first day of any such 20 consecutive day period
would be required to be updated under Rule 3-12 of Regulation S-X in order to
be sufficiently current on any day during such 20 consecutive day period to
permit a registration statement using such financial statements to be declared
effective by the SEC on the last day of such 20 day period, in which case the
Marketing Period shall not be deemed to commence until the receipt by Parent
of updated Required Financial Information that would be required under Rule
3-12 of Regulation S-X to permit a registration statement using such financial
statements to be declared effective by the SEC on the last day of such new 20
day period; _provided_ that the Marketing Period shall end on any earlier date
that is the date on which the Debt Financing is obtained; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if the Company shall in good faith reasonably believe it has
delivered the Required Financial Information, it may deliver to Parent a
written notice to that effect (stating when it believes it completed such
delivery), in which case the Marketing Period shall be deemed to have
commenced on the date specified in that notice unless Parent in good faith
reasonably believes the Company has not completed delivery of the Required
Financial Information and, within three Business Days after the delivery of
such notice by the Company, delivers a written notice to the Company to that
effect (stating with reasonable specificity which Required Financial
Information Parent reasonably believes the Company has not delivered). Parent
shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable
detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts
and shall cause its subsidiaries to use reasonable best efforts, and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause its

 



43  respective Representatives to, provide to Parent and Merger Sub, at Parents
sole expense, all reasonable cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that
is necessary in connection with the Financing, including (i) furnishing
Parent and Merger Sub and their Financing sources (by a date that is not later
than forty (40) calendar days after the end of any fiscal quarter after the
date hereof that is not a fiscal year end, in respect of unaudited quarterly
financial statements required pursuant to this Section 6.15(b)), with the
unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of October 31, 2010
(and as of the end of any subsequent quarterly period that is not a fiscal
year end ended no less than forty (40) calendar days prior to the Closing
Date) and the related unaudited statements of income and cash flows, which
shall have been reviewed by the Companys accountants as provided in SAS 100
(provided that such financial statements shall be deemed delivered to Parent
and Merger Sub upon filing thereof with the SEC) and (C) such other financial
and other information as Parent shall reasonably request in order to
consummate the Debt Financing, including all Company information, financial
statements and financial data of the type required in registration statements
on Form S-1 by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act
(subject to exceptions customary for private placements pursuant to Rule 144A
promulgated under the Securities Act) and of a type and form customarily
included in private placements pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act
for financings similar to the Financing and subject to exceptions customary
for such financings (including, to the extent applicable with respect to such
financial statements, the report of the Companys auditors thereon and related
management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations) (information required to be delivered pursuant to this clause (i)
being referred to as, the " _Required Financial Information_ "), (ii)
participating in a reasonable number of meetings (including customary one-on-
one meetings with the parties acting as lead arrangers or agents for, and
prospective lenders and purchasers of, the Financing and senior management and
Representatives, with appropriate seniority and expertise, of the
Company), presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting
sessions and sessions with rating agencies in connection with the Financing,
(iii) assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency
presentations, bank information memoranda, offering documents, private
placement memoranda and similar documents required in connection with the
Financing (including requesting any consents of accountants for use of their
reports in any materials relating to the Financing and the delivery of one or
more customary representation letters), (iv) using reasonable best efforts to
obtain accountants comfort letters and legal opinions as reasonably requested
by Parent and facilitate the pledging of collateral in connection with the
Financing, including, executing and delivering any documents as may be
reasonably requested by Parent (including a certificate of the chief financial
officer of the Company with respect to solvency matters as of the Closing, on
a pro forma basis), (v) causing the taking of corporate actions (subject to
the occurrence of the Closing) by the Company and its subsidiaries reasonably
necessary to permit the completion of the Financing, (vi) facilitating the
execution and delivery at the Closing of definitive documents related to the
Financing on the terms contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments, and
(vii) cooperating with consultants or others engaged to undertake field
examinations and appraisals, including furnishing information to such persons
in respect of accounts receivable, inventory and other applicable assets;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall require such cooperation to
the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of
the Company or its subsidiaries; _provided_ , _further_ , that neither the
Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall be required to commit to take any
action that is not contingent upon the Closing (including the entry into any
agreement) or that would be effective prior to the Effective

 



44 Time. None of the Company or any of its subsidiaries shall be required to take
any action that would subject it to actual or potential liability, to bear
any cost or expense or to pay any commitment or other similar fee or make any
other payment (other than reasonable out-of-pocket costs) or incur any other
liability or provide or agree to provide any indemnity in connection with the
Financing or any of the foregoing, or the Debt Offering, prior to the
Effective Time. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
subsidiaries and the Representatives from and against any and
all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing (including any action taken in accordance with

(other than historical information relating to the Company or its subsidiaries
or other information furnished by or on behalf of the Company or its
subsidiaries) and in connection with the Debt Offer. Parent shall, promptly
upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all documented and
reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or its subsidiaries in
connection with this Section 6.15(b) and in connection with the Debt Offer.
The Company hereby consents to the reasonable use of the Companys and its
subsidiaries logos in connection with the Financing, provided that such logos
are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to
harm or disparage the Company or any of its subsidiaries or the reputation or
goodwill of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their logos and
on such other customary terms and conditions as the Company shall reasonably
impose.

(c) In no event shall Parent or any of its controlled affiliates (which
for purposes of this Section 6.15(c) shall be deemed to include the Guarantors
and the active investment funds affiliated with any of the Guarantors),
directly or indirectly, enter into any Contract, without the prior consent of
the Company, (i) awarding any agent, broker, investment banker, financial
advisor or other firm or person any financial advisory role on an exclusive
basis (or until the No-Shop Period Start Date, any firm or person other than
Centerview Partners on a non-exclusive basis) or (ii) engaging any bank or
investment bank or other potential provider of debt financing on an exclusive
basis (or otherwise on terms that prevent such provider from providing or
seeking to provide such financing to any third party in connection with a
transaction relating to the Company or its subsidiaries), in the case of
clauses (i) and (ii), in connection with the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby. Until the No-Shop Period Start Date, neither Parent nor
any of its controlled affiliates shall, directly or indirectly, seek or obtain
any equity commitments or equity financing in respect of the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated hereby, or provide any information in
respect thereof to any potential investor in Parent other than as set forth in

, _however_ , Parent and its controlled affiliates and their respective
representatives may seek and obtain equity commitments and equity financing

investment funds, managed accounts affiliated with any of the Guarantors or an
investor in a vehicle controlled or managed by an affiliate of the Guarantors
and (ii) any other person to which any of the Guarantors or any of their
respective affiliates are obligated to offer the opportunity to invest in

Agreement. Subject to this Section 6.15(c), the Company hereby agrees that
Parent and each counterparty thereto shall not be bound by its obligations
under each Confidentiality Agreement not to provide confidential information
to or enter into discussions, agreements, arrangements or 

 



45  understandings with potential sources of debt or equity financing with
respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, provided that such sources of financing agree on customary terms
to keep such information confidential.

(d) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of
the Financing, or any alternative financing, is not a condition to Closing and
reaffirm their obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement irrespective and independently of the availability of the Financing
or any alternative financing, subject to fulfillment or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VII.

Section 6.16 _Stock Exchange Delisting_. Each of the Company and Parent

negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest
extent possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties intend that the
remedies and limitations thereon contained in Section 8.5(d) be construed as

Section 9.6 _Parties in Interest_. Except as provided in Section 6.7,
Parent and the Company hereby agree that their respective representations,
warranties and covenants set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the
other party hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this
Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon
any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder,
including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth
herein. The parties hereto further agree that the rights of third party
beneficiaries under Section 6.7 shall not arise unless and until the Effective
Time occurs. In addition, debt financing sources under the Debt Financing
Commitments shall be considered third party beneficiaries with respect to
Section 8.5(d), Section 9.4, Section 9.11 and Section 9.13 and Parent Related
Parties shall be considered third party beneficiaries with respect to Section
8.3 and Section 9.14. The representations and warranties in this Agreement
are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole
benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and
warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with
Section 8.8 without notice or liability to any other person. In some
instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent
an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with
particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Consequently, persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

Section 9.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware (without
giving effect to choice of law principles thereof).

 

Section 9.8 _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this
Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect
in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 

Section 9.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and
delivered (including by facsimile, ".pdf," or other electronic transmission)
in one or more counterparts, and by the

 



57  different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when
executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement. 

Section 9.10 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not
perform the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such
actions as are required of it hereunder in order to consummate this
Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties
hereby further acknowledge and agree that prior to the Closing, the Company
shall be entitled to seek specific performance (i) to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions of, and to prevent or cure breaches of Sections 6.8 and
6.15 by Parent or Merger Sub, and (ii) to cause Parent and/or Merger Sub to
draw down the full proceeds of the Equity Financing and to cause Parent or
Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including to
effect the Closing in accordance with Section 1.2, on the terms and subject
to the conditions in this Agreement, if, but only if (with respect to this
clause (ii)), (A) all conditions in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been
satisfied, (B) Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing by the date
the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to Section 1.2, (C) the Debt
Financing (or, if alternative financing is being used in accordance with
Section 6.15, pursuant to the commitments with respect thereto) has been
funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at
the Closing and (D) the Company has irrevocably confirmed that if specific
performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded,
then the Closing will occur. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
it is hereby acknowledged and agreed that the Company shall be entitled to
seek specific performance to cause Parent and Merger Sub to enforce the terms
of the Debt Financing Commitment, including by demanding Parent and/or Merger
Sub file one or more lawsuits against the sources of Debt Financing to fully
enforce such sources obligations thereunder and Parents and Merger Subs
rights thereunder, only in the event that each of the following conditions has
been satisfied: (i) all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and 7.2
have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing), and Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the
Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to
Section 1.2 and (ii) all of the conditions to the consummation of the
financing provided by the Debt Financing Commitment (or, if alternative
financing is being used in accordance with Section 6.15, pursuant to the
commitments with respect thereto) have been satisfied (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing). Each of
the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein on the
basis that (x) either party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances will the Company
be entitled to monetary damages in excess of the aggregate amount of (A) the
Parent Fee, (B) any reimbursement obligation of Parent pursuant to the first
sentence of Section 8.5(d) and (C) the indemnification, reimbursement and
expense obligations of Parent contained in Section 6.15(b). Any party seeking
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this

 



58  Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction. Until such time as Parent pays
the Parent Fee, the remedies available to the Company pursuant to this
Section 9.10 shall be in addition to any other remedy to which it is entitled
at law or in equity, and the election to pursue an injunction or specific
performance shall not restrict, impair or otherwise limit the Company from,
in the alternative, seeking to terminate this Agreement and collect the Parent
Fee under Section 8.5.

 

Section 9.11 _Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto (a) consents to
submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery
and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (unless
the Delaware Court of Chancery shall decline to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, in which case, in any Delaware state or federal court
within the State of Delaware), in the event any dispute arises out of this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (c) agrees that it
will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
courts of the State of Delaware, as described above, and (d) consents to
service being made through the notice procedures set forth in Section 9.2.
Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby agrees that service of any
process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the
respective addresses set forth in Section 9.2 shall be effective service of
process for any suit or proceeding in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. The parties hereby further agree that New
York state or United States Federal courts sitting in the borough of
Manhattan, City of New York shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any action
brought against any financing source under the Debt Financing Commitments in
connection with the transactions contemplated under this Agreement.

 

Section 9.12 _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement
to a Section, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the
words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein," "hereby" and
"hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of
this Agreement. The word "or" shall not be exclusive. This Agreement shall be
construed without regard to any presumption or rule requiring construction or
interpretation against the party drafting or causing any instrument to be
drafted.

Section 9.13 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE
COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY SUCH ACTION
INVOLVING THE FINANCING SOURCES UNDER THE DEBT FINANCING COMMITMENTS) OR THE
ACTIONS OF PARENT OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION,
PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF.

Section 9.14 _No Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against,
and any claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or
relate to this Agreement, or the

 



59  negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement may only be made
against the entities that are expressly identified as parties hereto and no
Parent Related Party (other than the Guarantors to the extent set forth in
the Guarantees or Equity Commitment Letters and other than the parties to the
Confidentiality Agreements to the extent set forth in the Confidentiality
Agreements) shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of
the parties to this Agreement or for any claim (whether in tort, contract or
otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions
contemplated hereby or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged
to be made in connection herewith. Without limiting the rights of the Company
against Parent or Merger Sub hereunder, in no event shall the Company or any
of its affiliates, and the Company agrees not to and to cause its affiliates
not to, seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of
this Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, any Parent
Related Party (other than payment of the Guarantors to the extent set forth in
the Guarantees).
