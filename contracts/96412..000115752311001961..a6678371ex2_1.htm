AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  

  

This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this "Agreement"), is entered into as of
April 10, 2011, by and among TASTY BAKING COMPANY, a Pennsylvania corporation
(the "Company"), Flowers Foods, Inc., a Georgia corporation ("Parent"), and
Flowers Bakeries, LLC, a Georgia limited liability company and a wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"). Capitalized terms used herein (including
in the immediately preceding sentence) and not otherwise defined herein shall
have the meanings set forth in Section 9.01 hereof.

  

  

RECITALS

  

  

WHEREAS, Parent desires to acquire the Company on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement;

  

  

WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof and pursuant to this Agreement, Merger Sub has
agreed to commence a tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as
permitted under this Agreement, the "Offer") to purchase all of the
outstanding shares of the common stock, par value $.50 per share, of the
Company (the "Company Common Stock"), at a price per share of Company Common
Stock of $4.00 (such amount or any greater amount per share that may be paid
pursuant to the Offer being hereinafter referred to as the "Offer Price") net
to the seller in cash, without interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes
required by applicable Law;

  

  

WHEREAS, following the consummation of the Offer, Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company with the Company surviving that merger (the
"Merger"), in accordance with the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of
1988, as amended (the "PBCL"), pursuant to which each issued and outstanding
share of Company Common Stock, other than (i) shares of Company Common Stock
owned directly or indirectly by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company and (ii) the
Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into the right to receive an amount
equal to the Merger Consideration;

  

  

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the "Company Board") has
unanimously (a) determined that the Offer, the Merger, and the other
transactions contemplated hereby are fair to and in the best interests of the
Company, (b) approved and adopted this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby, and (c) resolved to recommend
acceptance of the Offer, and, if required, approval of the Merger by its
shareholders in each case on the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement;

  

  

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Parent and Merger Sub have, on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, approved this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and
the Merger; and

  

  

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with the Offer and the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby and also to prescribe certain conditions to
the Offer and the Merger.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties,
intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

ARTICLE I

  

THE OFFER

  

  

Section 1.01. The Offer.

  

  

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement (and in any
event within ten (10) Business Days), Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (the "Exchange Act")) the Offer.

  

  

(b) The obligation and right of Merger Sub to accept for payment and pay for
any shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to: (i) there being validly tendered in
the Offer (and not validly withdrawn) prior to any then scheduled Expiration
Time that number of shares of Company Common Stock which, together with the
shares beneficially owned by Parent or Merger Sub (if any), represents at
least a majority of the Company Common Stock then outstanding (determined on a
partially diluted basis assuming conversion or exercise of all deferred stock
units but not any other derivative securities including stock options) (the
"Minimum Condition"); and (ii) the satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or Merger
Sub, of the other conditions and requirements set forth in Exhibit A (together
with the Minimum Condition, the "Offer Conditions"). Subject to the prior
satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction, or waiver by
Parent or Merger Sub, of the other Offer Conditions, Merger Sub shall (and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) consummate the Offer in accordance with its
terms and accept for payment and pay for all shares of Company Common Stock
validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as promptly
as practicable after the Expiration Time. The conditions to the Offer set
forth in Exhibit A are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and may
be asserted by Parent or Merger Sub regardless of the circumstances (including
any action or inaction by Parent or Merger Sub, provided that nothing therein
shall relieve any party hereto from any obligation or liability such party has
under this Agreement) giving rise to such condition or may be waived by Parent
or Merger Sub, in their sole discretion, in whole or in part at any time and
from time to time, subject to this Section 1.01. The Offer Price payable in
respect of each share of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid net to the seller in cash,
without interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable
Law.

  

  

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the "Offer to
Purchase") that describes the terms and conditions of the Offer as set forth
in this Agreement, including the Offer Conditions. Parent and Merger Sub
reserve the right to waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition, to
increase the Offer Price or to make any other changes in the terms and
conditions of the Offer; provided, however, that unless otherwise provided by
this Agreement or as previously approved in writing by the Company, Merger Sub
shall not (i) reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price, (iii) change, modify or waive the
Minimum Condition, (iv) add to the conditions set forth in Exhibit A or modify
or change any Offer Condition in a manner adverse in any material respect to
any shareholders of the Company, (v) except as otherwise provided in this
Section 1.01, extend or otherwise change the expiration date of the Offer,
(vi) change the form of

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

  

consideration payable in the Offer or (vii) otherwise amend, modify or
supplement any of the terms of the Offer in a manner adverse in any material
respect to any shareholders of the Company.

  

  

(d) The Offer shall expire at midnight (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania time) on
the date that is twenty (20) Business Days following the commencement (within
the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of the Offer (the "Initial
Expiration Time") or, in the event the Initial Expiration Time has been
extended pursuant to this Agreement, the date and time to which the Offer has
been so extended (the Initial Expiration Time, or such later date and time to
which the Initial Expiration Time has been extended pursuant to this
Agreement, is referred to as the "Expiration Time").

  

  

(e) If on or prior to any then scheduled Expiration Time, all of the
conditions to the Offer (including the Minimum Condition and the other
conditions and requirements set forth in Exhibit A) have not been satisfied
or, to the extent waivable by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement,
waived by Parent or Merger Sub, then Merger Sub (i) may (and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to) extend the Offer for successive periods of up to ten (10)
Business Days each (or such longer period of up to twenty (20) Business Days
if the Company consents in writing prior to such extension), the length of
each such period to be determined by Parent in its sole discretion, in order
to permit the satisfaction of such conditions; and (ii) shall (and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to) extend the Offer on one occasion for a period of up
to seven (7) Business Days if requested by the Company; provided, however,
that, in either case, Merger Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer
beyond June 23, 2011 (the "Outside Date") and shall not extend the Offer
beyond the Outside Date without the Company's consent. In addition, Merger Sub
shall extend the Offer for any period or periods required by applicable Law or
applicable rules, regulations, interpretations or positions of the Securities
and Exchange Commission or its staff (the "SEC").

  

  

(f) On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Merger Sub
shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, accept and pay for (subject to
any withholding of tax pursuant to Section 3.05) all shares of Company Common
Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as
promptly as practicable after the Expiration Time (as it may be extended and
re-extended in accordance with this Section 1.01). Acceptance for payment of
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to and subject to the Offer Conditions
upon the Expiration Time is referred to in this Agreement as the "Offer
Closing," and the date on which the Offer Closing occurs is referred to in
this Agreement as the "Offer Closing Date." Merger Sub expressly reserves the
right to, in its sole discretion, following the Offer Closing, extend the
Offer for a "subsequent offering period" not to exceed ten (10) Business Days
after the Offer Closing in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act,
and the Offer Documents (as defined below) may, in Merger Sub's sole
discretion, provide for such a reservation of right. Nothing contained in this
Section 1.01 shall affect any termination rights in Article VIII.

  

  

(g) Merger Sub shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration
Time without the prior written consent of the Company except in the event that
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VIII. If the Offer is
terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, or this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VIII, prior to
the acceptance for payment of the Company Common Stock tendered in

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

the Offer, Merger Sub shall promptly return, and shall cause any depository
acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, in accordance with applicable Law,
all tendered Company Common Stock to the registered holders thereof.

  

  

(h) As soon as practicable on the date of the commencement of the Offer,
Parent and Merger Sub shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on
Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments,
supplements and exhibits thereto, the "Schedule TO"). The Schedule TO shall
include, as exhibits, the Offer to Purchase and a form of letter of
transmittal and summary advertisement, if any (such Schedule TO and the
documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together
with any amendments and supplements thereto, the "Offer Documents"). The
Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Sub all information
concerning the Company required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the
Offer Documents. Parent and Merger Sub agree to take all steps necessary to
cause the Offer Documents to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
shareholders of the Company, in each case as and to the extent required by the
Exchange Act. Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, agree to promptly correct any material information provided by it
for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise
required by applicable Law. Parent and Merger Sub further agree to take all
steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents, as so corrected (if applicable),
to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the shareholders of the Company,
in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Parent and
Merger Sub shall promptly notify the Company upon the receipt of any comments
from the SEC, or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements, to
the Offer Documents, and shall promptly provide the Company with copies of all
correspondence between them and their representatives, on the one hand, and
the SEC, on the other hand. Prior to the filing of the Offer Documents
(including any amendments or supplements thereto) with the SEC or
dissemination thereof to the shareholders of the Company, or responding to any
comments of the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents, Parent and Merger Sub
shall provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on such Offer Documents or response, and Parent and Merger Sub
shall give reasonable consideration to any such comments.

  

  

(i) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub, on a timely
basis, the funds necessary to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock that
Merger Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment, and pay for, pursuant to
the Offer.

  

  

Section 1.02. Company Actions.

  

  

(a) On the date the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC, the Company shall
file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and
exhibits thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") that shall, subject to the provisions
of Section 6.04, contain the recommendation described in Section 4.03(d). The
Company agrees to take all steps reasonably necessary to cause the Schedule
14D-9 to be prepared and filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
shareholders of the Company, in each case as and to the extent required by the
Exchange Act. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company all
information concerning Parent and Merger Sub required by the Exchange Act to
be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9. The Company,

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, agree to
promptly correct any material information provided by it for use in the
Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by
applicable Law. The Company further agrees to take all steps reasonably
necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected (if applicable), to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to the shareholders of the Company, in
each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. The Company shall
promptly notify Parent and Merger Sub upon the receipt of any comments from
the SEC, or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements, to the
Schedule 14D-9, and shall promptly provide Parent and Merger Sub with copies
of all correspondence between the Company and its representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Prior to the filing of the Schedule
14D-9 (including any amendments or supplements thereto) with the SEC or
dissemination thereof to the shareholders of the Company, or responding to any
comments of the SEC with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, the Company shall
provide Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on such Schedule 14D-9 or response, and the Company shall
give reasonable consideration to any such comments. The Company hereby
consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Company Board
Recommendation contained in the Schedule 14D-9.

  

  

(b) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish or cause
to be furnished to Parent and Merger Sub or their agents mailing labels,
security position listings, nonobjecting beneficial owner lists and any other
available listings or computer files containing the names and addresses of the
record holders or beneficial owners of the shares of Company Common Stock as
of the most recent practicable date, and shall promptly furnish Parent and
Merger Sub with such information and assistance (including updated lists of
record holders or beneficial owners of the shares of Company Common Stock,
from time to time upon Parent's, Merger Sub's or either of their respective
agents' request, and the addresses, mailing labels and lists of security
positions of such record holders or beneficial owners) as Parent, Merger Sub
or their agents may reasonably request for the purpose of communicating the
Offer and the Offer Documents to the record holders and beneficial owners of
the shares of Company Common Stock. Subject to the requirements of applicable
Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer
Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, Parent and Merger Sub
shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels,
listings and files in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement and shall
use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if
this Agreement shall be terminated, shall promptly deliver (and shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to cause their agents and
Representatives to deliver) to the Company (or destroy) all copies and any
extract or summaries of such information then in their possession or control.
In addition, in connection with the Offer, the Company shall cause its
Representatives to cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub to disseminate the
Offer Documents to holders of shares of Company Common Stock held in or
subject to any Company Employee Plan, and to permit such holders of shares of
Company Common Stock to tender such shares of Company Common Stock in the
Offer, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the applicable Company
Employee Plan.

Section 1.03. Directors.

  

  

(a) Effective upon the Offer Closing and from time to time thereafter, Parent
shall be entitled to designate the number of directors, rounded up to the next
whole number, on the Company Board that equals the product of (i) the total
number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to the election of any
additional directors pursuant to this Section 1.03) and (ii) the percentage
that the number of shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent
and/or Merger Sub (including shares accepted for payment) bears to the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding, and the Company shall
cause Parent's designees to be elected or appointed to the Company Board,
including by promptly increasing the number of directors (included by amending
the by-laws if necessary to increase the size of the Company Board) or
securing resignations of incumbent directors. At such time, the Company shall
also cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute the number of
members, rounded up to the next whole number, on (A) each committee of the
Company Board and (B) as requested by Parent, each board of directors of each
Subsidiary of the Company (and each committee thereof) that represents the
same percentage as such individuals represent on the Company Board.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, until the Effective Time, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to ensure that not less than three (3) persons who are
directors on the date hereof shall remain members of the Company Board until
the Effective Time.

  

  

(b) The Company's obligations to appoint Parent's designees to the Company
Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions reasonably
necessary to effect the appointment of Parent's designees, including mailing
to its shareholders information with respect to the Company and its officers
and directors, as Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 require in order to fulfill its
obligations under this Section 1.03(b), which, unless Parent otherwise elects,
shall be mailed together with the Schedule 14D-9. Parent shall supply to the
Company in writing and be solely responsible for any information with respect
to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 and the Company's obligations under Section
1.03(a) hereof shall be subject to the receipt of such information.

  

  

(c) Following the election or appointment of Parent's designees pursuant to
Section 1.03(a) and until the Effective Time (as defined in Section 2.03
hereof), the approval of a majority of the directors of the Company then in
office who were not designated by Parent (the "Independent Directors") shall
be required to authorize (and such authorization shall constitute the
authorization of the Company Board and no other action on the part of the
Company, including any action by any other director of the Company, shall be
required to authorize) (i) any termination of this Agreement by the Company,
(ii) any amendment of this Agreement requiring action by the Company Board,
(iii) any amendment to the Company's articles of incorporation and by-laws,
(iv) any extension of time for performance of any obligation or action
hereunder by Parent or Merger Sub, and (v) any waiver of compliance with, or
enforcement by the Company of, any of the agreements or conditions contained
herein for the benefit of the Company.

  

  

Section 1.04. Top-Up Option.

  

  

(a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the "Top-Up
Option"), exercisable only on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Section 1.04, to purchase

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

at a price per share equal to the Offer Price paid in the Offer that number of
newly issued shares of Company Common Stock (the "Top-Up Shares") equal to the
lowest number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number
of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries at the
time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, shall constitute one share more than
80% of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately after the
issuance of the Top-Up Shares on a partially diluted basis (assuming
conversion or exercise of all deferred stock units but not any other
derivative securities including stock options); provided, however, that (i)
the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable for a number of shares of Company
Common Stock in excess of the shares of Company Common Stock authorized and
unissued or held in the treasury of the Company at the time of exercise, (ii)
the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable unless immediately after such
exercise and the issuance of the Top-Up Shares, Merger Sub shall own at least
80% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (determined on a
partially diluted basis assuming conversion or exercise of all deferred stock
units but not any other derivative securities including stock options) and
(iii) the exercise of the Top-Up Option and the issuance and delivery of the
Top-Up Shares shall not be prohibited by any Law or Order. Upon Parent's
request, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
transfer agent to certify in writing to Parent the number of shares of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the exercise of
the Top-Up Option and after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up
Shares. The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable only once, in whole but not in
part, at any time following the Offer Closing (only after Merger Sub has
accepted and paid for all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and
not validly withdrawn) and prior to the earlier to occur of (A) the Effective
Time and (B) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

  

  

(b) In the event Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub
shall give the Company at least five (5) Business Days prior written notice,
specifying (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent
and its Subsidiaries at the time of such notice (giving effect to the Offer
Closing) and (ii) a place and a time for the closing of such purchase. The
Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice,
deliver written notice to Merger Sub specifying, based on the information
provided by Merger Sub in its notice, the number of Top-Up Shares to be
purchased by Merger Sub. At the closing of the purchase of Top-Up Shares, the
aggregate purchase price owed by Merger Sub to the Company for the Top-Up
Shares shall be paid to the Company at Parent's election, either (i) entirely
in cash, by wire transfer of same-day funds or (ii) by (A) paying in cash by
wire transfer of same-day funds an amount equal to not less than the aggregate
par value of the Top-Up Shares and (B) issuing to the Company a promissory
note having a principal amount equal to the aggregate purchase price pursuant
to the Top-Up Option less the amount paid in cash pursuant to the preceding
clause (A) (the "Promissory Note"). The Promissory Note (i) shall bear simple
interest at a rate of five percent (5%) per annum, payable in arrears at
maturity, (ii) shall mature on the first anniversary of the date of execution
of the Promissory Note, (iii) shall be full recourse to Parent and Merger Sub,
(iv) may be prepaid, at any time, in whole or in part, without premium or
penalty, and (v) shall have no other material terms. The Company shall cause
to be issued to Merger Sub a certificate representing the Top-Up Shares or, if
the Company does not then have certificated shares, the applicable number of
Book-Entry Shares. Such certificates or Book-Entry Shares may include any
legends that are required by federal or state securities Laws.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that no Top-Up Shares issued upon
exercise of the Top-Up Option will be registered under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the
"Securities Act") and that all such shares will be issued in reliance upon an
applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub hereby represents and warrants to the Company that
Merger Sub is, and will be, upon the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, an
"accredited investor," as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the
Securities Act. Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Shares
to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be
acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to,
or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning
of the Securities Act).

  

  

(d) Any dilutive impact on the value of the shares of Company Common Stock as
a result of the issuance of the Top-Up Shares will not be taken into account
in any determination of the fair value of any Dissenting Shares pursuant to
Subchapter 15D of the PBCL as contemplated by Section 3.03.

  

  

(e) If Merger Sub elects to exercise the Top-Up Option, as soon as practicable
after such exercise, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its
part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of the NASDAQ Stock Market
("NASDAQ") to cause the delisting of the Company and of the Company Common
Stock from NASDAQ and the deregistration of the Company Common Stock under the
Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such delisting.

  

  

ARTICLE II

  

THE MERGER

  

  

Section 2.01. The Merger. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and in accordance with the PBCL, at the Effective Time,
Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger,
the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and the Company will
continue its corporate existence under the PBCL as the surviving corporation
in the Merger (sometimes referred to herein as the "Surviving Corporation").

  

  

Section 2.02. Closing. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at 10:00
a.m., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania time, as soon as practicable (and, in any
event, within three (3) Business Days) after satisfaction or, to the extent
permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the Merger set forth in
Article VII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent
permitted hereunder, waiver of all such conditions), unless this Agreement has
been terminated pursuant to its terms or unless another time or date is agreed
to in writing by the parties hereto. The Closing shall be held at the offices
of Stradley Ronon Stevens and Young, LLP, 2600 One Commerce Square,
Philadelphia, PA 19103, unless another place is agreed to in writing by the
parties hereto, and the actual date of the Closing is hereinafter referred to
as the "Closing Date."

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

  

Section 2.03. Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at
the Closing, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub will cause articles of merger
(the "Articles of Merger") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the
Department of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the PBCL and shall make all other filings or recordings
required under the PBCL. The Merger will become effective at such time as the
Articles of Merger have been duly filed with the Department of State of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or at such later date or time as may be agreed by
the Company and Parent in writing and specified in the Articles of Merger in
accordance with the PBCL (the effective time of the Merger being hereinafter
referred to as the "Effective Time").

  

  

Section 2.04. Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the PBCL. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, from and after the
Effective Time, all property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers,
franchises, licenses and authority of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions and duties of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

  

  

Section 2.05. Articles of Incorporation; By-laws. Subject to Section 6.08, at
the Effective Time, (a) the articles of incorporation and by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation shall be amended so as to read in their entirety to be
identical to the articles of incorporation and by-laws of Merger Sub as in
effect following the required assignment described in Section 9.11 and
immediately prior to the Effective Time until thereafter amended in accordance
with the terms thereof, the articles of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation or as provided by applicable Law.

  

  

Section 2.06. Directors and Officers. The directors and officers of Merger
Sub, in each case, following the required assignment described in Section 9.11
and immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the
Effective Time, be the directors and officers, respectively, of the Surviving
Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and
qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the articles of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

ARTICLE III

  

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

  

  

Section 3.01. Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, as
a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub or the Company or the holder of any capital stock of Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company:

  

  

(a) Cancellation of Certain Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common
Stock that is owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company (as treasury stock or
otherwise) or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiaries will automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to
exist, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

9  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including
Restricted Shares, but excluding (i) shares to be cancelled and retired in
accordance with Section 3.01(a), and (ii) Dissenting Shares) will be converted
into the right to receive, in cash and without interest, an amount equal to
the Offer Price or the appropriate fraction thereof, in the case of a
fractional share, if any (the "Merger Consideration"). At the Effective Time,
all shares of Company Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and all
shares of Company Common Stock will be cancelled and retired and will cease to
exist, and, subject to Section 3.03, each holder of a certificate formerly
representing any such shares (each, a "Certificate") will cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 3.02 hereof.

  

  

(c) Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding following the
required assignment described in Section 9.11 and immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one newly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

Section 3.02. Surrender and Payment.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an exchange agent
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent") to act as the
agent for the purpose of exchanging the Merger Consideration for: (i) the
Certificates, or (ii) book-entry shares which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented the shares of Company Common Stock (the "Book-Entry
Shares"). At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or cause the
Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Exchange Agent, funds sufficient to
pay the aggregate Merger Consideration that is payable in respect of all of
the shares of Company Common Stock represented by the Certificates and the
Book-Entry Shares (the "Payment Fund") in amounts and at the times necessary
for such payments. If for any reason (including losses) the Payment Fund is
inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of shares shall be entitled
under Section 3.01(b), Parent shall take all steps necessary to enable or
cause the Surviving Corporation promptly to deposit in trust additional cash
with the Exchange Agent sufficient to make all payments required under this
Agreement, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall in any event be
liable for the payment thereof. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses,
including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the exchange of
shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration. Promptly after
the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to
send, to each record holder of shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective
Time, a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares to
the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.

  

  

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Common Stock
represented by a Certificate or Book-Entry Share upon (i) surrender to the
Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a duly completed and validly
executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

10  

  

 

 

 

  

be requested by the Exchange Agent, or (ii) receipt of an "agent's message" by
the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of Book-Entry Shares. Until
so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, and subject to the terms
set forth in Section 3.03, each such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as
applicable, shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof. No
interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender or
transfer of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share. Upon payment of the Merger
Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Article III, each Certificate
or Certificates so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled.

  

  

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Book-Entry Share, as applicable, is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall
otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be
properly transferred, and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to
the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Tax required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share, as applicable, or establish to the reasonable satisfaction
of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

  

  

(d) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates or
transfer of Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares, and from and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth,
in this Article III.

  

  

(e) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent,
upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company
Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 3.02
prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the
Merger Consideration. If any Certificate has not been surrendered immediately
prior to such date on which Merger Consideration in respect of such
Certificate would irrevocably escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in
respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, Exchange Agent, the Surviving
Corporation, or the Company shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock for any amounts properly paid to any Governmental Entity or
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
applicable Laws.

  

  

(f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent, upon
demand.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

11  

  

 

 

 

  

Section 3.03. Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, including Section 3.01, shares of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than shares cancelled in accordance with Section 3.01(a)) and held by a holder
who has not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto
in writing and who has properly exercised dissenters rights (if applicable) of
such shares in accordance with Subchapter 15D of the PBCL (such shares of
Company Common Stock being referred to collectively as the "Dissenting Shares"
until such time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such
holder's dissenters rights under the PBCL with respect to such shares) shall
not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead
shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by Subchapter 15D of the
PBCL; provided, however, that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails
to perfect, withdraws or loses such holder's right to dissenters pursuant to
Subchapter 15D of the PBCL or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by
Subchapter 15D of the PBCL, such shares of Company Common Stock shall be
treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 3.01(b),
without interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate formerly
representing such share or transfer of such Book-Entry Share, as the case may
be. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 3.01(b), if
the Merger is rescinded or abandoned prior to the Effective Time, then the
right of any shareholder to be paid the fair value of such shareholder's
Dissenting Shares pursuant to Subchapter 15D of the PBCL shall cease. The
Company shall provide Parent prompt written notice of any demands received by
the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, any withdrawal of
any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the
Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the PBCL that relates to such
demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity and right to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the
prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

  

  

Section 3.04. Adjustments. Without limiting the other provisions of this
Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock
of the Company shall occur (other than the issuance of additional shares of
capital stock of the Company as permitted by this Agreement), including by
reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including
reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or
any stock dividend or distribution paid in stock, the Offer Price and the
Merger Consideration (as applicable) and any other amounts payable pursuant to
this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such change.

  

  

Section 3.05. Withholding Rights. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent, Merger
Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the Offer Price and the Merger Consideration, as the case may be,
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may
be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and applicable
Treasury Regulations issued pursuant thereto (the "Code"), or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted
and withheld by the Exchange Agent, Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

12  

  

 

 

 

  

which the Exchange Agent, Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

  

  

Section 3.06. Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
reasonably required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificate as contemplated under this
Article III.

  

  

Section 3.07. Treatment of Stock Options and Other Stock-based Compensation.

  

  

(a) The Company shall take all requisite action so that, at the Effective
Time, each option to acquire shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Company
Stock Option") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
holder of that Company Stock Option or any other Person, cancelled and
converted into the right to receive from Parent and the Surviving Corporation,
as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option,
multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per
share exercise price under such Company Stock Option, less any Taxes required
to be withheld in accordance with Section 3.05.

  

  

(b) The Company shall take all requisite action so that, at the Effective
Time, (i) each deferred stock unit award outstanding (each, a "Company Stock
Award") under any Company Stock Plan (as defined below), immediately prior to
the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company, the holder of that Company Stock Award or any other Person,
cancelled and converted into the right to receive from Parent and the
Surviving Corporation, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of
(x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of such
Company Stock Award multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration, less any Taxes
required to be withheld in accordance with Section 3.05, and (ii) any right of
repurchase or risk of forfeiture or other condition under any award agreement
for Restricted Shares shall lapse and any vesting thereon shall fully
accelerate, in each case, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

ARTICLE IV

  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

  

  

Except as set forth in the correspondingly numbered Section of the disclosure
letter, dated the date of this Agreement and delivered by the Company to
Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure
Letter") or in another Section of the Company Disclosure Letter to the extent
that it is reasonably apparent that such disclosure is applicable to

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

13  

  

 

 

 

  

such Section, and except as set forth in the Company SEC Documents (but
disregarding risk factor disclosures or disclosures set forth in any "forward
looking statements" or any other statements that are similarly non-specific,
predictive or forward-looking in nature, in each case, other than any specific
factual information contained therein), the Company hereby represents and
warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as set forth below in Article IV. Except as
set forth below, the Company does not make, and has not made, any
representations or warranties in connection with the Offer or the Merger.

  

  

Section 4.01. Organization; Standing and Power; Charter Documents; Minutes;
Subsidiaries.

  

  

(a) Organization; Standing and Power. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries
is a corporation, limited liability company or other legal entity duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing) under the Laws of
its jurisdiction of organization, and has the requisite corporate, limited
liability company or other organizational, as applicable, power and authority
to own, lease and operate its assets and to carry on its business as now
conducted. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or
licensed to do business as a foreign corporation, limited liability company or
other legal entity and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that
recognize the concept of good standing) in each jurisdiction where the
character of the assets and properties owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of its business makes such qualification or license necessary, except
where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in good standing,
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(b) Charter Documents. The Company has delivered or made available to Parent a
true and correct copy of the articles of incorporation, by-laws or like
organizational documents, each as amended to date (collectively, the "Charter
Documents"), of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any of the provisions of its
Charter Documents, except where such violation would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

  

  

(c) Subsidiaries. Section 4.01(c)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists
each of the Subsidiaries of the Company as of the date hereof and its

with, disclose any non-public information relating to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to, afford access to the business, properties, assets, books
or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, or knowingly assist,
participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort by, any third party that is
seeking to make, or has made, any Takeover Proposal (other than any such
actions, efforts, disclosure or negotiations with such third party in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practices and unrelated to
any Takeover Proposal), (ii) enter into or obtain Company Board approval of
any letter of intent, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other Contract
relating to any Takeover Proposal (each, a "Company Acquisition Agreement"),
(iii) terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant permission
under, any standstill, confidentiality agreement or similar Contract to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party relating to any Takeover
Proposal; provided, that the foregoing shall not prohibit the Company Board
from terminating, waiving, amending or modifying any provision of, or granting
permission under, any standstill, confidentiality agreement or similar
Contract if the Company Board determines in good faith that there is a
reasonable probability that the failure to take such action would constitute a
breach of the Company Board's fiduciary duties to the Company under applicable
Law. Subject to Section 6.04(b), the Company shall (i) immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any existing solicitation, discussion or negotiation
with any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or their Representatives)
conducted prior to the date of this Agreement by the Company, its subsidiaries
or any of their respective Representatives with respect to any actual or
potential Takeover Proposal and (ii) as promptly as reasonably practicable
request that all confidential information provided by or on behalf of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to such third party be returned or
destroyed. Subject to Section 6.04(b), the Company Board shall not withdraw,
amend, modify or materially qualify, in a manner materially adverse to Parent
or Merger Sub, the Company Board Recommendation, or recommend a Takeover
Proposal, or make any public statement materially inconsistent with the
Company Board Recommendation, or resolve or agree to take any of the foregoing
actions (any of the foregoing, a "Company Adverse Recommendation Change").

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding Section 6.04(a), prior to the Offer Closing, the Company
Board, directly or indirectly through any Representative, may, subject to
Section 6.04(c), (i) participate in negotiations or discussions with any third
party that has made (and not withdrawn) a bona fide, unsolicited Takeover
Proposal in writing that the Company Board believes in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and the Company Financial Advisor,
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal,
(ii) thereafter furnish to such third party non-public information relating to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to an executed confidentiality
agreement that constitutes an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, (iii)
following receipt of and on account of a Superior Proposal, make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, and/or (iv) take any action that any court of
competent jurisdiction orders the Company to take, but in each case referred
to in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv), only if the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
there is a reasonable probability that the failure to take such action could
cause the Company Board to be in breach of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Company Board from
disclosing to the Company's shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9
and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to a Takeover
Proposal, if the Company determines, after consultation with outside

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

  

legal counsel, that there is a reasonable probability that the failure to
disclose such position could constitute a violation of applicable Law;
provided, that, any such disclosure shall be deemed a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change unless the Company Board expressly reaffirms the Company
Board Recommendation within four (4) Business Days.

  

  

(c) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than
twenty-four (24) hours) after it obtains Knowledge of the receipt by the
Company (or any of its Representatives) of any Takeover Proposal. In such
notice, the Company shall identify the third party making, and details of the
material terms and conditions of, any such Takeover Proposal. The Company
shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis (and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours), of the status and material terms of any such
Takeover Proposal, including any material amendments or proposed amendments as
to price and other material terms thereof.

  

  

(d) Except as set forth in this Section 6.04(d), the Company Board shall not
make any Company Adverse Recommendation Change or enter into (or permit any
Subsidiary of the Company to enter into) a Company Acquisition Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the Offer Closing, the
Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or enter into
(or permit any Subsidiary of the Company to enter into) a Company Acquisition
Agreement, if: (i) the Company promptly notifies Parent, in writing, at least
four (4) Business Days (the "Notice Period") before making a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or entering into (or causing a Subsidiary of the Company
to enter into) a Company Acquisition Agreement, of its intention to take such
action with respect to a Superior Proposal, which notice shall state expressly
that the Company has received a Takeover Proposal that the Company intends to
declare a Superior Proposal and that the Company Board intends to make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or the Company intends to enter into
a Company Acquisition Agreement; (ii) the Company attaches to such notice the
most current version of the proposed agreement and the identity of the third
party making such Superior Proposal; and (iii) at the end of the Notice
Period, the Company Board continues to believe that such Takeover Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal, including taking into account any adjustment
to the terms and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby proposed
by Parent in response to such Takeover Proposal; provided, however that (A)
with respect to any applicable Superior Proposal, any material amendment to
the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new written notice by the Company and a new Notice Period, and no
such termination of this Agreement by the Company or withdrawal or
modification of the Company Board Recommendation may be made during any Notice
Period, (B) the Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal
advisors to, during such Notice Period described above, to the extent
requested by Parent, negotiate with Parent in good faith, to make such changes
in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Takeover Proposal
(as amended) ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal or that the cause for
such withdrawal or modification of the Company Board Recommendation ceases to
exist, as applicable, (C) the Company Board shall take into account any
written proposal to amend the financial and other terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent in response to any such written notice by the Company or
otherwise and (D) the requirements for terminating this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.04(a) or effecting a Company Adverse Recommendation Change are still
satisfied at the time this Agreement is terminated or at the time of such
withdrawal or modification of the Company Board Recommendation, as applicable.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

  

(e) The Company agrees that any material violation of the restrictions set
forth in Section 6.04(a) by any Representatives of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement
(including this Section 6.04) by the Company.

  

  

Section 6.05. Shareholders Meeting; Preparation of Proxy Materials.

  

  

(a) Subject to the terms set forth in this Agreement, if the approval of this
Agreement by the Company's shareholders is required under applicable Law, the
Company shall take all action reasonably necessary to duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Offer Closing, and, in connection therewith, the Company
shall mail the Company Proxy Statement to the holders of Company Common Stock
in advance of such meeting. Except to the extent that the Company Board shall
have effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by Section
6.04(b) hereof, the Company Proxy Statement shall include the Company Board
Recommendation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if following the Offer and any
subsequent offering period and the exercise, if any, of the Top-Up Option,
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries shall hold, in the
aggregate, at least eighty percent (80%) of the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock (determined on a partially diluted basis assuming conversion or
exercise of all deferred stock units but not any other derivative securities
including stock options), the parties hereto shall take all necessary and
appropriate action, including with respect to the transfer to Merger Sub of
any shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent,
to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after the Offer
Closing without the Company Shareholders Meeting in accordance with Section
1924(b)(1)(ii) of the PBCL.

  

  

(b) If the adoption of this Agreement by the Company's shareholders is
required by applicable Law, as soon as practicable following the Offer
Closing, the Company shall prepare and file the Company Proxy Statement with
the SEC. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will cooperate and consult with
each other in the preparation of the Company Proxy Statement. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly
furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub
required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder to be set forth in the Company Proxy Statement. The Company shall
not file the Company Proxy Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto,
without providing Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon (which comments shall be reasonably
considered by the Company). The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
resolve, and each party agrees to consult and cooperate with the other party
in resolving, all SEC comments with respect to the Company Proxy Statement as
promptly as practicable after receipt thereof and to cause the Company Proxy
Statement in definitive form to be mailed to the Company's shareholders as
promptly as reasonably practicable following filing with the SEC. The Company
agrees to consult with Parent prior to responding to SEC comments with respect
to the preliminary Company Proxy Statement. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company agree to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in
the Company Proxy Statement if and to the extent that such information shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect and the Company shall
promptly prepare and mail to its shareholders an amendment or supplement
setting forth such correction. The Company shall as soon as reasonably
practicable (i) notify Parent of the receipt of any comments from the SEC with
respect to the Company

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  

Proxy Statement and any request by the SEC for any amendment to the Company
Proxy Statement or for additional information and (ii) provide Parent with
copies of all written correspondence between the Company and its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with respect
to the Company Proxy Statement.

  

  

Section 6.06. Notices of Certain Events. The Company shall notify Parent and
Merger Sub, and Parent and Merger Sub shall notify the Company, promptly of
(i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) any notice or other
communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) any Legal Actions commenced, or to such
party's knowledge, threatened, against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or Parent or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, that are related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv) any representation or
warranty of such party contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect, or the material failure of any party to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement in this Agreement,
in each case such that the conditions set forth in paragraph (b) or (c) of
Exhibit A would not be satisfied or would give rise to a right a termination
set forth in Section 8.03(b) or Section 8.04(b), as the case may be. In
addition, the Company shall notify Parent and Merger Sub promptly of any
change or event having, or which is reasonably likely to have, a Company
Material Adverse Effect or which would reasonably be likely to result in the
failure of any of the conditions set forth in Exhibit A to be satisfied. In no
event shall the delivery of any notice by a party pursuant to this Section
6.06 limit or otherwise affect the respective rights, obligations,
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement. During the
time period between the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the
Company shall have the right to supplement and/or amend the Company Disclosure
Letter; provided, however, that the right to supplement and/or amend the
Company Disclosure Letter shall apply only to facts, circumstances or events
that occurred after the date of this Agreement and only where they would not
be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

Section 6.07. Employees; Benefit Plans.

  

  

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the date
soonest to occur of (i) December 31, 2011 or (ii) the date of the employee's
termination of employment with Parent and its Subsidiaries, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to
provide the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who remain employed
immediately after the Effective Time (collectively, the "Company Continuing
Employees") with base salary, target bonus opportunities (excluding equity-
based compensation), and employee benefits under Parent Benefit Plans
(excluding any Pension Plan, other than employee contributions to a 401(k)
plan but not including any matching contribution thereon) that are, in the
aggregate, no less favorable than the base salary, target bonus opportunities
(excluding equity-based compensation), and employee benefits provided by the
Company and its Subsidiaries (excluding any Pension Plan, other than employee
contributions to a 401(k) plan but not including any matching contribution
thereon) on the date of this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) With respect to any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, excluding both any
retiree healthcare plans or programs maintained by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries and any equity compensation arrangements maintained by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, "Parent Benefit Plans") in which any
Company Continuing Employees will participate effective as of the Effective
Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, recognize all
service of the Company Continuing Employees with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be as if such service were with Parent, for
vesting and eligibility purposes (but not for (i) purposes of early retirement
subsidies under any Parent Benefit Plan that is a defined benefit pension
plan, (ii) benefit accrual purposes (except for vacation, if applicable) in
any Parent Benefit Plan in which such Company Continuing Employees may be
eligible to participate after the Effective Time, or (iii) any frozen Parent
Benefit Plan); provided, that such service shall not be recognized to the
extent that (x) such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits or
(y) such service was not recognized under the corresponding Company Employee
Plan.

  

  

(c) Effective upon the Offer Closing, Parent shall assume the obligations of
the Company to pay the bonuses, if any, to be paid for calendar year 2011 and
change in control payments identified in Section 6.07(c) of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

  

  

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall create any right or obligation which is
enforceable by any Company Employee, former Company Employee, Company
Continuing Employee or any other Person with respect to any terms or
conditions of employment, including, but not limited to, the benefits and
compensation described in this Section 6.07. For the avoidance of doubt, any
amendments to the Company's, its Subsidiaries', the Parent's and the Surviving
Corporation's benefit and compensation plans, programs or arrangements shall
occur only in accordance with their respective terms and shall be pursuant to
action taken by the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Parent and the Surviving
Corporation which are independent of the consummation of this Agreement or any
continuing obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this Section 6.07(d), each party entitled to a payment identified in Section
6.07(e) (including Trust Beneficiaries), and each party entitled to a payment
identified in Section 6.07(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter (subject to the
terms of the applicable Company Employee Plan), shall be an intended third
party beneficiary of such respective section, who may enforce the provisions
of such respective section against Parent with respect to the payment owed to
such party. The preceding sentence shall not alter or limit any rights that
any such party may have against the Company with respect to any such payment.

  

  

(e) Promptly after the Offer Closing, Parent shall fund, or cause Merger Sub
to fund, the trusts established under the separate Trust Agreements between
the Company and SEI Private Trust Company as Trustee, as successor Trustee to
Wachovia Bank, N.A., dated November 17, 1989, with respect to the Tasty Baking
Company Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans, and dated January 19, 1990,
with respect to the Tasty Baking Company Retirement Plan for Directors (each,
a "Rabbi Trust"), and thereafter to supplement such funding to the extent
necessary, in both cases in accordance with the terms of the respective Rabbi
Trust; provided that if Parent determines based upon the advice of legal
counsel that such funding violates Section 409A of the Code, Parent and Merger
Sub shall be under no obligation to fund the Rabbi Trusts. In the event the
Rabbi Trusts are not funded, Parent shall pay, or Parent shall cause Merger
Sub to pay, the benefits that the Rabbi Trusts would have paid and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

shall pay benefits directly to the "Trust Beneficiaries" (as such term is
defined in the Rabbi Trusts) in accordance with the terms of the retirement
plan associated with each Rabbi Trust.

  

  

Section 6.08. Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.

  

  

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation by the Company now existing in favor
of each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or
who becomes prior to the Effective Time an officer or director of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (each an "Indemnified Party") as provided in the Company
Charter Documents, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or
pursuant to any other Contracts in effect on the date hereof and disclosed in
Section 6.08 of the Company Disclosure Letter, shall be assumed by the
Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective
Time and shall survive the Merger and shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms and shall not be modified, amended or repealed in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights of the Indemnified Parties
thereunder with respect to their acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, and, in the event that any proceeding is pending or
asserted or any claim made during such period, until the final disposition of
such proceeding or claim.

  

  

(b) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, Parent and the Surviving Corporation (the
"Indemnifying Parties") shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
Indemnified Party against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees,
expenses, judgments and fines arising in whole or in part out of actions or
omissions in their capacity as such occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), and shall reimburse each Indemnified Party for any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with
investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
fees, expenses, judgments and fines as such expenses are incurred, subject to
the Surviving Corporation's receipt of an undertaking by such Indemnified
Party to repay such legal and other fees and expenses paid in advance if it is
ultimately determined in a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be
indemnified under applicable Law; provided, however, that the Surviving
Corporation will not be liable for any settlement effected without the
Surviving Corporation's prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  

  

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, (i) maintain in effect for a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time, if available, the current policies of directors' and officers'
liability insurance maintained by the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time (provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute
therefor policies from a insurer with the same or better credit rating as the
Company's current insurance carrier of at least the same coverage and amounts
and containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to the
directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries when compared to
the insurance maintained by the Company as of the date hereof), or (ii) obtain
and fully pay for as of the Effective Time "tail" insurance policies with a
claims period of six (6) years from the Effective Time with at least the same
coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are not less
advantageous to the directors and officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, in each case with respect to claims arising out of or relating
to

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  

events which occurred before or at the Effective Time (including in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); provided that in no
event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in any year an
amount in excess of 300% of the annual aggregate premiums currently paid by
the Company for such insurance.

  

  

(d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section
6.08 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to
whom this Section 6.08 applies without the consent of such affected
Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to
whom this Section 6.08 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
Section 6.08, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 6.08).

  

  

(e) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations
set forth in this Section 6.08. The agreements and covenants contained herein
shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which any
Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise.
Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or its officers, directors and employees, it being understood and
agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.08 is not prior
to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.

  

  

Section 6.09. Reasonable Best Efforts.

  

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement
(including those contained in this Section 6.09), each of the parties hereto
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, and to satisfy all
conditions to, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Offer, the
Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, including (i) the obtaining
of all necessary Permits, waivers, consents, approvals and actions from
Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and
filings (including filings with Governmental Entities) and the taking of all
steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an
action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entities, (ii) the obtaining of all
necessary and material consents or waivers from third parties, and (iii) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the Offer, the Merger and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.
The Company and Parent shall, subject to applicable Law, promptly (x)
cooperate and coordinate with the other in the taking of the actions
contemplated by clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) immediately above and (y) supply
the other with any information that may be reasonably required in order to
effectuate the taking of such actions. Each party hereto shall promptly inform
the other party or parties hereto, as the case may be, of any communication
from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. If the Company or Parent

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

receives a request for additional information or documentary material from any
Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, then it shall use reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be
made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other
party, an appropriate response in compliance with such request, and, if
permitted by applicable Law and by any applicable Governmental Entity, provide
the other party's counsel with advance notice and the opportunity to attend
and participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any
filing made thereto in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Neither Parent nor the Company shall commit to or agree (or permit
their respective Subsidiaries to commit to or agree) with any Governmental
Entity to stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act
or other applicable Antitrust Laws, without the prior written consent of the
other (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to Section
6.09(a) hereof, the parties hereto shall (i) provide or cause to be provided
as promptly as reasonably practicable to Governmental Entities with
jurisdiction over the Antitrust Laws (each such Governmental Entity, a
"Governmental Antitrust Authority") information and documents requested by any
Governmental Antitrust Authority as necessary, proper or advisable to permit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
preparing and filing any notification and report form and related material
required under the HSR Act and any additional consents and filings under any
other Antitrust Laws as promptly as practicable following the date of this
Agreement (provided that in the case of the filing under the HSR Act, such
filing shall be made within ten (10) Business Days of the date of this
Agreement) and thereafter to respond as promptly as practicable to any request
for additional information or documentary material that may be made under the
HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Laws and (ii) subject to the terms
set forth in Section 6.09(c) hereof, use their reasonable best efforts to take
such actions as are necessary or advisable to obtain prompt approval of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any
Governmental Entity or expiration of applicable waiting periods.

  

  

(c) In the event that any administrative or judicial action, proceeding or
other Legal Action is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a
Governmental Entity or private party challenging the Offer, the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or any other agreement
contemplated hereby, the parties shall cooperate in all respects and shall use
their reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or
proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none
of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries shall be required, without
the prior written consent of Parent, to consent to any requirement, condition,
limitation, understanding, agreement or order to sell, license, assign,
transfer, divest, hold separate or otherwise dispose of any material portion
(in the aggregate among such entities) of the assets or business of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  

Section 6.10. Public Announcements. Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand,
and the Company, on the other hand, shall use their reasonable best efforts to
consult with each other before issuing, and, to the extent reasonably
practicable, provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon,
any press release or other public statements with respect to the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange.

  

  

Section 6.11. Takeover Statutes; Rights Agreement. To the extent that any
"control share acquisition," "fair price," "moratorium" or other anti-takeover
Law becomes or is deemed to be applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub,
the Offer, the acquisition of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement,
including, without limitation, the provisions of Sections 2538 through 2588,
inclusive, of the PBCL (including Subchapter 25F of the PBCL), then each of
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, and their respective board of directors shall
grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to render such anti-
takeover Law inapplicable to the foregoing.

  

  

Section 6.12. Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act any dispositions of shares of Company
Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to such shares)
that are treated as dispositions under such rule and result from the Offer,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby by each director or
officer of the Company who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company.

  

  

Section 6.13. Rule 14d-10(d) Matters. Prior to the Offer Closing, the Company
(acting through the compensation committee of the Company Board) shall take
all such steps as may be required to cause each agreement, arrangement or
understanding entered into by the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company on or
after the date hereof with any of its officers, directors or employees
pursuant to which consideration is paid to such officer, director or employee
to be approved as an "employment compensation, severance or other employee
benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under the
Exchange Act and to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor
set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act.

  

  

Section 6.14. Further Assurances. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub,
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things
to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the
rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the
Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

Section 8.02. Termination By Either Parent or the Company. This Agreement may
be terminated, and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
abandoned, at any time prior to the Effective Time (notwithstanding any
approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company) by either

Date; provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 8.02(a) shall not be available to any party whose breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Offer
Closing to have occurred on or before the Outside Date; or

  

  

(b) if any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have enacted,

(f) The Company acknowledges and hereby agrees that the provisions of this

have entered into this Agreement. If the Company shall fail to pay in a timely

judgment against the Company, the Company shall pay to Parent the reasonable
costs and expenses of Parent (including its reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses) incurred or accrued in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 8.06 at the prime lending

in accordance with the terms hereof, the Termination Fee shall be Parent's and
Merger Sub's sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement; provided,
however, that such limitation will not apply in the event of active fraud or
intentional misrepresentation.

before or after the Offer Closing or any vote or consent of the Company's
shareholders contemplated hereby, by written agreement signed by each of the

amendment shall be made which decreases the Merger Consideration and, after
adoption of this Agreement by the holders of Company Common Stock, no
amendments shall be made which by Law requires further approval by such
holders without obtaining such further approval.

  

  

Section 8.08. Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, may,
subject to Section 1.03(c) (a) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations of the other party(ies), (b) waive any inaccuracies in the

constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject
matter of this Agreement and supersede all other prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties to this Agreement

Section 9.09. Third Parties. Except as provided in Section 6.07 and Section

sections), nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any other Person or entity any legal or equitable right or
remedy of any nature to enforce the terms of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 9.10. Severability. If any term or provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of
this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in

apply to the assignee of such required assignment). No assignment shall
relieve the assigning party of any of its obligations hereunder.

Section 9.12. Specific Performance. Notwithstanding Article VIII (including
Section 8.06), the parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur
for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy
if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with the terms hereof or were otherwise breached, and that the party seeking
to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to specific performance and the
issuance of injunctive and other equitable relief, in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the parties
agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief sought in accordance with this Section
9.12. The parties fully intend that specific performance will be the principal
remedy for failure to perform or other breaches of this Agreement, and each
party also agrees that the agreements contained in this Section 9.12 are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, without
the agreement of each party in this Section 9.12, the other party would not
enter into this Agreement. The parties hereto further agree to waive any
