Days following the Closing, Purchaser Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement that registers under the Securities Act the sale from time to time pursuant to Rule 415 promulgated under the
Securities Act by Sellers of the Purchaser Parent Common Stock comprising the Stock Purchase Price. Purchaser Parent shall further use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective by the SEC as
promptly thereafter as possible, including by filing an &#147;automatic shelf registration statement&#148; (as such term in defined in Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities Act) that becomes effective upon filing with the SEC in accordance with
Rule 462(e) to the extent Purchaser Parent is then a &#147;well-known seasoned issuer&#148; (as such term is defined in Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities Act). Purchaser Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep such registration
statement effective continuously until the earlier to occur of (x)&nbsp;the six (6)&nbsp;month anniversary of the Closing and (y)&nbsp;the date the Purchaser Parent Common Stock is no longer registered under Section&nbsp;12 of the Exchange Act.
Purchaser Parent shall use its best efforts not take any action, or fail to take any action, in each case prior to the effectiveness of the shelf registration statement described in this <U>Section&nbsp;8.20(a)</U>, which action or failure would
reasonably be expected to cause Purchaser Parent to no longer be qualified as a &#147;well-known seasoned issuer&#148; or to be ineligible to file a registration statement under the Securities Act on Form S-3 (or any successor form). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Purchaser Parent shall have the right to (i)&nbsp;delay the effectiveness of any registration statement for a period of up to four (4)&nbsp;consecutive weeks (including by delaying the initial filing of an automatic shelf registration
statement), or (ii)&nbsp;suspend the use by Sellers of any registration statement for a period of up to four (4)&nbsp;consecutive weeks, to the extent, in the case of either <U>clause (i)</U>&nbsp;or <U>(ii)</U>, Purchaser Parent is then in
possession of material non-public information that would be detrimental to Purchaser Parent to disclose at such time; <I>provided, however</I>, if Purchaser Parent determines in good faith that the material non-public information would, if
disclosed, reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the trading price of the Purchaser Parent Common Stock, references in this sentence to &#147;four (4)&nbsp;consecutive weeks&#148; shall instead be to &#147;two
(2)&nbsp;consecutive weeks&#148;. The costs of preparing and filing any such registration statement shall be borne by Purchaser Parent, though any selling expenses or commissions incurred in connection with any sale pursuant to such registration
statement shall be borne by the Seller that is disposing of its shares pursuant to such sale. Any such registration statement shall be in such form, and shall contain a plan of distribution requested by the Seller Representative, which shall be in
compliance with applicable Law and acceptable to Purchaser Parent in its reasonable judgment; <I>provided, however</I>, in no event shall Purchaser Parent be obligated to participate in any &#147;road show&#148; or other marketing efforts by Seller

hereunder, Purchaser shall cause its transfer agent to promptly issue new certificates without legends to any transferees of such shares at no cost to Sellers for legal opinions or any other mechanics. Prior to the one (1)&nbsp;year anniversary of
the Closing Date, Purchaser Parent will use its best efforts to comply with the current public information requirements of Rule 144(c) under the Securities Act. Upon the one (1)&nbsp;year anniversary of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause
Purchaser Parent&#146;s transfer agent to issue new certificates representing the Purchaser Parent Common Stock issued to Sellers hereunder without any restrictive legends, at no cost to Sellers for legal opinions or any other mechanics, subject
