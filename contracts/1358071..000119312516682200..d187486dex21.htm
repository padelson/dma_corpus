ARTICLE 2

PURCHASE AND SALE

Section 2.1 _Purchase and Sale_. On the terms and conditions contained in this
Agreement, the Seller Parties jointly and severally agree that the Sellers
will sell to Purchaser and Purchaser and Purchaser Parent jointly and
severally agree that Purchaser will accept and pay for the Assets, including
by assumption of the Assumed Obligations.

 

Section 2.2 _Purchase Price_.

 

 __(a) The purchase price for the Assets shall be a cash amount equal to One
Billion Six Hundred Twenty-Five Million and No/100 Dollars
($1,625,000,000.00) (the " _Unadjusted Purchase Price_ "). The Unadjusted
Purchase Price shall be adjusted as provided in _Section 2.4_ (as adjusted,
the " _Adjusted Purchase Price_ "). _ _

__(b) On or prior to August 29, 2016, either Purchaser, on behalf of
Purchaser and Purchaser Parent, or the Seller Representative, on behalf of
Sellers, shall have the right and option (the " _Stock Option_ ") to elect to
require that, subject to the terms and adjustments set forth herein, the
Unadjusted Purchase Price for the Assets be paid, delivered and issued (i)
Four Hundred Eighty-Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars
($487,500,000.00) in the form of Purchaser Parent Common Stock and (ii) the
remainder of the Unadjusted Purchase Price in the form of cash, and in such
event the "Unadjusted Purchase Price" shall consist of the following: __

 



28 __(i) a cash amount equal to One Billion One Hundred Thirty-Seven Million
Five Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($1,137,500,000.00) (the " _Cash
Purchase Price_ "); and __

 

 __(ii) a number of shares of Purchaser Parent common stock, par value $0.001
per share (" _Purchaser Parent Common Stock_ "), equal to Three Million Nine
Hundred Fifty-Eight Thousand Five Hundred Twenty-Six (3,958,526), which number
of shares is the quotient of (A) Four Hundred Eighty-Seven Million Five
Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($487,500,000.00) ___divided by_ __(B)
the Share Price (such resulting number of shares of Purchaser Parent Common
Stock, the " _Stock Purchase Price_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, no certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Purchaser Parent Common Stock shall be issued as part of the Stock
Purchase Price, no dividend or distribution with respect to Purchaser Parent
Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and
such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or
to any other rights of a stockholder of Purchaser Parent. In lieu of the
issuance of any such fractional share, Purchaser at Closing shall pay to
Sellers an amount in cash determined by ___multiplying_ __(I) the Share Price
by (II) the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest hundredth when
expressed in decimal form) of Purchaser Parent Common Stock to which Sellers
would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant hereto. __

__(c) The Stock Option may be exercised any time on or prior to August 29,
2016, by the delivery of a Notice delivered by the Seller Representative to
Purchaser or by Purchaser to the Seller Representative stating that such
delivering Party has elected to exercise the Stock Option. Any valid delivery
by a Party of a Notice of election to exercise the Stock Option shall
constitute the final, binding and irrevocable election to exercise the Stock
Option and shall be binding for all purposes as to all of the Parties. In the
event that neither Purchaser nor the Seller Representative validly delivers a
Notice electing to exercise the Stock Option prior to August 29, 2016, then
(i) the Parties shall be deemed to have made an election not to exercise the
Stock Option and (ii) the provisions set forth in _Section 4.23_, _Section
8.20_ and _Section 8.21_ and all other obligations of Purchaser Parent
hereunder shall be null and void _ab initio_  for all purposes. In the event
the Stock Option is validly exercised by the Seller Representative or
Purchaser, the Seller Representative shall designate and identify in the
Preliminary Settlement Statement delivered under _Section 2.5(a)_ (i) the
Sellers and other Persons to receive Purchaser Parent Common Stock at Closing,
(ii) the number of shares of Purchaser Parent Common Stock to be issued to
each such Person and (iii) such other information about any such Person that
is not a Seller that may be reasonably requested by Purchaser; _provided,
however_ , in no event shall Purchaser or Purchaser Parent be required to
issue or cause to be issued any Purchaser Parent Common Stock to any Person
that has not ratified and joined this Agreement as a Seller or executed and
delivered a certification, representation and warranty as to the matters set
forth in _Section 4.23_ as to such Person, together with any other applicable
information or documents required under applicable Laws. Notwithstanding any
provision in this _Section 2.2(c)_ to the contrary, each of the Reliance
Selling Subsidiaries and each Initial NPI Seller hereby agrees that, unless
otherwise designated by the Seller Representative in the Preliminary
Settlement Statement, such Seller will accept a proportionate share of the
Stock Purchase Price to be issued hereunder (based on the respective portions
of the Unadjusted Purchase Price allocable to the Reliance Selling
Subsidiaries and the Initial NPI Sellers). __

 



29 (d) For the avoidance of doubt, the Stock Purchase Price shall be
proportionately adjusted to reflect any splits, combinations, stock
dividends, recapitalizations, reorganizations or reclassifications with
respect to the Purchaser Parent Common Stock, or any transaction in which
shares of Purchaser Parent Common Stock are converted into other securities
or cash, in each case, occurring after the signing of this Agreement and prior
to the Closing. For the further avoidance of doubt, any reference in this
Agreement to shares of Purchaser Parent Common Stock comprising the
Stock Purchase Price that occurs after the signing of this Agreement shall
have the corresponding meaning.

Section 2.3  _Deposit_.

__(a) Within two (2) Business Days after the Execution Date, (i) Purchaser
and the Seller Representative shall execute and deliver to each other and the
Escrow Agent the Escrow Agreement and (ii) Purchaser shall deposit into an
escrow account an amount equal to five percent (5%) of the Unadjusted Purchase
Price (together with any interest, earnings or other amounts accrued thereon,
the " _Deposit_ "), pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. __

 

(b) In the event that Closing occurs, then on the Closing Date (i) the Deposit
shall be applied and credited toward the Escrow Cash, to be held pursuant to
the terms hereof and the Escrow Agreement and shall constitute part of the
Unadjusted Purchase Price and (ii) the excess (if any) of the Deposit over the
Escrow Cash shall be disbursed by the Escrow Agent to Sellers pursuant
to joint written instructions executed and delivered by the Seller
Representative and Purchaser to the Escrow Agent.

(c) If for any reason this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
_Section 12.1_, then the Deposit shall be disbursed or retained as provided
in _Section 12.2_.

 

Section 2.4 _Adjustments to Unadjusted Purchase Price_. The Unadjusted
Purchase Price shall be adjusted, without duplication, as follows, but only
with respect to matters in the case of _Section 2.4(a)_ for which notice is
given on or before the Cut-Off Date:

avoidance of doubt, any Asset Taxes that were withheld or deducted from the

which _Section 2.4(e)_ applies, and therefore were taken into account in
determining the proceeds "received" by Sellers for purposes of applying
_Section 2.4(e)_ with respect to such transaction); and

 



30 (ii) decreased by the amount of all Asset Taxes allocated to Sellers in
accordance with  _Section 11.1_ but paid or otherwise economically borne by
Purchaser;

(d) adjusted for Imbalances, inventory, amounts in storage and linefill on
the Effective Time as follows:

merchantable Hydrocarbons produced from or credited to the Oil and Gas
Properties or located in tanks or storage facilities included in the Assets to
the extent such merchantable Hydrocarbons are located above the bottom of the
applicable downstream outlet flange as of the Effective Time based upon the

case of gaseous Hydrocarbons, on the basis of $2.67 per MMBtu, (B) in the case

and ethane, propane, iso-butane, nor-butane and gasoline on the basis of

(e) without prejudice to any Partys rights under _Article 13_, adjusted for
proceeds and other income attributable to the Assets, Property Costs and
certain other costs attributable to the Assets, and interest as follows:

proceeds to the extent received by Sellers:

(A) amounts earned from the sale, during the period from and after the
Effective Time, of Hydrocarbons produced from or attributable to the Oil and

connection with sales of Hydrocarbons and (3) Property Costs that are
deducted by the purchaser of production), and

(B) other income earned with respect to the Assets attributable to the

accrual method of accounting and COPAS, as consistently applied (the "
_Accounting Principles_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, but subject to any adjustment made (x) at Closing pursuant to
_Section 3.2(b)_ for any Title Defect for which the Seller Representative
elects to cure after the Closing (which adjustment shall be made to the Cash
Purchase Price only) or (y) post-Closing pursuant to _Section 2.5(b)_, in
the event the Stock Option is validly exercised, all adjustments to the
Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be made between the Cash Purchase Price (the
Cash Purchase Price, as adjusted, the " _Adjusted Cash Purchase Price_ ") and
the Stock Purchase Price (the Stock Purchase Price, as adjusted, the "
_Adjusted Stock Purchase Price_ ") in the same ratio as the cash portion of
the Unadjusted Purchase Price bears to the aggregate Share Price attributable
to the unadjusted Stock Purchase Price. __

 

Section 2.5 _Closing Payment and Post-Closing Adjustments_.

 

(a) Not later than five (5) days prior to the Closing Date, the Seller
Representative shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser, a draft preliminary
settlement statement (" _Preliminary Settlement Statement_ ") setting forth

Price for the Assets as of the Closing Date after giving effect

 



32  to all adjustments set forth in _Section 2.4_, (ii) the Persons, accounts
and amounts of disbursements that Sellers designate and nominate to receive
the Closing Payment and the Purchaser Parent Common Stock required to be
delivered by Purchaser Parent to or on behalf of Sellers under _Section
10.3(c)_ and (iii) the wiring instructions for all such payments and
disbursements. The Seller Representative shall supply to Purchaser reasonable
documentation in the possession of any Seller or any of their Affiliates to
support the items for which adjustments are proposed or made in the
Preliminary Settlement Statement delivered by the Seller Representative, and
a brief explanation of any such adjustments and the reasons therefor. Within
three (3) days after receipt of the Seller Representatives draft Preliminary
Settlement Statement, Purchaser will deliver to the Seller Representative
a written report containing all changes that Purchaser proposes to be made to
the Preliminary Settlement Statement, if any, together with a brief
explanation of such changes. The Preliminary Settlement Statement, as agreed
upon by the Parties, will be used to adjust the Unadjusted Purchase Price at
Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Parties cannot agree on all
adjustments set forth in the Preliminary Settlement Statement prior to the
Closing, then any such unagreed adjustments as set forth in the Preliminary
Settlement Statement as presented by the Seller Representative will be used to
adjust the Unadjusted Purchase Price at Closing; _provided further_ that, if
Purchaser disagrees with the Seller Representatives estimate of any
adjustments set forth in _Section 2.4(a)_, then Purchasers good faith
estimate of such adjustments shall be used in calculating the Adjusted
Purchase Price as of the Closing Date for the purpose of determining the
Closing Payment.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing but not later than the
later of (i) the one hundred eightieth (180th) day following the Closing Date
and (ii) five (5) days after the date on which the Parties or the applicable
Defect Referee finally determines all Defect Amounts under _Section 3.2(g)_,

final settlement statement setting forth the final calculation of the Adjusted
Purchase Price and showing the calculation of each adjustment under _Section
2.4_, based on the most recent actual figures for each adjustment. The Seller
Representative shall make reasonable documentation available to support the
final figures. As soon as reasonably practicable but not later than the
fifteenth (15th) day following receipt of the Seller Representatives
statement hereunder, Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller Representative a
written report containing any changes that Purchaser proposes be made in such
statement. The Seller Representative may deliver a written report to
Purchaser during this same period reflecting any changes that the Seller
Representative proposes to be made in such statement as a result of additional
information received after the statement was prepared. The Parties
shall undertake to agree on the final statement of the Adjusted Purchase
Price no later than thirty (30) days following Purchasers receipt of the
Seller Representatives statement delivered hereunder. In the event that the
Parties cannot reach agreement as to the final statement of the Adjusted
Purchase Price within such period of time, any Party may refer the items of
adjustment which are in dispute or the interpretation or effect of this
_Section 2.5_ to a nationally-recognized independent accounting firm or
consulting firm mutually acceptable to both Purchaser and the Seller
Representative (the " _Accounting Referee_ "), for review and final
determination by arbitration. The Accounting Referee shall conduct the
arbitration proceedings in Midland, Texas, in accordance with the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent such
rules do not conflict with the terms of this  _Section 2.5(b)_. The
Accounting Referees determination shall be made within fifteen (15) days
after submission of the matters in dispute and without limiting Purchasers
right to indemnity under _Section 13.3(c)_ or the Sellers Parties right to

 



33  indemnity under _Section 13.2(c)_ shall be final and binding on all
Parties, without right of appeal. In determining the amount of any adjustment
to the Adjusted Purchase Price, the Accounting Referee shall be bound by the
terms of _Section 2.4_ and shall be authorized to select only the Adjusted
Purchase Price as proposed by the Seller Representative in the final
settlement statement (on the one hand) or by Purchaser in its written report
to the Seller Representative containing its suggested changes to the Adjusted
Purchase Price (on the other hand). The Accounting Referee shall act as an
expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed aspects
of Adjusted Purchase Price adjustments submitted by any Party and may not
award damages, interest (except to the extent expressly provided for in this
_Section 2.5_) or penalties to any Party with respect to any matter. The
Seller Representative and Purchaser shall each bear its own legal fees and
other costs of presenting its case. Sellers shall bear one-half and Purchaser
shall bear one-half of the fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Referee.
Within five (5) Business Days after the earlier of (i) the expiration of
Purchasers fifteen (15) day review period without delivery of any written
report or (ii) the date on which the Parties or the Accounting Referee finally
determine the Adjusted Purchase Price, (A) Purchaser shall pay to Sellers the
amount by which (1) the Adjusted Purchase Price exceeds (2) the sum of the
Closing Payment, _plus_ the product of the Share Price multiplied by the
number of shares of Purchaser Parent Common Stock included in the Purchaser
Parent Common Stock delivered by Purchaser Parent to or on behalf of Sellers
under _Section 10.3(c)_, _plus_ the Escrow Cash, _plus_ the product of the
Share Price multiplied by the number of shares of Purchaser Parent Common
Stock included in the Escrow Stock or (B) Sellers shall pay to Purchaser the
amount by which (1) the sum of the Closing Payment, _plus_ the product of the
Share Price multiplied by the number of shares of Purchaser Parent Common
Stock included in the Purchaser Parent Common Stock delivered by Purchaser
Parent to or on behalf of Sellers under _Section 10.3(c)_, _plus_ the Escrow
Cash, _plus_ the product of the Share Price multiplied by the number of
shares of Purchaser Parent Common Stock included in the Escrow Stock, exceeds
(2) the Adjusted Purchase Price, as applicable.

 

(c) Purchaser shall assist the Seller Representative in preparation of the
final statement of the Adjusted Purchase Price under  _Section 2.5(b)_ by
furnishing invoices, receipts, reasonable access to personnel and such other
assistance as may be requested by the Seller Representative to facilitate such
process post-Closing.

 

(d) All payments made or to be made under this Agreement to Sellers shall be
made by electronic transfer of immediately available funds to Sellers to such
bank and account as may be specified by the Seller Representative in writing.
All payments made or to be made hereunder to Purchaser shall be by electronic
transfer of immediately available funds to such bank and account as may
be specified by Purchaser in writing.

Received Post-Closing_.

any proceeds or other income to which another Party is entitled under _Section
2.6(a)_, such Party shall fully disclose, account for, and promptly remit the
same to the Party entitled to such proceeds or income.

(c) Without duplication of any adjustments made pursuant to _Section
2.4(e)_, should any Party, or any Affiliate of any Party, pay after Closing
any Property Costs for which another Party is responsible under _Section
2.6(a)_, such Party shall be reimbursed by the Party responsible for such
Property Costs under _Section 2.6(a)_ promptly after receipt of such Partys
invoice, accompanied by copies of the relevant vendor or other invoice and
proof of payment.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 2.6_,
following date that is two (2) years after the Closing, Sellers shall have no
further entitlement to amounts earned from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced
from or attributable to the Assets and other income earned with respect to the
Assets and no further responsibility for Property Costs incurred with respect
to the Assets.

Section 2.7 _Procedures_.

 

(a) All adjustments and payments made pursuant to this _Article _2 shall be
without duplication of any other amounts paid or received under this
Agreement.

(b) For purposes of allocating production (and accounts receivable with
respect thereto), under  _Section 2.4_ and _Section 2.6_, (i) liquid
Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or attributable to" the Oil and Gas
Properties when they are produced into the tank batteries related to each Well
and (ii) gaseous Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or attributable to"
the Oil and Gas Properties when they pass through the delivery point sales
meters or similar meters at the point of entry into the pipelines through
which they are transported. Sellers shall use reasonable interpolative
procedures to arrive at an allocation of production when exact meter readings,
gauging or strapping data are not available.

 



35 (c) Surface use or damage fees and other Property Costs that are paid
periodically shall be prorated based on the number of days in the applicable
period falling before, or on or after, the Effective Time.

__(d) After Closing, Purchaser shall handle all joint interest audits and
other audits of Property Costs covering periods for which Purchaser is in
whole or in part responsible under _Section 2.4_; _provided, however,_ that
Purchaser shall not agree to any adjustments to previously assessed costs for
which any Seller is liable, or any compromise of any audit claims to which any
Seller would be entitled, without the prior written consent of the Seller
Representative, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Each Party
shall provide the other Party with a copy of all applicable audit reports and
written audit agreements received by such Party and relating to periods for
which Sellers are partially responsible. __

 

(e) " _Earned_ " and " _incurred_ ," as used in _Section 2.4(e)_ and _Section
2.6_, shall be interpreted in accordance with accounting recognition guidance
under the Accounting Principles.

Section 2.8  _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Purchaser and the Seller
Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts to agree to an
allocation of the Adjusted Purchase Price, as adjusted to take into account
the amount properly treated as consideration for the Assets for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, among the Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and, to the extent
allowed under applicable U.S. federal income tax Law, in a manner consistent
with the Allocated Values and this Agreement, within thirty (30) days after
the Cut-Off Date (the " _Allocation_ "). If the Seller Representative and
Purchaser reach an agreement with respect to the Allocation, (a) Purchaser
and the Seller Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
update the Allocation in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code following
any adjustment to the amount treated as consideration for the Assets, and (b)
Purchaser and Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
report consistently with the Allocation, as adjusted, on all Tax Returns,
including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 (Asset Acquisition Statement
under Section 1060), and none of Sellers or Purchaser shall take any position
on any Tax Return that is inconsistent with the Allocation, as adjusted,
unless otherwise required by applicable Law; provided, however, that no Party
shall be unreasonably impeded in its ability and discretion to negotiate,
compromise and/or settle any Tax audit, claim or similar proceedings in
connection with such allocation

TITLE AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Section 3.1 _General Disclaimer of Title and Environmental Warranties_.
Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees that except as to (i) any breach of
the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.5_, _Section
4.9_, _Section 4.10_, _Section 4.13_, _Section 4.14_ and  _Section 4.19_
(and the rights of Purchaser with respect thereto under _Article 13_), (ii)
the indemnification obligations of Sellers in respect of the Retained
Liabilities and (iii) the special warranty of title set forth in the
Conveyances, (a) _Article _3 sets forth Purchasers sole and

 



36  exclusive remedy with respect to any Defect and the existence of any Release
of Hazardous Substances or any other environmental condition with respect to
the Assets and (b) PURCHASER WAIVES, RELEASES, REMISES AND FOREVER DISCHARGES
SELLERS FROM ANY AND ALL SUITS, LEGAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS,
DEMANDS, DAMAGES, COSTS, LIABILITIES, LOSSES, INTEREST OR CAUSES OF ACTION
WHATSOEVER, IN LAW OR IN EQUITY, KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, ATTRIBUTABLE TO ANY
PERIODS OF TIME WHICH PURCHASER MIGHT NOW OR SUBSEQUENTLY MAY HAVE, BASED ON,
RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF, ANY DEFECT THAT IS NOT VALIDLY ASSERTED
PURSUANT TO A DEFECT NOTICE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN
_SECTION 3.2(A)_ BY THE DEFECT DEADLINE OR THE EXISTENCE OF ANY ENVIRONMENTAL
DEFECT, RELEASE OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE OR ANY OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY
WITH RESPECT TO THE ASSETS. Purchaser further acknowledges and agrees that
Purchaser shall not be entitled to protection under the special warranty of
title provided in the Conveyances for any Title Defect asserted by Purchaser
pursuant to a Defect Notice under this _Article 3_.

 

Section 3.2 _Defects; Adjustments_.

 

 __(a) Purchaser shall deliver a valid Notice or Notices (each a " _Defect
Notice_ ") with respect to such alleged Defect to the Seller Representative
on or before 5:00 p.m. Central Standard Time on September 19, 2016 (the "
_Defect Deadline_ "). Each Defect Notice shall be in writing and include, as
to each alleged Defect alleged therein: __

(i) a description of the alleged Defect that is reasonably sufficient for
Sellers to determine the basis of the alleged Title Defect;

(ii) the Assets adversely affected by such Defect;

 

(iii) the Allocated Value, if any, of each Asset adversely affected by the
alleged Defect;

 

(iv) Purchasers good faith reasonable estimate of the Defect Amount
attributable to such Defect and the computations and information upon which
Purchasers estimate is based; and

(v) to the extent available, documents and information reasonably necessary
for the Sellers (as well as any title attorney, examiner or environmental
consultant hired by such Parties) to verify, investigate or be put on notice
as to the existence of the alleged Defect.

 

Subject to Purchasers rights with respect to (A) any breach of the
representations and warranties set forth in  _Section 4.5_, _Section 4.9_,
_Section 4.10_, _Section 4.13_, _Section 4.14_ and _Section 4.19_ (and the
rights of Purchaser with respect thereto under _Article 13_), (B)
the indemnification obligations of Sellers in respect of the Retained
Liabilities and (C) the special warranty of title set forth in the
Conveyances, but otherwise notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived its right
to assert any Defects for which a Defect Notice has not been delivered on or
before the Defect Deadline.

 



37 (b) _Option to Cure Defects_.

 

 __(i) The Seller Representative may notify Purchaser in writing prior to the
Closing that Sellers elect to cure or remove any validly asserted Defect.
Sellers shall have the right, but not the obligation to attempt, at Sellers 
sole cost, to cure or remove any Defects asserted in a Defect Notice (x) on or
prior to the Closing Date, in the case of any Environmental Defect or (y) by
the date that is ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, in the case of any
Title Defect (each of _clauses (x)_ and _(y)_ , the " _Cure Deadline_ "). __

 

(ii) If (A) any asserted Defect is not cured or removed as elected by the
Seller Representative (or waived by Purchaser) by the Closing Date or (B)
Seller Representative and Purchaser cannot agree as to whether such Defect has
been cured or removed, and it is determined by the Title Referee that such
Defect is not cured as of the applicable Closing Date, then, at the
Closing, then, in each case, subject to _Section 3.2(d)_, the Unadjusted
Purchase Price shall be adjusted by the Defect Amount attributable to such
Defect. In the event that any Title Defect that the Seller Representative
elects to cure after the Closing is cured (or partially cured) by the Cure
Deadline, then, in the final calculation of Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant
to _Section 2.5(b)_, the Adjusted Purchase Price will be adjusted upward by
the amount by which the Purchase Price was adjusted downward at the Closing
for such Defect (or the portion of such downward adjustment attributable to
the cured portion of such affected Asset).

 

(c) _Defect Amounts_. The diminution of value of any Asset attributable to any
valid Defect that burdens, encumbers or affects such Asset (the " _Defect
Amount_ ") shall be determined as follows:

(i) if Purchaser and the Seller Representative agree on the Defect Amount,
that amount shall be the Defect Amount;

(ii) if a Title Defect is a Lien which is liquidated in amount, then the
Defect Amount shall be the amount necessary to be paid to remove the Title
Defect from Sellers aggregate interest in the affected Assets;

 

(iii) if a Title Defect as to any Well represents a negative discrepancy
between (A) the actual aggregate Net Revenue Interest of Sellers for such
Well and (B) the "Net Revenue Interest" percentage stated on _Exhibit A-2_
for such Well, then the Defect Amount shall be equal to (1) the product of the
Allocated Value of such Oil and Gas Property  _multiplied by_ (2) a fraction,
the numerator of which is (x) the remainder of (I) the "Net Revenue Interest"
percentage stated on _Exhibit A-2_ for such Well _minus_ (II) the actual
aggregate Net Revenue Interest of Sellers for such Well, and the denominator
of which is (y) the "Net Revenue Interest" percentage stated on _Exhibit A-2_
for such Well; _provided, however,_ that if the Title Defect does not affect
the "Net Revenue Interest" percentage stated on _Exhibit A-2_ for such Well
throughout its entire productive life, the Defect Amount determined under this
_Section 3.2(c)(iii)_ shall be reduced to take into account the applicable
time period only;

 



38 (iv) if a Title Defect as to any Undeveloped Lease represents a negative
discrepancy between (A) the actual aggregate Net Revenue Interest of Sellers
for any such Undeveloped Lease and (B) the "Net Revenue Interest" percentage
stated on _Exhibit A-1_ for such Undeveloped Lease, then the Defect Amount
shall be equal to (1) the product of the Net Mineral Acre Price, _multiplied
by_ (2) the number of Net Mineral Acres of such Undeveloped Lease subject to
such Defect _multiplied by_ (3) a fraction, the numerator of which is (x) the
remainder of (I) the Net Revenue Interest stated in _Exhibit A-1_ for such
Undeveloped Lease _minus_ (II) the actual aggregate Net Revenue Interest of
Sellers for such Undeveloped Lease as to such Undeveloped Lease after giving
effect to such Title Defect and the denominator of which is (y) the Net
Revenue Interest stated in _Exhibit A-1_ for such Undeveloped Lease;
_provided, however_ , that if the Title Defect does not affect the
"Net Revenue Interest" percentage stated on _Exhibit A-1_ for such Lease
throughout its entire productive life, the Defect Amount determined under this
_Section 3.2(c)(iv)_ shall be reduced to take into account the
applicable time period only; _provided further_ that, if Sellers actual
aggregate Net Revenue Interest in any Lease is equal to or less than 70%, then
the Defect Amount shall be equal to the Allocated Value of such Lease;

 

(v) if a Title Defect as to any Undeveloped Lease constitutes a reduction in
the number of Net Mineral Acres as to any Undeveloped Lease, then the Defect
Amount for such Defect shall be equal to the product of (1) the Net Mineral
Acre Price therefor multiplied by (2) the remainder of (x) the number of Net
Mineral Acres purported to be included in such Undeveloped Lease as set forth
on _Exhibit A-1_ minus (y) the actual number of Net Mineral Acres included in
such Undeveloped Lease after giving effect to such Defect;

 

(vi) if the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or
charge upon or other defect in title to the affected Assets of a type not
described in _Section 3.2(c)(i)_ through _(v)_ , the Defect Amount therefor
shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the Assets
so affected, the portion of Sellers aggregate interest in the Assets
affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the
potential present value economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of
the affected Assets, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Purchaser and
the Seller Representative, the estimated capital and operational costs and
expenses (or reduction or increases thereof) attributable to Sellers
aggregate Working Interest and other interests therein, and such other factors
as are necessary to make an evaluation and determination of such value;

(vii) if a Defect is an Environmental Defect, the Defect Amount shall be equal
to the estimated present value (discounted seven percent (7%)) of the costs
and expenses (as of the Closing Date) to Remediate the Assets subject to such
Environmental Defect in the lowest-cost effective manner available, consistent
with applicable Environmental Laws taking into account that non-permanent
remedies (including mechanisms to contain or stabilize Hazardous Substances,
including monitoring site conditions, natural attenuation, risk-based
corrective action, institutional controls, or other appropriate restrictions
on the industrial use of the property, caps, dikes, encapsulation, lechate
collection systems, and the like) may be the most cost-manner, consistent with
the continued safe and prudent long-term operation of the affected Asset
reasonably available and, where applicable, to the satisfaction of the
applicable Governmental Authorities;

 



39 (viii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
aggregate adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price for all Title Defect
Amounts attributable to Title Defects upon any Asset shall not exceed the
Allocated Value of such Asset (after giving effect to any applicable
adjustments due to prior Title Defects and reductions to the Adjusted
Purchase Price under _Section 8.7_ with respect any Seller NPIs that are
deemed to constitute Excluded Assets thereunder); _provided_ , _however_ , the
foregoing limitations shall in no event apply to Environmental Defect Amounts
with respect to Environmental Defects;

(ix) the Defect Amount with respect to a Defect shall be determined
without duplication of any costs or losses included in any other Defect
Amount hereunder or of any amounts for which Purchaser otherwise receives
credit in the calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to _Section
2.4(a)_ or  _Section 2.5(b)_ and shall be calculated in a manner that is net
to Sellers interest in the applicable affected Assets; and

 

(x) If a single Defect burdens or affects more than one Asset ( _e.g._ ,
failure to obtain one permit that affects several Wells), then the Defect
Amount with respect to such Defect shall equal the aggregate amount of all
Defect Amounts attributable to such Defect, as determined in accordance with
this _Section 3.2(c)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no case will
the aggregation contemplated by this _Section 3.2(c)(x)_ apply in the event
of any Environmental Defect that is a physical condition ( _e.g._ , soil or
groundwater contamination).

 

(xi) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any discrepancy that is
solely the result of (x) the existence of the Seller NPIs held by the Seller
NPI Holders listed held on Schedule 1.1(c) or (y) the failure of a Seller NPI
Holder listed on _Schedule 1.1(c)_ to ratify and join this Agreement prior to
the Closing will be handled exclusively pursuant to  _Section 8.7_, and not
this _Article 3_.

(d) _Individual Defect Threshold and Aggregate Defect
Deductibles_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement:

(i) There shall be no Unadjusted Purchase Price adjustments or other
remedies available to Purchaser under this _Article 3_ , including those
remedies set forth in _Section 3.2(e)(iii)_ and _Section 3.2(e)(iv)_, for
any Defect to the extent the Defect Amount attributable to such Defect is less
than the Individual Defect Threshold; and

(ii) Except as otherwise provided in and _Section 3.2(e)(iv)_, with respect
to all valid Title Defects and Environmental Defects where the Defect Amounts
thereof exceeds the Individual Defect Threshold (excluding any Defects that
have been cured by Sellers or waived in writing by Purchaser), there shall be
no adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price or other remedies available to
Purchaser under this _Article 3_ , including those remedies set forth in
_Section 3.2(e)(iii)_, with respect to any and all such Defects unless and
until the aggregate Defect Amounts thereof exceed the Aggregate Defect
Deductible, and then only to the extent and in the amount by which such
aggregate amount exceeds the Aggregate Defect Deductible.

 

(e) _Remedies for Defects_. In the event that any valid Defect is not waived
in writing by Purchaser or is not cured on or prior to the Closing Date,
then, subject to the Seller Representatives right to cure (if applicable) or
dispute the existence of such Defect and the Defect Amount asserted with
respect thereto:

 



40 (i) subject to (x) _Section 3.2(e)(iii)_ or (y) any subsequent
Unadjusted Purchase Price adjustment attributable to a post-Closing cure (or
partial cure) by Sellers pursuant to _Section 3.2(b)(ii)_, with respect to
all Title Defects that have not been cured (or have only been partially cured)
by the Closing Date and the Defect Amount with respect thereto exceeds the
Individual Defect Threshold, the applicable Assets shall be conveyed to
Purchaser and the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be decreased by the sum of
the aggregate Defect Amounts attributable to all such Defects, but only to
the extent and in the amount by which such aggregate sum with respect to
Defects exceeds the Aggregate Defect Deductible;

 

(ii) subject to _Section 3.2(e)(iv)_, with respect to all Environmental
Defects that have not been cured by the Closing Date and the Defect Amount
with respect thereto exceeds the Individual Defect Threshold, the applicable
Assets shall be conveyed to Purchaser and the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall
be decreased by the sum of the aggregate Defect Amounts attributable to all
such Environmental Defects, but only to the extent and in the amount by which
such aggregate sum with respect to Defects exceeds the Aggregate Defect
Deductible;

 

(iii) notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that the
Defect Amount in respect of a Title Defect of the type described in _Section
3.2(c)(iv)_ for any Undeveloped Lease equals or exceeds the Allocated Value of
such Asset, in lieu of the remedy for Title Defects set forth in _Section
3.2(e)(i)_, either Purchaser or the Seller Representative shall have the
right, but not the obligation, to elect in writing delivered to the other
Party prior to the Closing, to exclude the Undeveloped Lease subject to such
Title Defect (along with any other Assets reasonably necessary for the
ownership or operation of such Assets) from the transactions contemplated
hereunder and, in such event, (A) the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be
decreased by the Allocated Value of such excluded Assets, (B) all such Assets
shall be deemed to be excluded from the definition of Assets and from
_Exhibit A_ attached hereto and (C) such Assets shall be deemed to constitute
Excluded Assets set forth on _Schedule 1.1(a)_; and

 

(iv) notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that any
Defect Amount in respect of an Environmental Defect for any Asset equals or
exceeds the Allocated Value of such Asset, in lieu of the remedy for
Environmental Defects set forth in _Section 3.2(e)(ii)_, either Purchaser or
the Seller Representative shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
elect in writing delivered to the other Party prior to the Closing, to
exclude the Asset subject to such Environmental Defect (along with any other
Assets reasonably necessary for the ownership or operation of such Assets;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Asset so excluded does not have an
Allocated Value, no Assets that have an Allocated Value (other than any Asset
that would reasonably be expected to be adversely affected by such excluded
Asset) shall be excluded in connection with such exclusion) from the
transactions contemplated hereunder and, in such event, (A) the Unadjusted
Purchase Price shall be decreased by the Allocated Value of such excluded
Assets (and without regard to the Aggregate Defect Deductible), (B) all such
Assets shall be deemed to be excluded from the definition of Assets and from
_Exhibit A_ attached hereto and (C) such Assets shall be deemed to constitute
Excluded Assets set forth on _Schedule 1.1(a)_. 

(f) _Title Benefits_.

 

(i) Sellers have the right, but not the obligation, to deliver to Purchaser on
or before the Defect Deadline with respect to each Title Benefit discovered
by Sellers a notice (a " _Title Benefit Notice_ ") in writing and including
(A) a description of the alleged Title Benefit that is reasonably sufficient
for Purchaser to determine the basis of the alleged Title Benefit, (B)
identification of each Asset affected by such Title Benefit (each, a

 



41  " _Title Benefit Property_ "), (C) the Allocated Value, if any, of each
Title Benefit Property, (D) to the extent available, documents reasonably
necessary for Purchaser (as well as any title attorney, examiner or
consultant hired by Purchaser) to verify, investigate or be put on notice as
to the existence of the alleged Title Benefit and (E) Seller Representatives
good faith reasonable estimate of the amount by which the Allocated Value of
each Title Benefit Property is increased by the alleged Title Benefit and the
computations and information upon which Seller Representatives estimate is
based. Sellers shall be deemed to have waived their right to assert any Title
Benefits for which a Title Benefit Notice has not been delivered on or before
the Defect Deadline.

 

 __(ii) With respect to each Title Benefit Property affected by Title Benefits
reported under _Section 3.2(f)(i)_, any reduction to the Unadjusted Purchase
Price pursuant to _Section 3.2(e)(i)_ or _Section 3.2(e)(ii)_ will be offset
by an amount (the " _Title Benefit Amount_ ") equal to the increase in the
Allocated Value for such Title Benefit Property as the result of such Title
Benefit as determined as follows: __

(A) if Purchaser and the Seller Representative agree on the Title Benefit
Amount, that amount shall be the Title Benefit Amount;

(B) if the Title Benefit Amount for any Title Benefit for a Well or
Undeveloped Lease represents an increase between (I) the actual aggregate Net
Revenue Interest of Sellers for such Well or Undeveloped Lease and (II) the
"Net Revenue Interest" percentage stated on  _Exhibit A-1_ or _Exhibit A-2_ ,
as applicable for such Well or Lease, then the Title Benefit Amount shall be
an amount equal to the product of the Allocated Value of the Title Benefit
Property _multiplied by_ a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net
Revenue Interest increase for such Title Benefit Property and the denominator
of which is the Net Revenue Interest stated in the applicable Exhibit for such
Title Benefit Property; _provided, however,_ that, if the Title Benefit does
not affect the "Net Revenue Interest" percentage stated in the applicable
Exhibit for such Title Benefit Property for the entire productive life of such
Title Benefit Property, the Title Benefit Amount determined under this 
_Section 3.2(f)(ii)(B)_ shall be reduced to taken into account the applicable
time period only; and

(C) if a Title Benefit as to any Undeveloped Lease constitutes an increase in
the number of Net Mineral Acres as to any Undeveloped Lease, then the Title
Benefit Amount for such Title Benefit shall be equal to the product of (1) the
Net Mineral Acre Price therefor  _multiplied by_ (2) the remainder of (x) the
actual number of Net Mineral Acres included in such Undeveloped Lease minus
(y) the number of Net Mineral Acres for such Undeveloped Lease as set forth on
_Exhibit A-1_.

 

(iii) Any offset for Title Benefits as provided in _Section 3.2(f)(ii)_ shall
be made and accounted for in the final calculation of the Adjusted Purchase
Price pursuant to _Section 2.5(b)_.

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Title
Benefit Amount for any Title Benefit shall be included only in the calculation
of the offset to the Unadjusted Purchase Price in _Section 3.2(f)(ii)_ if
such Title Benefit Amount is equal to or exceeds the Individual
Defect Threshold.

 



42 (v) If Sellers and Purchaser cannot reach an agreement on alleged Title
Benefits and Title Benefit Amounts by the Closing, the provisions of _Section
3.2(g)_ shall apply.

(g) _Disputed Defects_.

 

 __(i) The Seller Representative and Purchaser shall use good faith efforts to
agree on the interpretation and effect of this  _Article _3 and the validity
and determination of all Defects and Defect Amounts (or the cure thereof) and
Title Benefits and Title Benefit Amounts. If the Seller Representative and
Purchaser are unable to agree on the scope, interpretation and effect of this
_Article _3 the existence, cure or amount of any Defect or Defect Amount by
the Closing Date, then, subject to _Section 3.2(c)_, Purchasers good faith
estimate shall be used to determine the Closing Payment pursuant to _Section
2.5(a)_. If the Seller Representative and Purchaser are unable to agree on the
interpretation and effect of this _Article _3, the existence, cure or amount
of any Defect or Defect Amount, the presence or absences of wells or leases
on _Exhibit A_ (including _Exhibit A-1_ and _Exhibit A-2_), the Allocated
Value of any Asset or any other matter related to title to the Assets by the
date that is seventy-five (75) days after the Cure Deadline for the
applicable Defect, or the Closing Date for any Title Benefit, then, subject to
_Section 3.2(d)_ and _Section 3.2(e)_, such disputed interpretations and
effect of this  _Article _3, all Defects and Defect Amounts, the presence or
absences of wells or leases on _Exhibit A_ (including _Exhibit A-1_ and
_Exhibit A-2_), the Allocated Value of any Asset or any other matter
related to title to the Assets in dispute shall be exclusively and finally
resolved pursuant to this _Section 3.2(g)_. During the ten (10) Business Day
period following the date that is seventy-five (75) days after the Cure
Deadline for the applicable Defect, or the Closing Date for any Title
Benefit, as the case may be (A) disputes as to the interpretation and effect
of this _Article _3 and all Defects or Defect Amounts in dispute with respect
to Title Defects and Title Benefits or Title Benefit Amounts in dispute shall
be submitted to a title attorney that has at least ten (10) years experience
in oil and gas titles in the State of Texas, as selected by mutual agreement
of Purchaser and the Seller Representative or absent such agreement during
the ten (10) Business Day period, by the Houston office of the American
Arbitration Association (the " _Title Referee_ ") and (B) Defect or Defect
Amounts in dispute with respect to Environmental Defects shall be submitted
to a nationally recognized independent environmental consulting firm mutually
acceptable to the Seller Representative and Purchaser or absent such agreement
during the ten (10) Business Day period, by the Houston office of the
American Arbitration Association (the " _Environmental Referee_ " and
collectively with the Title Referee, each a " _Defect Referee_ "). The Defect
Referee shall not have worked as an employee or outside counsel for any Party
or any Affiliate of any Party during the ten (10) year period preceding the
arbitration or have any financial interest in the outcome of the dispute. __

 

(ii) Within ten (10) Business Days after the selection of the applicable
Defect Referee, the Parties shall provide to the applicable Defect Referee
only the documents and materials described in this _Section 3.2(g)(ii)_, as
applicable (it being the intention of the Parties that any Party submitting a
Defect Notice or Title Benefit Notice shall only be able to submit to the
applicable Defect Referee the information, reports, opinions and materials
included with or provided as part of such Defect Notice or Title Benefit
Notice):

 



43 (A) Purchasers Defect Notice and all documentation provided therewith with
respect to each disputed Defect or the Seller Representatives Title Benefit
Notice and all documentation provided therewith with respect to each disputed
Title Benefit;

 

(B) such evidence as each Party deems appropriate to explain and dispute the
existence, amount, waiver and cure or each disputed Defect or Title Benefit
or Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount assigned thereto by Purchaser or the
Seller Representative, together with such Partys good faith estimate of the
Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount, if any, with respect to each
such disputed Defect or Title Benefit; and

(C) this _Article _3, _Exhibit A_ (including _Exhibits A-1_ and  _Exhibit
A-2_) and _Schedule 2.8_, together with any definitions of terms used in this
_Article _3 and such Exhibits and Schedule, but no other provisions of this
Agreement.

 

(iii) The arbitration proceeding shall be held in Midland, Texas and shall be
conducted in accordance with, but not under the auspices or jurisdiction of,
the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to
the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this _Section
3.2(g)_. The applicable Defect Referees determination shall be made within
sixty (60) days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final
and binding upon the Parties, without right of appeal. In making a
determination, the applicable Defect or Title Benefit, the Defect Referee
shall be bound by the rules set forth in this _Article _3 and may consider
such other matters as in the opinion of the applicable Defect Referee are
necessary or helpful to make a determination; _provided_ , _however_ , in
determining the existence or amount of any Defect, Defect Amount, Title
Benefit or Title Benefit Amount, Purchaser may not submit any evidence,
records, materials, data or information that was not included in a valid
Defect Notice delivered to the Seller Representative by the Defect Deadline
and the Seller Representative may not submit any evidence, records, materials,
data or information that was not included in a valid Title Benefit Notice
delivered to Purchaser by the Defect Deadline, as applicable.
Additionally, the applicable Defect Referee may consult with and engage any
disinterested Third Party to advise the Defect Referee, including title
attorneys, petroleum engineers and environmental consultants.

 

(iv) The Defect Referee shall be authorized to select only the Defect Amount
with respect to any Defect or Title Benefit Amount with respect to any Title
Benefit, that was proposed by the Seller Representative in its submissions
pursuant to _Section 3.2(g)(ii)_ (with respect to Defects) or in the
applicable Title Benefit Notice (with respect to Title Benefits) (on the one
hand) or Purchaser in the applicable Defect Notice (with respect to Defects)
or in its submissions pursuant to _Section 3.2(g)(ii)_ (with respect to Title
Benefits) (on the other hand). Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the Defect Referee shall have exclusive, final and binding
authority with respect to the scope of the Defect Referees authority with
respect to any dispute arising under or related to this _Article _3 or any
disputed Defect, Defect Amount, Title Benefit and Title Benefit Amount and in
no event shall any dispute as to the authority of the Defect Referee to
determine any such disputes be subject to resolution or the provisions of
_Section 14.3_. The applicable Defect Referee shall act as an expert for the
limited purpose of determining the interpretation and effect of this _Article
_3 and any and all specific disputed Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amount

not, individually or in the aggregate, if determined adversely to Purchaser
Parent or any of its subsidiaries or their respective assets or any director
or officer of Purchaser Parent or any of its subsidiaries, reasonably be
expected to result in a Purchaser Parent Material Adverse Effect. None of
Purchaser Parent or any of its subsidiaries or their respective assets, or any
director or officer of Purchaser Parent or any of its subsidiaries, in each
case, for whom Purchaser Parent or any of its subsidiaries may be liable, is a
party to or subject to the provisions of any order, writ, injunction, decree
or award of any Governmental Authority which would, individually or in the
aggregate, if determined adversely to Purchaser Parent or any of its
subsidiaries or their respective assets or any director or officer of
Purchaser Parent or any of its subsidiaries, reasonably be expected to result
in a Purchaser Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 6.8 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since June 30, 2016, there has not
been any Purchaser Parent Material Adverse Effect or any event, occurrence,
change, discovery or development of a state of circumstances or facts which
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Purchaser Parent Material Adverse Effect.

COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES

 

Section 8.1 _Access_.

 

(a) Upon execution of this Agreement until the Defect Deadline, the Seller
Parties shall give Purchaser, its Affiliates and each of their respective
officers, employees, agents, accountants, attorneys, investment bankers,
environmental consultants and other authorized representatives (" _Purchaser
s Representatives_") access to Assets operated by any Seller Party and the
Records in any Seller Partys possession during the Seller Parties normal
business hours, for the purpose of conducting a confirmatory review of the
Assets, to the extent that a Seller Party has authority to grant such access
without breaching any restriction binding on such Seller Party, but only to
the extent that Seller Parties may do so without (i) violating applicable
Laws, (ii) waiving any legal privilege of any Seller Party, any of its
Affiliates or its counselors, attorneys, accountants or consultants or (iii)
violating any obligations to any Third Party, _provided, however,_ that the
Seller Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to, upon
Purchasers written request, request from any Third Party operator any
consents or waivers necessary for Purchasers Representatives to gain access
to the Assets not operated by any Seller Party as contemplated in this
_Section 8.1_. Such access shall be granted to Purchaser (A) in the offices
of the Seller Representative located in Midland, Texas and (B) on the premises
of the Oil and Gas Properties operated by any Seller Party (or for which
Seller Parties have received the consent referenced in the preceding
sentence). All investigations and due diligence conducted by Purchaser or any
of Purchasers Representatives shall be conducted at Purchasers sole cost,
risk and expense and any conclusions made from any examination done by
Purchaser or any of Purchasers Representatives shall result from Purchasers
own independent review and judgment. The Seller Parties or their designee
shall have the right to accompany Purchaser and Purchasers Representatives
whenever they are on site on the Assets and are permitted and collect split
test samples if any are collected. Purchasers investigation and review shall
be conducted in a manner that minimizes interference with the ownership
or operation of the Assets or the business of the Seller Parties or co-owners
thereof and Purchasers inspection right with respect to the environmental
condition of the Assets shall be limited to conducting a Phase I Environmental
Site Assessment in accordance with the American Society for Testing and
Materials (A.S.T.M.) Standard Practice Environmental Site Assessments: Phase I
Environmental Site Assessment Process (Publication Designation: E1527-13) ("
_Phase I_ "). Purchaser shall not be entitled to conduct any Phase II
Environmental Site Assessments in accordance with the American Society for
Testing and Materials (A.S.T.M.) Standard Practice Environmental Site
Assessments: Phase II Environmental Site Assessment Process (Publication
Designation: E1903-

 



59  11) (" _Phase II_ ") or any invasive or intrusive testing, or sampling on or
relating to the Assets (collectively, the (" _Invasive Activity_ ")
without the prior written consent of the Seller Representative, such consent
to be granted, conditioned or withheld at the sole discretion of the Seller
Representative; _provided_ , _however_ , in the event that (x) Purchasers
Phase I has identified a Recognized Environmental Concern (as determined
under A.S.T.M. Publication Designation: E1527-13) and Purchaser reasonably
concludes that it is necessary to conduct a Phase II on an Asset prior to the
Closing in order for Purchaser to ascertain whether such Recognized
Environmental Concern is an Environmental Defect, (y) Purchaser has delivered
a written notice to the Seller Representative, requesting the Seller
Representatives consent to conduct such a Phase II (including the
corresponding portions of the Phase I on which Purchaser has based its
reasonable conclusions) and (z) the Seller Representative fails to grant such
consent within five (5) days of the Seller Representatives receipt of such
request, then Purchaser shall have the right to exclude the Assets subject to
such written request (along with any other Assets reasonably necessary for the
ownership or operation of such Assets) from the transactions contemplated
hereunder and, in such event, (A) the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be
decreased by the Allocated Value, if any, of such excluded Assets, (B) all
such Assets shall be deemed to be excluded from the definition of Assets and
from  _Exhibit A_ (including _Exhibit A-1_ and _Exhibit A-2_) attached
hereto, (C) such Assets shall be deemed to constitute Excluded Assets set
forth on _Schedule 1.1(a)_ and (D) Purchaser shall have no rights or
obligations hereunder with respect to such Excluded Assets. Purchaser shall
obtain all permits necessary to conduct any approved invasive activities from
any applicable Governmental Authorities; _provided_ that Sellers shall
provide Purchaser with assistance as reasonably requested by Purchaser that
may be necessary to secure such permits. If the Seller Representative consents
to any requested Invasive Activity, all such activities will be performed by
Purchasers Representatives in accordance with the Phase II Guidelines.

(b) Purchaser (i) waives and releases all claims against the Sellers Group
and any Third Party operators arising in any way in connection with Purchaser
and Purchasers Representatives rights of access, examination and inspection
under this _Section 8.1_ and (ii) agrees to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless each member of the Sellers Group, the other owners of interests in
the Oil and Gas Properties, and all such Persons stockholders, members,
officers, directors, employees, agents, lenders, advisors,
representatives, accountants, attorneys and consultants from and against any
and all claims, damages, obligations, liabilities, losses, costs and expenses
(including court costs and reasonable attorneys fees), including claims,
damages, obligations, liabilities, losses, costs and expenses attributable
to, arising out of or relating to access to the Records, any offices of the
Seller Parties, or the Assets prior to the Closing by Purchaser or any of
Purchasers Representatives, EVEN IF SUCH CLAIMS, DAMAGES, LIABILITIES,
OBLIGATIONS, LOSSES, COSTS AND EXPENSES ARE CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE
NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER
LEGAL FAULT OF ANY MEMBER OF THE SELLERS GROUP, BUT EXCLUDING IN EACH CASE OF
THE FOREGOING _CLAUSES (I)_ AND _(II)_ , (X) THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL
MISCONDUCT ON THE PART OF ANY SELLER OR OTHER MEMBER OF THE SELLERS GROUP AND

control the appointment of a successor operator. the Seller Parties agree,
however, that as to the Assets any of them operate, the Seller Parties shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to support Purchasers efforts to
become successor operator of such Assets (to the extent permitted under any
applicable joint operating agreement) effective as of Closing and to
designate and/or appoint, to the extent legally possible and permitted under

consents to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) notices to
the holders of any applicable preferential rights to purchase or similar
rights triggered by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in
compliance with the terms of such rights and requesting waivers of such
rights. Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (x) cause any

cause all such preferential rights to purchase to be waived prior to Closing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers shall not be required to make payments
or undertake obligations to obtain any Consents or waivers of preferential

preferential rights to purchase or similar rights that are not set forth on
_Schedule 4.12(a)_ or  _Schedule 4.12(b)_ or for which notices have not
been sent in compliance with the first sentence hereof, and which are
applicable to the Assets, Purchaser shall promptly provide written notice to
Sellers of such Consents and preferential rights, whereupon Sellers shall
promptly thereafter comply with such Consents and preferential rights in
accordance with this _Section 8.4_, _Section 8.5_ and _Section 8.6_, as
applicable.

 

Section 8.5 _Consents to Assignment_.

 

(a) In no event shall there be transferred at Closing any Asset for which a
Required Consent has not been satisfied or obtained.

 

(b) In cases in which the Asset subject to such an unobtained Required Consent
is an Asset other than an Oil and Gas Property, and Purchaser is assigned the
Oil and Gas Property or Oil and Gas Properties to which such Asset relates at
Closing, but such Asset is not transferred to Purchaser due to the unwaived
Required Consent requirement, the Parties shall continue after Closing to
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Required Consent so that
such Asset can be transferred to Purchaser upon receipt of the Required
Consent, and, if permitted pursuant to applicable Law and agreement, such
Asset shall be held by Sellers for the benefit of Purchaser, Purchaser shall
pay all amounts due thereunder or with respect thereto, and Purchaser shall be
responsible for the performance of any obligations under or with respect to
such Asset to the extent that Purchaser has been transferred the Assets
necessary to such performance until the applicable Required Consent is
obtained.

 



63 (c) In cases in which the Asset subject to such a Required Consent requirement
is an Oil and Gas Property and the Required Consent is not obtained by
Closing, Purchaser may elect to exclude the Oil and Gas Property subject to
such Required Consent from the Assets conveyed at Closing and (i) the
Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value, if any, of
such Oil and Gas Property, (ii) such Oil and Gas Property shall be deemed to
be deleted from _Exhibit A_ (including _Exhibit A-1_ and _Exhibit A-2_) and
added to  _Schedule 1.1(a)_ and (iii) such Oil and Gas Property shall
constitute an Excluded Asset for all purposes hereunder. If any such Required
Consent requirement with respect to which an adjustment to the Unadjusted
Purchase Price is made under pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence
is subsequently satisfied prior to the Cut-Off Date, (A) Sellers shall,
promptly after such Required Consent requirement is satisfied, convey the
applicable Oil and Gas Property to Purchaser, using the form of Conveyance
attached hereto as _Exhibit B-1_, (B) the Parties shall deliver all
instruments and documents that would have been required under the terms hereof
to be delivered at Closing with respect to such Oil and Gas Properties at
Closing, (C) Purchaser shall, simultaneously with the conveyance of the
applicable Oil and Gas Property, pay the amount of any previous deduction from
the Unadjusted Purchase Price (subject to all other applicable
adjustments with respect to such Oil and Gas Properties under _Section 2.4_)
to Sellers and (D) such Oil and Gas Property shall no longer be deemed to be
(1) deleted from _Exhibit A_ (including _Exhibit A-1_ and  _Exhibit A-2_),
(2) added to _Schedule 1.1(a)_ or (3) an Excluded Asset for any purposes
hereunder.

 

Section 8.6 _Preferential Rights_.

 

(a) Any preferential purchase right triggered by the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement must be exercised subject to all terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement, including the successful Closing of this Agreement
pursuant to _Article 10_ on the dates set forth herein. The consideration
payable under this Agreement for any particular Asset for purposes
of preferential purchase right notices shall be the Allocated Value for such
Asset, adjusted as set forth herein.

(b) If any preferential right to purchase any Asset (i) is validly and timely
exercised prior to Closing, (ii) is not exercised or waived prior to the
Closing but the time for exercise or waiver of such preferential right has not
yet expired or (iii) the holder of such preferential right has disputed in
writing the validity or terms of the notice delivered by Sellers with respect
to such right, then in each case, at the Closing, (A) the Unadjusted Purchase
Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such Oil and Gas Property,
(B) such Oil and Gas Property shall be deemed to be deleted from _Exhibit A_
(including _Exhibit A-1_ and _Exhibit A-2_) and added to _Schedule 1.1(a)_,
and (iii) such Oil and Gas Property shall constitute an Excluded Asset for
all purposes hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , in the event (x) the holder
of any preferential right to purchase any Asset validly exercises such
preferential right prior to Closing but refuses or fails to consummate the
purchase of such Asset as of the Cut-Off Date or (y) the time for exercise or
waiver of a preferential right expires after the Closing without exercise
thereof, Sellers shall convey such Asset to Purchaser effective as of the
Effective Time pursuant to a Conveyance and, simultaneously with such
conveyance, Purchaser shall pay to Sellers the Allocated Value of such Assets
(subject to all other applicable adjustments with respect to such Oil and Gas
Properties under _Section 2.4_), and such Asset shall no longer be deemed to
be (1) deleted from _Exhibit A_ (including _Exhibit A-1_ and _Exhibit
A-2_), (2) added to  _Schedule 1.1(a)_ or (3) an Excluded Asset for any
purposes hereunder.

 



64 Section 8.7 _Drag-Alongs and Tag-Alongs_.

 

(a) Promptly after the Execution Date and in any event no later five (5) days
after the Execution Date, the Seller Representative shall prepare and send,
or cause to be prepared and sent, on forms reasonably satisfactory to
Purchaser, (a) notices to the holders of any Tag-Alongs, including those set
forth on _Schedule 4.12(c)_ , in compliance with the terms of such Tag-Alongs
and (b) notices to the holders of any Drag-Alongs, including those set forth
on _Schedule 4.12(c)_ , in compliance with the terms of such Drag-Alongs
notifying the Persons subject to such Drag-Alongs that Sellers (and
Purchaser) have elected to exercise such Drag-Along in connection with the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement. Sellers shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause all such Tag-Alongs and Drag-Alongs to be
exercised prior to Closing;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, except as
expressly contemplated by this Agreement, Sellers shall not be required to
make payments or undertake obligations to obtain any exercise of Tag-Alongs
and Drag-Alongs.

 

(b) Sellers shall comply with the provisions of any Tag-Alongs and Drag-Alongs
set forth on _Schedule 4.12(c)_ and execute and deliver all agreements and
instruments required to be executed and delivered by Sellers under the
respective terms of such Tag-Alongs and Drag Alongs. If prior to Closing,
Purchaser discovers any Tag-Alongs or Drag-Alongs or similar rights that are
not set forth on _Schedule 4.12(c)_ and that are applicable to the Assets,
Purchaser shall provide written notice to Sellers of such Tag-Alongs and Drag-
Alongs, whereupon Sellers shall promptly thereafter comply with such Tag-
Alongs or Drag-Alongs in accordance with this _Section 8.7_.

(i) With respect to any Seller NPI Holder that, as a result of a Tag-Along,
Drag-Along or otherwise, agrees to ratify and join this Agreement as a
Seller, then upon the execution and delivery to Purchaser by such Seller NPI
Holder (and if such Seller NPI Holder is a natural Person, by such Persons
spouse) of a ratification and joinder agreement substantially in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit F_ , such Seller NPI Holders right, title and
interests in the Seller NPIs shall be included in the Assets conveyed to
Purchaser hereunder and such Seller NPI Holder shall be considered and
constitute a Seller hereunder for all purposes (but, for the avoidance of
doubt, not an Initial NPI Seller). The portion of the Purchase Price to which
a Seller shall be entitled with respect to the Seller NPI owned by
such Seller shall be determined in a manner consistent with Schedule 8.7,
taking into account the negative capital account for such Seller and the other
adjustments to the Purchase Price set forth in this Agreement.

 

(c) With respect to any Seller NPI Holder that, notwithstanding a Tag-Along,
Drag-Along, does not ratify and join this Agreement as a Seller prior to
Closing in the manner contemplated in _Section 8.7(b)_, then in either such
event (i) the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be decreased by the value
specified for such Seller NPI on _Schedule 8.7_ , (ii) the Seller NPI held by
such Seller NPI Holder shall be deemed to be excluded from the definition of
Assets and from _Exhibit A_ attached hereto and (iii) such Assets shall be
deemed to constitute Excluded Assets set forth on  _Schedule 1.1(a)_. For
the avoidance of doubt, any Allocated Value with respect to any Asset to which
such Seller NPI has an interest shall be adjusted appropriately in order to
take into account the fact that such Seller NPI is an Excluded Asset.

(d) If after Closing and prior to the Cut-Off Date (i) any Seller NPI Holder
elects to ratify and join this Agreement as to such Seller NPI Holders
right, title and interest in and to the Seller NPIs or Sellers acquire, or are
ready, willing and able to acquire, any interest in any Seller NPIs, then in
either such event the Seller Representative shall provide Notice to Purchaser
as to the occurrence of such event, and promptly thereafter (A) such Seller
NPI Holder shall convey, or such Sellers shall acquire and then convey, the
applicable Seller NPI to 

 



65  Purchaser, (B) the Parties shall deliver all instruments and documents that
would have been required under the terms hereof to be delivered at Closing
with respect to such Seller NPI at Closing, (C) Purchaser shall,
simultaneously with the conveyance of the applicable Seller NPI, pay the
amount of any previous deduction from the Unadjusted Purchase Price (subject
to all other applicable adjustments with respect to such Seller NPI under
_Section 2.4_) to Sellers and (D) such Seller NPI shall no longer be deemed
to be (1) deleted from _Exhibit A_, (2) added to _Schedule 1.1(a)_ and (3)
an Excluded Asset for any purposes hereunder.

Section 8.8 _Casualty Loss_. If, after the Execution Date but prior to or on
the Closing Date, any portion of the Oil and Gas Properties is destroyed by
fire, explosion, wild well, hurricane, storm, weather events, loop currents,
civil unrest or similar disorder, terrorist acts, war or any other hostilities
or other similar casualty or is expropriated or taken in condemnation or
under right of eminent domain (each, excluding any damage as a result of
depreciation, mechanical failure or gradual structural deterioration of
materials, equipment and infrastructure, downhole failure or ordinary
course reservoir changes or depletion, a " _Casualty Loss_ "), Purchaser and
the Seller Parties shall, subject to the satisfaction (or waiver) of the
conditions to Closing set forth in _Article _9, nevertheless be required
to proceed with Closing and (except to the extent Sellers have, prior to the
Closing, caused the Assets affected by such Casualty Loss to be repaired or
restored to at least its condition prior to such Casualty Loss, at Sellers
sole cost and expense) the Unadjusted Purchase Price will be reduced at
Closing by the lesser of: (a) the aggregate amount necessary to repair or
restore the affected Asset(s) to its condition prior to such Casualty Loss and
(b) the reduction in value of the affected Asset(s) due solely to such
Casualty Loss.

Section 8.9 _Closing Efforts and Further Assurances_. Each Party agrees that
from and after the Execution Date until the Closing Date it will not
voluntarily undertake any course of action inconsistent with the provisions or
intent of this Agreement and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all
actions reasonably necessary, proper, or advisable under applicable Laws to

use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each
other to cause to be lifted or rescinded any injunction or restraining order
or other order adversely affecting the ability of the Parties to consummate

Section 8.10 _Notifications_. If, prior to Closing, either a Seller Party or
Purchaser obtains Knowledge that it has breached a representation, warranty,
covenant, obligation or other agreement under this Agreement, then such Party,
as applicable, shall promptly inform such other Party (or in the case
of Purchaser, inform the Seller Representative) of such breach.

with respect to the representations and warranties of the Seller Parties

respect to any matter hereafter arising or discovered which, if existing or
known at the Execution Date or thereafter, would have been required to be set
forth or described in such Schedules. For all purposes of this Agreement,
including for purposes of determining whether the conditions set forth in
_Section 9.2_ have been fulfilled and the indemnification obligations of the
Parties in _Article 13_, the Disclosure Schedules contained in this
Agreement shall be deemed to include only that information contained therein
on the Execution Date and shall be deemed to exclude all information contained
in any addition, supplement or amendment thereto.

Section 8.18 _Employee Matters_.

 

 __(a) Beginning on the Execution Date, the Seller Parties shall make
available to Purchaser each of the Business Employees to discuss potential
employment with Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser. Purchaser shall
provide the Seller Representative, in writing, not later than ten (10)
calendar days prior to the Closing Date, a list of those Business Employees to
whom Purchaser or one of its Affiliates intends to make offers of employment
(collectively, the " _Designated Employees_ "), and such list shall include
information regarding the terms and conditions of such offer (e.g.,
compensation, employee benefits, job duties) reasonably requested by the
Seller Representative. Such offers shall be for employment as of the Closing
Date or, if later, such date on which the applicable Designated Employee
returns from a leave of absence (so long as such return occurs within ninety
(90) days after the Closing or such later time as may be required by
applicable Law). Such offers of employment shall be on terms and conditions
determined by Purchaser or its applicable Affiliate in its discretion. Each
such employment offer shall be subject to and conditioned upon the occurrence
of the Closing and the satisfaction of Purchasers or its applicable
Affiliates applicable pre-employment screening processes. The Seller Parties
and their Affiliates shall not take any action intended to interfere with any
such employment offer or negotiations by Purchaser or its Affiliates to employ
any Designated Employee or take any action intended to discourage any
Designated Employee from accepting employment with Purchaser or its
Affiliates. The date of a Designated Employees commencement of active
employment with Purchaser or its Affiliate is referred to herein as his or her
" _Hire Date._ " __

 



70 __(b) For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Transferred Employee_ " is a
Designated Employee who accepts an offer of employment made pursuant to
_Section 8.18(a)_, passes Purchasers or its Affiliates applicable pre-
employment screening processes, and becomes employed by Purchaser or one of
its Affiliates pursuant to the process set forth in _Section 8.18(a)_ above.
With respect to each Transferred Employee and effective as of the time
immediately prior to such Transferred Employees Hire Date, the Seller
Parties or their Affiliates shall (i) terminate the employment of such
Transferred Employee and (ii) waive and release any confidentiality, non-
competition, non-disclosure or other agreements between any Seller Party or
any of their Affiliates and such Transferred Employee that would restrict or
encumber such Transferred Employees ability to perform any of his or her
duties as an employee of Purchaser or its Affiliate, but only to the extent
necessary to allow such Transferred Employees to provide services to
Purchaser and its Affiliates. __

(c) On or before the Hire Date of each Transferred Employee, the Seller
Parties or their Affiliates shall (i) take any necessary action to fully vest
as of such date such Transferred Employees account balances and other
benefits under all Seller Benefit Plans, if any, that (A) are employee
pension benefit plans (as such term is defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), or
(B) provide equity-based awards, and (ii) take such actions, if and to the
extent permitted by the Seller Benefit Plans, as may be necessary to permit
the continuation of loan repayments after such date by the Transferred
Employee if he or she has an outstanding loan from any Seller Benefit Plan
that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code. Such
loan repayments shall be made directly by the Transferred Employee to the
applicable Seller Benefit Plan, and shall be permitted so long as the
Transferred Employee remains employed by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 8.18_ are solely for the benefit of the
parties hereto and nothing in this  _Section 8.18_, express or implied,
shall confer upon any Business Employee, or legal representative or
beneficiary thereof, any rights or remedies, including any right to employment
or continued employment for any specified period, or compensation or benefits
of any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement. Nothing in this
_Section 8.18_, express or implied, shall be (i) deemed an amendment of any
Seller Benefit Plan, or (ii) construed to prevent Purchaser or its Affiliates
from terminating or modifying to any extent or in any respect any employee
benefit plan that Purchaser or its Affiliates may establish or maintain.

 

Section 8.19 _Audits and Filings_.

 

(a) From and after the Execution Date until the first (1st) anniversary
thereof, The Seller Parties shall, and shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause their respective Affiliates to, make available to Purchaser
and its Affiliates and their agents and representatives any and all books,
records, information and documents that are attributable to the Assets in any
Sellers or any of their Affiliates possession or control if reasonably
required by Purchaser Parent, its Affiliates and their agents and
representatives in order to prepare for Purchaser Parent or its Affiliates, if
required, in connection with such filings, financial statements relating to
the Assets or to the Seller Parties or their Affiliates meeting the
requirements of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC, along with any
documentation attributable to or relating to the Assets required to complete
any audit associated with such financial statements.

 



71 __(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 8.19(a)_, from and
after the Execution Date until the first (1st) anniversary thereof, the
Seller Parties shall, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause
their Affiliates to, cooperate with the independent auditors chosen by
Purchaser Parent (" _Purchaser s Auditor_") in connection with any audit by
Purchasers Auditor of any financial statements relating to the Assets or of
any Seller or any of their Affiliates that Purchaser Parent or any of
its Affiliates requires to comply with the requirements of the Securities
Laws or other Tax, financial or reporting requirements. Such cooperation will
include (i) reasonable access to the Seller Parties officers, managers,
employees, agents and representatives who were responsible for preparing or
maintaining the financial records and work papers and other supporting
documents used in the preparation of such financial statements as may be
required by Purchasers Auditor to perform an audit or conduct a review in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards or to otherwise verify
such financial statements, (ii) delivery of one or more customary
representation letters from the Seller Parties to Purchasers Auditor that
are reasonably requested by Purchaser Parent to allow such auditors to
complete an audit (or review of any financial statements), and to issue an
opinion acceptable to Purchasers Auditor with respect to an audit or review
of those financial records required pursuant to this _Section 8.19(b)_ and
(iii) using reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of the independent
auditor of the Seller Parties that conducted any audit of such financial
statements to be named as an expert in any report filed by Purchaser Parent
with the SEC. Purchaser Parent will reimburse the Seller Parties, within ten
(10) Business Days after receipt of demand in writing therefor, for any
reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Seller Parties or their
Affiliates in complying with the provisions of this _Section 8.19(b)_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall expand the Seller Parties
representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements set forth in this
Agreement or give Purchaser, its Affiliates, or any third Person any rights to
which it is not entitled hereunder. __

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 14.12_, for a period of three
(3) years following the Closing Date, the Seller Parties shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to, retain all books, records, information
and documents in their or their Affiliates possession that are necessary to
prepare and audit financial statements with respect to the Assets or
otherwise relating to the Seller Parties or their respective Affiliates,
except to the extent originals or copies thereof are transferred to Purchaser
in connection with Closing. Purchaser Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Sellers Group from and against any and all damages suffered or incurred
by them arising from any claims by Third Parties or Governmental Authorities
against them in connection with any action taken by them at the request of
Purchaser Parent pursuant to this  _Section 8.19(c)_ or in connection with
the arrangement of any financings or securities offerings and any filing made
pursuant to the Securities Laws or other disclosures in connection with any
such financings or securities offerings, except to the extent such damages
arise as a result of the gross negligence or intentional misconduct of any
member of the Sellers Group.

 



72 Section 8.20 _Resale Registration Statement; NYSE Listing_.

 

 __(a) In the event the Stock Option is validly exercised, promptly following
the Closing, but in any event within two (2) Business Days following the
Closing, Purchaser Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
file with the SEC a registration statement that registers under the Securities
Act the sale from time to time pursuant to Rule 415 promulgated under
the Securities Act by Sellers of the Purchaser Parent Common Stock comprising
the Stock Purchase Price. Purchaser Parent shall further use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared
effective by the SEC as promptly thereafter as possible, including by filing
an "automatic shelf registration statement" (as such term in defined in Rule
405 promulgated under the Securities Act) that becomes effective upon filing
with the SEC in accordance with Rule 462(e) to the extent Purchaser Parent is
then a "well-known seasoned issuer" (as such term is defined in Rule 405
promulgated under the Securities Act). Purchaser Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to keep such registration statement effective
continuously until the earlier to occur of (x) the six (6) month anniversary
of the Closing and (y) the date the Purchaser Parent Common Stock is no longer
registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. Purchaser Parent shall use
its best efforts not take any action, or fail to take any action, in each case
prior to the effectiveness of the shelf registration statement described in
this _Section 8.20(a)_, which action or failure would reasonably be expected
to cause Purchaser Parent to no longer be qualified as a "well-known seasoned
issuer" or to be ineligible to file a registration statement under the
Securities Act on Form S-3 (or any successor form). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Purchaser Parent shall have the right to (i) delay the
effectiveness of any registration statement for a period of up to four (4)
consecutive weeks (including by delaying the initial filing of an automatic
shelf registration statement), or (ii) suspend the use by Sellers of any
registration statement for a period of up to four (4) consecutive weeks, to
the extent, in the case of either _clause (i)_ or _(ii)_ , Purchaser Parent
is then in possession of material non-public information that would be
detrimental to Purchaser Parent to disclose at such time; _provided, however_
, if Purchaser Parent determines in good faith that the material non-public
information would, if disclosed, reasonably be expected to have a material
and adverse effect on the trading price of the Purchaser Parent Common Stock,
references in this sentence to "four (4) consecutive weeks" shall instead be
to "two (2) consecutive weeks". The costs of preparing and filing any such
registration statement shall be borne by Purchaser Parent, though any selling
expenses or commissions incurred in connection with any sale pursuant to such
registration statement shall be borne by the Seller that is disposing of its
shares pursuant to such sale. Any such registration statement shall be in such
form, and shall contain a plan of distribution requested by the Seller
Representative, which shall be in compliance with applicable Law and
acceptable to Purchaser Parent in its reasonable judgment; _provided, however_
, in no event shall Purchaser Parent be obligated to participate in any "road
show" or other marketing efforts by Seller pursuant to such registration
statement. After the six (6) month anniversary of the Closing Date, upon
request by or on behalf of Sellers in connection with any proposed sale of any
shares of Purchaser Parent Common Stock issued to Sellers hereunder,
Purchaser shall cause its transfer agent to promptly issue new certificates
without legends to any transferees of such shares at no cost to Sellers for
legal opinions or any other mechanics. Prior to the one (1) year anniversary
of the Closing Date, Purchaser Parent will use its best efforts to comply
with the current public information requirements of Rule 144(c) under the
Securities Act. Upon the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall cause Purchaser Parents transfer agent to issue new
certificates representing the Purchaser Parent Common Stock issued to Sellers
hereunder without any restrictive legends, at no cost to Sellers for legal
opinions or any other mechanics, subject only to receipt of the original
stock certificates from Sellers. __

 



73 (b) In the event the Stock Option is validly exercised, Purchaser Parent shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Purchaser Parent Common
Stock comprising the Stock Purchase Price listed on the NYSE prior to the
Closing, subject to official notice of issuance of such shares.

 

Section 8.21 _Lock-Up_.

 

 __(a) Sellers hereby irrevocably agree that, without the prior written
consent of Purchaser Parent, Sellers will not, directly or indirectly, for a
period commencing on the Execution Date and ending on and including the
thirtieth (30th) day after the Closing Date (such thirty (30) day period, the
" _Lock-Up Period_ "), (i) offer for sale, sell or otherwise dispose of (or
enter into any transaction or device that is designed to, or would reasonably
be expected to, result in the disposition by any Person at any time in the
future of), or, in the case of the Reliance Seller Subsidiaries and the
Initial NPI Sellers, pledge, in each case of the foregoing any shares of
Purchaser Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) enter
into any swap or other derivatives transaction that transfers to another, in
whole or in part, any of the economic benefits or risks of ownership of
shares of Purchaser Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to this Agreement,
whether any such transaction described in _clause (i)_ or _(ii)_ above is to

74 __Section 8.22 _Non-Negotiation_ __. From and after the Execution Date up to
and including the Closing Date (or earlier termination of this Agreement), the
Seller Parties shall not, and the Seller Parties shall direct their respective
Affiliates and each of their respective directors, officers, employees,
representatives, advisors, brokers or agents not to, directly or indirectly,
(a) actively market any material portion of the Assets to any Person other
than Purchaser or its Affiliates (an " _Acquisition Transaction_ "), (b)
solicit or initiate negotiations, submissions of proposals or offers in
respect to any Acquisition Transaction, or (c) permit any Person (other than
Purchaser) to conduct any on-site diligence with respect to the Assets. __

Section 8.23 _Non-Competition_.

 

 __(a) The Seller Parties acknowledge that Purchaser is entering into this
Agreement and assuming the Assumed Obligations, in contemplation of
undertaking substantial further development of the Assets, which development
is intended to permit Purchaser to satisfy such Assumed Obligations. As a
material inducement to Purchaser to enter into this Agreement, from and
after Closing each Seller Party shall not, and shall ensure and cause each
Affiliate of such Seller Party (each, a " _Restricted Person_ ") not to,
directly or indirectly, acquire in any capacity during the period from and
after the Execution Date and ending on the date that is one (1) year after
the Closing Date (the " _Non-Compete Period_ "), any interest in any
Restricted Opportunity, whether alone or as a partner, joint venturer or
equity interest holder of any Person acquiring such interest. __

__(b) As used herein " _Restricted Opportunity_ " means any opportunity for,
including an opportunity to finance, the leasing, acquisition, farm-in,
exploration, development, production, gathering or marketing or any
combination of the foregoing, of oil, gas or other Hydrocarbons leases,
Hydrocarbon interests, royalty interests, overriding royalty interests,
Hydrocarbon interests payable out of production, production payments or any
other rights to acquire any of the foregoing interests in the Development
Area;  __ _provided_ __that a Restricted Opportunity shall not (i) include
any transaction where the assets involved that are located in the Development
Area include less than ten percent (10%) of the assets involved (either as to
the number of acres or wells subject thereto or the value of such assets) in
the transaction, and any assets in the area described above that are acquired
as described in this provision shall be exempted from the restrictions in
this  _Section 8.23_, (ii) in the case of the Seller Parties other than any
Additional NPI Sellers, the assets and interests described on _Schedule
1.1(a)_ , or (iii) in the case of any Additional NPI Sellers, any Additional
NPI Seller Excluded Interests owned by any Additional NPI Seller in the
Development Area as of the Closing Date; ___provided further_ __that, if any
Seller Party or its Affiliates acquires any assets in the Development
Area, such Seller Party or such Affiliate, as applicable shall not
subsequently acquire any additional oil and gas leases or mineral interests in
production of Hydrocarbons in the Development Area during the Non-Compete
Period, except as permitted pursuant to this _Section 8.23(b)_. __

(c) The Parties agree that the limitations contained in this  _Section 8.23_
with respect to time, geographical area and scope of activity are reasonable
in all respects and necessary to preserve the value of the goodwill and Assets
being conveyed by Sellers pursuant hereto. However, if any court shall
determine that the time, geographical area or scope of activity of any
restriction contained in this _Section 8.23_ is unenforceable, it is the
intention of the Parties that such restrictive covenant set forth herein shall
not thereby be terminated but shall be deemed amended to the extent required
to render it valid and enforceable.

 



75 (d) The Parties hereto recognize that, because of the nature and subject
matter of this  _Section 8.23_, it would be impractical and extremely
difficult to determine Purchasers actual damages in the event of a breach of
its obligations under this _Section 8.23_. Without prejudice to the rights
and remedies otherwise available to Purchaser hereunder, the Seller Parties
agree that money damages would not be an adequate remedy for breach of this
_Section 8.23_ by the Seller Parties or any of their respective Affiliates
and that if any Seller Party or its Affiliate commits a breach, or threatens
to commit a breach, of this _Section 8.23_, Purchaser shall have the right to
have the provisions of this _Section 8.23_ specifically enforced by any court
having jurisdiction, it being acknowledged and agreed by the Seller Parties
that any such breach or threatened breach will cause irreparable injury to
Purchaser and that an injunction may be issued against the applicable Seller
Party and any Affiliate of any Seller Party to stop or prevent any such
breach or threatened breach. The remedies set forth in the preceding sentence
shall be in addition to all other remedies available to Purchaser at law or in
equity. In the event that an action shall be instituted to specifically
enforce any obligations of any Seller Party or any Affiliate of any Seller
Party under this _Section 8.23_, the Seller Parties agree to waive, and shall
cause their Affiliates to waive, the defense that Purchaser has an adequate
remedy at law. Provided that the Closing occurs, from and after Closing until
the end of the Non-Compete Period, each Seller Party shall enforce, and cause
any of such Seller Partys existing or future Affiliates to enforce,
the terms of agreements with their respective employees, independent
contractors, consultants, representatives and agents to the extent such terms
restrict or prohibit the direct or indirect acquisition of any Restricted
Opportunity by any such Person. 

Section 8.24 _Expenses; Filings, Certain Governmental Approvals; Records and
Removal of Names_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, all expenses
incurred by the Seller Parties in connection with or related to
the authorization, preparation or execution of this Agreement, and the
Exhibits and Schedules hereto and thereto, and all other matters related to
the Closing, including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants and
financial advisers employed by the Seller Parties, shall be borne solely and
entirely by the Seller Parties, and all such expenses incurred by Purchaser
shall be borne solely and entirely by Purchaser.

 

(b) After the Closing, Purchaser shall record all assignments of Assets
executed at the Closing in the records of the applicable
Governmental Authority and shall be responsible for all costs and fees
associated therewith. As soon as practicable after recording, Purchaser shall
furnish Seller Representative with all recording data and evidence of all
required filings with appropriate counties. Purchaser shall also be
responsible for using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain Customary
Consents and all costs and fees associated therewith.

 

 __(c) As soon as practicable, but in no event later than thirty (30) days
after the Closing Date, Sellers shall deliver or cause to be delivered to
Purchaser the original Records that are in the possession of Sellers or any of
their Affiliates; _provided, however,_ that Sellers shall deliver or cause to
be delivered to Purchaser electronic records constituting customary Lease and
Royalty ownership and deck information with respect to the Assets on or before
the day on which the Closing occurs; __

 



76 (d) Upon the occurrence of Closing, as promptly as practicable, but in any
case within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall eliminate
the names "Reliance" and any variants thereof from the Assets acquired
pursuant to this Agreement and, except with respect to such grace period for
eliminating existing usage, shall have no right to use any logos, trademarks
or trade names belonging to Sellers or any of their Affiliates.

 

 __Section 8.25 _Transition Services_ __. At the Closing, Purchaser (on the
one hand) and Reliance Energy, Reliance Exploration or the Reliance
Subsidiaries or their Affiliates (on the other) shall enter into agreements,
on terms and conditions to be mutually agreed upon by such Parties, for (a)
the joint ownership and/or access of certain Equipment, Rights Of Ways and
other Assets and the Excluded Assets as between such Parties and (b) the
provision of certain transition services with respect to the Assets and
Excluded Assets, in each case on commercially reasonable terms that take into
account the nature and duration of the services and other benefits to be
provided to and by each Party under such agreements (any such agreements, the
" _Transition Agreements_ "). __

 

Section 8.26 _Right Of Way Exhibit_. Within five (5) Business Days prior to
the Closing, the Seller Parties shall deliver to Purchaser the exhibit to the
Conveyances which lists the Assets that constitute the Rights of Way.

TAX MATTERS

 

Section 11.1 _Asset Taxes_.

 

(a) Sellers shall be allocated and bear all Asset Taxes attributable to (i)
any Tax period ending prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the portion of any
Straddle Period ending immediately prior to the Effective Time, and Purchaser
shall be allocated and bear all Asset Taxes attributable to (x) any Tax period
beginning at or after the Effective Time and (y) the portion of any Straddle
Period beginning at the Effective Time.

(b) For purposes of determining the allocations described in  _Section
11.1(a)_, (i) Asset Taxes that are attributable to the severance or production
of Hydrocarbons (other than such Asset Taxes described in _clause (iii)_ ,
below) shall be allocated to the period in which the severance or production
giving rise to such Asset Taxes occurred, (ii) Asset Taxes that are based upon
or related to income or receipts or imposed on a transactional basis (other
than such Asset Taxes described in _clause (i)_ or _(iii)_ ), shall be
allocated to the period in which the transaction giving rise to such Asset
Taxes occurred, and (iii) Asset Taxes that are ad valorem, property or other
Asset Taxes imposed on a periodic basis pertaining to a Straddle Period shall
be allocated between the portion of such Straddle Period ending immediately
prior to the Effective Time and the portion of such Straddle Period beginning
at the Effective Time by prorating each such Asset Tax based on the number of
days in the applicable Straddle Period that occur before the date on which
the Effective Time occurs, on the one hand, and the number of days in such
Straddle Period that occur on or after the date on which the Effective Time
occurs, on the other hand.

 



82 __Section 11.2 _Transfer Taxes and Recording Fees_. Purchaser, on the one
hand, and Sellers, on the other, shall each bear and pay 50% of any sales,
use, transfer, stamp, documentary, registration, excise or similar Taxes

this Agreement (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") and Purchaser shall pay all required
filing and recording fees and expenses in connection with the filing and
recording of the assignments, conveyances or other instruments required to
convey title to the Assets to Purchaser. Sellers and Purchaser shall
reasonably cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the extent permissible
under applicable Law, the amount of any such Transfer Taxes. __

 

 __Section 11.3 _Withholding_. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any consideration otherwise payable or deliverable to Sellers
such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under any
applicable Laws; _provided, however,_ that Purchaser shall notify the
applicable Sellers of its intention to do so, and the Parties shall cooperate
in good faith to minimize, to the extent permissible under applicable Laws,
the amount of any such deduction or withholding, including by providing any
certificates or forms that are reasonably requested to establish an exemption
from (or reduction in) any such deduction or withholding. To the extent such
amounts are so deducted or withheld, and remitted to the applicable
Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes as
having been paid to the Party to whom such amounts would otherwise have been
paid absent such deduction or withholding. __

__Section 11.4  _Tax-Deferred Exchange_. Purchaser and Sellers agree that
any or all of Sellers and Purchaser may elect, by notifying the other Parties
in writing of its intention at least five (5) days prior to Closing, to treat
the acquisition or sale of the Assets as part of an exchange of like-kind
property under Section 1031 of the Code (an " __ _Exchange_ __"), _provided,
however,_ that the Closing shall not be delayed by reason of such election.
By making such an election, any of Sellers or Purchaser shall have the right
prior to Closing to assign all or a part of its rights under this Agreement to
a qualified intermediary (as that term is defined in Treasury Regulation §
1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(iii)) or an exchange accommodation titleholder (as that term
is defined in Internal Revenue Service Revenue Procedure 2000-37) to effect an
Exchange. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that neither an assignment of a
Partys rights under this Agreement nor any other actions taken by a Party or
any other person in connection with the Exchange shall release any Party from,
or modify, any of its liabilities or obligations (including indemnity
obligations) under this Agreement, and no Party makes any representations as
to any particular Tax treatment that may be afforded to any other Party by
reason of such assignment or any other actions taken in connection with such
an Exchange. Any Party electing to treat the acquisition or sale of the
Assets as part of an Exchange shall be obligated to pay all costs incurred by
the other Parties in connection with the Exchange and to indemnify and hold
the other Parties, their Affiliates, and their respective former, current and
future partners, members, shareholders, owners, officers, directors, managers,
employees, agents and representatives harmless from and against any and all
loss, cost or damage (including any Taxes) arising out of, based upon,
attributable to or resulting from such an Exchange or transactions or actions
taken in connection with the Exchange that would not have been incurred by the
other Party but for the electing Partys Exchange election. Provided
the electing Party satisfies its obligations hereunder, the other Parties
shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the electing Partys requests
in connection with such an Exchange. __

 



83 Section 11.5 _Cooperation_. The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to
the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns and any audit, litigation, or other proceeding with
respect to Taxes relating to the Assets. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other Partys request) the provision of records and
information that are relevant to any such Tax Return or audit, litigation or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
under this Agreement. Sellers and Purchaser agree to retain all books and
records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Assets relating to any
taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the
statute of limitations of the respective taxable periods and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Authority.

effect indefinitely) and (ii) there shall be no liability under this
Agreement on the part of Purchaser, Purchaser Parent or the Seller Parties or
any of their respective Affiliates, officers, shareholders, members, officers,

84 (b) In the event that (i) all conditions precedent to the obligations of the
Seller Parties set forth in _Section 9.1_ have been satisfied or waived by
the Seller Representative (except for those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing) and (ii) the Closing has not occurred as a
result of the material breach or failure of any Seller Partys
representations, warranties or covenants hereunder, including, if and when
required, such Seller Partys obligations to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereunder at Closing, then Purchaser shall be entitled to elect
in writing, as the sole and exclusive remedy of the Purchaser Group against
any member of the Sellers Group for the failure to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereunder at the Closing (A) in lieu of terminating this
Agreement, seek specific performance by the Seller Parties of this Agreement

receive the entirety of the Deposit for the sole account and use
of Purchaser, plus the Seller Parties shall pay to Purchaser an aggregate
amount equal to five percent (5%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price as
liquidated damages hereunder. The Seller Parties, Purchaser and Purchaser
Parent acknowledge and agree that (1) Purchasers actual damages upon the
event of such a termination are difficult to ascertain with any certainty, (2)
the foregoing amount of damages is a fair and reasonable estimate by the
Parties of such aggregate actual damages of Purchaser and (3) such liquidated
damages do not constitute a penalty.

(c) In the event that (i) all conditions precedent to the obligations of
Purchaser (and Purchaser Parent in the event the Stock Option is validly
exercised ) set forth in _Section 9.2_ have been satisfied or waived by
Purchaser (and Purchaser Parent in the event the Stock Option is validly

the event the Stock Option is validly exercised) representations, warranties
or covenants hereunder, including, if and when required, Purchasers (or
Purchaser Parents in the event the Stock Option is validly exercised)
obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated hereunder at Closing,
then the Seller Representative shall be entitled to elect in writing, as the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Sellers Group against any member of the
Purchaser Group for the failure to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereunder at Closing, (A) in lieu of terminating this Agreement, seek specific
performance by Purchaser and Purchaser Parent of this Agreement or (B) to
terminate this Agreement and retain the entirety of the Deposit for the sole
account and use of the Seller Parties as liquidated damages hereunder. The
Seller Parties, Purchaser and Purchaser Parent acknowledge and agree that (1)
the Seller Parties actual damages upon the event of such a termination are
difficult to ascertain with any certainty, (2) the Deposit is a fair and
reasonable estimate by the Parties of such aggregate actual damages of the
Seller Parties and (3) such liquidated damages do not constitute a penalty.

(d) In the event the Closing does not occur and this Agreement is terminated
under _Section 12.1_ for any reason other than as provided in _Section
12.2(c)_, Purchaser shall be entitled to receive a return of the Deposit, and
the Parties will have no further obligation or liability to one another
hereunder other than as set forth in this  _Section 12.2_.

 



85 (e) In the event that this Agreement is terminated under _Section 12.1_, the
Parties shall promptly (but in no event later than three (3) Business Days
after the Termination Date) execute joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse the entirety of the Deposit to
the Party entitled to receive the Deposit under this _Section 12.2_.

AGREE THAT, UNLESS AND UNTIL THE CLOSING OCCURS, THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY

OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT (WHETHER WILLFULLY, INTENTIONALLY,
UNINTENTIONALLY OR OTHERWISE), WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, SHALL

contained elsewhere in this Agreement, Sellers shall not have any liability
or be required to indemnify Purchaser (i) under _Section 13.3(b)_ as to any

in connection therewith, any dollar, materiality, material adverse effect,
Seller Material Adverse Effect or Purchaser Parent Material Adverse Effect
qualifiers in such representations or warranties shall be disregarded.

 

Section 13.5 _Exclusive Remedy and Certain Limitations_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, from
and after the Closing, Purchasers sole and exclusive remedy against the
Seller Parties with respect to the ownership and operation of the Assets, the
Retained Liabilities and any breach of the representations and warranties or
covenants of any Seller Party set forth herein and the 

 



89  affirmations of such representations and warranties contained in the
certificates delivered by or on behalf of the Seller Parties at Closing
pursuant to _Section 10.2(g)_ are the rights set forth in this _Article
13_, as limited by the terms hereof and (ii) each Seller Partys sole and

operation of the Assets, the Assumed Obligations and any breach of the
representations and warranties or covenants of Purchaser (or Purchaser Parent

affirmations of such representations and warranties contained in
the certificates delivered by or on behalf of Purchaser at Closing pursuant
to _Section 10.3(i)_ are the rights set forth in this _Article 13_, as

Partys Indemnified Persons under this _Article 13_ with respect to any item
for which a specific adjustment has already been made to the Unadjusted
Purchase Price or a payment has been made under the terms of this Agreement,
in each case to the extent of such adjustment or payment, it being agreed by
all Parties that it is intended that the provisions of this Agreement will not

of or resulting from the indemnified matter, whether attributable to personal
injury or death, property damage, contract claims, torts or
otherwise, including reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys, consultants,
accountants or other agents and experts reasonably incident to matters
indemnified against, and the costs of investigation or monitoring of such
matters, and the costs of enforcement of the indemnity. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither Purchaser nor the Seller Parties shall be entitled to
Damages in connection with this Agreement (including pursuant to any claim of
indemnification under this _Article 13_) for loss of profits, whether actual
or consequential, or other consequential damages suffered by any Party
(whether on its own behalf or on behalf of any member of the Sellers Group or
Purchaser Group, as applicable), or any punitive, special, indirect
or exemplary damages (other than loss of profits, consequential damages or
punitive, special, indirect or exemplary damages suffered by any Third Party
for which responsibility is allocated among the Parties under the terms of
this Agreement).

 

(c) Any claim for indemnity under this _Article 13_ by any current or former
member of the Purchaser Group or Sellers Group must be brought and
administered by Purchaser or the Seller Representative. No Indemnified Person
other than Seller Parties and Purchaser shall have any rights against either
the Seller Parties or Purchaser under the terms of this _Article 13_ except
as may be exercised on its behalf by Purchaser or the Seller Representative,

conducted before or after the Closing Date

 



90  by, any Person in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. In
order to preserve the benefit of the bargain otherwise represented by this
Agreement, each Party shall be entitled to rely upon the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of the other Party set forth herein
notwithstanding any investigation or audit conducted or any knowledge acquired
(or capable of being acquired) before or after the Closing Date or the
decision of any Party to complete the Closing. The right to indemnification or
other remedy based on any of the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements in this Agreement shall not be affected by any investigation or
audit conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of
being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy
or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation, warranty,
covenant, or agreement.

(e) The Parties shall treat, for U.S. federal and applicable state income
Tax purposes, any amounts paid or received under this _Article 13_ as an
adjustment to the Adjusted Purchase Price, except as otherwise required by
applicable Law.

 

(f) Except to the extent of claims and rights expressly included as part of
the Assets, nothing in this Agreement is intended to limit or otherwise waive

Purchaser may have against any Third Party for any Damages, obligations or
liabilities that may be incurred with respect to the Assumed Obligations,
Retained Liabilities or the ownership or operation of the Assets.

(g) To the extent of the indemnification obligations in this Agreement,
Purchaser and Sellers hereby waive for themselves and their respective
successors and assigns, including any insurers, any rights to subrogation for
Damages for which such Party is liable or against which such Party indemnifies
any other Person under this Agreement. If required by applicable insurance
policies, each Party shall obtain a waiver of such subrogation from its
insurers.

anything herein to the contrary, (i) no Seller Party will have any
indemnification obligation or otherwise be liable with respect to any breach
or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty in _Section 4.1_, _Section
4.2_, _Section 4.3_ or _Section 4.4 _made by any other Seller that is an
Additional NPI Seller, or any breach of any covenant or other agreement
hereunder made by any such other Seller that is an Additional NPI Seller and
(ii) no Additional NPI Seller shall have any indemnification obligation or
otherwise be liable with respect to any breach or inaccuracy of a
representation or warranty in  _Section 4.1_, _Section 4.2_, _Section 4.3_

Section 13.6 _Indemnification Actions_. All claims for indemnification under
_Article 13_ shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

__(a) For purposes of this _Article 13_, the term _"Indemnifying Party"_
 when used in connection with particular Damages means the Person(s) having
an obligation to indemnify another Person(s) with respect to such Damages
pursuant to this _Article 13_, and the term " _Indemnified Person_ " when
used in connection with particular Damages means a Person(s) having the right
to be indemnified with respect to such Damages pursuant to this _Article 13_.
__

 



91 (b) Upon receiving notice of an audit, proceeding or claim by a Third Party (a
_"Third Party Claim"_ ) that could give rise to a claim for indemnification
or reimbursement against an Indemnifying Party under this _Article 13_, an
Indemnified Person shall notify the Indemnifying Party (or if a member of
the Purchaser Group is the Indemnified Party, Purchaser shall notify the
Seller Representative) regarding the specific details thereof (including
supporting documentation of the alleged Damages and such Indemnified Persons
good faith estimate of the applicable claim) of and the specific basis under
this Agreement for its claim (the _"Claim Notice"_ ).

(c) The Indemnified Person shall provide its Claim Notice with respect to a
Third Party Claim promptly after the Indemnified Person has actual knowledge
of the Third Party Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if any)
served with respect to the Third Party Claim; _provided_ that the failure of
any Indemnified Person to give notice of any Third Party Claim as provided in
this _Section 13.6_ shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations under this  _Article 13_ except to the extent such failure
results in insufficient time being available to permit the Indemnifying Party
to effectively defend against the Third Party Claim or otherwise prejudices
the Indemnifying Partys ability to defend against the Third Party Claim. In
the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon an alleged
inaccuracy or breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, the
Claim Notice shall specify the representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement that was allegedly inaccurate or breached.

(d) In the case of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall
have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to notify the
Indemnified Person whether it desires to defend the Indemnified Person against
such Third Party Claim under this _Article 13_. The Indemnified Person is
authorized, prior to receiving notice from the Indemnifying Party of its
intention to defend during such thirty (30) day period, to file any motion,
answer or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to
protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party and that is not
prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party fails to
notify the Indemnified Person within such thirty (30) day period regarding
whether the Indemnifying Party desires to defend the Indemnified Person, then
until such date as the Indemnifying Party admits or it is finally determined
by an non-appealable judgment that such obligation exists, the Indemnified
Person may file any motion, answer or other pleading, settle any Third Party
Claim or take any other action that the Indemnified Person deems necessary or
appropriate to protect its interest, regardless of whether the Indemnifying
Party is prejudiced or adversely impacted by any such actions.

 

(e) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Person that it desires
to defend the Indemnified Person against such a Third Party Claim within the
time period and as otherwise set forth above, then such Indemnifying Party
shall have the right and obligation to diligently prosecute and control the
defense, at its sole cost and expense, subject to the conditions on compromise
or settlement set forth below. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Person agrees at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party to
cooperate in contesting any Third Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party
elects to contest;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Person
shall not be required to bring any counterclaim or cross-complaint against any
Person. The Indemnified Person may participate in, but not control, any
defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by the Indemnifying
Party pursuant to this _Section 13.6(e)_, _provided_ that the Indemnified
Person may file initial pleadings as described

 



92  in the second to the last sentence of _clause (d)_ above if required by
court or procedural rules to do so within the thirty (30) day period in
_paragraph (d)_ above. An Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written
consent of the Indemnified Person, settle or compromise any Third Party Claim
or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto that (A) does not
result in a final resolution of the Indemnified Persons liability with
respect to the Third Party Claim (including, in the case of a settlement, an
unconditional written release of the Indemnified Person from all further
liability in respect of such Third Party Claim) or (B) may materially and
adversely affect the Indemnified Person (other than as a result of money
damages covered by the indemnity).

 

(f) Except to the extent an Indemnifying Party is entitled to control the
defense of a Third Party Claim as set forth above, the Indemnified Person
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to defend and control the
defense against the Third Party Claim (at the sole cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party, if the Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification
hereunder), with counsel of the Indemnified Persons choosing, subject to the
right of the Indemnifying Party to admit its obligation to indemnify the
Indemnified Person and assume the defense of the Third Party Claim at any time
prior to settlement or final determination thereof. If the Indemnifying Party
is not controlling the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Person
shall send written notice to the Indemnifying Party of any proposed settlement
of such Third Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party shall have the option
for ten (10) days following receipt of such notice to (i) admit in writing its
obligation for indemnification with respect to such Third Party Claim and (ii)
if its obligation is so admitted, assume the defense of the Third Party
Claim, including the power to reject the proposed settlement. If the
Indemnified Person settles any Third Party Claim over the objection of the
Indemnifying Party after the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of
the Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Person shall be deemed to have waived
any right to indemnity with respect to the Third Party Claim.

 

(g) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon an Third Party
Claim, (a _"Direct Claim"_ ) shall be asserted by giving the Indemnifying
Party reasonably prompt Claim Notice thereof, but in any event not later than
thirty (30) days after the Indemnified Person becomes aware of the events that
gave rise to such Direct Claim. Such Claim Notice by the Indemnified Person
shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of
all available material written evidence thereof and shall indicate the
estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of Damages that have been or may
be sustained by the Indemnified Person. The Indemnifying Party shall have
sixty (60) days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to (i) cure the Damages
complained of, (ii) admit its obligation to provide indemnification
with respect to such Damages or (iii) dispute the claim for such Damages. If
the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Person within such
sixty (60) day period that it has cured the Damages or that it disputes the
claim for such Damages, the Indemnifying Party shall be conclusively deemed
obligated to provide indemnification hereunder with respect to such Direct
Claim.

 

(h) From and after Closing, each Party agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with the other Parties in connection with each Partys
defense and other actions relating to or arising out of any matters for with
such Party is required to indemnify any Person hereunder.

 



93 Section 13.7 _Escrow Amount_.

 

(a) If the Closing occurs, the Escrow Amount shall be held by the Escrow Agent
in escrow in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Upon the
final determination of the amount of any Damages payable to Purchaser pursuant
to this _Article 13_, the Seller Representative and Purchaser shall promptly
(and in any event within three (3) Business Days after such
final determination), deliver to the Escrow Agent written instructions
instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse to Purchaser from the Escrow Amount
an amount equal to all or a stipulated amount of such alleged Damages to which
it has been finally determined that Purchaser is entitled.

(b) Promptly after the Escrow Deadline (but in no event more than three (3)
Business Days thereafter), each of Purchaser and the Seller Representative
shall execute and deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse to the Seller Representative, on
behalf of Sellers, from the Escrow Amount an amount equal to the remainder,
if any, of (i) the Escrow Amount and all interest accrued thereon, _minus_
(ii) all amounts to which Purchaser is entitled as set forth in any joint
written instructions delivered by Purchaser and the Seller Representative
pursuant to _Section 13.7(a)_ that have not yet been released by the Escrow
Agent to Purchaser, _minus_ (iii) all undisbursed or unpaid alleged Damages
for which Purchaser has made a timely claim for indemnification pursuant to
this _Article 13_ and which claim has not been finally determined. In the
event any portion of the Escrow Amount is not released to the Seller
Representative as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence as a result
of Damages for which Purchaser has made a timely claim for indemnification
pursuant to this _Article 13_ and which claim has not been finally
determined, Purchaser and Seller Representative shall, within three (3)
Business Days following the final determination of any such outstanding
claims, instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse (A) any amounts to which
Purchaser is entitled based upon the final determination of such claim to
Purchaser and (B) after giving effect to _clause (A)_ , the then-remaining
balance of the Escrow Account to the Seller Representative, to be disbursed to
Sellers.

 

(c) In the event the Stock Option is validly exercised and the Closing occurs,
for the purpose of determining the amounts and type (Escrow Cash or Escrow
Stock) to be disbursed from the Escrow Amount to any applicable Party (either
as reimbursement and indemnity for Damages or otherwise), such disbursements
shall be made pro rata on the basis of the ratio of the unadjusted Cash
Purchase Price to the aggregate Share Price of the unadjusted Stock Purchase
Price, it being understood for the purpose of providing any member of the
Purchaser Group indemnity or reimbursement for any Damages owed to such Person
by Sellers hereunder, each share of Purchaser Parent Common Stock shall be
valued at the Share Price.

(d) At any time the Parties may execute join written instructions instructing
the Escrow Agent to disburse all or any portion of the Escrow Amount pursuant
to such Persons and in such amounts as mutually agreed upon by the Parties.

 

(e) The Parties agree and acknowledge that, the Escrow Amount shall not be
deemed a limitation on any rights, remedies or obligations of the Parties
hereunder, including the rights and obligations under _Section 13.3_. To the
extent that Sellers are obligated hereunder to indemnify or owe hereunder any
member of the Purchaser Group aggregate Damages in excess of the
Escrow Amount, then, subject to the other terms and limitations set forth
herein, Sellers shall be liable for, and Purchaser may pursue, payment for any
such Damages.

and the documents delivered pursuant hereto and the legal relations between
the Parties shall be governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with
the Laws of the State of Texas, without regard to principles of conflicts of
Laws that would direct the application of the Laws of another jurisdiction.

 

Section 14.3 _Forum Selection; Waiver of Jury Trial_. Subject to _Section
14.12_:

 

(a) Except as to any dispute, controversy, matters or claim arising out of or
in relation to or in connection with the adjustments to the Unadjusted
Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.4_ or _Section 2.5_ (which shall be
resolved exclusively in accordance with _Section 2.5(b)_), or the scope,

regarding title to any Assets (which all shall be resolved exclusively in
accordance with _Section 3.2(g)_), any dispute, controversy, matter or claim
between Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Seller Parties, on the other,
with respect to any Transaction Document (each, subject to such exceptions, a
" _Dispute_ "), that cannot be resolved among the Parties, will

 



96  be instituted exclusively in the courts of the State of Texas in and for
Midland County or the United States District Court or the Texas State District
Court located in Midland, Texas and each Party hereby irrevocably consents to
the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in connection with any Dispute,
litigation or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated thereby. All Disputes among any the Parties to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall have exclusive
jurisdiction and venue only in the courts of the State of Texas in and for
Midland County or the United States District Court or the Texas State District
Court located in Midland, Texas. Each Party waives any objection which it may
have pertaining to improper venue or forum non-conveniens to the conduct of

(b) To the extent that any Party or any of its Affiliates has or hereafter may
acquire immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process
(whether through service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment
in aid of execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its
property, such Party (on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates)
hereby irrevocably (i) waives such immunity in respect of its obligations
with respect to this Agreement and (ii) submits to the personal jurisdiction
of any court described in _Section 14.3(a)_. Further, each Party waives any
objection which it may have pertaining to improper venue or forum non

proceeding or litigation may be served upon it outside of State of Texas in
and for Midland County or the United States District Court or the Texas State
District Court located in Midland, Texas with the same force and effect as if
such service had been made within the State of Texas in and for Midland
County or the United States District Court or the Texas State District Court
located in Midland, Texas.

(c) The Parties agree that a dispute under this Agreement may raise issues
that are common with one or more of the other Transaction Documents or other
documents executed by the Parties in connection herewith or which are
substantially the same or interdependent and interrelated or connected with
issues raised in a related dispute, controversy, or claim between or among the
Parties and their Affiliates. Accordingly, any Party to a new Dispute under
this Agreement may elect in writing within fifteen (15) days after the
initiation of a new Dispute to refer such new Dispute for resolution by the
applicable court together with any existing Dispute arising under this
Agreement, other Transaction Documents or other documents executed by the
Parties in connection herewith or which are substantially the same or
interdependent and interrelated or connected. If the applicable court does not
determine to consolidate such new Dispute with the existing Dispute within
thirty (30) days of receipt of written request, then the new Dispute shall
not be consolidated, and the resolution of the new Dispute shall proceed
separately.

 

(d) EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY VOLUNTARILY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY LITIGATION, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN CONNECTION WITH

97 Section 14.4 _Headings and Construction_. The headings and captions herein
are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to
govern, limit or aid in the construction of any term or provision hereof. The
rights and obligations of each Party shall be determined pursuant to this
Agreement. The Seller Parties, Purchaser and Purchaser Parent have each had
the opportunity to exercise business discretion in relation to the negotiation
of the details and terms of the transactions contemplated hereby. This
Agreement is the result of arms length negotiations from equal bargaining
positions. It is the intention of the Parties that every covenant, term and
provision of this Agreement shall be construed simply according to its fair
meaning and not strictly for or against any Party (notwithstanding any rule
of law requiring an agreement to be strictly construed against the drafting
Party) and no consideration shall be given or presumption made, on the basis
of who drafted this Agreement or any particular provision thereof, it being
understood that the Parties to this Agreement are sophisticated and have had
adequate opportunity and means to exercise business discretion in relation to
the negotiation of the details of the transactions contemplated hereby and
retain counsel to represent their interests and to otherwise negotiate the
provisions of this Agreement.

Section 14.5  _Waivers_. Any failure by any Party to comply with any of its
obligations, agreements or conditions herein contained may be waived by the
Party to whom such compliance is owed by the application of the express terms
hereof of by an instrument signed by the Party to whom compliance is owed and
expressly identified as a waiver, but not in any other manner. No course of
dealing on the party of any Party or their respective officers, employees,
agents, or representatives and no failure by any Party to exercise any of its
rights under this Agreement shall, in each case, operate as a waiver thereof
or affect in any way the right of such Party at a later time to enforce the
performance of such provision. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
no waiver of, or consent to a change in or modification of, any of the
provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of,
or consent to a change in or modification, other provisions hereof (whether
or not similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless
otherwise expressly provided herein. The rights of each Party under this
Agreement shall be cumulative and the exercise or partial exercise of any such
right shall not preclude the exercise by such Party of any other right.

Section 14.6 _Severability_. It is the intent of the Parties that the
provisions contained in this Agreement shall be severable should any terms or
provisions, in whole or in part, be held invalid, illegal or incapable of
being enforced as a matter of law, such holding shall not affect the other
portions of this Agreement, and such portions that are not invalid shall be
given effect without the invalid portion. Upon such determination that any
term or provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

Section 14.7 _Assignment_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section 11.4_, no
Party shall assign or otherwise transfer all or any part of this Agreement,
nor shall any Party delegate any of its rights or duties hereunder, without
the prior written consent of (i) in the case of any transfer by Purchaser or
Purchaser Parent, the Seller Representative, and (ii) in the case of any
transfer by a Seller Party, Purchaser, and any transfer or delegation made
without such consent shall be null and void; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a)
in the event of a Person succeeding to all or substantially all of the assets
of a Party (whether by merger, consolidation, sale of assets or otherwise),
assignment, transfer or delegation by a Party to such Person (or its
Affiliates) of such Partys rights or duties under this Agreement shall not
require the prior written consent of the other Party and (b) this Agreement
may be amended without the consent of any Parties to the extent a NPI

 



98  Holder ratifies and joins this Agreement in accordance with the terms of
_Section 8.7_. Unless expressly agreed to in writing by the Parties, no
permitted assignment of any Partys rights or duties that is subject to the
consent of the other Party shall relieve or release the assigning Party from
the performance of such Partys rights or obligations hereunder and such
assigning Party shall be fully jointly and severally liable with such
assignee to the other Party for the performance of all such rights and duties.
Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective permitted
successors and assigns.

Section 14.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents constitute the entire agreement among the Parties pertaining to the
subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior agreements, understandings,
negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, of the Parties
pertaining to the subject matter hereof. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT BETWEEN
THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF ANY
SCHEDULE OR EXHIBIT HERETO, THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL
GOVERN AND CONTROL; _PROVIDED, HOWEVER,_ THAT THE INCLUSION IN ANY OF THE
SCHEDULES AND EXHIBITS HERETO OF TERMS AND PROVISIONS NOT ADDRESSED IN THIS
AGREEMENT SHALL NOT BE DEEMED A CONFLICT, AND ALL SUCH ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS
SHALL BE GIVEN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT, SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THIS 
_SECTION 14.8_.

Section 14.9 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by an
agreement in writing signed by Purchaser, Purchaser Parent and the Seller
Representative and expressly identified as an amendment or modification;
_provided_ , _however_ , (a) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the provisions relating to the Financing Sources set forth in
_Section 12.2(f)_ and _Section 14.12_ (and the defined terms used therein)
may not be amended, modified or altered in a manner adverse to the interests
of the Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the Financing
Sources affected thereby (it being understood that the consent of any Person
described in _clause (b)_ of the definition of " _Financing Source_ " shall
not be required) and (b) this Agreement may be amended without the consent of
any Parties pursuant to and in accordance with the execution and delivery to
Purchaser, Purchaser Parent and the Seller Representative of a ratification
and joinder agreement to the extent a NPI Holder ratifies and joins this
Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Section 8.7_ and _Section
14.14(c)_.

 

 __Section 14.10 _No Third-Person Beneficiaries_ __. Nothing in this
Agreement shall entitle any Person other than Purchaser, Purchaser Parent and
the Seller Parties to any claim, cause of action, remedy or right of any kind,
except the rights expressly provided to the Persons described in _Section
8.1(b)_ and _Article 13_, in each case, only to the extent such rights are
exercised or pursued, if at all, by the Seller Representative or Purchaser
acting on behalf of such Person (which rights may be exercised in the sole
discretion of the applicable Party hereunder); _provided, however_ ,
notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) the Parties reserve the right to amend,
modify, terminate, supplement, or waive any provision of this Agreement or
this entire Agreement without the consent or approval of any other Person that
is not a Party hereto (including any Indemnified Person) and (b) no Party
hereunder shall have any direct liability to any permitted Third Party
beneficiary, nor shall any permitted Third Party beneficiary have any __

 



99  right to exercise any rights hereunder for such Third Party beneficiarys
benefit except to the extent such rights are brought, exercised and
administered by a Party hereto in accordance with _Section 13.5(c)_ and (c)
the Financing Sources shall be deemed third party beneficiaries of the
provisions set forth in _Section 12.2(f)_ and _Section 14.12_, each of which
shall be enforceable by each Financing Source and none of which shall be
amended or otherwise modified in any way that adversely affects the rights of
any Financing Source without the prior written consent of the Financing
Sources.

 

Section 14.11 _Limitation on Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, NO PERSON SHALL BE ENTITLED TO (A) LOST PROFITS,
INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL DAMAGES OR (B) PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND
EACH OF PURCHASER AND EACH SELLER, FOR ITSELF AND ON BEHALF OF THEIR
RESPECTIVE MEMBERS OF THE PURCHASER GROUP AND SELLERS GROUP, RESPECTIVELY,
HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO LOST PROFITS, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, other than (i) in the case of _Section
14.11(a)_ to the extent such lost profits or damages are suffered by any Third
Party for which responsibility is allocated among the Parties under the
terms hereof.

Section 14.12 _No Financing Source Liability_.

 

(a) None of the Financing Sources will have any liability to any member of the
Sellers Group relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Financing or
otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder, whether
at law or in equity, in contract, in tort, or otherwise, and none of the
Sellers Group will have any rights or claims against any of the Financing
Sources hereunder or thereunder in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereunder. Each Party hereby agrees that it will not bring or
support any action, claim, cause of action or similar claims or assertions of
any kind or description arising out of or relating to this Agreement, whether
at law or in equity, whether in contract or tort or otherwise, against the
Financing Sources with respect to any dispute arising out of or relating in
any way to the Financing contemplated hereby or the performance thereof.

(b) Each Party agrees that (i) it will not, and will not permit its controlled
Affiliates to, bring or support any action, claim, cause of action or similar
claims or assertions of any kind or description, whether at law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in
any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including with respect to any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Financing or the performance thereof, in any forum
other the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
or any court of the State of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in
the City of New York (or any appellate court having jurisdiction over any such
court) and (ii) any such action, claim, cause of action or similar claims
or assertions of any kind or description, whether at law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources
will be instituted exclusively in the courts of the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York or any court of the State of New
York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York (or any
appellate court

 



100  having jurisdiction over any such court) and each Party hereby irrevocably
consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in connection with any such
action, claim, cause of action or similar claims or assertions and waives any
objection which it may have pertaining to improper venue or forum non-
conveniens to the conduct of any such litigation or proceeding in the
foregoing courts. Each Party agrees that any and all process directed to it
in any such proceeding or litigation may be served upon it outside of the
State of New York with the same force and effect as if such service had been
made within the State of New York.

 

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY VOLUNTARILY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY LITIGATION, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN CONNECTION WITH
ANY ACTION, CLAIM, PROCEEDING, CAUSE OF ACTION OR SIMILAR CLAIMS OR ASSERTIONS
OF ANY KIND OR DESCRIPTION REFERRED TO IN THIS _SECTION 14.12_.

 

Section 14.13 _Calculation of Time_. Time is of the essence in this Agreement.
If the date specified in this Agreement for giving any notice or taking any
action is not a Business Day (or if the period during which any notice is
required to be given or any action taken expires on a date that is not a
Business Day), then the date for giving such notice or taking such action
(and the expiration date of such period during which notice is required to be
given or action taken) shall be the next day that is a Business Day.

 

Section 14.14 _Certain Seller Matters_.

irrevocably constitutes and appoints Reliance Energy (the " _Seller
Representative_ ") as such Seller Partys true and lawful agent and attorney-
in-fact with full power of substitution to do any and all things and execute
any and all documents which may be necessary, convenient or appropriate to
facilitate the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and the
exercise of all rights and the performance of all obligations hereunder,
including: (i) receiving payments under or pursuant to this Agreement and
disbursements thereof to the Seller Parties, as contemplated by this
Agreement, and setting aside portions of such payments reasonably determined
by the Seller Representative to be necessary or appropriate as a reserve to
make payments required under this Agreement or to fund out-of-pocket expenses
(including the fees and expenses of counsel) incurred in connection with the
performance of the Seller Representatives duties under this Agreement; (ii)
receiving and forwarding of Notices and communications pursuant to this
Agreement and accepting service of process; (iii) giving or agreeing to, on
behalf of all the Seller Parties or any Seller Party, any and all consents,
waivers and amendments deemed by the Seller Representative, in its reasonable
and good faith discretion, to be necessary or appropriate under this Agreement
and the execution or delivery of any documents that may be necessary or
appropriate in connection therewith; (iv) with respect to any indemnification
claims, purchase price adjustment provisions, title and environmental defect
processes and all other matters arising under this Agreement, (A) disputing
or refraining from disputing, on behalf of any Seller Party relative to any
amounts to be received by any Seller

 



101 _ _ Party under this Agreement or any agreements contemplated hereby, or any
claim made by Purchaser under this Agreement, (B) negotiating and
compromising, on behalf of each Seller Party, any dispute, controversy or
dispute that may arise under, and exercise or refrain from exercising any
rights or remedies available under, this Agreement, and (C) executing, on
behalf of each Seller Party, any settlement agreement, release or other
document with respect to such dispute or remedy, except in each case with
respect to a dispute between any Seller Party on the one hand and the Seller
Representative on the other hand; and (v) performing those actions or
exercising those powers otherwise specifically provided to the Seller
Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; _provided, however,_
that, in each case, the Seller Representative shall not take any action
adverse to any Seller Party unless such action is also taken proportionately
with respect to all the Seller Parties. Notices and communications to or from
the Seller Representative shall constitute Notice to or from each of the
Seller Parties. Any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Seller
Representative (acting in its capacity as the Seller Representative) shall
constitute a decision of all Seller Parties and shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon each Seller Party, and Purchaser and Purchaser Parent may rely
upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction. Each Seller Party hereby
agrees that: (i) in all matters in which action by the Seller Representative
is required or permitted, the Seller Representative is authorized to act on
behalf of such Seller Party, notwithstanding any dispute or disagreement
among the Seller Parties, and each member of the Purchaser Group shall be
entitled to rely on any and all action taken by the Seller Representative
under this Agreement without any liability to, or obligation to inquire of,
any Seller Party, notwithstanding any knowledge on the part of any member of
the Purchaser Group of any such dispute or disagreement; and (ii) the
appointment of the Seller Representative is coupled with an interest and
shall be irrevocable by each Seller Party in any manner or for any reason. __

(c) _Additional Sellers_. The Seller Representative shall have the right,
from time to time, upon Notice to Purchaser to cause any Person that is a
Seller NPI Holder to ratify and become party to this Agreement as a Seller
effective as of the Execution Date by causing such Seller NPI Holder (and if
such Seller NPI Holder is a natural Person, such Persons spouse) to execute
and deliver to Purchaser a ratification and joinder agreement substantially in
the form attached hereto as _Exhibit F_ , subject to such modification as may
be mutually agreed upon in writing by Purchaser, Purchaser Parent and the
Seller Representative, in which event _Appendix A_ shall be deemed to be
automatically amended to include such Person as a "Seller" for all purposes
hereunder, without any other action by any Person (with each such Person being
referred to as an _"Additional NPI Seller"_ ). For the avoidance of doubt, any
such additional Seller that actually joins in the execution of this Agreement
after the Execution Date (notwithstanding that such Seller is deemed to become
a Seller effective as of the Execution Date) shall not be deemed an Initial
NPI Seller.

 

(d) _Seller NPI Related Liabilities_. Each Seller hereby waives, releases and
discharges, agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, each member of the
Purchaser Group from and against any and all Damages, obligations, claim and
liabilities related to or arising out of the relationships, disputes, claims,
causes of action or other among, or any proposed, contemplated or consummated
transactions related to or arising out of, (i) the apportionment of the
Unadjusted Purchase Price or Adjusted Purchase Price amongst the Sellers, the
Seller NPI Holders, the Assets or any of the Seller NPIs or (ii)
the performance, attempted performance or non-performance of any Sellers
obligations under (A) _Section 8.7_ or (B) the Tag-Alongs or the Drag-Alongs
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder (collectively,
the " _Seller NPI Related Liabilities_ ").

 



102 Section 14.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in
multiple counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Facsimile, .pdf
or other electronic transmission of copies of signatures shall constitute
original signatures for all purposes of this Agreement and any enforcement
hereof.

Section 14.16 _Purchaser Parent Guaranty_.

 

(a) Subject to the conditions and limitations as set forth below, Purchaser
Parent hereby absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, as
principal and not as surety, to the Seller Parties their successors and
assigns, the due and punctual payment and the full, complete and punctual
performance of all monetary obligations of Purchaser (and any successor or
permitted assignee thereof) to the Seller Parties and the Sellers Group
pursuant to this Agreement (the guaranty obligations under this _Section
14.16_, collectively, the " _Purchaser Guarantied Obligations_ ").

 

(b) Purchaser Parent guarantees that the Purchaser Guarantied Obligations will
be duly and punctually paid and fully and completely performed, as if
Purchaser Parent were the primary obligor in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. If for any reason Purchaser shall fail or be unable duly and
punctually to pay or fully and completely to perform any Purchaser Guarantied
Obligation as and when the same shall become due or otherwise required, then
Purchaser Parent shall, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
forthwith duly and punctually pay or fully and completely perform such
Purchaser Guarantied Obligation (in the case of performance, as if Purchaser
Parent was the primary obligor). Purchaser Parent further agrees that this
Agreement, to the extent it requires the payment of money, constitutes a
guaranty of payment when due and not of collection and is in no way
conditioned or contingent upon any attempt to collect from Purchaser.
Purchaser Parents liability under this Agreement shall be absolute,
unconditional, irrevocable and continuing irrespective, without limitation,
of:

 

(i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement as a result of
(A) the application of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium, and other Laws of general application, heretofore or hereafter
enacted or in effect, affecting the rights and remedies of creditors
generally, or (B) the exercise of judicial or administrative discretion
in accordance with general equitable principles, particularly as to the
availability of the remedy of specific performance or other injunctive relief,
in each case, regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a
proceeding at law or in equity; 

(ii) any modification, amendment, consent, extension, forbearance or waiver of
or any consent to departure from this Agreement that may be agreed to by
Purchaser; or

(iii) any action or inaction by the Seller Parties under or in respect of this
Agreement, any failure, lack of diligence, omission or delay on the part of
any Seller Party to enforce, assert or exercise any right, power or remedy
conferred on any Seller Party in this Agreement.

 



103 (c) Purchaser Parent hereby unconditionally waives (i) any and all notices,
including promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance of this Agreement and
any other notice with respect to any of the Purchaser Guarantied Obligations
and this Agreement, (ii) any presentment, demand, performance, protest, notice
of nonpayment as the same pertains to Purchaser, suit or the taking of other
action by the Seller Parties against, and any other notice to, Purchaser,
Purchaser Parent or others with respect to any of the Purchaser Guarantied
Obligations, (iii) any right to require the Seller Parties to proceed against
Purchaser or to exhaust any security held by the Seller Parties or to pursue
any other remedy with respect to any of the Purchaser Guarantied Obligations,
(iv) any defense based upon an election of remedies by the Seller Parties,
unless the same would excuse performance by Purchaser under this Agreement
with respect to any of the Purchaser Guarantied Obligations and (v) any duty
of the Seller Parties to advise Purchaser Parent of any information known to
the Seller Parties regarding Purchaser or its ability to perform under this
Agreement with respect to any of the Purchaser Guarantied Obligations. The
Seller Representatives may at any time and from time to time without notice
to or consent of the Purchaser Parent and without impairing or releasing the
obligations of Purchaser Parent hereunder, with respect to any of the
Purchaser Guarantied Obligations, (A) agree with Purchaser to make any change
in the terms of the Purchaser Guarantied Obligations, (B) take or fail to
take any action of any kind in respect of any security for the Purchaser
Guarantied Obligations, (C) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights
against Purchaser or others, or (D) compromise or subordinate the Purchaser
Guarantied Obligations, including any security therefor. Any other suretyship
defenses are hereby waived by Purchaser Parent with respect to any of the
Purchaser Guarantied Obligations.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 14.16_ shall continue to be effective or
be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time and to the extent that any
payment of any of the Purchaser Guarantied Obligations is rescinded or must
otherwise be returned by the payee thereof upon the insolvency, bankruptcy,
reorganization or similar event of Purchaser or Purchaser Parent, all as
though such payment had not been made.

Section 14.17 _Reliance Guaranty_.

 

(a) Subject to the conditions and limitations as set forth below, Reliance
Exploration and Reliance Energy hereby absolutely, irrevocably
and unconditionally guarantee, as principals and not as sureties, to
Purchaser, Purchaser Parent and the Purchaser Group and their respective
successors and assigns, the due and punctual payment and the full, complete
and punctual performance of all monetary obligations of the Reliance Selling
Subsidiaries and the Initial NPI Sellers (and any permitted assignee thereof)
to Purchaser, Purchaser Parent and the Purchaser Group pursuant to this
Agreement (the guaranty obligations under this  _Section 14.17_,
collectively, the " _Reliance Guarantied Obligations_ ").

(b) Reliance Exploration and Reliance Energy guarantee that the Reliance
Guarantied Obligations will be duly and punctually paid and fully and
completely performed, as if Reliance Exploration and Reliance Energy were the
primary obligors in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If for any
reason the Reliance Selling Subsidiaries or any of the Initial NPI Sellers
shall fail or be unable duly and punctually to pay or fully and completely to
perform any Reliance Guarantied Obligation as and when the same shall become
due or otherwise required, then Reliance Exploration and Reliance Energy
shall, subject to the terms and

 



104  conditions of this Agreement, forthwith duly and punctually pay or fully and
completely perform such Reliance Guarantied Obligation (in the case of
performance, as if Reliance Exploration and Reliance Energy were each joint
and several primary obligors). Reliance Exploration and Reliance Energy
further agree that this Agreement, to the extent it requires the payment of
money, constitutes a guaranty of payment when due and not of collection and
is in no way conditioned or contingent upon any attempt to collect from the
Reliance Selling Subsidiaries or any of the Initial NPI Sellers. Reliance
Exploration and Reliance Energys liability under this Agreement shall
be absolute, unconditional, irrevocable and continuing irrespective, without
limitation, of:

(i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement as a result of
(A) the application of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium, and other Laws of general application, heretofore or hereafter
enacted or in effect, affecting the rights and remedies of creditors
generally, or (B) the exercise of judicial or administrative discretion in
accordance with general equitable principles, particularly as to the
availability of the remedy of specific performance or other injunctive relief,
in each case, regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a
proceeding at law or in equity;

(ii) any modification, amendment, consent, extension, forbearance or waiver
of or any consent to departure from this Agreement that may be agreed to by
the Reliance Selling Subsidiaries or any of the Initial NPI Sellers; or

 

(iii) any action or inaction by the Reliance Selling Subsidiaries or any of
the Initial NPI Sellers under or in respect of this Agreement, any failure,
lack of diligence, omission or delay on the part of Purchaser, Purchaser
Parent or any member of the Purchaser Group to enforce, assert or exercise any
right, power or remedy conferred on such Persons in this Agreement.

 

(c) Reliance Exploration and Reliance Energy hereby unconditionally waive (i)
any and all notices, including promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance of
this Agreement and any other notice with respect to any of the Reliance
Guarantied Obligations and this Agreement, (ii) any presentment, demand,
performance, protest, notice of nonpayment as the same pertains to the
Reliance Selling Subsidiaries and the Initial NPI Sellers, suit or the taking
of other action by Purchaser against, and any other notice to, the Reliance
Selling Subsidiaries, the Initial NPI Sellers, Reliance Exploration, Reliance
Energy or others with respect to any of the Reliance Guarantied Obligations,
(iii) any right to require Purchaser to proceed against the Reliance Selling
Subsidiaries or any of the Initial NPI Sellers or to exhaust any security held
by Purchaser or to pursue any other remedy with respect to any of the
Reliance Guarantied Obligations, (iv) any defense based upon an election of
remedies by Purchaser, unless the same would excuse performance by the
Reliance Selling Subsidiaries or any of the Initial NPI Sellers under this
Agreement with respect to any of the Reliance Guarantied Obligations and (v)
any duty of Purchaser to advise Reliance Exploration and Reliance Energy of
any information known to Purchaser regarding the Reliance
Selling Subsidiaries and the Initial NPI Sellers or their ability to perform
under this Agreement with respect to any of the Reliance Guarantied
Obligations. Purchaser may at any time and from time to time without notice to
or consent of the Reliance Exploration or Reliance Energy and without
impairing or releasing the obligations of Reliance Exploration or Reliance
Energy hereunder, with respect to any of the Reliance

 



105  Guarantied Obligations, (A) agree with the Reliance Selling Subsidiaries and
the Initial NPI Sellers to make any change in the terms of the Reliance
Guarantied Obligations, (B) take or fail to take any action of any kind in
respect of any security for the Reliance Guarantied Obligations, (C) exercise
or refrain from exercising any rights against the Reliance Selling
Subsidiaries or any of the Initial NPI Sellers or others, or (D) compromise
or subordinate the Reliance Guarantied Obligations, including any security
therefor. Any other suretyship defenses are hereby waived by Reliance
Exploration and Reliance Energy with respect to any of the Reliance
Guarantied Obligations.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 14.17_ shall continue to be effective or
be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time and to the extent that any
payment of any of the Reliance Guarantied Obligations is rescinded or must
otherwise be returned by the payee thereof upon the insolvency, bankruptcy,
reorganization or similar event of any of the Reliance Selling Subsidiaries,
the Initial NPI Sellers, Reliance Exploration or Reliance Energy, all as
though such payment had not been made.
