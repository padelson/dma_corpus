(f) To the extent that the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates pays the
consideration required to be paid under this Agreement, and such payment is
made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such payment shall be
deemed to satisfy in full the Purchasers obligations in respect thereof, and
no Person shall have any recourse to the Purchaser or its Affiliates
(including from and after the Closing Date, the Target Group Companies) for
any failure of the Sellers or the Seller Representative to distribute the
aggregate amount of those payments to the other intended recipients, or for
any disputes among or between the Sellers and the other intended recipients.

 



 

(g) At its election, Parent may satisfy its obligations pursuant to _Section
2.01(d)(ii)_ and _Section 2.01(d)(iii)_ by paying to the Managers an amount
in cash equal to the US dollar value of the Consideration Shares (calculated
in accordance with _Section 2.01(d)_) required to be issued on the applicable
Closing Date in lieu of issuing the Consideration Shares otherwise required to
be issued pursuant to _Section 2.01(d)(ii)_ and _Section 2.01(d)(iii)_.

 **2.04** **Post-Closing Adjustment**

 



 

(a) For the purposes of finally determining Closing Date Indebtedness, Closing
Date Cash and Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Purchaser shall, or shall
cause the Purchasers accountants to, after the Closing, prepare a statement
(the **_Proposed Closing Statement_** ) showing the amounts, and calculations,
of Closing Date Indebtedness, Closing Date Cash and Closing Date Net Working
Capital, together with reasonable supporting detail with respect to the
calculations included therein. The Purchaser shall deliver the Proposed
Closing Statement to the Seller Representative within ninety (90) calendar
days after the Closing Date. The Purchaser shall prepare the Proposed Closing
Statement in accordance with the Accounting Principles.

 



 

(b) The Proposed Closing Statement shall become binding upon the Parties at
5:00 P.M. New York time on the thirtieth (30th) calendar day following
delivery thereof (and shall be deemed the Final Closing Statement, and the
determination contained therein shall be binding) unless the Seller
Representative gives written notice of Seller Representatives disagreement
with the Proposed Closing Statement (a **_Notice of Disagreement_** ) to the
Purchaser prior to the expiration of

 



     

 

 



 

such thirty (30) calendar day period. Any Notice of Disagreement shall specify
those items or amounts with which the Seller Representative disagrees in the
Proposed Closing Statement and contain (i) a reasonably detailed description
of the reasons for its objections to each such item or amount contained
therein and (ii) the Seller Representatives calculation of any amounts with
which the Seller Representative disagrees in the Proposed Closing Statement,
prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles. Items not disputed in
the Notice of Disagreement shall be binding upon the Parties.

 



 

(c) The objections set forth in the Notice of Disagreement shall be resolved
as follows:

 



 

(i) During the ten (10) Business Day period following the delivery of a Notice
of Disagreement (or such longer period as may be agreed in writing by the
Seller Representative and the Purchaser) (such period, the **_Resolution
Period_** ) the Seller Representative and the Purchaser shall first seek in
good faith to resolve such objections. If such objections are so resolved they
shall be deemed binding as so resolved and, at such time, the Proposed Closing
Statement, as modified to reflect such resolution, shall be deemed the Final
Closing Statement.

 



 

(ii) If the Seller Representative and the Purchaser do not resolve all of such
objections during the Resolution Period, the Seller Representative, on the one
hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand, shall make a written submission to
the Accounting Firm (and substantially simultaneously to the other) for
determination of any and all matters that remain in dispute (the **_Unresolved
Objections_** ) (all matters previously resolved shall become part of the
Final Closing Statement as resolved) and which were included in the Notice of
Disagreement; _provided_ that the scope of the Unresolved Objections to be
resolved by the Accounting Firm shall be limited to whether there were
mathematical errors in the Proposed Closing Statement and whether the
calculations of the Closing Date Indebtedness, Closing Date Cash and Closing
Date Net Working Capital were accurate and performed in accordance with the
applicable Accounting Principles, and the Accounting Firm shall not make any
other determination. Within five (5) Business Days after the expiration of
such ten (10) Business Day period, each of the Purchaser, on the one hand, and
the Seller Representative, on the other hand, may deliver to the Accounting
Firm its response to the others position on each Unresolved Objection;
_provided_ that each delivers a copy thereof substantially simultaneously to
the other. The Accounting Firms decision with respect to any Unresolved
Objection must be within the range of values assigned to each such item in the
Proposed Closing Statement and the Notice of Disagreement, respectively.

 



 

(iii) Except as set forth in _Section 2.04(c)(ii)_, the Seller Representative
and the Purchaser shall not be entitled to make submissions except as
specifically

 



     

 

 



 

requested by the Accounting Firm. The Seller Representative and the Purchaser
shall provide, as soon as reasonably practicable, all the information and
explanations that the Accounting Firm may reasonably require. The precise
timetable shall be as agreed with the Accounting Firm, but the Accounting Firm
shall be instructed to render its determination regarding only the Unresolved
Objections in accordance with _Section 2.04(c)(ii)_ within thirty (30)
Business Days following the date of such submissions.

 



 

(iv) The resolution by the Accounting Firm of the Unresolved Objections shall,
absent manifest error, be binding and at such time, the Proposed Closing
Statement, as modified to reflect such resolution (and any matters resolved in
accordance with _Section 2.04(c)(i)_), shall be deemed the Final Closing
Statement. The Parties agree that the procedure set forth in this _Section
2.04_ for resolving disputes with respect to the Proposed Closing Statement
shall be the exclusive method for resolving any disputes with respect to
Closing Date Indebtedness, Closing Date Cash and Closing Date Net Working
Capital. The decision of the Accounting Firm shall constitute an arbitral
award that is final, binding and non-appealable and upon which a judgment may
be entered by a court having jurisdiction thereover.

 



 

(v) The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by the
Sellers, on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand, based on the
following formula:

 



 

(A) The Sellers shall pay a portion of such fees and expenses equal to that
fraction of such fees and expenses where (1) the numerator is the absolute
value of the difference between Sellers aggregate position with respect to
the Closing Date Indebtedness, Closing Date Cash and Closing Date Net Working
Capital and such amounts as recalculated based upon the Accounting Firms
final determination with respect to the Unresolved Objections and (2) the
denominator is the absolute value of the difference between Sellers aggregate
position with respect to the Closing Date Indebtedness, Closing Date Cash and
Closing Date Net Working Capital and Purchasers aggregate position with
respect to such amounts; and

 



 

(B) The Purchaser shall pay the remainder of such fees and expenses.

 



 

(d) No later than five (5) Business Days after the Proposed Closing Statement
is deemed the Final Closing Statement pursuant to this _Section 2.04_:

 



 

(i) if Closing Date Indebtedness is: (A) less than Estimated Closing Date
Indebtedness, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Sellers payment of the amount
of such deficit; or (B) greater than the Estimated Closing Date

 



     

 

 



 

Indebtedness, the payment of the amount of such excess shall be made to the
Purchaser from the Escrow Amount in the Escrow Account;

 



 

(ii) if Closing Date Cash is: (A) less than Estimated Closing Date Cash,
payment of the amount of such deficit shall be made to the Purchaser from the
Escrow Amount in the Escrow Agreement; or (B) greater than Estimated Closing
Date Cash, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Sellers payment of the amount of
such excess; and

 



 

(iii) if Closing Date Net Working Capital is: (A) less than Estimated Closing
Date Net Working Capital, payment of the amount of such deficit shall be made
to the Purchaser from the Escrow Amount in the Escrow Account; or (B) greater
than Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Purchaser shall deliver
to the Sellers payment of the amount of such excess.

 



 

Any payments made by the Purchaser pursuant to this _Section 2.04(d)_ shall
be made by wire transfer from immediately available funds to a bank account
designated in writing by the Sellers (such designation to be made at least
three (3) Business Days prior to such payment). In respect of any payment
required to be made from the Escrow Account pursuant to this _Section
2.04(d)_, the Seller Representative shall, together with the Purchaser,
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to remit such payment to the Purchaser not
later than five (5) Business Days after the Proposed Closing Statement is
deemed the Final Closing Statement pursuant to this _Section 2.04(d)_. To the
extent that the amount required to be paid to the Purchaser pursuant to this
_Section 2.04(d)_ exceeds the Escrow Amount, the Sellers shall pay such
excess to the Purchaser not later than five (5) Business Days after the
Proposed Closing Statement is deemed the Final Closing Statement pursuant to
this _Section 2.04(d)_. The Parties shall net the payments, if any, to be
made pursuant to _Section 2.04(d)(i)_, _(ii)_ and _(iii)_ , such that only
one Party is required to deliver or cause to be delivered amounts required to
be paid under this _Section 2.04(d)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Party
shall be required to make any payment pursuant to this _Section 2.04(d)_
unless the amount of the adjustment calculated hereunder be paid by one Party
to the other Party exceeds $400,000.00.

 



 

(e) Until the date the Proposed Closing Statement is deemed the Final Closing
Statement pursuant to this _Section 2.04_, the Parties agree that following
the Closing, each shall provide and cause to be provided to the other and its
respective representatives reasonable access upon reasonable notice during
normal business hours to such first Partys books, records and accounting
personnel (including books, records and accounting personnel of the Target
Group Companies), and shall cause such personnel to reasonably cooperate with
the other Party and respond to such Partys reasonable requests for
information reasonably promptly.

 



     

 

 



 

 **2.05** **Intended Tax Treatment; Allocation**

 



 

(a) The Parties acknowledge and agree that, for U.S. federal (and, where
applicable, state and local) income Tax purposes pursuant to Revenue Ruling
99-6, 1999-1 C.B. 432, the purchase of the Units pursuant to this Agreement
shall be treated by the Purchaser as a purchase of the assets of the Target
Company, subject to the liabilities of the Target Company as of the Closing
Date, and by the Sellers as a sale of their respective Units. Furthermore,
with the consideration for the redemption of the Motley Perforator Class B
Units and the Motley Coil Class B Units under the Motley Perforator Redemption
Agreements and Motley Coil Redemption Agreements effectively coming from
Purchaser, the Parties acknowledge and agree that, for U.S. federal (and,
where applicable, state and local) income Tax purposes, the acquisition of
each of such Motley Perforator Class B Units and Motley Coil Class B Units
shall also be treated as a transaction pursuant to Revenue Ruling 99-6, 1999-1
C.B. 432, whereby the redemption of such Motley Perforator Class B Units and
Motley Coil Class B Units shall be treated by Purchaser as a purchase of an
undivided interest in the assets of Motley Perforator or Motley Coil, subject
to the liabilities thereof, as the case may, and by such Motley Perforator
Class B Unitholders or Motley Coil Class B Unitholders, as a sale of their
respective Motley Perforator Class B Units and/or Motley Coil Class B Units.

 



 

(b) On, or prior to, the Closing, the Purchaser shall prepare and provide the
Seller Representative with the Purchasers best estimate of the allocation,
prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code, of the Cash
Consideration (plus any other relevant items) and the liabilities of the
Target Group Companies (plus other relevant items) to the assets of each of
the Target Group Companies (the **_Estimated Allocation_** ). Within sixty
(60) days of the Closing, the Seller Representative shall provide the
Purchaser with written comments on the Estimated Allocation. Within ninety
(90) days of the Closing, the Purchaser shall prepare and provide to the
Seller Representative, taking into account reasonable written comments of the
Sellers, a final version of that allocation (the **_Final Allocation_** ). The
Seller Representative shall notify the Purchaser if the Sellers disagree with
the Final Allocation within fifteen (15) days of receipt. In the event the
Seller Representative notifies the Purchaser of the Sellers disagreement with
the Final Allocation, the disagreement shall be resolved by a mutually agreed
upon nationally recognized accounting firm, whose determination shall be final
and binding on the Parties, with fees of such accounting firm borne fifty
percent (50%) by the Sellers and fifty percent (50%) by the Purchaser. The
Parties and their respective Affiliates shall prepare and file all Tax Returns
in a manner not inconsistent with this Section 2.05, and shall not take any
position for Tax purposes (including in any audit or other examination or
proceeding relating to Taxes) inconsistent with this _Section 2.05_ unless
required to do so by Applicable Law.

good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties and
assets occupied, owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business

Target Company, the Target Company does not have any outstanding Equity
Securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any membership
interests in it or any rights to subscribe for or to purchase, or any
agreements providing for the issuance (contingent or otherwise), repurchase,

sale of, any membership interests in it. Other than the Amended and Restated
Company Agreement of the Target Company, no Seller is a party to any right of
first refusal, right of first offer, proxy, voting agreement, voting trust,
registration rights agreement or shareholders agreement with respect to the
sale or voting of any Equity Securities, including the Units, or any
securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any Equity

Governing Documents or the Applicable Law of its jurisdiction of organization.
The conversion of the Target Company into a limited liability company on
October 6, 2016 was in accordance with the Texas Business Organizations Code
and was conducted in accordance with the Target Companys Governing Documents
in effect at such time, and all limited liability company action required to
be taken by the Target Company as a condition to the conversion of the Company
into a limited liability company on October 6, 2016 was taken prior to the
consummation of such conversion.

 



 

(e) No claims for indemnification have been made under the Governing Documents
of any Target Group Company, nor have any requests or other notices related to
capital contributions been provided by any Target Group Company to any Seller,
nor are any such requests or other notices, or any future capital

effect in accordance with its terms.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing, each of the Sellers and their Affiliates shall
keep confidential all Confidential Information; _provided_ that each of the

required (i) pursuant to any legal process (including pursuant to the
assertion of rights under this Agreement), (ii) for purposes of compliance by
such Seller or any of its Affiliates with Applicable Law, or (iii) in
connection with carrying out such Partys obligations under this Agreement or
the other agreements contemplated under this Agreement; _provided further_

Law, such Seller shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to preserve
the confidentiality of the Confidential Information disclosed, including by

appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information required to be
disclosed. As used in this _Section 6.03_, **_Confidential Information_**

provide to the requesting Party or its Representatives reasonable access to
such records during normal business hours and (ii) permit the requesting Party
or its Representatives to make copies of such records, in each case at no cost
to the requesting Party or its Representatives (other than for reasonable out
of pocket expenses); _provided_ that nothing herein shall require any Party to
disclose any information to the other if such disclosure would result in

 



     

 

 



 

the loss of any attorney work-product protections, attorney-client privileges
or similar protections and privileges, or contravene any Applicable Law.

 



 

(d) Prior to or on the Closing Date, the Seller Representative will deliver to

Purchaser, after prior, good faith consultation with the Sellers and after
considering in good faith the Sellers views and comments, shall have primary

Governmental Authority which are required in connection with the Required
Notification; _provided_ that the consent of each Party shall be required
prior to the taking of any action (including the failure to take any such
action) in connection therewith if such action (or failure to act) would be
reasonably likely to materially delay, or materially impair, the likelihood of
obtaining the same.

 



 

(d) The Purchaser, on one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, shall each
be responsible for 50% of all filing fees in connection with the Required
Notification and the satisfaction of the condition set forth in _Section

material substantive position with respect to the Required Notification, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, in any written submission
to, or in any discussions with, any Governmental Authority. No Party shall
participate in or agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any filings, investigation (including any settlement
of any such investigation), litigation or other inquiry related to the
Required Notification, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
or enter into any agreement with any Governmental Authority (including,
without limitation, extending antitrust waiting periods) unless it consults
with the other Parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Authority, gives the other Parties the opportunity to attend and
participate at such meeting. Each Party will coordinate and cooperate with
each other Parties in exchanging such information and providing such
assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with the Required

Purchaser, any Target Group Company or any of their respective subsidiaries,
Affiliates, employees, officers, directors or stockholders.

 



 

(d) Each Seller acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this _Section
6.07_ are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the
Purchaser and constitute a material inducement to the Purchaser to consummate
the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
the event that any covenant contained in this _Section 6.07_ should ever be
adjudicated to exceed the time, geographic, product or service, or other
limitations permitted by Applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then any court is
expressly empowered to reform such covenant, and such covenant shall be deemed
reformed, in such jurisdiction to the maximum time, geographic, product or
service, or other limitations permitted by Applicable Law. The covenants
contained in this _Section 6.07_ and each provision hereof are severable and
distinct covenants and provisions. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
such covenant or provision as written shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable the remaining covenants or provisions hereof, and any such
invalidity or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such covenant or provision in any other jurisdiction.

the Purchaser, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and
such resolution shall provide that the Sellers will inform the participants in
the Seller 401(k) Plan that their distributions may not be rolled over,
directly or subsequently, to the Purchasers plan) not later than the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date. To the extent that the Business
Employees satisfy the eligibility requirements under the Purchasers plan, the
Purchaser shall (i) cause Business Employees who are employed following the
Closing Date to be eligible to participate in a 401(k) plan sponsored by the
Purchaser or one of its Affiliates, and (ii) cause such 401(k) plan to provide

 **6.11** **Director and Officer Indemnification**

 



 

The Governing Documents of the Target Group Companies after Closing shall
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to elimination or limitation
of liability and indemnification in favor of current or former directors,
managers or officers (the **_D andO Indemnified Parties_**) than are set forth
in the Governing Documents of the Target Group Companies as of the date
hereof, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Target Group Companies)
for a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date in any manner that would
affect adversely the rights of the DandO Indemnified Parties. In the event any
Target Group Company or any of its successors or assigns (a) consolidates with
or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
Person of such consolidation or merger, or (b) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Purchaser agrees that proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of such Target Group Company shall succeed to the obligations of
Purchaser set forth in this _Section 6.11_. The rights of each of the DandO
Indemnified Parties under this _Section 6.11_ shall not be deemed exclusive
of any other rights to which to which such DandO Indemnified Party is entitled.
The provisions of this _Section 6.11_ shall survive the Closing Date and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each DandO
Indemnified Party and their respective heirs, successors and assigns. Nothing
in this _Section 6.11_ shall prevent the Purchaser from dissolving and
winding up any Target Group Company after the Closing Date.

from and against any (i) Tax Liabilities of the Sellers, (ii) Taxes
attributable to or imposed on a Target Group Company, or any precursor
company, with respect to any taxable period ending on or before the Closing
Date, and the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (a

which shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the termination of
this Agreement and any other provision hereof to the contrary.

 



 

 **9.02** **Effect of Termination**

 



 

If this Agreement is terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby are
abandoned as described in _Section 9.01_, this Agreement shall become null

determining whether there has been a breach thereof and (B) determining the

(ii) a breach of, or failure to timely and duly perform, any covenant or
agreement to be performed by the Sellers contained in this Agreement (other

 **10.03** **Limitations on Indemnification Obligations**

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement (but
except as set forth in the proviso in this _Section 10.03_):

 



 

(a) no Purchaser Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover under _Section
10.02(a)(i)_ or _Section 10.02(b)(i)_ unless and until the aggregate amount
of Losses (after giving effect to the De Minimis Threshold) suffered by
Purchaser Indemnitees thereunder exceeds one percent (1%) of the Cash
Consideration (the **_Deductible_** ), whereupon such Purchaser Indemnitee
shall be entitled to recover only such Losses in excess of the Deductible;

 



 

(b) no Purchaser Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover under _Section
10.02(a)(i)_ or _Section 10.02(b)(i)_ with respect to any single claim or
series of related claims unless and until the amount of Losses suffered by
such Purchaser Indemnitee in respect of such claim or series of related claims
exceeds $50,000 (the **_De Minimis Threshold_** ); and

 



 

(c) the Sellers maximum aggregate liability pursuant to _Section
10.02(a)(i)_ and _Section 10.02(b)(i)_ shall not exceed an amount equal to
five percent (5%) of the Cash Consideration (the **_Cap_** );

 



 

 _provided_ that the limitations in clauses (a), (b) and (c) above shall not
apply with respect to any claim for indemnification under _Article VII_ or in
respect of Losses to the extent arising from a breach of a Fundamental
Representation or Fraud on the part of any Seller, and in such event, other
than with respect to the Fundamental Representations contained in _Article
III_ for which each Seller shall be severally, and not jointly, liable for the
full amount of such Losses, the Sellers shall be jointly and severally liable
to the Purchaser Indemnitees for the full amount of such Losses.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, (1) each Sellers maximum aggregate liability pursuant to _Section
10.02(a)_ and _(b)_ shall not exceed the portion of the Cash Consideration
actually received by such Seller; and (2) the Sellers combined maximum
aggregate liability under this Agreement shall not exceed an amount equal to
the Cash Consideration plus the value of the Consideration Shares (calculated
in accordance with _Section 2.01(d)_).

 



 

 **10.04** **Third Party Claims; Notice of Direct Claims**

 



 

(a) In order for a Person to be entitled to any indemnification provided for
under this Agreement (such Person entitled to indemnification hereunder, an
**_Indemnified Party_** ; and a Party against whom indemnification is sought
hereunder, an **_Indemnifying Party_** ), in respect of, arising out of or
involving a claim made by any Person (other than a Party hereto) against an
Indemnified Party (a **_Third Party_**

 



     

 

 



 

 ** _Claim_** ), such Indemnified Party shall provide written notice to the
Indemnifying Party (such notice to include a description of the nature of the
Third Party Claim, a good faith estimate of the Losses associated therewith
and copies of all written notices and documents (including any court papers)
received by such Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim) during
the applicable survival period in _Section 10.01_ and within ten (10)
Business Days after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice of the
Third Party Claim; _provided_ that failure to give such prompt notice shall
not affect the right to indemnification provided hereunder except to the
extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been prejudiced as a result of such
failure.

 



 

(b) Except as set forth in this _Section 10.04_, the Indemnifying Party shall
be entitled (at its election) to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim
within ten (10) Business Days after receiving the notice specified in _Section
10.04(a)_ with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party that is reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; _provided_ that (i) the Indemnifying
Party may only assume control of such defense if (A) it acknowledges in
writing to the Indemnified Party that any damages, fines, costs or other
liabilities that may be assessed against the Indemnified Party in connection
with such Third Party Claim constitute Losses for which the Indemnified Party
may be indemnified pursuant to this _Article X_ and (B) an adverse resolution
of the Third Party Claim would not have a material adverse effect on the
goodwill or reputation of the Indemnified Party or the business, operations or
future conduct of the Indemnified Party, and (ii) the Indemnifying Party may
not assume control of the defense of any Third Party Claim involving any
Governmental Authority or criminal liability or in which equitable relief is
sought against the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not, or
is not permitted under the terms hereof to, assume control of the defense of a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall control such defense. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall
nonetheless have the right to employ counsel separate from the counsel
employed by the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party
shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party for any fees of such separate
counsel with respect to the defense of such Third Party Claim, unless, in the
reasonable opinion of the Indemnifying Partys legal counsel, a conflict of
interest exists between such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that
would make such separate representation advisable. If the Indemnifying Party
does not assume such defense, and for any period during which the Indemnifying
Party has not assumed such defense, the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for
the reasonable fees and expenses of one single counsel employed by such
Indemnified Party (which reasonable fees and expenses shall be considered
Losses for purposes of this Agreement). If the Indemnifying Party chooses to
defend a Third Party Claim or prosecute a claim in connection therewith, each
Indemnified Party shall provide all reasonable cooperation in such defense or
prosecution.

 



     

 

 



 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party may not settle, compromise or discharge such Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, unless (i)
the Indemnifying Party agrees in writing to pay or cause to be paid all
amounts arising out of such proposed settlement, and (ii) the proposed
settlement (A) does not include an admission of wrongdoing by the Indemnified
Party, (B) includes a complete release of the Indemnified Party from further
Liability, and (C) does not impose any injunctive relief or other equitable
obligations on the Indemnified Party.

 



 

(d) In the event a Seller Indemnitee has a claim against the Purchaser or
Parent (as applicable) under _Section 10.02_ that does not involve a Third
Party Claim, such Seller Indemnitee shall deliver written notice of such claim
to the Purchaser or Parent (as applicable) stating the amount of the Loss, if
known, and method of computation thereof, and containing a reference to the
provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification
is claimed or arises, during the applicable survival period in _Section
10.01_ and within twenty (20) Business Days of becoming aware of the facts or
circumstances giving rise to such claim; _provided_ that failure to give such
notice shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the
extent the Purchaser or Parent (as applicable) shall have been prejudiced as a
result of such failure. The Seller Indemnitee and the Purchaser or Parent (as
applicable) shall, for a period of not less than twenty (20) Business Days
following receipt by the Purchaser or Parent (as applicable) of the notice of
such claim, negotiate in good faith to resolve the claim, and such Seller
Indemnitee shall not commence Proceedings with respect to such claim prior to
the end of such period.

 



 

(e) In the event a Purchaser Indemnitee has a claim against one or more
Sellers under _Section 10.02_ that does not involve a Third Party Claim, such
Purchaser Indemnitee shall deliver written notice of such claim to such
Seller(s) stating the amount of the Loss, if known, and method of computation
thereof, and containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in
respect of which such right of indemnification is claimed or arises, during
the applicable survival period in _Section 10.01_ and within twenty (20)
Business Days of becoming aware of the facts or circumstances giving rise to
such claim; _provided_ that failure to give such notice shall not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent such Seller(s) shall
have been prejudiced as a result of such failure. The Purchaser Indemnitee and
the Seller(s) shall, for a period of not less than twenty (20) Business Days
following receipt by such Seller(s) of the notice of such claim, negotiate in
good faith to resolve the claim, and such Purchaser Indemnitee shall not
commence Proceedings with respect to such claim prior to the end of such
period.

 



     

 

 



 

 **10.05** **Representations and Warranties Insurance Policy**

 



 

(a) The Purchaser has purchased for its benefit a representations and
warranties insurance policy (the **_R andW Insurance Policy_**), and except as
otherwise set forth in this _Article X_, the RandW Insurance Policy shall
provide Purchasers sole and exclusive recourse with respect to Losses
suffered or incurred from claims of breaches of representations and warranties
arising under this Agreement. All premiums and underwriting and due diligence
fees for the RandW Insurance Policy shall be borne by the Purchaser.

 



 

(b) The Purchaser shall cause the RandW Insurance Policy to provide that the
insurer with respect to such RandW Insurance Policy will not, other than in
instances of Fraud by the Sellers, be entitled to subrogation or assignment of
rights of recovery against the Sellers, and the Purchaser shall not cause or
permit the RandW Insurance Policy to be amended or modified such that the
insurer with respect to such RandW Insurance Policy would be entitled to
subrogation or assignment of rights of recovery against the Sellers, other
than in instances of Fraud. The Purchaser shall not subrogate or assign
rights of recovery against the Sellers to such insurer and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such insurer to waive all rights of
recovery from or subrogation against the Sellers, other than in instances of
Fraud by the Sellers. The RandW Insurance Policy shall be specifically endorsed
to provide such waiver.

 



 

 **10.06** **Double Recovery**

 



 

No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover any amount pursuant to any
provision of this Agreement in respect of any claim to the extent that such
Indemnified Party has already recovered any amount in respect of such claim.

 



 

 **10.07** **Recovery; Other Limitations**

 



 

(a) In the event that any Purchaser Indemnitee sustains or incurs Losses for
which the Sellers are obligated to indemnify such Purchaser Indemnitee
pursuant to _Section 10.02(b)_ (except with respect to breaches of
Fundamental Representations), the payments of Sellers to such Purchaser
Indemnitee shall be made (and the Purchaser Indemnitee shall only recover such
payments as set forth under this _Article X_) as follows:

 



 

(i) First, subject in every respect to the limitations contained in this
_Article X_, from the Escrow Account pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement until such Losses are paid in full or until the Escrow Amount (and
all income earned thereon) is extinguished; and

 



 

(ii) then, directly from the Sellers in accordance with the terms of, and
subject in every respect to the limitations contained in, this _Article X_.

 



     

 

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, after
the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date, Purchasers sole and
exclusive remedy under _Section 10.02(b)(i)_ (other than with respect to
breaches of the Fundamental Representations and the representations contained
in _Sections 4.13_ and _4.15_ ) shall be against the RandW Insurance Policy.

 



 

(b) Losses suffered by a Party in connection with any claim hereunder shall be
limited to the amount of any liability or damage that remains after deducting
therefrom any insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contribution, or other
similar payment actually received by any Party in respect of any such claim.

 



 

(c) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the Closing
(except as provided in _Section 6.05(b)_, _Article VII_ and _Section
11.13_), its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all Losses
relating to this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby, the Target
Group Companies, the Business, and/or the personal or real property of the
Target Group Companies shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set
forth in this _Article X_.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XI** ** 
MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS**

other Party contained in this Agreement or (c) waive compliance with any of

Agreement; _provided_ that (i) any such extension or waiver by a Party will be
valid only if set forth in a written document signed on behalf of the Party
against whom such extension or waiver is to be effective; (ii) no extension or
waiver will apply to any time for performance, inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty or noncompliance with any covenant or condition, as
the case may be, other than that which is specified in the written extension
or waiver and (iii) no failure or delay by a Party in exercising any right or
remedy under this Agreement or any of the documents delivered pursuant to this
Agreement, and no course of dealing between the Parties, operates as a waiver
of such right or remedy, and no single or partial exercise of any such right
or remedy precludes any other or further exercise of such right or remedy or
the exercise of any other right or remedy.

delegated or otherwise transferred by any Party without the prior written

Any attempted assignment in violation of this _Section 11.02_ shall be null
and void and of no effect.

contemplated hereby and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby that

(A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTY HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN

with the negotiation and performance of this Agreement, (iii) accepting and

compromising and otherwise handling any claims for indemnification or other
claims made pursuant this Agreement to the extent that each of the Sellers is

indemnification, and (vi) generally doing each and every other act and
exercise any and all other rights which such Seller is, or Sellers
collectively are, permitted or required to do or exercise under this
Agreement. In addition, if one or more of the Sellers are an Indemnifying

Sellers hereby agree that the Seller Representative shall have the
authorization, power and authority to take any and all action and to make and
agree to any agreement for all such Sellers with respect to such Third Party
Claim and that such determination shall be binding upon such Sellers.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any of the
agreements, conveyances, documents, instruments and certificates delivered at
the Closing pursuant to this Agreement, each Seller hereby agrees to indemnify
and hold harmless the Seller Representative and any Affiliate of the Seller
Representative with respect to any claim asserted against or damages incurred

Representative as a result of the Seller Representative carrying out his, her
or its duties and obligations as the Seller Representative as contemplated by
this Agreement.

 



 

(b) The Seller Representative and each other Seller shall be and are bound by
all decisions, actions, inactions, consents or instructions taken by the
Seller Representative pursuant to this _Section 11.12_ on behalf of the
Sellers. The Seller Representative will not be liable to any Seller for any
act taken or omitted by it as permitted under this Agreement, except if taken
or omitted in bad faith or by willful misconduct. The Seller Representative
will also be fully protected in relying upon any written notice, demand,
certificate or document that it in good faith believes to be genuine
(including facsimiles thereof).

 



 

(c) The Sellers understand and agree that the Seller Representative may have
various actual, perceived or potential conflicts of interest and hereby waive
and agree to waive any and all such conflicts of interest, not to assert any
claim on the basis thereof, and not to seek to disqualify the Seller
Representative due to any and all such conflicts of interest or potential
conflicts of interest or appearances of impropriety.

 



 

(d) None of the Purchaser, Parent or any of their Affiliates (including, from
and after the Closing, the Target Group Companies) shall have any Liability to
any of Sellers or the Seller Representative arising out of the acts or
omissions of the Seller Representative or any disputes among Sellers or any
other Person who may own (or who may purport to own) an interest in a Seller
or between Sellers and the Seller Representative. From and after the Closing,
to the extent that the Purchaser or Parent or any of their Affiliates
(including, from and after the

 



     

 

 



 

Closing, any Target Group Company) makes any payment hereunder to the Seller
Representative, such payment shall be deemed to satisfy in full the payors
obligations in respect of the amount of the payment made by such payor
(subject to delivery of the payment in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement), it being agreed and understood that such applicable Sellers and
their respective Affiliates shall have no recourse, nor shall they be
permitted to pursue any claim, against the Purchaser, Parent any of their
Affiliates (including, from and after the Closing, any Target Group Company)
in respect of the amount of the payment made by the payor (whether such
payment was not paid over by the Seller Representative or for any other
reason).

Agreement is not performed in accordance with its terms, and the Parties shall
