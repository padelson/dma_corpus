<PAGE>

          Exchange Ratio. All Assumed Stock Options shall continue to have, and

          (including any vesting provisions). As soon as practicable after the

          shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable
          to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
          (including any vesting provisions). Buyer will cause the Buyer Common
          Stock issuable upon exercise of the Assumed Stock Options to be
          registered on Form S-8 of the SEC as soon as possible (but not later
          than five Business Days) following the filing of Buyer's Form 10-K for
          the 2006 fiscal year of Buyer, will exercise commercially reasonable
          efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement
          for so long as such Assumed Stock Options remain outstanding and will
          reserve a sufficient number of shares of Buyer Common Stock for
          issuance upon exercise thereof.

               (ii) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
     necessary or appropriate action to effectuate the assumption and conversion
     of the Company Stock Options by Buyer in accordance with the terms hereof

than ten Business Days, after the Closing Date.

deliver to the holders of Vested Company Stock Options the amounts to which they
are entitled

<PAGE>

under Section 2.8(d)(i)(A) as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event

          (c) Form of Payment. Payment shall be made by check, or, for amounts
over $250,000, wire transfer of immediately available funds.

     2.10 EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. Each Seller shall surrender the certificate(s)
representing such Seller's shares of Company Capital Stock, duly endorsed to
Buyer for cancellation as of the Effective Time and, subject to receipt of such
certificate(s), together with a completed and executed letter of transmittal in
customary form (which shall acknowledge such Seller's indemnification
obligations pursuant to this Agreement and contain standard representations
regarding such Seller's ownership of Company Capital Stock), Buyer shall pay
such Seller pursuant to Section 2.9(a). If any certificate(s) shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such certificate(s) to be lost, stolen or destroyed and delivery
of the executed letter of transmittal referenced in the preceding sentence, and
subject to such other conditions as the Board of Directors of Buyer may impose,
Buyer shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate(s)

When authorizing such issue of consideration in exchange for such
certificate(s), the Board of Directors of Buyer (or any authorized officer
thereof) may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the
issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate(s) to enter into an indemnity agreement, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Buyer, against any claim that may be made against Buyer
or the Surviving Corporation with respect to the certificate(s) alleged to have
been lost, stolen or destroyed.

     2.11 ESCROW AMOUNT. At the Closing, Buyer shall (a) withhold the Escrow
Amount from the cash payable pursuant to Section 2.9(a) to the Sellers on a pro
rata basis according to their respective Allocable Portions and (b) deposit the
Escrow Amount into escrow with the Escrow Agent (by wire transfer or delivery of
other immediately available funds to an account designated by the Escrow Agent)
as a fund for payment of indemnification claims made by Buyer against the Escrow
Amount, which fund shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Escrow
Agreement.

     2.12 CONTINUATION OF VESTING AND REPURCHASE RIGHTS. If there are any shares
of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that may be forfeited to or repurchased by the Company under the
terms of any contract with the Company ("Unvested Shares"), then the right to
recover or extinguish such Unvested Shares under the terms of any contract with
the Company shall be assigned to Buyer and the cash payable upon conversion of
such Unvested Shares in the Merger (the "Unvested Cash") shall be, in place of
such Unvested Shares, equally subject to such right assigned to Buyer and shall
be withheld by Buyer and paid without interest to the holders of such Unvested
Shares if and to the extent such assigned right expires unexercised by Buyer
pursuant to the terms of the applicable contract with the Company; provided,
however, that the Surviving Corporation and Buyer shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from such payments the amount of withholding imposed for Taxes;
provided further, that a portion of such newly vested cash so distributed may be
treated as imputed interest and will be so treated to the extent required under
the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder. If a Seller holds Unvested
Shares, then such


                                       14

<PAGE>

Seller's Allocable Portion of the Escrow Amount shall consist of the percentage
obtained by dividing the Escrow Amount by the amount of the Merger consideration
distributed as cash hereunder ("Escrow Percentage"), of both (a) the cash (the
"Vested Cash") payable upon conversion hereunder of shares of Company Common
Stock held by such Seller which are not Unvested Shares and (b) the Unvested
Cash (subject to vesting) payable upon conversion hereunder of Unvested Shares
held by such Seller, and thereafter with respect to each installment of Unvested
Cash that vests in accordance with this Section 2.12, the Escrow Percentage of
such installment shall vest the Unvested Cash held in escrow.

     2.13 REALLOCATION.

          (a) Calculation. For the period commencing on the Closing Date and
concluding on November 2, 2009 ("Measurement Period"), Buyer shall calculate for
each Continuing Employee who has had Unvested Cash withheld on his or her behalf
pursuant to Section 2.12 or an Assumed Stock Option issued to him or her
pursuant to Section 2.8(d)(i)(B) who (i) has his or her employment relationship
with Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries
terminated by Buyer or the Surviving Corporation in a termination without cause
(as defined by mutual agreement of Buyer and the Company for purposes of this
Section 2.13) during the Measurement Period and (ii) Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation exercises its right of repurchase with respect to such Unvested Cash
or such Continuing Employee otherwise forfeits such Unvested Cash or any
unvested portion of such Assumed Stock Option, (x) the dollar amount of such
repurchased or forfeited Unvested Cash (calculated net of payment of any
repurchase price for such Unvested Cash) and (y) for each Assumed Stock Option
held by such Continuing Employee, the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock
subject to the unvested portion of such Assumed Stock Option forfeited by such
person upon termination multiplied by the difference between the Average Buyer
Stock Price and the exercise price of such Assumed Stock Option (the aggregate
of the amounts specified in the foregoing clauses (x)-(y) for all such
Continuing Employees being the "Forfeited Merger Value"). Buyer shall then
convert the Forfeited Merger Value to a number of shares of Buyer Common Stock
(the "Forfeited Merger Consideration") having an aggregate then-fair market
value equal to the Forfeited Merger Value, with each share of Buyer Common Stock
valued for such purpose at the 2009 Buyer Stock Price.

          (b) Reallocation Amount Statement. No less than five or more than ten
Business Days following the completion of such Measurement Period, Buyer shall
prepare and deliver to the Seller Representative a statement (the "Reallocation
Amount Statement") setting forth Buyer's calculation of the Forfeited Merger
Consideration and Buyer's determination of the Surviving Employees (as defined
in subsection (c) below) and allocation of the Forfeited Merger Consideration
amongst the Surviving Employees according to their respective Pro Rata Shares
(as defined below), together with such supporting documentation and information
as is reasonably necessary for the Seller Representative to verify the same. The
Reallocation Amount Statement shall be final and binding on the Seller
Representative, the Surviving Employees and Buyer unless the Seller
Representative shall notify Buyer in writing (a "Notice of Dispute"), within ten
Business Days of its receipt of the Reallocation Amount Statement, that the
Seller Representative wishes to dispute one or more items set forth in the
Reallocation Amount Statement (a "Disputed Item"), which Notice of Dispute shall
set out in reasonable detail each Disputed Item, the basis for such dispute, the
amount in dispute and the Seller Representative's


                                       15

<PAGE>

calculation of the Forfeited Merger Consideration. Buyer shall permit the Seller
Representative and its accountants and other advisors reasonable access during
normal business hours, and on reasonable notice, to any relevant accounts,
documents and records within its possession which are reasonably necessary for
the purposes of reviewing the Reallocation Amount Statement, and will permit
them to make copies of such accounts, documents and records at their own cost
and expense. If the Seller Representative shall notify Buyer of one or more
Disputed Items in accordance with this Section 2.13(b), the Seller
Representative and Buyer shall consult with each other and attempt in good faith
to resolve any and all Disputed Items. If the Seller Representative and Buyer
are unable to resolve any Disputed Items within 20 Business Days of the delivery
of a Notice of Dispute, such Dispute Items shall be referred, on the application
of either the Seller Representative or Buyer, for determination by an
independent auditing firm that is mutually acceptable to the Seller
Representative and Buyer (the "Accounting Firm"). The following terms shall
apply to any such determination:

               (i) each of the Seller Representative and Buyer shall promptly
     prepare a written statement on the Disputed Items which (together with the
     relevant documents) will be submitted to the Accounting Firm for
     determination;

               (ii) in giving its determination, the Accounting Firm shall state
     what adjustments (if any) are necessary to the Reallocation Amount
     Statement in respect of the Disputed Items in order to comply with the
     requirements of this Agreement;

               (iii) the Accounting Firm shall act as an expert (and not as an
     arbitrator) in making any determination with respect to any Disputed Items,
     which shall be final and binding on the Seller Representative, the
     Surviving Employees and Buyer; and

               (iv) the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be paid
     (i) by the Seller Representative, if the difference between the Forfeited
     Merger Consideration calculated based upon any determinations of the
     Accounting Firm and the Seller Representative's calculation of the
     Forfeited Merger Consideration is greater than the difference between the
     Forfeited Merger Consideration calculated based upon any determinations of
     the Accounting Firm and Buyer's calculation of the Forfeited Merger
     Consideration, and (ii) by Buyer, if the difference between the Forfeited
     Merger Consideration calculated based upon any determinations of the
     Accounting Firm and Buyer's calculation of the Forfeited Merger
     Consideration is greater than the difference between the Forfeited Merger
     Consideration calculated based upon any determinations of the Accounting
     Firm and the Seller Representative's calculation of the Forfeited Merger
     Consideration.

     If the Seller Representative and Buyer reach agreement on the Reallocation
Amount Statement, or the Reallocation Amount Statement is finally determined at
any stage in the procedures set out in this Section 2.13(b), the Reallocation
Amount Statement as so agreed or determined (including the number of shares
constituting the Forfeited Merger Consideration set forth therein) shall be
final and binding on the Seller Representative, Surviving Employees and Buyer
and shall be deemed to be the "Final Reallocation Amount Statement," for all
purposes of and under this Agreement.


                                       16

<PAGE>

          (c) Payment of Forfeited Merger Consideration. Within five Business
Days after determination of the Final Reallocation Amount Statement, Buyer shall
issue to the Continuing Employees who continued to have an employment
relationship with Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
subsidiaries as of the last Business Day of the Measurement Period ("Surviving
Employees") the Forfeited Merger Consideration according to their respective Pro
Rata Shares (provided that any fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock
constituting Forfeited Merger Consideration shall instead be paid at such time
by Buyer in cash). For these purposes a Surviving Employee's "Pro Rata Share" of
the Forfeited Merger Consideration shall equal a fraction, (i) the numerator of
which shall be the number of shares of Company Common Stock held by such
Surviving Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the
denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Company Common Stock held
by all Surviving Employees as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(calculated in each case on a fully-diluted basis, assuming the full exercise
for, or conversion into, Company Common Stock of all Company Stock Options or
other direct or indirect rights to acquire shares of Company Common Stock held
by such Surviving Employees as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether or not then vested, exercisable or convertible).

          (d) Buyer will use reasonable best efforts to cause the Buyer Common
Stock constituting Forfeited Merger Consideration issued to Surviving Employees
to be registered on Form S-8 of the SEC (or the successor Form thereto (if any)
or another Form selected by Buyer and reasonably acceptable to the Seller
Representative) on or before the date of the payment referred to in subsection
(c).

     2.14 DISSENTING SHARES.

          (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
shares of Company Capital Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by stockholders who shall not have voted in
favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who shall have demanded
properly in writing appraisal for such shares in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL or Chapter 13 of the CGCL (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall
not be converted into or represent the right to receive the consideration set
forth in Section 2.8(c). Such stockholders shall be entitled to receive such
consideration as is determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares
in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 or Chapter 13, except that all
Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who
effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such
shares under Section 262 or Chapter 13 shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted into and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time,
the right to receive the consideration set forth in Section 2.8(c) (less such
stockholder's Allocable Portion of the Escrow Amount, which will be withheld by
Buyer pursuant to Section 2.11), without any interest thereon, upon surrender,
in the manner provided in Section 2.10, of the certificate or certificates that
formerly evidenced such Dissenting Shares.

          (b) The Company shall give Buyer (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL or the CGCL and received by the Company
and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to demands for appraisal under the DGCL


                                       17

<PAGE>

or the CGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Buyer, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to
settle or settle any such demands.

misappropriation, breach or wrongful use of the intellectual property rights of
any other Person, and the Company is not a party to any Action or order

hereby not occurred and without the payment of any additional amounts or
consideration other than ongoing fees or payments which the Company would
otherwise be required to pay. The Company is not a party to any non-competition
or other similar restrictive agreement or arrangement relating to any portion of

Letter:

               (i) The Company has taken all appropriate measures to seek
     registration for all Company IP, including the Company Software and Company
     Hardware, for which it is commercially reasonable (as determined by
     reference to similarly-situated private companies in the same industry) to
     seek registration.

               (ii) There is no Public Software, licensed rights or shrink-wrap
     code used in, incorporated into, integrated or bundled with or necessary
     for the use of the Company IP, including the Company Software or Company

     or right in the Company IP, the Company Software or the Company Hardware.
     To the Knowledge of the Company, no individual, including employees,
     consultants or contractors, performed services for a Governmental Entity or
     an educational institution or research center during the period of time in
     which the individual performed services relating to the creation or
     development of the Company IP, the Company Software or the Company Hardware
     for the Company.

               (v) The Company has not disclosed, delivered, licensed or agreed
     to disclose, deliver and/or license to any person or escrow agent, any of
     the source code relating to the Company Software. The consummation of the
     Merger will not result in any release of source code relating to the
     Company Software from a source code escrow or delivery of source code
     relating to the Company Software to any third party or entity.

               (vi) The Company Software, Company Hardware, any related products
     and the Company IP, and all parts thereof, are free of any disabling codes
     or instruction and any "back door", "time bomb", "Trojan horse", "worm",
     "drop dead device", "virus" or other software or hardware component
     permitting unauthorized access or disablement or erasure of the Company
     Software, the Company Hardware or any part thereof.

or condition exists which could subject the Company to a civil penalty under
Section 502(j) of ERISA or any excise tax related to the Employee Benefit Plans
(including, without limitation, any taxes under Sections 4975, 4976, or 4980B of
the Code) or the loss of a federal tax deduction.

          (g) Each "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined in Code

which each such Tax Return is filed, Buyer shall submit such Tax Return to the
Seller Representative for the Seller Representative's review, comment and
approval and Buyer shall make such revisions as are reasonably requested by the
Seller Representative to the extent that such Tax Return has not been prepared

obligations of Sellers under Section 7.

periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date. Seller Representative shall have
the right to participate in the disposition of the audit of any Tax Return
relating to the periods ending after the Closing Date if and to the extent that
such audit or disposition thereof will or might be reasonably expected to give
rise to a claim for indemnification under Section 7. If and to the extent that
such an audit (or the disposition thereof) will or might be reasonably expected
to give rise to a claim for indemnification under Section 7, Buyer may not
resolve that audit without the consent of the Seller Representative. Buyer shall

advance and comment upon all submissions made by Seller Representative in the
course of audits or appeals thereof to any Government Entity relating to taxable

other with such assistance as may reasonably be requested in connection with the
preparation of any Tax Return, any audit or other examination by any taxing
authority, or any judicial or administrative proceedings relating to liability
for Taxes, and each will retain for a period of three years after the close of
the relevant taxable period and provide the requesting party with any records or

(i) duplicate any benefit provided to any Continuing Employee or to fund any
such benefit, (ii) require Buyer to continue to maintain any employee benefit
plan in effect following the Effective Time for Buyer's employees, including the
Continuing Employees, or (iii) be construed to mean the employment of the
Continuing Employees is not terminable by Buyer at will at any time, with or
without cause, for any reason or no reason.

claim) exhaust any coverage available to him or her with respect to such claim
under the Tail Policy, and (ii) Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall in no
event be required to expend, in the aggregate, an amount pursuant to this
Section 6.10(a) (including without limitation in respect of all claims for
indemnification by Company Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.10(a)) in
excess of the amount of cash held (as a current asset of the Company) by the
Company as of the Closing Date, and at such time (if any) as such aggregate
expenditure under this Section 6.10(a) has been made, this Section 6.10(a) and
all rights and obligations hereunder shall immediately terminate. Except as
otherwise provided in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence, any claims for
indemnification made under this Section 6.10(a) on or prior to the fourth
anniversary of the Effective Time shall survive such anniversary until the final
resolution thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
6.10(a), the foregoing covenants under this Section 6.10(a) shall not apply to
any claim based on a claim for indemnification made by a Buyer Indemnitee
pursuant to Section 7.

          (b) The Company shall purchase immediately prior to the Closing a
"tail" policy under the Company's existing directors' and officers' insurance
policy which shall (i) have an effective term of six (6) years from the
Effective Time, (ii) cover only those persons who are currently covered by the
Company's directors' and officers' insurance policy in effect as of the
Agreement Date and only for matters occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
and (iii) contain terms reasonably comparable to those applicable to the current
directors and officers of the Company (the "Tail Policy"); provided that the
Company shall not expend in excess of $55,000 on the Tail Policy (and, if the
Tail Policy should cost more than such maximum amount, the Company shall
contribute such maximum amount to the purchase thereof and the remaining cost
shall be paid by the Sellers and/or the individual directors and officers or
their employers). Neither Buyer nor the Surviving Corporation shall take any
action following the Closing to cause the Tail Policy to be cancelled during its
term.

          (c) The provisions of this Section 6.10 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Company Indemnified Parties.

     6.11 COMPLETION OF ANNUAL AUDIT. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause, as soon as reasonably practicable following the
Agreement Date, (i) the completion (by the Company's regular auditor or another
auditor jointly approved by Buyer and the Company) of the audit of the financial
statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, and (ii)
the distribution to Buyer of an accurate and complete copy of such audited
financial statements, together with the auditor's report thereon (which shall
express an unqualified opinion on such financial statements, except that such
opinion may contain such qualifications of the general type as were also
reflected in the auditor's report on the Company's financial statements for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 and/or which are customary for companies at
the stage of development as the Company was as of December 31, 2005). For
clarity, the parties acknowledge and agree that (i) it is possible that the
financial statements contemplated by this Section 6.11 will not be completed and
distributed until after the Closing Date and (ii) provided that the Company has
used its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with this Section 6.11, the
fact that such financial statements have not been completed and distributed
prior to the Closing Date shall not in and of itself constitute a breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant of the Company under this Agreement.

     6.12 SECTION 16 MATTERS. Prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall take all
such steps as may be required to cause any acquisitions of Buyer Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to Buyer Common Stock but
specifically excluding any acquisitions of Buyer Common Stock pursuant to
Section 2.13) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
each individual who will become subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Buyer to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act, such steps to be taken in accordance with
the No-Action Letter, dated January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC to Skadden,
Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP. The Parties acknowledge that all such above
referenced dispositions and acquisitions are compensatory in nature.

     SECTION 7. SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION.

     7.1 SURVIVAL; BREACH.

          (a) All of the representations and warranties contained herein shall
survive the Closing and continue in full force and effect for a period of
eighteen (18) months thereafter, except that the representations and warranties
contained in Section 3.2(a) (Authorization) shall survive the Closing and
continue in full force and effect forever. The covenants and agreements
contained herein shall survive the Closing until duly performed in accordance
with the terms specified therefor. Any matter as to which an Indemnification
Claim Notice has been properly given during the applicable survival period
specified in this Section 7.1, which is pending or unresolved at the end of the
applicable survival period, shall continue to be covered by this Section 7
notwithstanding the expiration of the survival period until such matter is
finally terminated or otherwise resolved by the Parties or by a court of
competent jurisdiction and any amounts payable hereunder are finally determined
and paid. The rights to indemnification set forth in this Agreement based on the
representations, warranties, covenants and obligations set forth herein shall
not be affected by any investigation conducted, or any knowledge acquired (or


                                       43

<PAGE>

capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy
or inaccuracy of or compliance with any such representation, warranty, covenant
or obligation.

     7.2 INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS OF SELLERS. Subject to the provisions of
Section 7.4 below, each Seller shall, severally and not jointly, indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Buyer, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and each
of their respective successors, assigns, Affiliates, stockholders, officers,
directors, employees and agents (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnitees") from and
after the Closing, in respect of any Loss that any Buyer Indemnitee suffers,
sustains, incurs or becomes subject to as a result of, arising from or by virtue
of:

          (a) the breach of any of the covenants or agreements made by the
Company or Seller Representative in this Agreement;

          (b) the breach of any of the representations and warranties made by
the Company in this Agreement; and

          (c) the matters set forth on Schedule 7.2.

     7.3 INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS OF BUYER AND MERGER SUB. Subject to the
provisions of Section 7.4 below, Buyer and Merger Sub, jointly and severally,
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Seller and its respective
successors, assigns, Affiliates, stockholders, officers, managers, directors,
employees and agents (collectively, the "Seller Indemnitees") from and after the
Closing, in respect of any Loss which any Seller Indemnitee suffers, sustains,
incurs or becomes subject to as a result of, arising from or by virtue of:

          (a) the breach of any of the covenants or agreements made by Buyer or
Merger Sub in this Agreement; and

          (b) the breach of any of the representations and warranties made by
Buyer or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement.

     7.4 LIMITATIONS ON INDEMNIFICATION.

          (a) The maximum aggregate obligation of each Seller with respect to
any claim for indemnification shall not exceed such Seller's Allocable Portion
of the amount of such claim. The maximum aggregate obligation of each Seller
pursuant to Section 7.2 shall not exceed such Seller's Allocable Portion of the
Escrow Amount, and recovery from the Escrow Amount shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy under this Agreement for the matters listed in Section 7.2;
provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the maximum aggregate
obligation of each Seller pursuant to Section 7.2 with respect to claims based
on Section 3.2(a) (Authorization) and Section 3.3(a) (Capitalization) and claims
based on fraud shall not exceed the aggregate amount of cash paid to such Seller
pursuant to Section 2 (including amounts contributed to the Escrow Amount).
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no Buyer Indemnitee
may make a claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 7.2 unless and until an
Indemnification Claim Notice describing Losses in an aggregate amount greater
than $100,000 (the "Basket Amount") has been delivered, in which case the Buyer
Indemnitee shall be entitled to claim indemnity for the full amount of Losses
without deduction of such $100,000;


                                       44

<PAGE>

provided, however, that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to claims based
on Section 3.2(a) (Authorization) and Section 3.3(a) (Capitalization), claims
pursuant to Section 7.2(c), and claims based on fraud.

          (b) The maximum aggregate obligation of Buyer and Merger Sub pursuant
to Section 7.3 shall not exceed $15,000,000; provided that the maximum aggregate
obligation of Buyer pursuant to Section 7.3 with respect to claims based on
Section 2.9 and Section 2.13 shall not exceed $116,000,000.

     7.5 INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURES. Other than with respect to the tax matters
provisions, which will be governed by Section 6.8:

          (a) Notice of Third Party Claims. If any third party notifies Buyer or
the Seller Representative of any matter that may give rise to a claim by a Buyer
Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee, as applicable, for indemnification pursuant to
Section 7.2 or 7.3 above (a "Third Party Claim"), then Buyer or the Seller
Representative, as applicable (an "Indemnified Party"), must give the Seller
Representative or Buyer, as applicable (an "Indemnifying Party"), written notice
of such Indemnified Party's claim for indemnification (an "Indemnification Claim
Notice") specifying in detail to the extent practical to do so the source of the
Loss, promptly (and in any event within thirty (30) days) after the Indemnified
Party receives written notice of such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that
the failure of any Indemnified Party to promptly give notice within such thirty
(30) day period will not affect any rights to indemnification hereunder except
to the extent of any Losses caused by such delay in giving notice.

          (b) Control of Defense; Conditions. The obligations of an Indemnifying
Party under this Section 7 with respect to Losses arising from any Third Party
Claim that are subject to the indemnification provided in Section 7.2 or 7.3
above shall be governed by and contingent upon the following additional terms
and conditions:

               (i) An Indemnifying Party, at its option, shall be entitled to
     assume control of the defense of any Third Party Claim at any time within
     thirty (30) days of receiving notice of the Third Party Claim from the
     Indemnified Party, and may appoint as lead counsel of such defense any
     legal counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party. In order for an
     Indemnifying Party to assume control of the defense of any Third Party
     Claim, the Indemnifying Party must provide written notice to the
     Indemnified Party acknowledging that such Third Party Claim is (assuming
     that the allegations therein are true) covered by the indemnification
     rights provided in Section 7.2 or Section 7.3, respectively.

               (ii) Notwithstanding Section 7.5(b)(i) above, the Indemnified
     Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such claim and to
     employ counsel of its choice for such purpose; provided, that such
     employment shall be at the Indemnified Party's own expense unless (A) the
     employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the Indemnifying
     Party in writing, (B) the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the
     defense and employ counsel in accordance with Section 7.5(b)(i), (C) the
     named parties to any such Third Party Claim (including any impleaded
     parties) include both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and
     there are one or more legal defenses,


                                       45

<PAGE>

     in the opinion of counsel, that are reasonably available to such
     Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to those available
     to the Indemnifying Party (other than differing interests associated with
     an Indemnifying Party's obligation to indemnify), (D) the Third Party Claim
     seeks non-monetary relief, or (E) the Third Party Claim involves criminal
     allegations, in which case the Indemnified Party may, by notice to the
     Indemnifying Party, assume the defense of such claim and the reasonable
     fees and expenses of the Indemnified Party's counsel shall be paid
     periodically by the Indemnifying Party (provided that, if it is ultimately
     determined that the Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified
     under this Section 7 for such fees and expenses, such fees and expenses
     shall be refunded by the Indemnified Party into the escrow account, or, if
     such fees and expenses are paid directly by the Indemnifying Party, repaid
     by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party, within ten (10)
     Business Days following the date of such determination). If any of the
     conditions (A)-(E) in the preceding sentence is met, and if such Third
     Party Claim is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
     to entitle the Indemnified Party to indemnification as set forth in Section
     7, the reasonable costs and expenses of counsel of the Indemnified Party
     incurred in connection therewith shall be included in the indemnifiable
     Losses.

               (iii) If an Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of any
     Third Party Claim pursuant to Section 7.5(b)(i) above, then the
     Indemnifying Party shall have the exclusive right to defend, compromise, or
     settle such Third Party Claim, but the Indemnified Party will not be bound
     by any determination of a Third Party Claim so defended or any compromise
     or settlement effected without its consent, unless the judgment, settlement
     or compromise includes an unconditional release from all liability with
     respect to the Third Party Claim in favor of the Buyer Indemnitees or
     Seller Indemnitees, as applicable.

               (iv) If an Indemnified Party has assumed the defense of any Third
     Party Claim pursuant to Section 7.5(b)(ii) above, then the Indemnified
     Party shall have the exclusive right to defend, compromise, or settle such
     Third Party Claim, but the Indemnifying Party will not be bound by any
     determination of a Third Party Claim so defended or any compromise or
     settlement effected without its consent, unless the judgment, settlement or
     compromise includes an unconditional release from all liability with
     respect to the Third Party Claim in favor of the Buyer Indemnitees or
     Seller Indemnitees, as applicable.

               (v) The party which has not assumed the defense of any Third
     Party Claim shall nevertheless have the right to receive copies of all
     pleadings, notices and communications with respect to the Third Party Claim
     so long as the receipt of such documents does not affect any privilege
     relating to the Buyer Indemnitees or Seller Indemnitees, as applicable.

          (c) Notice of Other Claims. Any Indemnified Party may make a claim for
indemnification pursuant to Section 7.2 or 7.3 above by providing an
Indemnification Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party promptly after the
Indemnified Party becomes aware of such claim. Such notice must contain a
reasonably detailed description of the claim and the nature and amount, if then
reasonably ascertainable, of such Loss.


                                       46

<PAGE>

          (d) Resolution of Indemnification Claim Notice. Each Indemnification
Claim Notice shall be resolved as follows:

               (i) Uncontested Claims. If, within 20 Business Days after an
     Indemnification Claim Notice is received by the Indemnifying Party, the
     Indemnifying Party does not contest such Indemnification Claim Notice in
     writing to the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be
     conclusively deemed to have consented, on behalf of all Buyer Indemnitees
     or Seller Indemnitees, as applicable, to the recovery by the Buyer
     Indemnitees or Seller Indemnitees, as applicable, of the full amount of
     Losses specified in the Indemnification Claim Notice in accordance with
     this Section 7.

               (ii) Contested Claims. If the Indemnifying Party gives the
     Indemnified Party written notice contesting all or any portion of an
     Indemnification Claim Notice (a "Contested Claim") (with a copy to the
     Escrow Agent) within the 20 Business Day period specified in Section
     7.5(d)(i), then such Contested Claim shall be resolved by either (x) a
     written settlement agreement executed by the Indemnified Party and the
     Indemnifying Party (a copy of which shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent)
     or (y) in the absence of such a written settlement agreement within 40
     Business Days following receipt by the Indemnified Party of the written
     notice from the Indemnifying Party, by binding litigation between the
     Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party in accordance with the terms
     and provisions of Section 7.5(d)(iii).

               (iii) Litigation of Contested Claims. Either the Indemnified
     Party or the Indemnifying Party may bring suit in the state and federal
     courts located in the State of California, Orange County or Santa Clara
     County to resolve the Contested Claim. Regardless of which party brings
     suit to resolve a matter, the Indemnified Party shall bear the burden of
     proof by a preponderance of the evidence that the Indemnified Party or
     other Buyer Indemnitees or Seller Indemnitees, as applicable, are entitled
     to indemnification pursuant to this Section 7. The decision of the trial
     court as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Indemnification
     Claim Notice shall be nonappealable, binding and conclusive upon the
     Parties and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act in accordance with
     such decision and make or withhold payments out of the Escrow Amount in
     accordance therewith. Judgment upon any award rendered by the trial court
     may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

          (e) Manner and Characterization of Payment.

               (i) Any indemnification obligations of Sellers pursuant to
     Section 7.2 shall be paid within ten (10) days after final, nonappealable
     determination thereof by wire transfer or delivery of other immediately
     available funds to an account designated in writing by Buyer.

               (ii) Any indemnification obligations of Buyer pursuant to Section
     7.3 shall be paid by Buyer within ten (10) days after final, nonappealable
     determination thereof by wire transfer or delivery of other immediately
     available funds to an account(s) designated in writing by the Seller
     Representative.


                                       47

<PAGE>

               (iii) Any indemnification payments made hereunder shall be
     considered, to the extent permissible under applicable law, as adjustments
     to the consideration payable in the Merger for all Tax purposes.

     7.6 LOSSES NET OF INSURANCE AND TAXES. All amounts required to be paid to
an Indemnified Party pursuant to the terms of this Section 7 shall be (i)
reduced by the amount of any Tax benefits attributable to a payment made in
respect of a claim of Losses and actually received by the Indemnified Party
during the period after Closing, (ii) reduced by any amount actually received by
the Indemnified Party under insurance policies in existence prior to the
Closing, and (iii) net of any reserve specifically provided and identified for
the item (or category of item) in question on the November 30 Balance Sheet.

     7.7 EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. The foregoing indemnification provisions shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy for all claims for breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement under this Agreement (whether at law or
otherwise), other than claims for fraud or a suit for specific performance.

     SECTION 8. TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER.

     8.1 TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing:

          (a) by mutual written consent of Buyer and the Company;

          (b) by either Buyer or the Company if any court of competent
jurisdiction or other Government Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have
issued an order, decree, or ruling enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such order, decree or ruling
shall have become final and non-appealable (unless such order, decree, or ruling
has been withdrawn, reversed, or otherwise made inapplicable); or (ii) any
litigation or other Action is pending before any court of competent jurisdiction
or has been threatened to be instituted by any Person or Government Entity,
which in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of Buyer or the
Company, as the case may be, is reasonably likely to result in an order, decree,
or ruling enjoining, prohibiting, seeking substantial damages in respect of, or
materially impairing the benefits of the transactions contemplated by, this
Agreement;

          (c) by the Company by written notice to Buyer, upon a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Buyer set forth
in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Buyer shall have
become untrue or inaccurate, such that if not cured on or prior to the Closing
Date, the condition set forth in Section 9.2(a) would not be satisfied; provided
that if such untruth or inaccuracy in Buyer's representations and warranties or
breach by Buyer is curable by Buyer, through the exercise of commercially
reasonable efforts, within 30 days after Buyer's receipt of written notice from
the Company of a breach by Buyer hereunder, then the Company may not terminate
this Agreement under this Section 8.1(c) prior to the end of such 30-day period,
provided that Buyer continues to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to
cure such untruthfulness, inaccuracy or breach through such 30-day period (it
being understood that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section


                                       48

<PAGE>

8.1(c) if the Company shall have materially breached this Agreement or if such
untruthfulness, inaccuracy or breach by Buyer is cured prior to the end of such
30-day period);

          (d) by Buyer by written notice to the Company, upon a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set
forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of the Company
shall have become untrue or inaccurate, such that if not cured on or prior to
the Closing Date, the condition set forth in Section 9.1(a) would not be
satisfied; provided that if such untruth or inaccuracy in the Company's
representations and warranties or breach by the Company is curable by the
Company through the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts, within 30 days
after the Company's receipt of written notice from Buyer of a breach by the
Company hereunder, then Buyer may not terminate this Agreement under this
Section 8.1(d) prior to the end of such 30-day period, provided that the Company
continues to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure such
untruthfulness, inaccuracy or breach through such 30-day period (it being
understood that Buyer may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1(d) if Buyer shall have materially breached this Agreement or if such
untruthfulness, inaccuracy or breach by the Company is cured prior to the end of
such 30-day period); or

          (e) by the Company or Buyer, if the Closing shall not have taken place
on or before May 31, 2006 (the "Termination Date"); provided, that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(e) shall not be available to (i)
the Company if the failure of the Company to fulfill any of its respective
obligations under this Agreement substantially caused the failure of the Closing
to occur on or before such date or (ii) Buyer if the failure of Buyer to fulfill
any of its obligations under this Agreement substantially caused the failure of
the Closing to occur on or before such date; provided, further, that if the
Closing shall not have occurred by May 31, 2006 because any of the conditions
set forth in Section 9.1(b)-(c) or Section 9.2(b)-(c) has not been satisfied,
then either Buyer or the Company may (but shall not be obligated to), by giving
written notice to the other, extend such date by up to 90 days; provided,
further, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(e)
shall not in any way limit or otherwise affect the covenants of the Company, the
Sellers and Buyer under Section 6.3(d) above to use their commercially
reasonable best efforts to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in the most expeditious manner practicable.

     8.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there
shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Buyer, Merger Sub or the
Company or their respective officers, directors, stockholders or affiliates;
provided, however, that the provisions of this Section 8.2 (Effect of
Termination) and Section 10 (Miscellaneous) shall remain in full force and
effect and survive any termination of this Agreement.

     SECTION 9. CONDITIONS TO THE CLOSING.

     9.1 CONDITIONS OF BUYER'S AND MERGER SUB'S OBLIGATIONS. Buyer's and Merger
Sub's obligation to effect the Merger at the Closing is subject to the
satisfaction as of the Closing of the following conditions precedent:

<PAGE>

          (a) Representations and Warranties; Covenants. Each representation and
warranty set forth in Section 3 above shall be true and correct in all material
respects at and as of the Closing as though then made (except for any such
representation or warranty that by its terms speaks only as of a specific date
or dates, in which case such representation or warranty shall be true and
correct in all material respects at and as of such specified date or dates),
except to the extent that such representations and warranties are qualified by
the term "material," in which case such representations and warranties (as so
written, including the term "material") shall be true and correct in all
respects at and as of the Closing (except for any such representation or
warranty that by its terms speaks only as of a specific date or dates, in which
case such representation or warranty shall be true and correct in all respects
at and as of such specified date or dates). The Company shall have performed and
observed in all material respects each covenant or other obligation required to
be performed or observed by it prior to the Closing pursuant to this Agreement.

          (b) Proceedings.

               (i) There shall not be any injunction, judgment, order, decree,
     ruling or charge in effect the result of which would prevent or prohibit
     the consummation of any transaction pursuant to the Transaction Documents,
     cause any such transaction to be rescinded following consummation, or
     materially adversely affect the Company's performance of its obligations
     pursuant to the Transaction Documents, and no judgment, order, decree,
     stipulation, injunction or charge having any such effect shall exist.

               (ii) There shall not be any litigation or other Action pending
     before any court of competent jurisdiction or threatened to be instituted
     by any Person or Government Entity, which in the good faith determination
     of Buyer's board of directors is reasonably likely to result in an order,
     decree, or ruling enjoining, prohibiting, seeking substantial damages in
     respect of, or materially impairing the benefits of, the transactions
     contemplated by this Agreement.

          (c) Governmental Consents and Approvals. All governmental consents or
approvals required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
by the Company shall have been obtained, including the expiration of the waiting
period, if any, required under any applicable antitrust laws or regulations.

          (d) The Company's Closing Documents. The Company shall, or shall cause
each appropriate party to, deliver to Buyer the following documents (duly
executed as appropriate):

               (i) a certificate of the Company, dated as of the Closing Date
     and signed by an executive officer of the Company, expressly certifying
     that the conditions set forth in Section 9.1(a), Section 9.1(b) and Section
     9.1(c) with respect to the Company have been met;

               (ii) a certificate (dated not more than ten days prior to the

     10.1 CONFIDENTIALITY. The Company and Buyer will treat and hold as
confidential all information concerning the business and affairs of the Company
and Buyer that is not already generally available to the public (the
"Confidential Information"). Confidential Information shall not include
information that (a) becomes generally available to the public other than as a
result of the disclosure by such Party or such Party's representatives in
violation of this Section 10.1 or (b) a Party can demonstrate has become
available to a Party on a nonconfidential basis from a source (other than
another Party or its representatives) which, to such Party's knowledge, is not
prohibited from disclosing such Confidential Information by a legal, contractual
or fiduciary obligation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Party shall be
prohibited


                                       54

<PAGE>

from disclosing Confidential Information after such Party has been advised by
legal counsel that such Party is required by Legal Requirement to disclose such
Confidential Information. If this Agreement is terminated, all copies of
documents containing Confidential Information of a disclosing Party shall be
returned by the receiving Party to the disclosing Party or be destroyed.

     10.2 CONSENT TO AMENDMENTS. This Agreement may be amended or modified, and
any provisions of this Agreement may be waived, in each case upon the approval,
in writing, executed by the Company and Buyer, provided that after adoption of
this Agreement by the holders of Company Capital Stock, no amendment or
modification shall be made which under Legal Requirements requires the further
approval of the holders of Company Capital Stock without obtaining such further
approval, provided, further that following the Closing, this Agreement may be
amended or modified, and any provisions of this Agreement may be waived, in each
case upon the approval, in writing, executed by the Seller Representative and
Buyer. No other course of dealing between or among any of the Parties or any
delay in exercising any rights pursuant to this Agreement shall operate as a
waiver of any rights of any Party.

     10.3 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, all covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement by or on
behalf of the Parties shall bind and inure to the benefit of the respective
successors and permitted assigns of the Parties, whether so expressed or not.
Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder
may be assigned by any Party without the prior written consent of Buyer, with
respect to an assignment by the Company or the Seller Representative, or the
Company, with respect to an assignment by Buyer prior to the Closing, or the
Seller Representative, with respect to an assignment by Buyer or the Company
following the Closing.

     10.4 GOVERNING LAW; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL; VENUE. This Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict provision or
rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would
cause the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware to be
applied. In furtherance of the foregoing, the internal law of the State of
Delaware shall control the interpretation and construction of this Agreement,
even if under such jurisdiction's choice of law or conflict of law analysis, the
substantive law of some other jurisdiction would ordinarily apply. Each of the
Parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives any and all right to trial by jury in
any legal proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement. Each of the
Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the State of California,
Orange County or Santa Clara County, for any actions, suits, or proceedings
arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (and each of the Parties agrees not to commence any action, suit or
proceeding relating thereto except in such courts), and further agrees that
service of any process, summons, notice or document by any manner permitted by
applicable law shall be effective service of process of any action, suit or
proceeding brought against any Party in any such court. Each of the Parties
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of
venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, in such state or federal courts as aforesaid
and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to
plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

     10.14 SELLER REPRESENTATIVE.

          (a) By voting in favor of the Merger or participating in the
conversion of Company Capital Stock, each Seller shall be deemed to hereby
irrevocably appoint James F. Watson to act as the Seller Representative for all
purposes under Section 6.8 and Section 7 of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement including, without limitation, the full power and authority on each
Seller's behalf to: (i) receive notices or service of process, (ii) negotiate,
determine, compromise, settle and take any other action permitted or called for
by Sellers under Section 6.8 and Section 7 of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, and (iii) to execute and deliver any amendment or waiver to this
Agreement (to the extent permitted by the proviso in Section 10.2) and the
Escrow Agreement in connection therewith. Such agency and proxy are coupled with
an interest, and are therefore irrevocable without the consent of the Seller
Representative and shall survive the death, incapacity, bankruptcy, dissolution
or liquidation of any Seller. All decisions and actions by the Seller
Representative taken pursuant to this Section 10.14 shall be binding upon all
Sellers, and no Seller shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or
otherwise contest the same. The Seller Representative shall have no duties or
obligations hereunder except those specifically set forth herein and in the
Escrow Agreement and


                                       58

<PAGE>

such duties and obligations shall be determined solely by the express provisions
of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. Each Seller agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless the Seller Representative and its respective successors, assigns,
Affiliates, stockholders, officers, managers, directors, employees and agents
(collectively, "Seller Representative Indemnitees") against all expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts incurred by
a Seller Representative Indemnitee in connection with any action, suit or
proceeding to which such Seller Representative Indemnitee is made a party by
reason of the fact it is or was acting as, on behalf of or in connection with, a
Seller Representative under this Agreement or its relationship to a Seller
Representative; if not paid directly to the Seller Representative by the
Sellers, such expenses, judgments, fines and amounts may be recovered by the
Seller Representative from the Escrow Amount, and such recovery will be made
from the Sellers according to their respective Allocable Portions; provided
that, to the extent that such amounts recovered by the Seller Representative
from the Escrow Amount are not used by the Seller Representative to provide
indemnification to a Buyer Indemnitee for Losses pursuant to Section 7.2
(subject to the limitations on such indemnification set forth in Section 7.4),
the Seller Representative shall (if and upon subsequently receiving the direct
payment of such amounts from Sellers), or otherwise shall cause the Sellers to
(and the Sellers shall), promptly refund such amounts to the Escrow Amount. No
Seller Representative Indemnitee nor any agent employed by it shall incur any
liability to any Seller relating to the performance of its duties hereunder
except for actions or omissions constituting fraud or bad faith. Without
prejudice to the foregoing, no Seller Representative Indemnitee shall have
liability in respect of any action, claim or proceeding brought against the
Seller Representative Indemnitee by any Seller if the Seller Representative took
or omitted taking any action in good faith.

          (b) The individual serving as the Seller Representative may be
replaced from time to time by the holders of a majority in interest of the
Escrow Amount then on deposit with the Escrow Agent upon not less than ten days
prior written notice to Buyer and the Escrow Agent.

     10.15 ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEE AND OTHER MATTERS. The Parties additionally agree
to the items set forth on Schedule 10.15 hereto.
