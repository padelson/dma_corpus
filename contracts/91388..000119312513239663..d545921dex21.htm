This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of May 28,
2013, is entered into by and among Shuanghui International Holdings Limited, a
corporation formed under the laws of the Cayman Islands (" _Parent_ "), Sun
Merger Sub, Inc., a Virginia corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Smithfield Foods, Inc., a Virginia corporation
(the " _Company_ "). Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company are referred
to herein as a " _Party_ " and together as " _Parties_ ". Capitalized terms
used and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in _Section
9.01_.

 

RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") and
the respective boards of directors of Parent and Merger Sub have unanimously
determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and
shareholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the transactions
provided for herein, and have approved the acquisition by Parent of the
Company through the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement; and

 

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend that, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with
the Virginia Stock Corporation Act of the Commonwealth of Virginia (the "
_VSCA_ "), Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, with the
Company continuing as the Surviving Corporation (the " _Merger_ "), whereby
each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than shares
of Company Common Stock to be canceled in accordance with _Section 2.01(b)_)
will be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Price.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement, and subject to the conditions set forth herein, as well as other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties
agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

Section 1.01 THE MERGER. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, including the Plan of Merger, and in accordance with
the VSCA, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease. The
Company will continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "
_Surviving Corporation_ ") and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

Section 1.02 CLOSING. Subject to the provisions of _Article VII_ , the
closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m. (New
York City time), on the second (2nd) Business Day after satisfaction or (to
the extent permitted by Law) waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article
VII_ (other than those conditions that by their

 



1  terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
(to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions). The Closing
shall be held at the offices of Paul Hastings LLP, located at 75 East 55th
Street, New York, NY 10022, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in

Business Days notice to the Company or (b) if no such date has been specified

Agreement as the " _Closing Date_."

 

Section 1.03 EFFECTIVE TIME. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
as promptly as practicable on the Closing Date, the Parties shall (a) file
articles of merger, in customary form (the " _Articles of Merger_ "), meeting
the requirements of Section 13.1-720 of the VSCA, including setting forth the
related plan of merger meeting the requirements of Section 13.1-716 of the
VSCA (such plan of merger, the " _Plan of Merger_ "), substantially in the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ , with the State Corporation Commission
of the Commonwealth of Virginia (the " _SCC_ ") and (b) duly make all other
filings and recordings required by the VSCA in order to effectuate the Merger,
in each case, in such form as required by, and executed and filed in
accordance with, the relevant provisions of the VSCA. The Merger shall become
effective upon the issuance of a certificate of merger by the SCC or at such
later time as may be agreed to by Parent and the Company in writing and

becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Effective Time_

Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations,
claims, restrictions and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 1.05 ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS.

or by applicable Law.

 

(b) Bylaws. At the Effective Time, the Companys bylaws (the " _Company
Bylaws_ ") shall be amended and restated to be identical to the bylaws of

until thereafter amended (subject to _Section 6.06(a)_ hereof) as provided
therein or by applicable Law.

 



2 Section 1.06 DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.

(a) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall

death, resignation or removal in accordance with the articles of incorporation
and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their respective

ARTICLE II

 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS

 

Section 2.01 CONVERSION AND EXCHANGE OF SHARES OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK. At
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any holder of any shares of Company
Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Parent or Merger Sub:

(a) Conversion of Merger Sub Stock. Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, which shares at such time
shall comprise the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

(b) Cancellation of Company-Owned Stock, Parent-Owned Stock and Merger Sub-
Owned Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company or any
wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or held by Parent or Merger Sub, in
each case, immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, without payment of any consideration
therefor.

 

(c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Except as provided in _Section
2.01(b)_ and subject to  _Section 2.02_, each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into the right to receive $34.00 in cash, without interest (the "
_Per Share Merger Price_ "), payable to the holder thereof upon surrender of
such shares of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in _Section 2.03_.

(d) Appraisal Rights. In accordance with Section 13.1-730 of the VSCA, no
appraisal rights shall be available to the holders of Company Common Stock in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



3 Section 2.02 ADJUSTMENT TO PER SHARE MERGER PRICE. If at any time during the
period between the date hereof and the Effective Time there shall be any stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), cash
dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock,
the Per Share Merger Price shall be appropriately adjusted by Parent to
reflect the effect thereof.

Section 2.03 SURRENDER OF COMPANY STOCK CERTIFICATES.

(a) Paying Agent _._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an
agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company with the
Companys transfer agent or a bank or trust company that is reasonably
satisfactory to the Company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ")
for the payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Article
II_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause
the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Paying Agent in trust, for the
benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, cash in an amount
sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration. Any funds deposited
with the Paying Agent pursuant to this _Section 2.03(a)_ shall be referred to
in this Agreement as the " _Exchange Fund_."

(b) Company Stock Certificate Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each holder of record of a valid certificate previously representing
any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (a " _Company Stock Certificate_ ") or shares of Company Common
Stock represented by book-entry (" _Book Entry Shares_ ") whose shares of
Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Stock
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Company Stock
Certificates to the Paying Agent and which shall otherwise be in customary
form (including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an
"agents message" with respect to Book Entry Shares)) and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Company Stock Certificates, or in
the case of Book Entry Shares, the surrender of such shares, in exchange for
payment of the applicable Merger Consideration. Each holder of record of a
Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share shall, upon surrender to the
Paying Agent of such Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as
may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent pursuant to such instructions,
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash which the
number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such
Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share shall have been converted into
the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.01(c)_, and the Company Stock
Certificate or Book Entry Share so surrendered shall be canceled. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger
Consideration may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the
Company Stock Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Company Stock
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration

 



4  and any such dividends to a person other than the registered holder of such
Company Stock Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 2.03(b)_, each Company Stock Certificate shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration. No interest shall be
paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Company Stock
Certificates or Book Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this _Article
II_.

 

(c) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock; Transfer Books. At
and after the Effective Time, holders of Company Stock Certificates (or, in
the case of uncertificated shares, Book Entry Shares) shall cease to have any
rights as shareholders of the Company, except for the right to receive the
Merger Consideration. Any cash paid upon the surrender of Company
Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares in accordance with this _Article II_
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by such
Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares. At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of shares
of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Company Stock
Certificates or Book Entry Shares formerly evidencing shares of Company Common
Stock are presented to the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, they
shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration in accordance
with this _Article II_.

(d) Termination of the Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Stock Certificates or Book
Entry Shares on the date that is one (1) year after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Company Stock
Certificates or Book Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with this
_Article II_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall
remain liable for, payment of such holders claims for the Merger
Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_.

(e) No Liability. Neither Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official in compliance
with any applicable state, federal or other abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Shares shall not
have been surrendered prior to the date on which the related Merger
Consideration would escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Authority, any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, immediately prior to such time become the property of Parent,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled
thereto. 

(f) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash in the
Exchange Fund as directed by Parent;  _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) no
such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration
payable to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and following any
losses Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for
the benefit of the shareholders of the Company in the amount of any such
losses and (ii) such investments shall only be in short-term obligations of or
guaranteed by the 

 



5  United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof with
maturities of no more than thirty (30) days and backed by the full faith and
credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated
A1 or P1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$5.0 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that
are then publicly available). Any interest and other income resulting from
such investments shall be paid solely to Parent. 

(g) Lost Certificates. If any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Company Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such person of
a bond in such reasonable and customary amount as Parent or the Paying Agent
may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Company Stock Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate
the applicable Merger Consideration.

(h) Withholding Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of any Company Stock Certificate or
Book Entry Shares (or any holder of a Company Equity Award) such amounts as
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent are required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent such amounts are
so deducted or withheld and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the person to whom such amounts would otherwise have
been paid.

Section 2.04 COMPANY EQUITY AWARDS.

(a) At the Effective Time, each unexercised Company Stock Option granted
under any Company Stock Plan that, in each case, is outstanding and
unexercised as of the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) shall be
canceled, and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive a payment in
cash, without interest, equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock previously subject to such Company Stock Option and (B)
the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Price over the exercise price per
share previously subject to such Company Stock Option; _provided_ , _however_
, that to the extent the exercise price of any Company Stock Option is equal
to or greater than the Per Share Merger Price at the Effective Time, such
Company Stock Option shall be automatically canceled and retired and shall
cease to exist and no consideration will be paid or delivered in exchange
therefor. The Surviving Corporation shall pay the holders of Company Stock
Options the cash payments described in this _Section 2.04(a)_ as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Effective Time (but in no event later
than the second payroll period of the Surviving Corporation occurring after
the Effective Time).

 

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-outstanding performance

ARTICLE IV 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

 

Except as expressly set forth in the Parent Disclosure Schedule, it being
agreed that disclosure of any item in any part of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule shall also be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section of
this Agreement to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent,
Parent and Merger Sub jointly and severally represent and warrant to the
Company as follows:

Section 4.01 ORGANIZATION, STANDING AND CORPORATE POWER. Parent is a
corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the Cayman
Islands and has the requisite corporate power and authority to conduct its
business as it is presently being conducted and to own, lease or operate its
properties and assets. Merger Sub is a corporation duly organized and validly
existing under laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia and has the requisite
corporate power and authority to conduct its business as it is presently
being conducted and to own, lease or operate its properties and assets. Each
of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing (to the extent either such concept is recognized under applicable
Law) in each jurisdiction where the nature of its activities make such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified would not
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is
in violation of its organizational or governing documents.

Section 4.02 AUTHORITY; BINDING NATURE OF AGREEMENT. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to perform its respective obligations hereunder,
including the Merger and the Debt Financing. The execution, delivery and
performance by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the related Plan of
Merger and the consummation of the transactions completed hereby, including
the Merger and the Debt Financing, have been duly authorized by any necessary
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub and their respective boards of
directors, and Parent has caused the sole shareholder of Merger Sub to approve
and adopt this Agreement and the related Plan of Merger and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, in its capacity
as sole shareholder of Merger Sub and delivered to the Company evidence of
such vote or action by written consent approving and adopting this Agreement
in accordance with applicable law and the articles of incorporation and bylaws
of Merger Sub, and no other corporate proceedings or vote or consent of the
holders of any class or series of capital stock of Parent, Merger Sub or any
of their Affiliates or similar action on the part of Parent or Merger Sub or
any of their Affiliates are necessary to authorize this Agreement, to perform
their respective obligations hereunder, or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby (other than the filing with the SCC of the Articles of
Merger as required by the VSCA). This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the 

 



28  due and valid authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company, constitutes the valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger
Sub, enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its
terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

Section 4.03 NON-CONTRAVENTION.

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of Parent and Merger
Sub do not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and compliance with the provisions of this
Agreement will not, in the case of each of the following clauses (i), (ii),
and (iii), assuming compliance with the matters and requirements referred to
in _Section 4.03(b)(i)_: (i) violate or conflict with the organizational
documents of Parent or Merger Sub; (ii) violate or conflict with any Law
applicable to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective properties or
assets; or (iii) violate, conflict with or result in a breach of, constitute a
default (or an event that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default) under or give rise to any obligation to obtain any
third-party consent or provide any notice to any person under, any of the
terms, conditions or provisions of any Governmental Authorization or Contract
to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party except, with respect to clauses (ii)
and (iii), such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults, consents or notices
that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) No declaration, action by, filing or registration with, or notice to, or
authorization, permit, consent or approval, of any Governmental Authority is
required to be obtained or made by or with respect to Parent or Merger Sub in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent or
Merger Sub or the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Debt
Financing, except (i) (A) for the filing of a premerger notification and
report form by Parent and Merger Sub under the HSR Act and the filings and
receipt, termination or expiration, as applicable, of such other approvals or
waiting periods as may be required under any Foreign Merger Control Laws, (B)

regulations thereunder and state securities, takeover and "blue sky" laws, (D)

certificate of merger by the SCC pursuant to the VSCA; or (ii) where the
failure to make such declaration, filing or registration or notifications to
obtain such authorization, permits, consents or approvals, would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.04 FINANCING. Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete
copies of (a) the executed commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof,
among Parent and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., and (b) the executed
commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof, among Parent and Bank of
China Limited, New York Branch (together with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding,
Inc., the " _Lenders_ ") (collectively, the " _Debt Commitment Letters_ "),
pursuant to which the Lenders have agreed, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions thereof, to lend the amounts set forth therein for the purpose of
financing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and related fees and
expenses and the refinancing of any outstanding Indebtedness of the Company
required to be repaid at the

 



29  Effective Time (the " _Debt Financing_ "). The Debt Commitment Letters and
any related Fee Letter are referred to collectively in this Agreement as the "
_Financing Agreements_." As of the date hereof, the Financing Agreements are
in full force and effect. Except for the Fee Letters and fee credit letters
relating to fees with respect to the Debt Financing and the engagement letters
(complete copies of which have been provided to the Company, with only the
fee amounts and certain economic terms of the market flex (none of which would
adversely affect the amount or availability of the Debt Financing) redacted),
as of the date hereof there are no side letters or other agreements,
Contracts or arrangements related to the funding or investment, as applicable,
of the Debt Financing that are inconsistent with, modify or include additional
terms and conditions to the Financing Agreements delivered to the Company
prior to the date hereof. Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or
other fees in connection with the Financing Agreements that are payable on or
prior to the date hereof. The only conditions precedent or
other contingencies related to the obligations of the Lenders to fund the
full amount of the Debt Financing are those expressly set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letters. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or
breach on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or any direct investor in Parent
under any term, or a failure of any condition, of the Financing Agreements or
otherwise be reasonably likely to result in any portion of the Debt Financing
contemplated thereby to be unavailable. As of the date hereof, neither Parent
nor Merger Sub has any reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on
a timely basis any term or condition of the Financing Agreements required to
be satisfied by it. Based on the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
proceeds from the Debt Financing will be sufficient to provide Parent and
Merger Sub with the funds necessary to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 2.01(c)_, the Equity Award Amounts, any repayment or
refinancing of debt contemplated in this Agreement or the Financing Agreements
(including repayment of Indebtedness under the Existing Refinancing
Debt Documents), the payment of all other amounts required to be paid in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and to allow Parent and Merger Sub to perform all of their
obligations under this Agreement and pay all fees and expenses to be paid by
Parent or Merger Sub related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

Section 4.05 LITIGATION. There are no Legal Proceedings pending or, to
Parents Knowledge, threatened in writing against Parent or Merger Sub that
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is subject to
any Order, whether temporary, preliminary, or permanent, which would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.06 INFORMATION SUPPLIED. None of the information supplied or to
be supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub or any of its
Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the shareholders of the
Company and at the time of the Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Parent and
Merger Sub will take all commercially reasonable efforts to supply any
information necessary for the Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable.

Senior Management_ "), on the other hand, as of the date hereof that relate in

such transactions except as disclosed on _Part 4.10_ of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule and Parent or Merger Sub has promptly disclosed in writing to the
Company all such Contracts that may have arisen after the date of this
Agreement. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub, alone or together with any other
person, was at any time, or became, an "interested shareholder" under the VSCA
or has taken any action that would cause any anti-takeover statute under the
VSCA to be applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any transactions
contemplated by this Agreement

fees and expenses, (i) the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries
will not: (A) be insolvent (either because its financial condition is such
that the sum of its debts, including contingent and other liabilities, is

saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its
probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent and other
liabilities, as they mature); or (B) have incurred debts, or be expected to
incur debts, including contingent and other liabilities, beyond its ability

warranties are specifically disclaimed. Without limiting the foregoing, each
of Parent and Merger Sub further acknowledges and agrees that none of the
Company or any of its shareholders, directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates, advisors, agents or other Representatives has made any
representation or warranty concerning any estimates, projections, forecasts,
business plans or other forward-looking information regarding the Company, its
subsidiaries or their respective businesses and operations. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub hereby acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent
in attempting to develop such estimates, projections, forecasts, business
plans and other forward-looking information with which Parent and Merger Sub
are familiar, that Parent and Merger Sub are taking full responsibility for
making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates,
projections, forecasts, business plans and other forward-looking information
furnished to them (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
such estimates, projections, forecasts, business plans and other forward-
looking information), and that Parent and Merger Sub will have no claim
against the Company or any of its shareholders, directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents or other Representatives with respect
thereto.

outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary obligations under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ that any
such termination, amendment, modification, waiver or release shall not be to
permit or allow any such person to purchase securities of the Company; or (F)
resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.

(b) Response to Acquisition Proposals. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in _Section 5.02(a)_ or any other provision of this
Agreement, if at any time following the date hereof and prior to the receipt
of Shareholder Approval, (i) the Company has received after the date hereof
(or with respect to a Qualified Pre-Existing Bidder, prior to or after the
date hereof) a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal that has not been
solicited after the date hereof (except from a Qualified Pre-Existing Bidder
to the extent permitted by _Section 5.02(a)_) from a third party that did not

Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or
would reasonably be expected to constitute, result in, or lead to, a Superior
Proposal, then the Company may, subject to compliance with _Section 5.02(c)_,
upon a good faith determination by the Company Board (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law: (A) provide access to its properties,

Company shall promptly thereafter provide to Parent any material non-public
information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided to
any such person to the extent that such information was not previously
provided to Parent and (2) the Company shall provide, only pursuant to
customary "clean-room" or other appropriate procedures, such portions of
documents or information to the extent relating to any pricing or other
matters that are highly sensitive or competitive in nature, if the exchange of
such information (or portions thereof) would reasonably be likely to be
harmful to the operation of the Company in any material respect; and (B)
contact and engage in discussions or negotiations with the person making such
Acquisition Proposal or such persons Representatives.

 



37 (c) Notice to Parent of Acquisition Proposals. In addition to the obligations

within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent of the receipt of any Acquisition

terms of, but not the identity of the person making, any Acquisition
Proposal, and thereafter shall promptly keep Parent reasonably informed of a
summary of material developments affecting the terms and conditions of any
such Acquisition Proposal. 

(d) Prohibited Activities _._ Except as set forth in _Section 5.02(e)_,
neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall: (i) fail to make

Recommendation; (iii) adopt, approve, recommend, endorse or otherwise declare
advisable the adoption of any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Agreement
(other than those relating to the Merger); or (iv) resolve, agree or publicly
propose to take any such actions (each such foregoing action or failure to act

Recommendation_ ").

 

(e) Change in Company Board Recommendation. Notwithstanding any provision of
_Section 5.02(d)_, at any time prior to the receipt of Shareholder Approval,
the Company Board may, (A) in connection with an Intervening Event, if the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
obligations under applicable Law, make a Change in Company Board
Recommendation or (B) if the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal that was
not solicited after the date hereof (and that has not been withdrawn) and did
not otherwise result from a material breach of _Section 5.02(a)_ and that
the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel and its financial advisors) would, if consummated, constitute a
Superior Proposal, either (i) terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.01(f)_, provided that the Company shall pay to Parent any Company
Termination Fee required to be paid pursuant to _Section 8.03(b)_ in
connection with such termination or (ii) make a Change in Company Board
Recommendation, in each case of such clauses (A) and (B), if, and only if:

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent and Merger
Sub, of its or the Company Boards intention to take such action at least four
(4) Business Days (the " _Notice Period_ ") in advance of taking such action,
which notice shall (A) if made in connection with an Acquisition Proposal,
include a summary of the material terms of the Acquisition Proposal received
by the Company that in the good faith determination of the Company Board
would, if consummated, constitute a Superior Proposal, including a copy of the
most current version of the transaction agreements with, and the identity of,
the party making the Acquisition Proposal (it being understood and agreed
that any material change in the financial terms or any other material
amendment to the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal shall require
a new written notice by the Company to Parent in compliance with this clause
(i), provided that, in connection with such new notice, references to the four
(4) Business Day period above shall be deemed references to a three (3)
Business Day period) or, (B) if made in connection with an Intervening Event,
provide reasonable detail regarding such Intervening Event;

 



38 (ii) after providing such notice and prior to taking such action, the Company
shall have, and shall have caused its Representatives to, negotiate with
Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent wishes to
negotiate) during such applicable Notice Period to make such adjustments in
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Debt Financing such that
the Superior Proposal would cease to be a Superior Proposal or the Change in
Company Board Recommendation in response to the Intervening Event would no
longer be necessary, as applicable; and

 

(iii) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any changes to
this Agreement and the Debt Financing or other arrangements that may be
offered in writing by Parent by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the last
Business Day of such applicable Notice Period and shall have determined in
good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial
advisors, that the Acquisition Proposal received by the Company continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal, even if such changes offered in writing by
Parent were given effect, or that such Intervening Event continues to
necessitate a Change in Company Board Recommendation, as applicable.

(f) Standstills; Confidentiality Agreements. The Company shall enforce, and
shall not release or permit the release of any person from, or amend, waive,
terminate or modify, and shall not permit the amendment, waiver, termination
or modification of, any provision of, any confidentiality or similar agreement
or provision to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or
under which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any rights in each
case, unless the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that taking or failing to take such action,
as the case may be, would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ that any such termination, amendment,
modification, waiver or release shall not permit or allow any such person to
purchase securities of the Company. The Company shall not, and shall not
permit any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives to,
enter into any confidentiality agreement subsequent to the date hereof
that prohibits the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from providing to
Parent the information specifically required to be provided to Parent pursuant
to this _Section 5.02_.

 

(g) Communications With Shareholders. Nothing contained in this _Section
5.02_ shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its
shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to
shareholders in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or
exchange offer), (ii) making any disclosure to its shareholders as, in the
good faith determination of the Company Board, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, is required by applicable Laws, or (iii) making
any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to its shareholders pursuant to
Section 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communications to its shareholders) in which the Company indicates that it has
not changed the Company Board Recommendation, in each case, with respect to
an Acquisition Proposal or the transactions contemplated in this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ that in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above
(as to clause (ii), only if such disclosure specifically refers to any
Acquisition Proposal), any such disclosure shall be deemed to be a Change in
Company Board Recommendation unless such disclosure reaffirms the Company
Board Recommendation.

 



39 ARTICLE VI

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

Section 6.01 PREPARATION OF THE PROXY STATEMENT; SHAREHOLDERS MEETING.

(a) Preparation of Proxy Statement. As soon as practicable after the date
hereof (and in any event, within fifteen (15) Business Days hereof, assuming
the Company has received all required information from Parent), the Company
shall, with the assistance of Parent, prepare and shall cause to be filed with
the SEC in preliminary form a proxy statement relating to the Shareholders
Meeting (together with any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, the "
_Proxy Statement_ "). Except as expressly contemplated by _Section 5.02(e)_,
the Proxy Statement shall include the Company Board Recommendation with
respect to the Merger and the Fairness Opinion. Parent and the Company shall
cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Proxy Statement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub will
furnish to the Company the information relating to it required by the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set
forth in the Proxy Statement promptly following any request therefor from the
Company. The Company shall, assuming Parents compliance with its obligations
under  _Section 6.01(b)_, cause the Proxy Statement, at the date of mailing
to the Companys shareholders, to comply as to form in all material respects
with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder and to satisfy all rules of the NYSE. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company shall not file the Proxy Statement, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, without providing Parent, Merger Sub or their
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon (and such
comments shall be reasonably considered by the Company). The Company shall,
promptly (i) notify Parent of the receipt of any comments or inquiries
received by the Company from the SEC or the staff thereof related to the
Proxy Statement or any request for additional information, and (ii) provide
Parent with copies of all written correspondence between the Company and its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff thereof, on
the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall
provide Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel with copies of any written
comments or responses to be submitted by the Company in response to any
comments or inquiries from the SEC or the staff thereof and shall provide
Parent and Merger Sub and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the formulation of any written responses to any such written
comments of the SEC or its staff relating to the Proxy Statement. The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve, and each Party agrees to
consult and cooperate with the other Parties and use reasonable best efforts
in resolving, all SEC comments with respect to the Proxy Statement as promptly
as practicable after receipt thereof and to cause the Proxy Statement in
definitive form to be cleared by the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the filing thereof.

 

(b) Covenants of the Parties with Respect to the Proxy Statement. Each Party
will cause the information relating to such Party supplied by it for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement, at the time of the mailing of the Proxy
Statement or any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, and at the time of
the Shareholders Meeting, not to contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they

 



40  were made, not misleading; _provided_ , however, that (i) no representation
or warranty is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to information
supplied by or on behalf of the Company for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement and (ii) no representation or warranty is
made by the Company with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of
Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement.

(c) Mailing of Proxy Statement; Shareholders Meeting. The Company shall,
as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, in accordance
with applicable Law and the Company Charter Documents, (A) establish a record
date for and give notice of a meeting of its shareholders, for the purpose of
voting upon the approval of this Agreement and the related Plan of Merger and
the Merger (the " _Shareholders  Meeting_"), and (B) mail to the holders of
Company Common Stock as of the record date established for the
Shareholders Meeting a Proxy Statement (the date the Company elects to take
such action or is required to take such action, the " _Proxy Date_ "). The
Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law, the Company Charter
Documents, and NYSE rules, duly call, convene and hold the Shareholders
Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Proxy Date; _provided_
, _however_ , that in no event shall such meeting be held later than thirty-
five (35) calendar days following the date the Proxy Statement is mailed to
the Companys shareholders, subject to the Companys ability to postpone or
adjourn the Shareholders Meeting, provided that any postponements or
adjournments of such meeting shall require the prior written consent of
Parent, other than as required to allow reasonable additional time for the
filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Board
has determined in good faith after consultation with outside counsel is
necessary under applicable Law or fiduciary duty and for such supplemental or
amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Companys
shareholders prior to the Shareholders Meeting, or to allow reasonable
additional time to solicit additional proxies to the extent the Company
reasonably believes necessary in order to obtain the Shareholder Approval.
Once the Company has established a record date for the Shareholders Meeting,
the Company shall not change such record date or establish a different record
date for the Shareholders Meeting without the prior written consent of
Parent, unless required to do so by applicable Law or the Company Bylaws.
Unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to _Section 8.01_, the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies in favor of the
approval of this Agreement and to ensure that all proxies solicited in
connection with the Shareholders Meeting are solicited in compliance with
all applicable Laws and all rules of the NYSE. Unless this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with _Section 8.01_, the Company shall submit this
Agreement to its shareholders at the Shareholders Meeting even if the
Company Board shall have effected a Change in Company Board Recommendation or
proposed or announced any intention to do so. The Company shall, upon the
reasonable request of Parent, advise Parent at least on a daily basis on
each of the last three (3) Business Days prior to the date of the
Shareholders Meeting as to the aggregate tally of proxies received by the
Company with respect to the Shareholder Approval. Without the prior written
consent of Parent, the approval of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger) shall be the only matter which the
Company shall propose to be acted on by the shareholders of the Company at the
Shareholders Meeting, except as required by applicable Law or regulation.

(d) Amendments to Proxy Statement. If at any time prior to the Effective Time
any event or circumstance relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or its or their respective officers or directors should be discovered by the
Company which, pursuant to the Securities Act 

 



41  or the Exchange Act, should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to
the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly inform Parent. Each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company agree to use reasonable best efforts to correct
any material information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement which
shall have become false or misleading. Each of the Company and Parent shall
use reasonable best efforts to cause all documents that such party is
responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the Merger to comply as
to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act and, as applicable, not to contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

 

Section 6.02 ACCESS TO INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY. The Company shall afford
to Parent, and to Parents officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
consultants, financial advisors and other Representatives, reasonable access
consistent with applicable Law (including for the purpose of (i) coordinating
transition planning related to the matters contemplated in this Agreement and
(ii) if required for the Debt Financing or any Alternative Debt Financing,
conducting non-invasive and non-destructive evaluations and assessments of
the environmental conditions of the Owned Real Property and the Leased Real
Property of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the purpose of identifying
Releases of Hazardous Materials or any violations of Environmental Laws),
during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice to the Company
during the period from the date hereof until the Effective Time or the earlier
termination of this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 8.01_, to all of its and
its Subsidiaries properties, books, Contracts, commitments, personnel and
records as Parent may from time to time reasonably request, and during such
period, the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent (A) a copy of each
report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it during
such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities Laws
other than such documents publicly filed with or furnished to the SEC, and
(B) all other information concerning its and its Subsidiaries business,
properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request. Notwithstanding any
of the foregoing, any such investigation or consultation shall be conducted
in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or
operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise result in any
significant interference with the prompt and timely discharge by their
respective employees of their normal duties, and this _Section 6.02_ does
not authorize, and the Parties agree that there shall not be, any invasive or
destructive environmental testing or sampling of the Owned Real Property or
the Leased Real Property. If any of the information or material furnished
pursuant to this _Section 6.02_ includes material or information subject to
the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable
privilege concerning pending or threatened Legal Proceedings or governmental
investigations, each Party understands and agrees that the Parties have a
commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it is the desire,
intention and mutual understanding of the Parties that the sharing of such
material or information is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish
in any way the confidentiality of such material or information or its
continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine or other applicable privilege. All such information provided by the
Company that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to
such protection under these privileges, this Agreement and the joint defense
doctrine. The parties acknowledge that Parent and the Company have previously
executed a confidentiality agreement, dated as of April 17, 2013 (the 

 



42  " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which Confidentiality Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms (as such terms
may have been amended), except as expressly modified herein.

Section 6.03 BEST EFFORTS; APPROVALS; TRANSACTION LITIGATION.

anything contained herein to the contrary, neither the Company nor Parent or
Merger Sub shall be obligated to make any filings or seek any approvals from
any non-U.S. Governmental Authority under any Foreign Merger Control Laws
other than the Specified Foreign Merger Control Laws.

(b) In connection with the efforts referenced in _Section 6.03(a)_ to obtain

other person, make available the Representatives of such Party as may be
reasonably necessary for attendance by such Representatives in person at such
meetings and conferences, and to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or
such other applicable Governmental Authority or other person, give the other
Party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences in accordance with the HSR Act and each Specified Foreign Merger
Control Law.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in _Section 6.03(a)_ and _Section 6.03(b)_, if any objections are
asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby in connection
with any necessary consents, approvals, Orders, waivers and authorizations of
any Governmental Authority required pursuant to any Antitrust Law or if any
suit is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or
any other applicable Governmental Authority or any private party challenging
any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any Antitrust Law
or which would otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company shall take all such further action to, resolve any such
objections or suits so as to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including in order to resolve
such objections or suits which, in any case if not resolved, would reasonably
be expected to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation

permanent), including consent decrees, or taking any other action (i)

Parties sufficient prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted
by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend and/or participate
in such meeting. Subject to applicable Law, the Parties will consult and
cooperate with one another in connection with any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any Party relating to proceedings under Exon-
Florio. Without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent and the Company shall
take such actions and agree to such requirements or conditions to mitigate any
national security concerns as may be requested or required by CFIUS in
connection with, or as a condition of, the satisfaction of the
CFIUS Condition; provided, however, that

 



45  neither Parent nor the Company shall be required to agree to any term or
take any action in connection with the satisfaction of the CFIUS Condition (i)
that is not conditioned upon consummation of the Merger or (ii) would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect (provided that, for purposes of this _Section
6.03(e)_ only, clauses (iii) and (iv) in the definition of " _Company
Material Adverse Effect_ " shall be inapplicable).

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect
to the matters covered in this _Section 6.03_, Parent shall, after consulting
with the Company and considering the Companys views in good faith, take the
lead in communicating with any non-U.S. Governmental Authority and developing
strategy for responding to any investigation or other inquiry by any non-U.S.
Governmental Authority, and, subject to its obligations under _Section 6.03_,
shall make all final decisions with respect to any requests that may be made
by, or any actions, consents, undertakings, approvals, or waivers that may be
sought by or from, any non-U.S. Governmental Authority, including determining
the manner in which to contest or otherwise respond, by litigation or
otherwise, to objections to, or proceedings or other actions by any non-U.S.
Governmental Authority challenging, the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

(g) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall (i) use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain any approval or consent required from the other Party as a
result of the Merger to any material Company Lease reasonably requested by
Parent and (ii) assist and cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub in doing all
things necessary, proper or advisable to cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub
to resolve any objections raised by any U.S. Governmental Authority regarding
foreign ownership or use of any material Owned Real Property or material
Leased Real Property, including using its reasonable best efforts
to negotiate any restructuring of ownership or leasing arrangements of any
Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property, as applicable, prior to
completion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required
to agree to any term or take any action in connection with its obligations
pursuant to this _Section 6.03(g)_ that is not conditioned upon consummation
of the Merger.

(h) Prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01_, the Company shall promptly advise
Parent orally and in writing of any Transaction Litigation, shall keep Parent
reasonably informed regarding any such Transaction Litigation, shall consult
and cooperate reasonably with Parent in connection with, and permit Parent and
its Representatives to participate in, the defense, negotiation or settlement
of any Transaction Litigation, and shall give consideration to Parents advice
with respect to such Transaction Litigation.

(i) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or
cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its
part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of the NYSE to cause the
delisting of the Company and of the Company Common Stock from the NYSE as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time and the deregistration of
the Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable
after such delisting.

 



46 Section 6.04 STATE TAKEOVER LAWS. Assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in _Sections
4.09_ and _4.11_ , if any Takeover Law becomes or is deemed to be applicable
to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, this Agreement, the Merger, or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then the Company and the Company
Board, as applicable, shall take all action reasonably necessary to ensure
that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated herein and
therein and otherwise act to eliminate, or, if not possible, minimize to the
maximum extent possible, the effects of such Takeover Law on this Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Nothing
in this _Section 6.04_ shall be construed to permit Parent or Merger Sub to
do any act that would constitute a violation or breach of, or as a waiver of
any of the Companys rights under, any other provision of this Agreement or
the Plan of Merger. No Change in Company Board Recommendation shall change the
approval of the Company Board for purposes of causing any Takeover Law to be
inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 6.05 EMPLOYEE MATTERS.

(a) From the Effective Time until the date that is one (1) year following the
Effective Time, the Employees (other than Employees whose terms and conditions
of employment are governed by a Collective Bargaining Agreement, the terms and
conditions of which shall be respected by Parent and the Surviving
Corporation) who remain in the active employment of the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") shall receive (i) annual
rates of base salary or wages, as applicable, annual cash target bonus
opportunities (including commissions) and annual equity-based (or cash-
equivalent thereof) award opportunities, which, for the Companys 2014 fiscal
year, shall be deemed satisfied through the Companys grant of Company
Equity Awards pursuant to Section 5.01(a)(iii), that are in each case no less
favorable than those provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior
to the Effective Time under the applicable Company Benefit Plans; (ii)
severance benefits that are no less favorable that those maintained for such
Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time under the
applicable Company Benefit Plans and (iii) employee welfare and retirement
benefits (and the costs thereof) that, in the aggregate, are substantially
comparable to the employee welfare and retirement benefits (and the costs
thereof) provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries to such Continuing
Employees under the applicable Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to the
Closing.

(b) As of and after the Effective Time, with respect to any Company Benefit
Plans (or any successor plans thereof) and Foreign Benefit Plans (or any
successor plans thereof), Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation
to (i) continue to recognize each Continuing Employees service with the
Company, its Subsidiaries and their predecessor entities to the same extent
recognized by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time for all
purposes, (ii) not take any action that would impose new pre-existing
condition or eligibility limitations, or (for the plan year in which the
Closing Date occurs) reset any deductible or maximum out of pocket
limitations, in each case in respect of any Continuing Employee in connection
with their participation in any such plans and (iii) honor the terms of all
Company Benefit Plans and Foreign Benefit Plans subject to the amendment and
termination provisions thereof.

 



47 (c) The provisions of this _Section 6.05_ are for the sole benefit of the
Parties and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended or shall be
construed to confer upon or give to any person (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, any current or former employees, directors, or independent
contractors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Parent or any of its
Affiliates, or on or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or
any of its Subsidiaries), other than the Parties and their respective
permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or
remedies (with respect to the matters provided for in this _Section 6.05_)
under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement, including, without
limitation, any rights to continued employment with Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything
in this _Section 6.05_ to the contrary, nothing contained herein, whether
express or implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of
any Company Benefit Plan maintained by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or on or after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, or shall limit the
right of Parent to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Company Benefit
Plan or any employee benefit plan maintained by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries following the Effective Time. Nothing
contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Company shall take
no action that would have the effect of requiring, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to adopt or continue any specific employee benefit plans or to
continue the employment of any specific person.

 

(d) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company and its applicable
Subsidiaries shall provide any notice to Employees or their respective
Representatives, and/or satisfy any collective bargaining or works council
consulting obligations that are required, with respect to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, under applicable Law or
any Collective Bargaining Agreement or other similar agreement, in each case,
except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

(e) Within twenty (20) days of the date hereof, the Company shall make any
amendments to its Company Benefit Plans necessary to permit the treatment of
equity rights described in  _Section 2.04_.

Section 6.06 DIRECTOR AND OFFICER LIABILITY.

(a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, to the extent permitted by applicable Law or
the Company Charter Documents or Subsidiary Charter Documents, to: (i)
indemnify and hold harmless, against any costs or expenses (including
attorneys fees and expenses and disbursements), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any Legal
Proceeding (whether formal or informal), and provide advancement of expenses
to, all past and present directors and officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") (in all of their capacities); and
(ii) include and cause to be maintained in effect in the Companys or the
Surviving Corporations (or any successors), as the case may be, articles and
bylaws for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, provisions
regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of officers
and directors, and advancement of expenses to officers and directors that are
at least as favorable as those contained in the Company Charter Documents. If
the Company or the 

 



48  Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, or any of their respective
successors or assigns shall: (x) consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger; or (y) transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Company or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.06_.

 

(b) The Company shall, at or prior to the Effective Time, purchase a six (6)
year "tail" prepaid policy on the same terms and conditions as the existing
directors and officers liability (and fiduciary) insurance maintained by the
Company from insurance carriers with comparable credit ratings, covering,
without limitation, the Merger; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the cost of
such "tail" policy shall in no event exceed three hundred percent (300%) of
the amount of the last annual premium paid by the Company for such existing
directors and officers liability (and fiduciary) insurance. If, but for the
proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, the Surviving Corporation would
be required to expend more than three hundred percent (300%) of current annual
premiums, the Surviving Corporation will obtain the maximum amount of that
insurance obtainable by payment of annual premiums equal to three hundred
percent (300%) of current annual premiums.

(c) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section 6.06_ is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

(d) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and
legal representatives. The rights to indemnification and advancement and the
other rights provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any
other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to
law, contract or otherwise.

Section 6.07 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. The initial press release with respect to
the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to
be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Except as permitted in
accordance with _Section 6.02_, Parent and the Company shall consult with
each other before issuing, and, to the extent practicable, give each other the
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other
public statements (including any filings with the SEC) with respect to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and shall consider in
good faith the views of the other Party, and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation,
except as may be required by applicable Law (or, in the case of the Company,
by the Companys fiduciary duties as reasonably determined by the Company),
court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any applicable securities exchange or trading market, in which case
the Party required to make the release or announcement shall use reasonable
best efforts to allow the other Party or Parties reasonable time to comment
on such release or announcement in

 



49  advance of such issuance (it being understood that the final determination
of the disclosure requirements under applicable Law shall be made by the
disclosing party after consultation with its outside legal counsel).

Section 6.08 FINANCING.

 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take all actions and to do all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions
(including the flex provisions) set forth in the Financing Agreements and any
related Fee Letter, including using reasonable best efforts to seek to enforce
its rights under the Debt Commitment Letters in the event of a material
breach thereof by the Financing Sources thereunder, and shall not agree to any
amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or
remedy, under the Debt Financing without the prior written consent of the
Company if such amendments, modifications or waivers could or could reasonably
be expected to (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing below the
amount required to consummate the Merger and repay or refinance the debt
contemplated in this Agreement or the Debt Financing, (ii) impose new or
additional conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing, (iii) prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (iv) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to
enforce their rights against the other parties to the Debt Financing. For
purposes of clarification, the foregoing shall not prohibit Parent
from amending the Debt Commitment Letters and any related Fee Letter solely
to add additional lender(s), lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents
or similar entities (and Affiliates of such additional lender(s), lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities) as a party
thereto. Any reference in this Agreement to (x) " _Debt Financing_ " shall
include the financing contemplated by the Financing Agreements as amended or
modified in compliance with this _Section 6.08(a)_ and (y) " _Financing
Agreements_ " or " _Debt Commitment Letters_ " shall include such documents as
amended or modified in compliance with this _Section 6.08(a)_.

 

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take all actions and to do all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions set forth
in the Financing Agreements, including using reasonable best efforts (i) to
maintain in effect the Financing Agreements in accordance with the terms
and subject to the conditions thereof, (ii) to satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions and covenants applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in the Debt
Commitment Letters, (iii) to negotiate and enter into all definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions)
contained in the Debt Commitment Letters and any related Fee Letter, (iv) to
satisfy all conditions to such definitive agreements that are applicable to
Parent and Merger Sub, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions precedent
thereto, and consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing
including using its reasonable best efforts to cause the Lenders and the
other persons committing to fund the Debt Financing, and (v) to comply with
its obligations under the Financing Agreements. For the avoidance of doubt,
Parent shall be responsible for timely provision of any post- Closing pro
forma cost savings, synergies, capitalization, ownership or other pro forma
adjustments desired to be incorporated into any pro forma financial
information to be delivered by the Company pursuant to _Section 6.09_. Parent
shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis and
in reasonable detail of the status of its

 



50  efforts to arrange the Debt Financing. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall give the Company prompt written
notice: (x) of any default or breach (or any event that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to
any default or breach) by any party to any Financing Agreement or definitive
document related to the Debt Financing of which Parent or its Subsidiaries
becomes aware; (y) of the receipt of any written notice or other communication
from any person with respect to any (A) actual or potential default, breach,
termination or repudiation by any party to any Financing Agreement or any
definitive document related to the Debt Financing of any provisions of the
Financing Agreements or any definitive document related to the Debt Financing
or (B) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any
Financing Agreement or any definitive document related to the Debt Financing;
and (z) if for any reason Parent or Merger Sub has determined in good faith
that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing on
the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Financing
Agreements. As soon as reasonably practicable after the date the Company
delivers Parent or Merger Sub a written request, Parent and Merger Sub shall
provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any
circumstance referred to in clause (x), (y) or (z) of the immediately
preceding sentence.

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, if any portion of
the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including
the flex provisions) contemplated in one or more of the Financing Agreements,
Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the occurrence of such event alternative
financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on terms and conditions that are
not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent and Merger Sub than
those contained in such Financing Agreements (including flex provisions
therein) and that do not, in any case, involve any conditions to funding the
financing that are not contained in the Debt Commitment Letters and would not
reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the financing or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and in an amount at least equal to the Debt Financing or such
unavailable portion thereof, as the case may be (the " _Alternate Debt
Financing_ "), and to obtain a new financing commitment letter with respect
to such Alternate Debt Financing (the " _New Debt Commitment Letter_ ") which
shall replace the existing Debt Commitment Letter, a true, complete and
correct copy of which (together with any related Fee Letter) shall be
promptly provided (with only the fee amounts and certain economic terms of the
market flex (none of which would adversely affect the amount or availability
of the Alternative Debt Financing) redacted) to the Company;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be required to execute
any New Debt Commitment Letter or arrange for such Alternate Debt Financing on
terms and conditions (including flex provisions) which are materially less
favorable (unless otherwise determined by Parent in its sole discretion), in
the aggregate, to Parent and Merger Sub than those included in the Debt
Commitment Letters that such New Debt Commitment Letter is replacing. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, in the event that (x) all
or any portion of the Debt Financing structured as high yield financing has
not been consummated, (y) all closing conditions contained in _Article VII_
have been satisfied or waived (other than those contained in _Section
7.02(d)_ and _Section 7.03(c)_) and (z) any bridge financing, to be utilized
in the event the placement of high yield securities in a comparable amount is
not consummated, described in or contemplated by the Debt Financing (or
Alternative Debt Financing obtained in accordance with

 



51  this _Section 6.08(c)_) is available on terms and conditions described in
or contemplated by the Debt Financing (or replacements thereof in accordance
with this  _Section 6.08(c)_), then Parent shall consummate, or cause to be
consummated, and shall use, or cause to be used, the proceeds of such bridge
financing (or such Alternative Debt Financing) to replace such high yield
financing. In the event any New Debt Commitment Letter is obtained, (i) any
reference in this Agreement to the " _Debt Financing_ " shall mean the debt
financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters as modified pursuant to
clause (ii) below, (ii) any reference in this Agreement to the " _Financing
Agreements_ " or the " _Debt Commitment Letters_ " shall be deemed to include
the Debt Commitment Letters that are not superseded by a New Debt Commitment
Letter at the time in question and the New Debt Commitment Letters to the
extent then in effect, and (iii) any reference in this Agreement to a " _Fee
Letter_ " shall be deemed to include any fee letter relating to the Debt
Commitment Letters that are not superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter at
the time in question and the New Debt Commitment Letters to the extent then in
effect. Without first obtaining the Companys prior written consent (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Parent shall not
directly or indirectly take any action that would or would be reasonably
expected to result in the Debt Financing not being available.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this _Section 6.08_ shall require, and in no event
shall the reasonable best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or
construed to require, either Parent or Merger Sub to pay any material fees in
excess of those contemplated by the Financing Agreements (whether to
secure waiver of any conditions contained therein or otherwise).

Section 6.09 FINANCING COOPERATION.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its Representatives and each of its Subsidiaries to, provide to Parent such

requested by Parent to assist Parent in causing the conditions in the Debt
Commitment Letters to be satisfied and such cooperation as is otherwise
necessary and reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt
Financing, the Revolver/Securitization Amendments and/or the Debt Payoff (for

6.09_ shall include the issuance of the Opco Notes (as defined in the Debt
Commitment Letter with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc.)), which

55 Section 6.10 CHANGE OF CONTROL OFFER; CREDIT FACILITIES.

(a) Change of Control Offer. At the option of Parent, either (i) Parent or
(ii) the Company, as soon as reasonably practicable after the receipt of any
written request by Parent to do so, shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to commence a Change of Control Offer (as defined in the
indenture governing the 2022 Notes) to purchase any or all of the outstanding
aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes at a purchase price of 101% plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase pursuant to
Section 3.09(i) of the indenture governing the 2022 Notes (the " _Change of
Control Offer_ ") and the Party commencing such Change of Control Offer shall
reasonably assist the other Party in connection therewith; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Companys counsel shall concurrently with the Closing
provide such legal opinions as may be reasonably requested by Parent that are
customary or necessary in connection with the Change of Control Offer;
_provided_ _further_ , that the Party conducting the Change of Control Offer
shall do so in compliance with the indenture governing the 2022 Notes and the
rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange
Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the closing of the Change of Control Offer
shall be conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing, and the parties shall
use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Change of
Control Offer to close on the Closing Date. Subject to the preceding
sentence, the Company shall provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and
shall direct their respective Representatives to, provide all cooperation
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Change of Control
Offer, including using commercially reasonable efforts in assisting with the
preparation of the offer to purchase and letter of transmittal. The Company
(i) shall make any change to the Change of Control Offer, in each case, as
may be reasonably requested by Parent, and (ii) shall not, without the written
consent of Parent, make any material changes to the Change of Control Offer.
The Party conducting the Change of Control Offer agrees to provide the other
Parties and their counsel reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Change of Control Offer documents prior to the distribution thereof to the
holders of the 2022 Notes, and such Party shall give reasonable
consideration to any comments made by the other Parties and their counsel.
Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Change of Control Offer documents if
and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading
in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law. The Party
conducting the Change of Control Offer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to take all steps necessary to cause the Change of Control Offer
documents, as so corrected, to be disseminated to the holders of the 2022
Notes, as and to the extent required by applicable Law. Parent shall ensure
that at the Effective Time the Surviving Corporation has all funds necessary
to pay for such 2022 Notes that have been properly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 6.10_, the Company shall not be obligated
to consummate the Change of Control Offer unless the Merger has occurred or
is occurring concurrently with the consummation of the Change of Control Offer
and sufficient funds are available from the Debt Financing or from Parent to
pay all consideration for the purchase of the 2022 Notes.

(b) Agents. The depositary, paying agent and any other agents retained in
connection with the Change of Control Offer shall be selected by Parent and
shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company. The Company may enter into
customary agreements with such parties on terms and conditions reasonably
acceptable to Parent.

 



56 (c) Credit Facilities. On or prior to the third (3rd) Business Day prior to
the Closing, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
arrange for the delivery to Parent of copies of payoff letters in customary
form and substance, from the administrative agent or other similar agents
under any of the Existing Refinancing Debt Documents and the Securitization
Facility, and for the release, effective upon and conditioned upon the
Closing, of all Liens and other security over the Companys and its
Subsidiaries properties and assets securing its obligations under the
Existing Refinancing Debt Documents or the Securitization Facility, as
applicable, together with the return of any collateral in the possession of
the applicable administrative agent or similar agent, at or as soon
as practicable following the Closing. Parent shall ensure that at the
Effective Time the Surviving Corporation has all funds necessary to pay the
amounts contemplated by such payoff letters (unless such facilities are to
remain outstanding with the consent, where needed, of the counterparties to
the Existing Refinancing Debt Documents and the Securitization Facility).

(d) Reimbursement of Costs. Parent (i) shall promptly, upon request by the
Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out of pocket
costs (including reasonable attorneys fees and costs) incurred by the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives in
connection with the actions of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and
the Company Representatives contemplated by this _Section 7.10_, and (ii)
acknowledges and agrees that the Company, its Subsidiaries or their
respective Representatives shall not incur any liability to any person prior
to the Effective Time with respect to any Change of Control Offer contemplated
by this _Section 7.10_. 

Section 6.11 SECTION 16 MATTERS. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all reasonable steps as may be required to cause any dispositions
of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) in connection
with this Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the
Company subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

Section 6.12 ESCROW FOR PARENT TERMINATION FEE. As of the date hereof, Parent
has deposited, or has caused to be deposited, an amount of cash equal to the
Parent Termination Fee with Bank of China, New York Branch, as escrow agent
(" _Escrow Agent_ "), as collateral and security for the payment of the Parent
Termination Fee, which amount shall be held by Escrow Agent until the earlier
of (a) the Effective Time, at which time the escrowed funds will be released
to Parent, and (b) the date on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 8.01_, at which time, the escrowed funds will be released (i) to the
Company, in accordance with _Section 8.03(d)_ or _Section 8.03(e)_, as
applicable, or (ii) to Parent if not otherwise released to the Company in
accordance with the foregoing clause (i).

 

Section 6.13 OBLIGATIONS OF MERGER SUB. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their
respective obligations under this Agreement, the Debt Financing and any
Alternative Debt Financing.

 



57 Section 6.14 NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN MATTERS. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a)
any notice or other communication received by such Party from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby or from any person alleging that the consent of such
person is or may be required in connection with the Merger, if the subject
matter of such communication or the failure of such Party to obtain such
consent would reasonably be expected to be material to the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent and (b) any actions commenced or, to such
Partys Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting such Party or any of its subsidiaries which relate to the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.14_ shall not (i)
cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any other provision of this
Agreement or (ii) limit the remedies available to the Party receiving such
notice. The Parties agree and acknowledge that the Companys, on the one hand,
and Parents on the other hand, compliance or failure of compliance with this
_Section 6.14_ shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining
whether the condition referred to in _Section 7.02(b)_ or _Section
7.03(b)_, respectively, shall have been satisfied.

(b) by either Parent or the Company if:

(i) the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before November 29, 2013
(the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.01(b)(i)_ shall not be available
to any Party if the failure of the Effective Time to occur on or before the
Outside Date is caused by a failure of such party to perform any of its

Time to occur on or before the Outside Date and such action or failure to
perform constitutes a breach in a material respect of this Agreement;

Order that is enforced in a U.S. court of competent jurisdiction having the
effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
consummation of the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 8.01(b)(ii)_ shall not

its obligations or covenants under this Agreement; and _provided_ _further_ ,

terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, each of which is
capable of being satisfied at the Closing) and (ii) is not capable of being
cured prior to the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall

Parents or Merger Subs representations or warranties set forth in this
Agreement or (ii) Parent or Merger

satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, each of which is capable of being
satisfied at the Closing) to be satisfied and (y) is not capable of being

pursuant to this _Section 8.01(e)_ if the Shareholder Approval shall have
been obtained;

 

(f) by the Company, subject to compliance with _Section 5.02(e)_, in order to
accept a Superior Proposal and enter into an Acquisition Agreement providing
for such Superior Proposal immediately following or concurrently with such
termination; _provided_ , _however_ , that payment of the Tier I Company
Termination Fee or the Tier II Company Termination Fee, as applicable,
pursuant to _Section 8.03(b)_ shall be a condition to the termination of this
Agreement by the Company pursuant to this _Section 8.01(f)_;

(g) by the Company, if (i) all of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.01_
and _Section 7.02_ have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by

62 Section 8.03 TERMINATION FEES AND EXPENSES.

(a) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by Parent pursuant to _Section

Termination Fee.

 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.01(f)_, to accept a Superior Proposal, (i) on or before the Pre-Existing
Bid End Date, from any Qualified Pre-Existing Bidder, then the Company shall
pay Parent the Tier II Company Termination Fee or (ii) (A) on or after the
date hereof, from any person (other than a Qualified Pre-Existing Bidder) or

case by wire transfer of same-day funds, concurrently with, and as a
condition to the effectiveness of, such termination.

(c) If (i) this Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent or the Company pursuant
to _Section 8.01(b)(i)_ or _Section 8.01(b)(iii)_ or (B) by Parent pursuant
to _Section 8.01(c)_, and (ii) (A) at any time after the date hereof and

Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement with respect to any

such termination, any Acquisition Proposal shall have been consummated (in
each case, whether or not such Acquisition Proposal is the same as the
original Acquisition Proposal made, communicated, publicly made known or
publicly announced), then, in any such event, the Company shall pay to Parent
the Tier I Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-day funds within
two (2) Business Days following the date the Company consummates such
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that for purposes of this clause (B) the

was entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(e)_, or
(iv) by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.01(f)_) and a Willful Breach by
Parent or Merger Sub is the primary cause of the failure of the Closing to
occur, then Parent shall pay to the Company the Parent Termination Fee by
wire transfer of same-day funds within two (2) Business Days following the
date of such termination.

 



63 (e) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by Parent or the Company pursuant to 
_Section 8.01(b)(ii)_ and the primary cause therefor is a final and non-
appealable Order relating to Antitrust Law, (ii) by Parent or the Company

failure of any Regulatory Condition (other than the CFIUS Condition) to be
satisfied or (iii) by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)_ and the
primary cause therefor or result thereof is the failure of any Regulatory
Condition (other than the CFIUS Condition) to be satisfied, then, in each

transfer of same-day funds within two (2) Business Days following the date of
such termination; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in the case of each of
clauses (ii) and (iii) above, Parent shall not be obligated to pay the Parent
Termination Fee if (A) Parent has waived any unsatisfied Regulatory Condition
(other than U.S. Antitrust Laws) and (B) the Company has declined to waive
such Regulatory Condition (other than U.S. Antitrust Laws) after receiving
Parents request for such waiver; and _provided_ _further_ , that, in the case
of each of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above, it shall not be a defense to a
finding of "primary cause" that there may be another cause for termination
arising from circumstances that would also give rise to the payment of a
Parent Termination Fee. 

(f) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.01(g)_, then Parent shall pay to the Company the Parent Termination Fee by
wire transfer of same-day funds within two (2) Business Days following the
date of such termination.

(g) Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges and agrees that the agreements
contained in this _Section 8.03_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, neither
the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement; accordingly, if
the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails promptly to pay the fee due
pursuant to this _Section 8.03_, and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent or the Company makes a claim against the other party that results in a
judgment against such other party, the Company or Parent, as the case may be,
shall pay to the other party its costs and expenses (including attorneys
fees and expenses) in connection with such claim, together with interest on
the amount of the applicable fee from the date such payment was required to be
made until the date of payment at the prime lending rate as published in 
_The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to
be made.

(h) The Parties agree that in no event shall (i) the Company be required to
pay the Tier I Company Termination Fee or Tier II Company Termination Fee on
more than one occasion or (ii) Parent be required to pay the Parent
Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Each of the Parties hereto
acknowledges that neither the Tier I Company Termination Fee, Tier II Company
Termination Fee nor the Parent Termination Fee is a penalty, but rather are
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and the
Company, respectively, in the circumstances in which such fee is due and
payable and which do not involve Willful Breach, for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
except in the case of fraud or Willful Breach by Parent or Merger Sub, in any
circumstance in which the Company receives payment of the Parent Termination
Fee pursuant to _Section 8.03(e)_ or _Section 8.03(f)_ ,

 



64  the Parent Termination Fee shall, subject to _Section 8.02_ and _Section
10.10_ , constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any Company Related Party against Parent, Merger Sub and any
Parent Related Party for all losses and damages suffered as a result of the
failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated
or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise arising out of,
or directly or indirectly relating to, this Agreement, the Financing
Agreements, the negotiation, execution or performance hereof or thereof or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and upon payment of such amount,
none of Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent Related Party shall have any further
liability or obligation to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Company
Related Party relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the
Financing Agreements, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or in
respect of any other document, theory of law or equity or oral representations
made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, in contract,
in tort or otherwise. Except as expressly provided in the immediately
preceding sentence, following the payment of the Parent Termination Fee (A)

Section 10.09 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that
any controversy which may arise under this Agreement is likely to involve
complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each such Party hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such Party may have to a
trial by jury in any Legal Proceeding directly or indirectly based upon,
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated
hereby (including the Financing Agreements) or the negotiation, execution or
performance hereof or thereof. Each Party certifies and acknowledges that (a)
no Representative, agent or attorney of any other Party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other Party would not, in the
event of any Legal Proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver, (b) each
Party understands and has considered the implication of this waiver, (c) each
Party makes this waiver voluntarily, and (d) each Party has been induced to
enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and
certifications in this section.

Section 10.10 SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE; REMEDIES.

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable injury for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the Parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate
this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach
such provisions. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the
Parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof and
thereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or
in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that, subject to _Section 10.10(b)_, it
will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that any other Party has an adequate remedy at
law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for
any reason at law or in equity. Any Party seeking an injunction to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in any court having jurisdiction related to this
Agreement as

 



86  provided in _Section 10.08_ may seek such an injunction without the
necessity of demonstrating damages or posting a bond or other security in
connection with any such Order. To the extent any Party brings an action,
suit or proceeding to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement (other than an action to specifically enforce any
provision that expressly survives termination of this Agreement) when
expressly available to such party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the
Outside Date shall automatically be extended to the later of (x) the twentieth
(20th) Business Day following the resolution of such action, suit or
proceeding or (y) such other time period established by the court presiding
over such action, suit or proceeding (it being understood that this _Section
10.10(a)_ shall not be deemed to alter, amend, supplement or otherwise modify
the terms of any Debt Financing (including the expiration or termination
provisions thereof). Subject to _Section 10.10(b)_, each of Parent and Merger
Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, hereby agrees not to
raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, or the Company, as applicable, and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of Parent or Merger Sub, or the Company, as
applicable, under this Agreement.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the right of the Company to obtain an injunction, or other
appropriate form of specific performance or equitable relief described in
_Section 10.10(a)_, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the Company shall
not be entitled to enforce specifically the obligations of Parent or Merger
Sub to consummate the Merger unless (i) all of the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.01_ and _Section 7.02_ (other than any condition that by its
nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but that is expected to be
satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied or waived, (ii) the full
proceeds to be provided to Parent or Merger Sub by the Debt Financing shall be
available to Parent or Merger Sub to complete the Merger.

Section 10.11 SEVERABILITY. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 



87 Section 10.12 COUNTERPARTS; FACSIMILE AND ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES. This
Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be
considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one
or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to
the other Parties. This Agreement or any counterpart may be executed and
delivered by facsimile copies or delivered by electronic communications by
portable document format (.pdf), each of which shall be deemed an original.
