v AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION



AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION, dated as of November 7, 2004, among
DIMON Incorporated, a Virginia corporation (" _DIMON_ "), and Standard
Commercial Corporation, a North Carolina corporation (the " _Company_ ").
DIMON and the Company are hereinafter sometimes collectively referred to as
the " _Constituent Corporations_." Capitalized terms not otherwise defined
herein are used as defined in Article 10 hereof.



WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of DIMON and the Company have approved and
deem it in the best interests of their respective shareholders to
consummate the merger of the Company with and into DIMON upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein (the " _Merger_ ") pursuant to
which each outstanding share of common stock, $0.20 par value per share, of
the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), will be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration (as hereinafter defined), upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;



WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the
Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "); and



WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
DIMON has entered into an agreement (the " _Company Shareholders Agreement_
") with certain shareholders of the Company listed on _Exhibit 6_ hereto
pursuant to which such shareholders agreed to vote the shares of Company
Common Stock owned by them in favor of the Merger.



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants,
representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to
be legally bound hereby, DIMON and the Company agree as follows:



ARTICLE 1



THE TRANSACTIONS



1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement and the Articles of Merger and in accordance with the VSCA and the
NCBCA, at the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined), the Company shall be
merged with and into DIMON, and DIMON shall be the surviving corporation in
the Merger (in such capacity, the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").



1.2. _Effective Time; Filing of Articles of Merger_. The Merger shall be
effected by the filing at the time of the Closing (as hereinafter defined) of
properly executed articles of merger, including a plan of merger and amended
and restated articles of incorporation attached thereto, substantially in the
form attached as _Exhibit 1_ hereto (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") with the
State Corporation Commission of Virginia (the " _SCC_ ") and with the
Secretary of State of the State of North Carolina (the " _NCSOS_ ") in
accordance with the provisions of the VSCA and NCBCA, respectively. The
Merger shall become effective at the time specified in the Articles of Merger
(the " _Effective Time_ ").

 1.3. _Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the amended and
restated articles of incorporation attached to the Articles of Merger shall
be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with its terms and the VSCA.



1.4. _By-Laws_. At the Effective Time, the by-laws of DIMON, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with its terms and the
VSCA.



1.5. _Directors and Officers_. The directors and officers of DIMON immediately
following the Effective Time shall be as set forth in Section 5.14 and each
such director and officer shall hold office in accordance with the articles of
incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until his or her
successor is duly appointed and qualified.



1.6. _Additional Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that consistent with the
terms of this Agreement any further assignments or any other acts are
necessary or desirable (i) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or
otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation, title to and possession of any
property or right of the Company acquired or to be acquired by reason of, or
as a result of, the Merger, or (ii) otherwise to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement, then, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the Company and its officers and directors shall be deemed to have granted to
the Surviving Corporation an irrevocable power of attorney to execute and
deliver all such documents and to do all acts necessary or proper to vest,
perfect or confirm title to and possession of such property or rights in the
Surviving Corporation and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement; and the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are
fully authorized in the name of the Company to take any and all such action.



1.7. _Time and Place of Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_
") shall take place (a) at the offices of Hunton and Williams LLP, Riverfront
Plaza, East Tower, 951 East Byrd Street, Richmond, Virginia 23219 as soon as
practicable and no later than the second business day following satisfaction
or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in Article 6, or (b) at such
other place, at such other time or on such other date as DIMON and the Company
may mutually agree (the date of the Closing is hereinafter sometimes referred
to as the " _Closing Date_ ").



1.8. _Effect of Merger on Capital Stock_.

 



(a) At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holder of any capital stock of the Company, each share of
Company Common Stock, issued and outstanding at the Effective Time (other than
Excluded Shares) shall, subject to and in accordance with _Section 1.9_
hereof, be converted into, and become exchangeable for 3.0 shares of common
stock, without par value, of DIMON, including the attached Common Stock
purchase rights issued pursuant to the DIMON Rights Plan (as defined herein)
(" _DIMON Common Stock_ ") (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").



(b) _Excluded Shares_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding as of the Effective Time that is owned by the Company (but not
including shares  



 

2  owned by a Subsidiary of the Company) or by DIMON (the " _Excluded Shares_
") shall be cancelled, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.



(c) _Effect of Merger_ _on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, all Company
Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ")
representing any of such Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares)
shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
and the right, if any, to receive cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant
to Section 1.9(e) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to
Section 1.9(c).



1.9. _Exchange Procedures_.



(a) As of the Effective Time, DIMON shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with an exchange agent selected by DIMON, with the Companys prior
approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld (the " _Exchange Agent_ "),
for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock, certificates
representing the shares of DIMON Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section
1.8 and any cash, dividends or other distributions with respect to the DIMON
Common Stock to be issued or paid pursuant to Section 1.9(c) (such cash and
certificates for shares of DIMON Common Stock, together with the amount of any
dividends or other distributions payable with respect thereto, being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").



(b) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger
Consideration together with any other cash, dividends or distributions in
respect thereof, may be issued and/or paid to such a transferee if the
Certificate formerly representing such Company Common Stock is presented to
the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer
taxes have been paid. If any certificate for shares of DIMON Common Stock is
to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in
exchange therefore is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange
that the Person (as defined herein) requesting such exchange shall pay any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of certificates for
shares of DIMON Common Stock in a name other than that of the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction
of DIMON or the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable.



(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares; Voting_.



(i) All shares of DIMON Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall
be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and whenever a
dividend or other distribution is declared by DIMON in respect of the DIMON
Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time,
that declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of
all shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement, provided that no dividends or
other distributions declared or made in respect of the DIMON Common Stock
after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of DIMON Common Stock represented
thereby until the  



 

3  holder of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate in accordance
with this Section 1.9. Thereafter, subject to the effect of applicable
laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be issued
and/or paid to the holder of the certificates representing whole shares of
DIMON Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (A) at the
time of such surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole
shares of DIMON Common Stock and not paid and (B) at the appropriate payment
date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such whole
shares of DIMON Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but
with a payment date subsequent to surrender.



(ii) Holders of unsurrendered Certificates representing Merger Consideration
shall be entitled to vote after the Effective Time at any meeting of DIMON
shareholders the number of whole shares of DIMON Common Stock represented by
such Certificates, regardless of whether such holders have exchanged their
Certificates.



(d) _Transfers_. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common
Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they
shall be canceled and (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and
similar laws) exchanged for the Merger Consideration (and cash in lieu of
fractional interests in accordance with Section 1.9(e) and any dividends or
other distributions pursuant to Section 1.9(c)) without any interest thereon,
as provided in this Section 1.9.



(e) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no fractional shares of DIMON Common Stock will be issued in the
Merger and any holder of Company Common Stock entitled to receive a fractional
share of DIMON Common Stock but for this Section 1.9(e) shall be entitled to
receive a cash payment in lieu thereof, which payment shall equal the
product of (i) such holders proportionate interest in a share of DIMON
Common Stock, and (ii) the average of the per share last sales prices, regular
way, of DIMON Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc.
composite transactions reporting system (as reported in the New York City
edition of The Wall Street Journal or, if not reported thereby, another
authoritative source) for the twenty (20) consecutive trading days ending on
(and including) the second trading day prior to the Closing.



(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof and any DIMON Common Stock)
that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of the Company for 180 days after
the Effective Time shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation. Any
shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this
Section 1.9 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of the Merger Consideration and any cash, dividends and
other distributions in respect thereof payable and/or issuable pursuant to
Section 1.8 and Section 1.9 upon due surrender of their Certificates (or
affidavits of loss and indemnification in lieu thereof), in each case, without
any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of DIMON, the  



 

4  Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be
liable to any former holder of Company Common Stock for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws.



(g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by DIMON, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen, or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration and
any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares and any unpaid dividends or
other distributions in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate pursuant to this Agreement.



(h) _Affiliates_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Certificates surrendered for exchange into Merger Consideration by any
"affiliate" (as determined pursuant to Section 5.8) of the Company shall not
be exchanged until DIMON has received a written agreement from such Person as
provided in Section 5.8 hereof.



(i) _Withholding_. The Exchange Agent or the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock such amounts
as the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be,
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under the
Code or any provisions of state, local or foreign tax law. Any amounts so
withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the Company Common Stock in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.



1.10. _Company Stock Options_.



(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of the Company or the holder thereof, each unexpired and
unexercised option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Company
Stock Option_ ") outstanding under the Company Stock Plans (as hereinafter
defined) or otherwise granted by the Company outside of any Company Stock
Plan, will be assumed by DIMON as hereinafter provided. To the extent that the
"vesting" or exercisability (or acceleration of "vesting" or exercisability)
of any Company Stock Option is permitted in connection with the Merger but
not required by the applicable governing instruments, then the Company shall
take all reasonable action within its control to cause such exercisability or
acceleration not to occur and shall otherwise cause the Company Stock Options
to be converted into DIMON Stock Options as provided herein (but, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall not be required to make any amendment to such
governing instrument that would require the consent of the holder of such
instrument or the approval of the Companys shareholders). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company may take action to amend the terms of the Company
Stock Plans or Company Stock Options to provide that vesting or exercisability
of Company Stock Options held by any individual shall occur if, within two
years after the Effective Time, such individuals employment or service with
the Surviving Corporation is terminated by the Surviving Corporation other
than for cause or such individual resigns for good reason (as defined below).
At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action
on the part of the Company or the holder thereof, each Company  



 

5  Stock Option will be automatically converted into an option (the " _DIMON
Stock Option_ ") to purchase the Merger Consideration at a price equal to the
exercise price specified in such Company Stock Option as adjusted for the
Merger. Such DIMON Stock Option shall otherwise be subject to the same terms
and conditions as such Company Stock Option. At the Effective Time, (i) all
references to the Company in the Company Stock Plans, the applicable stock
option or other awards agreements issued thereunder and in any other Company
Stock Options shall be deemed to refer to DIMON; and (ii) DIMON shall assume
the Company Stock Plans and all of the Companys obligations with respect to
the Company Stock Options.



(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of the Company or the holder thereof, each unvested
restricted stock award, restricted stock unit, stock appreciation right or
performance share award of the Company (" _Company Equity Based Award_ ")
shall be assumed by DIMON and shall be automatically converted into the Merger
Consideration and otherwise subject to the same terms and conditions as
the related Company Equity Based Award. To the extent that acceleration of
vesting of any Company Equity Based Award is permitted in connection with the
Merger but not required by the applicable governing instruments, then the
Company shall take all reasonable action within its control to cause such
acceleration not to occur and shall otherwise cause the Company Equity Based
Award to be converted into the Merger Consideration as provided herein (but,
for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be required to make any amendment to
such governing instrument that would require the consent of the holder of such
instrument or the approval of the Companys shareholders). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company may take action to amend the terms of the Company
Stock Plans or Company Equity Based Award to provide that vesting or
exercisability of Company Equity Based Awards held by any individual shall
occur if, within two years after the Effective Time, such
individuals employment or service with the Surviving Corporation is
terminated by the Surviving Corporation other than for cause or such
individual resigns for good reason (as defined below).



(c) In respect of each Company Stock Option as converted into a DIMON Stock
Option pursuant to Section 1.10(a) and assumed by DIMON, and the shares of
DIMON Common Stock underlying such option, DIMON shall file as soon as
practicable after the Effective Time with the SEC, and keep current the
effectiveness of, a registration statement on Form S-8 (which may be
accomplished by amendment of the registration statement on Form S-4) or other
appropriate form for as long as such options or equity based awards remain
outstanding (and maintain the current status of the prospectus with
respect thereto). DIMON agrees to reserve a number of shares of DIMON Common
Stock equal to the number of shares of DIMON Common Stock issuable upon the
exercise of such Company Stock Options.



(d) Except as disclosed in Section 1.10(d) of the Company Schedule of
Exceptions, the Company agrees that, prior to the Effective Time or earlier
termination hereof in accordance with Article 8 hereof, it will not grant any
stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation
rights, limited stock appreciation rights, performance shares or awards or
any other similar awards or instruments and will not permit cash payments to
holders of Company Stock Options or Company Equity-Based Awards in lieu of the
assumption thereof by DIMON, as described in this Section 1.10. Except
as disclosed in Section 1.10(d) of the DIMON Schedule of Exceptions, DIMON
agrees that, prior to the Effective Time or earlier termination in accordance
with Article 8 hereof, it will not grant any stock options, restricted  



 

6  stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, limited stock
appreciation rights, performance shares or awards or any other similar awards
or instruments.



(e) As used in this Section 1.10, "good reason" shall mean (i) the assignment
to the individual of any duties that are inconsistent with his or her position
with the Company as of the Effective Time, or (ii) a decrease in the
individuals annual base salary, target bonus or aggregate benefit levels
from those in effect as of the Effective Time.

compliance, with the provisions of the HSR Act and other U.S. or foreign

documents with the SEC since June 1, 2001 (the " _Company SEC Reports_ "). As
of their respective dates, the Company SEC Reports complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as
the case may be, and, at the respective times they were filed, none of the
Company SEC Reports contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. The consolidated financial statements (including,
in each case, any notes thereto) of the Company included in the Company SEC
Reports complied as to form in all material respects  



 

14  with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, were prepared in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") (except, in the
case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated therein or in the notes thereto) and fairly present in accordance
with GAAP the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows
for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to
normal year-end audit adjustments and to any other adjustments described
therein). Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports or as required
by GAAP, the Company has not, since March 31, 2004, made any change in the
accounting practices or policies applied in the preparation of financial

situation or set of circumstances which could be expected to result in such a
liability or obligation, except (a) liabilities or obligations reflected
in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof and (b) liabilities
or obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

materials, goods in process and finished goods, all of which are (i)

year, quantity and book value, and (ii) all commitments to purchase or deliver
tobacco, showing type, origin, grade, crop year, quantity and cost (but not

records and in the Companys consolidated financial statements included in
the Company SEC Reports and have arisen from bona fide transactions in the
ordinary course of business.



(d) All accounts payable of the Company and its Subsidiaries have arisen from
bona fide transactions in the ordinary course of business and are reflected

limitation, making use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of
interstate commerce corruptly in furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to

its Affiliates have conducted their businesses in compliance with the FCPA and
have instituted and maintain policies and procedures designed to ensure, and
which are reasonably expected to continue to ensure, continued compliance
therewith, except, in each case, as would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. "FCPA" means Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977,
as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder. 



(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company, the operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries are
and have been conducted at all times in compliance with applicable financial
recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the Currency and Foreign
Transactions Reporting Act of 1970, as amended, the money laundering statutes
of all jurisdictions, the rules and regulations thereunder and any related or
similar rules, regulations or guidelines, issued, administered or enforced
by  



 

16  any governmental agency (collectively, the " _Money Laundering Laws_ ") and
no action, suit or proceeding by or before any court or governmental agency,
authority or body or any arbitrator involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to the Money Laundering Laws is pending or, to the

filed on or prior to the date hereof, the Company and its Subsidiaries own fee
simple or valid leasehold (as the case may be) title to the Company Real
Estate and have valid title to their other tangible assets and properties
which they purport to own, free and clear of any and all Liens, except for
Permitted Liens. All leases material to the Company pursuant to which the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, as lessee, leases real or personal
property, are valid and effective in accordance with their respective terms,
and there is not, under any of such lease, any material existing default by
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or any event which, with notice
or lapse of time or both, would constitute such a material default. All
Buildings and Equipment of the Company or its Subsidiaries have been well
maintained and are in good and serviceable condition, normal wear and tear
excepted, except where the failure to be so maintained would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.



3.11. _Litigation_. Except as set forth in the Company SEC Reports filed prior
to the date hereof or in Section 3.11 of the Company Schedule of Exceptions,
(a) there are no actions, suits, claims (including workers compensation

of its properties, assets or business, or, to the knowledge of the Company,

the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company has agreed to indemnify
that could reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect.

Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement or set forth in
Section 3.12 of the Company Schedule of Exceptions, (A) none of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any liability or obligation (indirect,
direct or contingent), or entered into any oral or written agreement or other
transaction, that is not in the ordinary course of business or that would,
individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect, except
for any such changes or effects resulting from this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby or the  



 

17  announcement thereof; (B) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has sustained any loss or interference with their business or properties from
fire, flood, windstorm, accident or other calamity (whether or not covered by
insurance) that would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect; (C) there has been no action taken by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries since March 31, 2004, that, if taken during the period from
the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, would constitute a
breach of Section 5.1; and (D) there has been no event, circumstance or
development that would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company, except for any such changes or effects
resulting from this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or the
announcement thereof.



3.13. _Performance of Company Contracts_. Each of the Company Contracts is in
full force and effect and constitutes the legal and binding obligation of the
Company and, to the knowledge of the Company, constitutes the legal and
binding obligation of the other parties thereto. Except as disclosed
in Section 3.13 of the Company Schedule of Exceptions, there are no existing
breaches or defaults by the Company or, to the knowledge of the Company, any
other party to a Contract, under any Contract the effect of which would,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute a Material Adverse Effect and,
to the knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred which, with the passage
of time or the giving of notice or both, could reasonably be expected to
constitute such a breach or default. 



3.14. _ERISA_. __



(a) With respect to each Company Plan (as hereinafter defined), the Company
has made (or as soon as practicable will make) available to DIMON a true and
correct copy of (i) the three most recent annual reports (Form 5500) filed
with the Internal Revenue Service (" _IRS_ "), (ii) such Company Plan, (iii)
each trust agreement, insurance contract or administration agreement relating
to such Company Plan, (iv) the most recent summary plan description of each
Company Plan for which a summary plan description is required, (v) the
most recent actuarial report or valuation relating to a Company Plan subject
to Title IV of ERISA and (vi) the most recent determination letter, if any,
issued by the IRS with respect to any Company Plan intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code. Except, in each case, for events or actions
that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect, (i) each Company Plan complies with all applicable statutes and
governmental rules and regulations, including but not limited to ERISA, the
Code and COBRA, (ii) no "reportable event" (within the meaning of Section 4043
of ERISA) has occurred with respect to any Company Plan, (iii) neither the
Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has withdrawn from any Company
Multiemployer Plan (as hereinafter defined), or instituted, or is currently
considering taking, any action to do so, and (iv) no action has been taken, or
is currently being considered, to terminate any Company Plan subject to Title
IV of ERISA, and (v) the Company and its ERISA Affiliates have complied with
the continued medical coverage requirements of COBRA. Except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect, no Company
Plan, nor any trust created thereunder, has incurred any "accumulated funding
deficiency" (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA), whether or not waived.
Except as disclosed in the Company Schedule of Exceptions, with respect to any
Company Plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA, the present value of
accrued benefit obligations, as determined in accordance with FAS 87 in
accordance with the actuarial assumptions used to prepare the most recent  



 

18  reports of such Company Plan, did not exceed the fair market value of the
Plan assets as of the most recent valuation date for which an actuarial report
has been prepared and the Company has no knowledge of any material adverse
change to such status.



(b) With respect to the Company Plans, no event has occurred in connection
with which the Company or any ERISA Affiliate would be subject to any
liability under the terms of such Company Plans, ERISA, the Code or any other
applicable law which would have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as disclosed
in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof or set forth in
Section 3.14 of the Company Schedule of Exceptions, with respect to any
current or former employee or contractor of the Company or its Subsidiaries,
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not
result in the payment or provision of additional compensation or benefits or
accelerate the vesting, payment or funding of any compensation or benefits.
Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof
or set forth in Section 3.14 of the Company Schedule of Exceptions, no
amounts payable or provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will constitute "excess parachute
payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. Each Company Plan
that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has been
determined by the IRS to be so qualified, or a timely application for such
determination is now pending or it is a prototype or volume submitter
plan document that has been pre-approved by the IRS as is evidenced by a
letter from the IRS, and, to the knowledge of the Company, there is no reason
why any Company Plan is not so qualified in operation. Neither the Company nor
any of its ERISA Affiliates has been notified by any Company Multiemployer
Plan that such Company Multiemployer Plan is currently in reorganization or
insolvency under and within the meaning of Section 4241 or 4245 of ERISA or
that such Company Multiemployer Plan intends to terminate or has been
terminated under Section 4041A of ERISA. Except as disclosed in the Company
SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof or set forth in Section 3.14 of the
Company Schedule of Exceptions, neither the Company nor any of its ERISA
Affiliates has any liability or obligation under any welfare plan to provide
benefits after termination of employment to any employee or dependent other
than as required by ERISA. There are no pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened claims, suits, audits or investigations related to
any Company Plan other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course and
other than claims, suits, audits or investigations that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. As used
herein, (i) "Company Plan" means a "pension plan" (as defined in Section 3.2
of ERISA (other than a Company Multiemployer Plan or a plan exempt from ERISA
under Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA)) or a "welfare plan" (as defined in Section
3(1) of ERISA other than a plan exempt from ERISA under Section 4(b)(4) of
ERISA) established or maintained by the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates
or as to which the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates has contributed or
otherwise may have any liability and all other retirement, deferred
compensation, severance, termination, change in control, stock option,
restricted stock or phantom stock plans, policies or programs of the Company
or its Subsidiaries, (ii) "Company Multiemployer Plan" means a "multiemployer
plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) to which the Company or any
of its ERISA Affiliates is or has been obligated to contribute or otherwise
may have any liability and (iii) with respect to any Person, "ERISA Affiliate"
means any trade or business (whether or not incorporated) which is under
common control or would be considered a single employer with such
Person pursuant to Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code and the
regulations  



 

19  promulgated under those sections or pursuant to Section 4001(b) of ERISA and
the regulations promulgated thereunder, including, without limitation, each
of the Companys Subsidiaries.



3.15.  _Taxes_.



(a) _Tax Returns_. For all years for which the applicable statutory period of
limitation has not expired, each of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
has timely and properly filed, and will through the Closing Date timely and
properly file, all material federal, state, local and foreign tax returns
(including but not limited to income, franchise, sales, payroll, employee
withholding and social security and unemployment) that were or will be
required to be filed. Each of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
has paid all taxes (including interest, penalties and additions to tax) owed
by them. No material unpaid tax deficiencies have been proposed or assessed
against the Company or its Subsidiaries. To the knowledge of the Company, no
issue has been raised in any prior tax audit of the Company or its
Subsidiaries that, by application of the same or similar principles, could
reasonably be expected upon a future tax audit of the Company or its
Subsidiaries to result in a proposed material deficiency for any period.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is liable for any taxes
attributable to any other Person (other than a member of an affiliated group
of which the Company is the common parent), whether by reason of being a
member of another affiliated group, being a party to a tax sharing agreement,
as a transferee or successor, or otherwise.



(b) _Audits_. There are no material audits, examinations, investigations or
other proceedings pending or threatened in writing in respect of taxes or tax
matters of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has consented to any extension of the statute of
limitations with respect to any open federal, state, local or federal
tax returns.



(c) _Liens_. There are no tax Liens upon any property or assets of the
Company or its Subsidiaries except for Liens for current taxes not yet due and
payable.

and complete copies of all tax returns and reports of the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries filed for all periods not barred by the applicable statute of
limitations through the Effective Time.



(e) _Withholding Taxes_. Each of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has
properly withheld and timely paid substantially all withholding and
employment taxes that it was required to withhold and pay relating to
salaries, compensation and other amounts heretofore paid to its employees or
other Persons. All IRS Forms W-2 and 1099 required to be filed with respect
thereto have been timely and properly filed except where the failure to file
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.



(f) _Other Representations_. Each of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
has not made any elections under former Section 341(f) of the Code and,
except as shown in Section 3.15 of the Company Schedule of Exceptions, has and
will not be subject to disallowance of compensation deductions pursuant to
Section 280G of the Code by reason of the Merger or any prior event. 



 

20 3.16. _Labor Matters_. Except as set forth in Section 3.16 of the
Company Schedule of Exceptions, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any collective bargaining agreement or labor
contract. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in any
unfair labor practice with respect to any person employed by or otherwise
performing services primarily for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the
" _Company Business Personnel_ "), and there is no unfair labor practice
complaint or grievance against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by the
National Labor Relations Board or any comparable state agency pending or
threatened in writing with respect to the Company Business Personnel. There is
no labor strike, dispute, slowdown or stoppage pending or, to the knowledge
of the Company, threatened against or affecting the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries which may interfere with the respective business activities of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company and its Subsidiaries are
in material compliance with all labor, employment and wage payment-related
laws, regulations and rules.



3.17. _Company Existing Permits_. The material Company Existing Permits are
listed in Section 3.17 of the Company Schedule of Exceptions. The Company and
its Subsidiaries possess all licenses, permits, approvals, exemptions, orders,
franchises, qualifications, permissions, agreements and governmental
authorizations required by Law which the Company currently has and
is required to have for the conduct of the business of the Company as
currently conducted, except where the failure to have the same would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. No action or
proceeding is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened that is
reasonably likely to result in a revocation, non-renewal, termination,
suspension or other material impairment of any material Company Existing
Permits.



3.18. _Intangible Assets_. There are no claims, demands or proceedings
instituted, pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened by any
Person contesting or challenging the right of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to use any of its Intangible Assets that, individually or in
the aggregate, would be reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse
Effect. Each trademark registration, service mark registration, copyright
registration, patent and patent application owned by the Company and any of
its Subsidiaries has been maintained in good standing except where the
failure to so maintain would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries owns or
possesses adequate licenses or other rights to use all Intangible Assets
necessary to conduct its business as now conducted, except where the failure
to own or possess such licenses could not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The consummation
of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
impair the validity, enforceability, ownership or right of the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries to use its Intangible Assets.



3.19. _Environmental Matters_.



(a) Except as set forth in Section 3.19 of the Company Schedule of
Exceptions, the Company is, and at all times has been, in material compliance
with Environmental Laws, and any immaterial non-compliance will not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company
does not have any basis to expect, nor has it or any person for whose conduct
it is or may be held to be responsible received, any actual  



 

21  or threatened order, notice or other communication (written or oral) from
(i) any Governmental Entity or third party or (ii) the current or prior owner
or operator of any property, of any actual or potential violation or failure
to comply with any Environmental Law, or of any actual or threatened
obligation to undertake or bear the cost of any Environmental Claim with
respect to any property or assets (whether real, personal or mixed) in which
the Company has had an interest.



(b) Except as disclosed in Section 3.19 of the Company Schedule of Exceptions,
there are no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
Environmental Claims, encumbrances, or other restrictions of any nature,
resulting from any liabilities or arising under or pursuant to any
Environmental Law, with respect to or affecting any property and assets
(whether real, personal or mixed) in which the Company has or had an interest.



(c) The Company has obtained all environmental, health and safety permits and
governmental authorizations (collectively, the " _Environmental Permits_ ")
required for its operations, and all such permits are in good standing and the
Company is in substantial compliance with all terms and conditions of the
Environmental Permits, except where the failure to obtain or be in compliance
with such Environmental Permits would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Material Adverse Effect.



3.20. _Vote Required_. The affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of
the shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote with respect to the Merger
is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of the Companys
capital stock necessary to approve the Merger, this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.



3.21.  _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The Company has received the opinion
of Matrix Capital Markets Group, its financial advisor, to the effect that, as
of November 5, 2004, the Merger Consideration to be received in the Merger by
the Company Shareholders, based upon and subject to the assumptions and
limitations set forth in such opinion, is fair to such Company Shareholders
from a financial point of view, a copy of which opinion has been delivered to
DIMON.



3.22. _Certain Agreements_. Except as set forth in Section 3.22 of the
Company Schedule of Exceptions, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any oral or written agreement or plan, including
any stock option plan, stock appreciation rights plan, restricted stock plan
or stock purchase plan, any of the benefits of which will be increased, or
the vesting of the benefits of which will be accelerated, by the occurrence of
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the value of any of
the benefits of which will be calculated on the basis of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except as described in Section
3.22 of the Company Schedule of Exceptions, the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will not constitute a "change of control" under, require the
consent from or the giving of notice to any third party pursuant to, or
accelerate the vesting or repurchase rights under, the terms, conditions or
provisions of any loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
license, lease, contract, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or
any of their properties or assets may be bound.

whose engagement agreement has been provided to DIMON, neither the Company
nor its Subsidiaries has employed any investment banker, broker, finder or
intermediary in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby who might

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.



3.24. _Takeover Statutes_. No restrictive provision of any "fair price,"
"moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other similar anti-takeover
statute or regulation (each a " _Takeover Statute_ ") or restrictive provision
of any applicable anti-takeover provision in the Companys articles of
incorporation and by-laws is applicable to the Company, the Company Common
Stock, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including, without limitation, Article 14 of the VSCA and Article 9 of the

corporate power and authority and all necessary governmental approvals to own
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
of the jurisdictions in which the ownership of its properties or the conduct

of Exceptions sets forth a complete and accurate list of all DIMONs
Subsidiaries, showing the name, type of entity, jurisdiction of organization,
and type and amount of the Companys ownership in the equity of such

be, and, at the respective times they were filed, none of DIMON SEC Reports
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the

as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto, were prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of the
unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
therein or in the notes thereto) and fairly present in accordance with GAAP
the consolidated financial position of DIMON and its consolidated Subsidiaries
as at the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and their consolidated cash flows for the periods then ended

title to their other tangible assets and properties which they purport to own,
free and clear of any and all Liens, except for Permitted Liens. All leases
material to DIMON pursuant to which DIMON or any Subsidiary of DIMON, as
lessee, leases real or personal property, are valid and effective in
accordance with their respective terms, and there is not, under any of such
lease, any material existing default by DIMON or any Subsidiary of DIMON or
any event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute such a
material default. All of DIMONs Buildings and Equipment of the Company or its
Subsidiaries have been well maintained and are in good and serviceable
condition, normal wear and tear excepted, except where the failure to be so
maintained would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect.



4.13. _Performance of DIMON Contracts_. Each of the DIMON Contracts is in
full force and effect and constitutes the legal and binding obligation of
DIMON and, to the knowledge of DIMON, constitutes the legal and binding
obligation of the other parties thereto. Except as disclosed in Section 4.13
of the DIMON Schedule of Exceptions, there are no existing breaches or
defaults by DIMON or, to the knowledge of DIMON, any other party to a DIMON
Contract, under any DIMON Contract the effect of which would, individually or
in the aggregate, constitute a Material Adverse Effect and, to the knowledge
of DIMON, no event has occurred which, with the passage of time or the giving
of notice or both, could reasonably be expected to constitute such a breach or
default.



4.14. _ERISA_



(a) With respect to each DIMON Plan (as hereinafter defined), DIMON has made
(or as soon as practicable will make) available to the Company a true and
correct copy of (i) the three most recent annual reports (Form 5500) filed
with the IRS, (ii) such DIMON Plan, (iii) each trust agreement,
insurance contract or administration agreement relating to such DIMON Plan,
(iv) the most recent summary plan description of each DIMON Plan for which a
summary plan description is required, (v) the most recent actuarial report or
valuation relating to a DIMON Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA and (vi) the
most recent determination  



 

29  letter, if any, issued by the IRS with respect to any DIMON Plan intended to
be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code. Except, in each case, for
events or actions that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect, (i) each DIMON Plan complies with all applicable
statutes and governmental rules and regulations, including but not limited to
ERISA, the Code and COBRA, (ii) no "reportable event" (within the meaning of
Section 4043 of ERISA) has occurred with respect to any DIMON Plan, (iii)
neither DIMON nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has withdrawn from any DIMON
Multiemployer Plan (as hereinafter defined), or instituted, or is currently
considering taking, any action to do so, and (iv) no action has been taken, or
is currently being considered, to terminate any DIMON Plan subject to Title IV
of ERISA, and (v) DIMON and its ERISA Affiliates have complied with the
continued medical coverage requirements of COBRA. Except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect, no DIMON
Plan, nor any trust created thereunder, has incurred any "accumulated funding
deficiency" (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA), whether or not waived.
Except as disclosed in Section 4.14 of the DIMON Schedule of Exceptions, with
respect to any DIMON Plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA, the present
value of accrued benefit obligations, as determined in accordance with FAS 87
in accordance with the actuarial assumptions used to prepare the most recent
reports of such DIMON Plan, did not exceed the fair market value of the Plan
assets as of the most recent valuation date for which an actuarial report has
been prepared and DIMON has no knowledge of any material adverse change to
such status.



(b) With respect to the DIMON Plans, no event has occurred in connection with
which DIMON or any ERISA Affiliate would be subject to any liability under
the terms of such DIMON Plans, ERISA, the Code or any other applicable law
which would have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as disclosed in the DIMON
SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof or set forth in Section 4.14(b) of
the DIMON Schedule of Exceptions, with respect to any current or former
employee or contractor of DIMON or its Subsidiaries, consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not result in the payment or
provision of additional compensation or benefits or accelerate the vesting,
payment or funding of any compensation or benefits. Except as disclosed in the
DIMON SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof or set forth in Section 4.14
of the DIMON Schedule of Exceptions, no amounts payable or provided by DIMON
or its Subsidiaries related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will constitute "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G
of the Code. Each DIMON Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has been determined by the IRS to be so qualified, or a
timely application for such determination is now pending or it is a prototype
or volume submitter plan document that has been pre-approved by the IRS as is
evidenced by a letter from the IRS, and, to the knowledge of DIMON, there is
no reason why any DIMON Plan is not so qualified in operation. Neither DIMON
nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has been notified by any DIMON Multiemployer
Plan that such DIMON Multiemployer Plan is currently in reorganization or
insolvency under and within the meaning of Section 4241 or 4245 of ERISA or
that such DIMON Multiemployer Plan intends to terminate or has been terminated
under Section 4041A of ERISA. Except as disclosed in the DIMON SEC Reports
filed prior to the date hereof or set forth in Section 4.14 of the DIMON
Schedule of Exceptions, neither DIMON nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has any
liability or obligation under any welfare plan to provide benefits after
termination of employment to any employee or dependent other than as required
by ERISA. There are no pending or, to the knowledge of DIMON, threatened
claims, suits, audits or investigations related to any DIMON Plan other than
claims for benefits in the ordinary course  



 

30  and other than claims, suits, audits or investigations that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. As used
herein, (i) "DIMON Plan" means a "pension plan" (as defined in Section 3(2)
of ERISA (other than a DIMON Multiemployer Plan or a plan exempt from ERISA
under Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA)) or a "welfare plan" (as defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA other than a plan exempt from ERISA under Section
4(b)(4) of ERISA) established or maintained by DIMON or any of its ERISA
Affiliates or as to which DIMON or any of its ERISA Affiliates has contributed
or otherwise may have any liability and all other retirement, deferred
compensation, severance, termination, change in control, stock option,
restricted stock or phantom stock plans, policies or programs of DIMON or its
Subsidiaries, (ii) "DIMON Multiemployer Plan" means a "multiemployer plan"
(as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) to which DIMON or any of its ERISA
Affiliates is or has been obligated to contribute or otherwise may have any
liability and (iii) with respect to any Person, "ERISA Affiliate" means any
trade or business (whether or not incorporated) which is under common control
or would be considered a single employer with such Person pursuant to Section
414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code and the regulations promulgated under
those sections or pursuant to Section 4001(b) of ERISA and the regulations
promulgated thereunder, including, without limitation, each of DIMONs
Subsidiaries.



4.15. _Taxes_.



(a) _Tax Returns_. For all years for which the applicable statutory period of
limitation has not expired, each of DIMON and each of its Subsidiaries has
timely and properly filed, and will through the Closing Date timely and
properly file, all material federal, state, local and foreign tax returns
(including but not limited to income, franchise, sales, payroll, employee
withholding and social security and unemployment) that were or will be
required to be filed. Each of DIMON and each of its Subsidiaries has paid all
taxes (including interest, penalties and additions to tax) owed by them. No
material unpaid tax deficiencies have been proposed or assessed against DIMON
or its Subsidiaries. To the knowledge of DIMON, no issue has been raised in
any prior tax audit of DIMON or its Subsidiaries that, by application of the
same or similar principles, could reasonably be expected upon a future tax
audit of DIMON or its Subsidiaries to result in a proposed material deficiency
for any period. Neither DIMON nor any of its Subsidiaries is liable for any
taxes attributable to any other Person (other than a member of an affiliated
group of which DIMON is the common parent), whether by reason of being a
member of another affiliated group, being a party to a tax sharing agreement,
as a transferee or successor, or otherwise. 



(b) _Audits_. There are no material audits, examinations, investigations or
other proceedings threatened or pending in respect of taxes or tax matters of
DIMON and or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither DIMON nor any of its
Subsidiaries has consented to any extension of the statute of limitations
with respect to any open federal, state, local or federal tax returns.



(c) _Liens_. There are no tax Liens upon any property or assets of DIMON or
its Subsidiaries except for Liens for current taxes not yet due and payable.

copies of all tax returns and reports of DIMON and each of its Subsidiaries
filed for all periods not barred by the applicable statute of limitations
through the Effective Time.



(e) _Withholding Taxes_. Each of DIMON and each of its Subsidiaries has
properly withheld and timely paid substantially all withholding and
employment taxes that it was required to withhold and pay relating to
salaries, compensation and other amounts heretofore paid to its employees or
other Persons. All IRS Forms W-2 and 1099 required to be filed with respect
thereto have been timely and properly filed except where the failure to file
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.



(f) _Other Representations_. Each of DIMON and its Subsidiaries has not made
any elections under former Section 341(f) of the Code and, except as shown in
Section 4.15 of the DIMON Schedule of Exceptions, has and will not be subject
to disallowance of compensation deduction pursuant to Section 280G of the Code
by reason of the Merger or any prior event.



(g) _Continuity of the Company s Business_. It is the present intention of
DIMON, after the Effective Time, to (either directly or indirectly as
permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(d)) continue at least one
significant historic business line of the Company or use at least a
significant portion of the Companys historic business assets in a business,
in each case within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(d).



4.16. _Labor Matters_. Except as set forth in Section 4.16 of the DIMON
Schedule of Exceptions, neither DIMON nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party
to any collective bargaining agreement or labor contract. Neither DIMON nor
any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in any unfair labor practice with respect
to any person employed by or otherwise performing services primarily for
DIMON or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _DIMON Business Personnel_ "), and
there is no unfair labor practice complaint or grievance against DIMON or its
Subsidiaries by the National Labor Relations Board or any comparable state
agency pending or threatened in writing with respect to the DIMON Business
Personnel. There is no labor strike, dispute, slowdown or stoppage pending or,
to the knowledge of DIMON, threatened against or affecting DIMON or any of
its Subsidiaries which may interfere with the respective business activities
of DIMON or any of its Subsidiaries. DIMON and its Subsidiaries are in
material compliance with all labor, employment and wage payment-related laws,
regulations and rules. 



4.17. _DIMON Existing Permits_. The material DIMON Existing Permits are
listed in Section 4.17 of the DIMON Schedule of Exceptions. DIMON and its
Subsidiaries possess all licenses, permits, approvals, exemptions, orders,
franchises, qualifications, permissions, agreements and governmental
authorizations required by Law which DIMON currently has and is required to
have for the conduct of the business of DIMON as currently conducted, except
where the failure to have the same would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. No action or proceeding is pending
or, to the knowledge of DIMON, threatened that is reasonably likely to result
in a revocation, non-renewal, termination, suspension or other material
impairment of any material DIMON Existing Permits.



 

32 4.18. _Intangible Assets_. There are no claims, demands or proceedings
instituted, pending or, to the knowledge of DIMON, threatened by any Person
contesting or challenging the right of DIMON or any of its Subsidiaries to use
any of its Intangible Assets that, individually or in the aggregate, would be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each trademark
registration, service mark registration, copyright registration, patent and
patent application which is owned by DIMON and any of its Subsidiaries has
been maintained in good standing except where the failure to so maintain
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.
DIMON and each of its Subsidiaries owns or possesses adequate licenses or
other rights to use all Intangible Assets necessary to conduct its business as
now conducted, except where the failure to own or possess such licenses could
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. The consummation of the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not impair the validity, enforceability,
ownership or right of DIMON and each of its Subsidiaries to use its Intangible
Assets.



4.19. _Environmental Matters_.



(a) Except as set forth in Section 4.19 of the DIMON Schedule of Exceptions,
DIMON is, and at all times has been, in material compliance with
Environmental Laws, any immaterial non-compliance would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. DIMON does not have any
basis to expect, nor has it or any person for whose conduct it is or may be
held to be responsible received, any actual or threatened order, notice or
other communication (written or oral) from (i) any Governmental Entity or
third party or (ii) the current or prior owner or operator of any property, of
any actual or potential violation or failure to comply with any Environmental
Law, or of any actual or threatened obligation to undertake or bear the cost
of any Environmental Claim with respect to any property or assets (whether
real, personal or mixed) in which DIMON has had an interest.



(b) Except as disclosed in Section 4.19 of the DIMON Schedule of Exceptions,
there are no pending or, to the knowledge of DIMON, threatened Environmental
Claims, encumbrances, or other restrictions of any nature, resulting from any
liabilities or arising under or pursuant to any Environmental Law, with
respect to or affecting any property and assets (whether real, personal or
mixed) in which DIMON has or had an interest.



(c) DIMON has obtained all environmental, health and safety permits and
governmental authorizations (collectively, the " _DIMON Environmental
Permits_ ") required for its operations, and all such permits are in good
standing and DIMON is in substantial compliance with all terms and conditions
of the Environmental Permits, except where the failure to obtain or be
in compliance with such DIMON Environmental Permits would not, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.



4.20. _Required Vote of DIMON Shareholders; Authorization_. The affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of DIMON Common Stock present
in person or by proxy at the DIMON Shareholders Meeting at which the holders
of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of DIMON Common Stock are
present in person or by proxy is the only vote of the holders of any class or
series of DIMONs capital stock necessary to approve the Merger and other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Upon such approval, the DIMON  



 

33  Common Stock issued pursuant to the Merger, when issued in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable. 



4.21. _Brokers or Finders_. Except for Peter J. Solomon Company, a copy of
whose engagement agreement has been provided to the Company, neither DIMON nor
any of its Subsidiaries has employed any investment banker, broker, finder or
intermediary in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby who
might be entitled to any fee or any commission in connection with or upon
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.



4.22. _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. DIMON has received the opinion of Peter
J. Solomon Company L.P., its financial advisor, to the effect that, as of
November 6, 2004, based upon and subject to the assumptions and limitations
set forth in such opinion, the Merger Consideration is fair to DIMON from a
financial point of view, a copy of which opinion has been delivered to
the Company.



4.23. _Certain Agreements_. Except as set forth in Section 4.22 of the DIMON
Schedule of Exceptions, neither DIMON nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party
to any oral or written agreement or plan, including any stock option plan,
stock appreciation rights plan, restricted stock plan or stock purchase plan,
any of the benefits of which will be increased, or the vesting of the benefits
of which will be accelerated, by the occurrence of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the value of any of the benefits of which
will be calculated on the basis of any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Except as described in Section 4.22 of the DIMON Schedule of
Exceptions, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
constitute a "change of control" under, require the consent from or the
giving of notice to any third party pursuant to, or accelerate the vesting or
repurchase rights under, the terms, conditions or provisions of any loan or
credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, license, lease, contract,
agreement or other instrument or obligation to which DIMON or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or any of their properties or
assets may be bound.

or restraint of trade or lessening of competition.



(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, if any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by
a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging

DIMON a list of names and addresses of those Persons who are, in the opinion
of the Company, as of the time of the Company Shareholder Meeting,
"affiliates" of the Company within the meaning of Rule 145 under the
Securities Act. The Company shall provide to DIMON such information and
documents as DIMON shall reasonably request for purposes of reviewing such
list. There shall be added to such list the names and addresses of any other
Person subsequently identified by either DIMON or the Company as a Person who
may be deemed to be such an affiliate of the Company; provided, however, that
no such Person identified by DIMON shall be  



 

41  added to the list of affiliates of the Company if DIMON shall receive from
the Company, on or before the Closing Date, an opinion of counsel
reasonably satisfactory to DIMON to the effect that such Person is not such
an affiliate. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver
or cause to be delivered to DIMON, prior to the Closing Date, from each
affiliate of the Company identified in the foregoing list (as the same may be
supplemented as aforesaid), a letter substantially in the form attached as

to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each
of DIMON and the Company and their respective boards of directors shall grant

terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions.

other transactions contemplated hereby, as more particularly described in
Section 6.2(c) of the DIMON Schedule of Exceptions (the " _Financing_ ").

comfort letters, as DIMON and its representatives and agents may deem
reasonably necessary or appropriate in connection with the Financing.



5.11. _Tax-Free Reorganization_.



(a) Each of DIMON and the Company shall use all reasonable efforts to cause
the Merger to constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section

and intend that it be, a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of
Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the Treasury Regulations.



(b) Unless otherwise required (and then only to the extent otherwise required)
by a "determination" (as defined in Section 1313(a)(1)) of the Code or by a
similar applicable provision of state or local income tax law, each party
shall (i) report the Merger on all  



 

42  tax returns and other filings as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii) not take any position that is inconsistent
with the characterization of the Merger as such a reorganization in any
audit, administrative proceeding, litigation or otherwise.



5.12. _Letters of the Company s Accountants_. The Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to DIMON letters
from Deloitte and Touche LLP, the Companys independent public accountants, one

days before the Effective Time, each addressed to DIMON and customary in
scope and substance for letters delivered by independent accountants in
connection with registration statements similar to the Registration Statement.
Further, the Company shall cause to be delivered to DIMON prior to the
Effective Time the written agreement of Deloitte and Touche, LLP, and each other
accounting firm upon which Deloitte and Touche, LLP, has relied in preparing its
reports on any of the Companys consolidated financial statements or internal
controls included in the Company SEC Reports (i) to provide DIMON and its
agents and employees reasonable access after the Effective Time to it
workpapers relating to such financial statements or internal controls and to
their personnel who have participated in the preparation or review of such
reports and financial statements, (ii) to provide DIMON with such additional
manually-executed copies of such reports as it may reasonably request, and

reference of such reports in DIMONs filings under the Securities Act,
the Exchange Act and the related rules and regulations.
