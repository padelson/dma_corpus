2.3 Calculation of Estimated Cash Payable on Closing



| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

The amount to be paid by the Purchaser to the Vendors' Representative on the
Closing Date will be equal to Cdn $208,000,000 less: (i) the Holdback Amounts;
(ii) $1,000,000 in respect of the working capital adjustment and Combined
Target April 2014 Net Profits (the "Working Capital Holdback"); (iii) the
Lender Payout Amount; (iv) $1,000,000 in respect of the Servco Note; and (v)
$505,000 in respect of the Accrued Bonus Pool (such amount being the
"Estimated Cash Payable on Closing"). 

 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

Within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall
deliver to the Vendors' Representative an unaudited combined consolidated
balance sheet of the Targets as of the Closing Date and the Combined Target
April 2014 Net Profits, each prepared by the Purchaser in accordance with GAAP
(the "Closing Balance Sheet"). For the purpose of preparing the Closing
Balance Sheet, the Vendors agree to provide all necessary cooperation to the
Purchaser. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(3)

|

The Vendors' Representative shall have a period (the "Review Period") of sixty
(60) days from the date the Vendors' Representative receives the Closing
Balance Sheet and the Combined Target April 2014 Net Profits in which to
review the same. For the purpose of such review, the Purchaser shall permit
the Vendors' Representative to examine all material accounting documentation
used or prepared by the Purchaser and its auditors in preparing the Closing
Balance Sheet and the Combined Target April 2014 Net Profits. If no objection
in writing to the Closing Balance Sheet or the Combined Target April 2014 Net
Profits, as applicable, is given to the Purchaser by the Vendors'
Representative within the Review Period, the Closing Balance Sheet or the
Combined Target April 2014 Net Profits, as applicable, shall be deemed to have
been approved as of the last day of such Review Period. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(4)

|

If the Vendors' Representative objects to any item or aspect of the Closing
Balance Sheet or the Combined Target April 2014 Net Profits, as applicable,
the Vendors' Representative shall give a single written notice to the
Purchaser on or before the end of the Review Period, setting out in detail the
nature of any such objection and the related amount(s) in dispute and the
Purchaser and the Vendors' 

Representative shall attempt to resolve the matters in dispute within 30 days
from the date the Vendors' Representative gives such notice to the Purchaser.
If all matters in dispute are resolved by the Purchaser and the Vendors'
Representative, the Closing Balance Sheet or the Combined Target April 2014
Net Profits, as applicable, shall be modified to the extent required to give
effect to such resolution and shall be deemed to have been approved as of the
date of such resolution.



| 
---|--- 

(5)

|

If the Purchaser and the Vendors' Representative cannot resolve all matters in
dispute within such thirty day period, all such unresolved matters shall be
submitted to a nationally recognized accounting firm acceptable to the
Purchaser and the Vendors' Representative (the "Expert") for resolution, as
expert and not arbitrator. The Expert shall use its reasonable efforts to
render its written decision within 30 days of its appointment. The Expert
shall be given access to all materials and information reasonably requested by
it for such purpose. The rules and procedures to be followed in such
proceeding shall be determined by the Expert in its discretion. The Expert's
determination of all such matters shall be final and binding on all parties
and shall not be subject to appeal, absent manifest error. The fees and
expenses of the Expert shall be borne by the Vendors and the Purchaser in the
manner determined by the Expert based on the relative success of the Vendors
and the Purchaser in respect of such disputes. The Closing Balance Sheet shall
be modified to the extent required to give effect to the Expert's
determination and shall be deemed to have been approved as of the date of such
determination. 

 

2.4 Adjustment of Purchase Price

The Vendors and the Purchaser acknowledge and agree that the Purchase Price
shall be adjusted (the "Adjustment"), as follows:

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

downwards, if the Combined Working Capital is less than $38,000,000 by the
amount by which Combined Working Capital is less than $38,000,000 (the
"Working Capital Deficit"); 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

downwards, with respect to instalments for Taxes paid by the Targets on or
before the Closing Date if the Closing Balance Sheet determines there is a
payable, by an amount equal to the value of the payable; 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

upwards, with respect to instalments for Taxes paid by the Targets (other than
Servco) on or before the Closing Date if the Closing Balance Sheet discloses
there is a receivable, by an amount equal to the value of the receivable; 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

downwards, by the amount of any incentive payments owed by any of the Targets
prior to the Time of Closing that were not paid out prior to the Closing Date; 

| 
---|--- 

(e)

|

upwards by the amount, if any, of cash on hand in the bank accounts of the
Targets (other than Servco) in excess of the amount required to cover all
outstanding cheques written by the Targets at the Closing Date; and 

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

downwards by the amount, if any, by which the amount of outstanding cheques
written by the Targets as at the Closing Date exceeds cash on hand in the bank
accounts of the Targets at the Closing Date. 

For purposes of Section 2.4(a), the Purchaser shall deduct the Working Capital
Deficit and any Combined Target April 2014 Net Profits not left behind in the
Targets (collectively, the "Combined Deficit") from the Working Capital
Holdback. If the Combined Deficit does not exceed the Working Capital
Holdback, the Purchaser shall pay the excess of the Working Capital Holdback
over the Combined Deficit to a single account designated by the Vendors'
Representative within five Business Days of the Payment Date (as defined in
the next following paragraph). If the Combined Deficit exceeds the Working
Capital Holdback, the Purchaser shall be entitled to retain the entire amount
of the Working Capital Holdback and the adjustment referred to 

in Section 2.4(a) shall be equal to the excess of the Combined Deficit over
the Working Capital Holdback. If there is no Combined Deficit, the Purchaser
shall pay the Working Capital Holdback to a single account designated by the
Vendors' Representative within five Business Days of the Payment Date.

If the Adjustment results in a negative amount (the "Deficit"), the Vendors
shall pay the Deficit to the Purchaser, and if the Adjustment results in a
positive amount (the "Surplus"), the Purchaser shall pay the Vendors the
Surplus to a single account as directed in writing by the Vendors'
Representative as hereinafter provided, each on the basis set forth below. The
Vendors or the Purchaser, as the case may be, shall within five Business Days
after the Review Period or, if submitted to the Expert for resolution, within
five (5) Business Days of delivery of the Expert's written decision to the
Vendor and Purchaser, as the case may be (the "Payment Date"), pay the Deficit
or the Surplus, as the case may be, to the party entitled thereto. If the
Deficit or the Surplus, as the case may be, is not paid by the Payment Date,
then the amount payable shall be payable and shall be paid together with
interest thereon at a rate of 2.00% per annum from and including the Payment
Date to but excluding the date of payment.



2.5 Holdback Amounts



| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

The Holdback Amounts shall be paid as follows: 

 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

as to $10,400,000 (the "First Holdback") together with interest thereon
calculated monthly from the Closing Date at a rate of 2.00% per annum, less
any amount deducted pursuant to Section 2.5(2) or 6.2(c), by payment on the
first anniversary of the Closing Date or, if such day is not a Business Day,
the next following Business Day of such net amount by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to a single account, as directed by the Vendors'
Representative; and

immediately available funds to a single account, as directed by the Vendors'
Representative.

(2)

|

From time to time from and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall be
entitled to satisfy any claim for indemnification made against the Vendors or
any of them under this Agreement and the Vendors' Non-Competition Agreements,
for breach of representation, warranty or covenant hereunder or thereunder or
otherwise by making a set-off or deduction equal to the amount of any such
claim, together with interest thereon from time to time from the Closing Date

zoning of any of the Real Property and the Vendors are not aware of any
proposed or pending change to any zoning affecting the Real Property; (v) to

comprising the Real Property are free of any material structural defect and
the heating, ventilating, plumbing, drainage, electrical and air conditioning
systems and all other systems used in the Real Property are in good working
order and none of such buildings, structures or other tangible assets are in
need of maintenance or repairs except for routine maintenance and repairs in
the Ordinary Course; (viii) to the knowledge of the Vendors, all Permitted
Encumbrances which are easements or registered agreements or restrictions are
in good standing. Reliance Industrial, and, if relevant, each other Person who
is a party thereto, has performed all obligations required to be performed by
it thereunder and is not in breach or default in any respect thereunder nor
has there occurred any event nor does there exist any condition which, in
either case, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time, or both, would
constitute such a breach or default; and (ix) to the knowledge of the Vendors,
there are no matters affecting the right, title and interest of Reliance
Industrial in and to the Real Property 

or which, in the aggregate, would adversely affect the ability to carry on the

accordance with law for the Vendor Tax Period and if this net tax is a
positive amount, the Vendors shall pay this amount to the Purchaser within

Sales Tax Straddle Return is a negative amount, the Purchaser shall pay this
amount, as if it were a positive number, to the Vendors within five (5)
Business Days after filing this Sales Tax Straddle Return. For the sake of

The following procedures shall apply to claims for indemnification under this
Agreement: 

 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

in the event that a party entitled to indemnification hereunder shall incur or
suffer any Losses (or shall reasonably anticipate that it shall suffer any
Losses) in respect of which indemnification may be sought by such party (an
"Indemnified Party") from a party providing indemnification hereunder (each,
an "Indemnifying Party"), the Indemnified Party shall submit to the
Indemnifying Party written notice (an "Indemnification Notice") stating the
nature and basis of such claim including, to the extent it is then known, a
description in reasonable detail of the facts giving rise to the claim for
indemnification hereunder and (if known) the amount or the method of
computation of the amount of such claim, and a reference to the provisions of
this Agreement upon which such claim is based; provided, however, that the
failure of the Indemnified Party to give the Indemnification Notice shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability that the Indemnifying Party
may have to the Indemnified Party. In the case of Losses arising by reason of
any third-party claim, the Indemnification Notice shall be given within thirty
(30) days after receipt by the Indemnified Party of the filing or other
written assertion of any such claim against the Indemnified Party, but the
failure of the Indemnified Party to give the Indemnification Notice within
such time period shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability
that the Indemnifying Party may have to the Indemnified Party; and 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

in the case of third-party claims with respect to which an Indemnification
Notice is given, the Indemnifying Party shall have the option at its own
expense: (i) to conduct any proceedings or negotiations in connection
therewith; (ii) to take all other steps to settle or defend any such claim;
and (iii) to employ counsel of the Indemnifying Party's choosing and approved
by the Indemnified Party, acting reasonably, to contest any such claim in the
name of the Indemnified Party or otherwise. The Indemnifying Party may not
compromise or settle any claim without the Indemnified Party's prior written
consent, which may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to participate at its own expense and by its own
counsel in any proceedings relating to any third-party claim and the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate with counsel of its own
choice at the expense of the Indemnifying Party if, on the written advice of
legal counsel, representation of both parties by the same counsel presents a
conflict of interest or is otherwise inappropriate under applicable standards
of professional conduct. The Indemnifying Party shall, within ten (10) days of
receipt of the Indemnification Notice, notify the Indemnified Party of its
intention to assume the defense of any such claim. If the Indemnifying Party
shall decline to assume the defense of any such claim, or shall fail to notify
the Indemnified Party within ten (10) days after receipt of the
Indemnification Notice of the Indemnifying Party's election to defend such
claim or fails to diligently defend such claim after electing to assume
conduct, the Indemnified Party shall defend such claim and the expenses of all
proceedings, contests or lawsuits in respect of any such claims shall be borne
in full by the Indemnifying Party 

 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

or in part, of fraud, wilful misconduct or intentional non-disclosure or
misrepresentation, in which event the liability of the Vendors shall be
unlimited.

apply) unless and until the Purchaser or the Vendors, as applicable, has or
have suffered, incurred, sustained or become subject to Losses in excess of
$100,000 individually or on a cumulative basis, in which case the Purchaser or
the Vendors, as the case may be, may bring a claim for all Losses.

contest such potential disclosure.



| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

Each Vendor shall use reasonable commercial efforts to protect the security
and confidential nature of any Confidential Information in its possession or
control, which efforts shall not be less than those that a reasonable person

7.5 Reasonable Restrictions

Each Vendor acknowledges and agrees that all restrictions in this Article 7,
including the time and geographic limitations, are necessary and fundamental
for the protection of the Purchaser and the Targets and are reasonable and
valid. Each Vendor also covenants not to do or perform any act or attempt to
do any act whatsoever that will, or would, directly or indirectly, circumvent
any or all of the restrictions in this Article 7, which circumvention would
have a material effect in avoiding or denying the intent of, and protection

|

the business of the Targets are carried on throughout the Business Territory
and the Targets solicit and canvass opportunities throughout the Business
Territory; 

 

| 
---|---

7.6 Enforcement



| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

Each Vendor acknowledges and recognizes that a breach by it of any of the
covenants herein contained might result in damages to the Purchaser and the
Targets and that the Purchaser and the Targets may not adequately be
compensated for such damages by monetary award. Accordingly, each Vendor
agrees that, in the event of any such breach, in addition to any other
remedies available to the Purchaser at law or in equity, the Purchaser will be
entitled to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for such relief by way
of restraining order, injunction, decree or otherwise, as may be appropriate
to ensure compliance with the provisions of this Article 7. 

 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

If a Vendor breaches any of the covenants set forth in this Article 7, then,
in addition to any other remedies that the Purchaser may otherwise be entitled
to, the Purchaser shall be entitled to recover from the Vendor under the
principle of accounting for profits and unjust enrichment. To determine the
remedies and amount to which the Purchaser may be entitled, each Vendor agrees
that a court of 

competent jurisdiction may order an appropriate accounting from the Vendor and
the other parties subject to the covenants set forth in this Agreement.



7.7 Severability

Each provision of this Article 7 is declared to constitute an entirely
separate and distinct independent covenant. If any provision of this Article 7
is determined to be void or unenforceable in whole or in part or held not to
be valid as going beyond what is reasonable for the protection of the
interests of the Purchaser or any other reason whatsoever but would be valid
if part of the wording were deleted or altered or its extent, duration or
geographic scope reduced or modified, then such restriction will apply with
such reduction in extent, duration or geographic scope, modification, deletion
or alteration as may be necessary to make it enforceable and any court with
jurisdiction over the parties shall so reform this Article 7\. Similarly, if
any such restriction is determined to be void or unenforceable in whole or in
part, it will be deemed not to affect or impair the validity of any other
covenant or provision, and the foregoing paragraphs and portions thereof are
declared to be separate and distinct covenants, the parties hereby
acknowledging and agreeing that the restrictions contained herein are
necessary and fundamental to the protection of the Purchaser and are
reasonable and valid and that the duration, extent and application of each
such restriction are no greater than is necessary or commensurate with the
protection of the legitimate interests of the Purchaser and the Targets and
the value of business of the Targets. Each Vendor further covenants that in
the event this Article 7 is determined to be void or unenforceable in whole or
in part, it will execute any substantially similar document to replace any
such void or unenforceable provision(s) with valid and enforceable
provision(s) that will achieve, to the extent possible, the intent of such
provision(s). Each Vendor hereby waives all defenses which exist as of the
date of this Agreement as to the formation and enforceability of the
provisions of this Article 7 in accordance with its terms. In addition to the
above, each Vendor acknowledges that it does not object to the grant of
injunctive relief as a remedy, as appropriate, for the breach of its
obligations under this Article 7 and acknowledges such grant of injunctive
relief may be necessary for the reasonable and legitimate protection of the
Purchaser.

by electronic communication.



9.12 Severability

If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate

right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement.



9.14 Counterparts; Facsimile

This Agreement may be executed and delivered in one or more counterparts and
via facsimile, and by the Parties in separate counterparts, each of which when
executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.



9.15 Waiver

Subject to the limitations contained in this Agreement, the failure of a party
to require performance of any provision hereof shall not affect its right at a
later time to enforce the same. No waiver by a party of any term, covenant,
representation or warranty contained herein shall be effective unless in
writing. No such waiver in any one instance shall be deemed a further or
continuing waiver of any such term, covenant, representation or warranty in
any other instance.

all or any part of the shares or other securities of any Target or Vendor in
any manner whatsoever (whether directly or indirectly) by sale, merger, take-
over bid, amalgamation, reorganization, exchange or otherwise. The Vendors
