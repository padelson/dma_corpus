                               SPIN OFF AND MERGER

         Section 2.01 THE SPIN OFF. Prior to the Effective Time, on the Closing

consummating the transactions contemplated thereby and delivering, or causing to
be delivered, to the Exchange Agent a certificate (the "SPIN OFF STOCK

Record Date (other than treasury shares). The Exchange Agent shall hold the
shares of Newco Common Stock represented by the Spin Off Stock Certificate for
the P&G Shareholders on the Record Date. Except as directed by P&G in its sole
discretion, the shares of Newco Common Stock represented by the Spin Off Stock
Certificate shall not be transferable and the Exchange Agent shall not deliver
any shares of Newco Common Stock represented by the Spin Off Stock Certificate
to any P&G Shareholder.

         Section 2.02 THE MERGER.

         (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement,
Newco will be merged (the "MERGER") with and into JMS in accordance with the
provisions of the Ohio Corporation Law. Following the Merger, JMS will continue
as the surviving corporation (the "SURVIVING CORPORATION") and the separate
corporate existence of Newco will cease.

         (b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the consummation of the Spin Off and the Merger (the "CLOSING") will
take place at the offices of P&G, at 10:00 a.m., local time on the fifth
Business Day following satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VII hereof (other than those conditions, including the Spin Off, that by
their nature or pursuant to the terms of this Agreement are to be satisfied at
the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, where permitted, the waiver of
those conditions), or at such other date, time or place as P&G and JMS may
agree. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to as the "CLOSING
DATE."

         (c) The Merger will be consummated by the filing of a certificate of
merger (the "CERTIFICATE OF MERGER") with the Secretary of State of the State of
Ohio in accordance with Section 1701.78 of the Ohio Corporation Law. The time
that the Merger becomes effective in accordance with Section 1701.78 of the Ohio
Corporation Law is referred to in this Agreement as the "EFFECTIVE TIME."

         (d) The Merger will have the effects set forth in the Ohio Corporation
Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as of the Effective Time,
all properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Newco and JMS will
vest in the Surviving Corporation and all debts, liabilities and duties of Newco
and JMS will become debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

         Section 2.03 ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND CODE OF REGULATIONS. The
articles of incorporation and code of regulations of the Surviving Corporation
as of the Effective Time shall be in the form of the articles of incorporation
and code of regulations of JMS as in effect as of

                                      -8-

the date hereof and as further amended so as to provide (a) that the provisions
of paragraph (a) of Division II of Article IV of the amended articles of
incorporation apply only to the voting of shares with respect to the matters set
forth on Schedule 2.03 hereto, and (b) that as to all other matters as to which
holders of shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock are entitled to vote,
each outstanding share of Surviving Corporation Common Stock shall entitle the
holder to one vote for such share of Surviving Corporation Common Stock with
respect to each such other matter and (c) for such other amendments not
affecting or related to the voting power of shares of Surviving Corporation
Common Stock, as P&G and JMS shall mutually agree within ten Business Days of
the date hereof.

         Section 2.04 DIRECTORS. The directors of JMS at the Effective Time will
be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and will hold office from
the Effective Time until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified in the manner provided by the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or as otherwise provided
by Law.

         Section 2.05 OFFICERS. The officers of JMS at the Effective Time will

incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or as otherwise provided
by Law.

                                  ARTICLE III

                    CONVERSION OF SHARES AND RELATED MATTERS

         Section 3.01 CONVERSION OF CAPITAL STOCK. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Newco, JMS or the
holders of the following securities:

         (a) Each share of Newco Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Newco Common Stock to be
cancelled pursuant to Section 3.01(b) or as to which appraisal rights are
perfected in accordance with Section 3.05) shall be converted, subject to
Section 3.02(e), into the right to receive one-fiftieth (1/50th) of a share of
the common stock of the Surviving Corporation, without par value ("SURVIVING
CORPORATION COMMON STOCK"). Following the Effective Time, all shares of Newco
Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled
and retired and shall cease to exist.

         (b) Each share of Newco Common Stock owned by JMS or any direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of JMS (other than, in each case, trust
accounts, managed accounts, custodial accounts and the like that are
beneficially owned by third parties) immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and no
payment shall be made with respect thereto.

         (c) Intentionally Omitted.

         (d) Each share of JMS Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to

                                      -9-
<PAGE>   15

the Effective Time will, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, be converted into (i) that number of shares of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock equal to the Applicable Percentage of a share
of Surviving Corporation Common Stock and (ii) to the extent that one or more of
the Supplemental Rulings are not obtained in whole or in part, the Cash Amount.
Each JMS Option shall remain outstanding and the terms of each such JMS Option
shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect the conversion of the JMS Common
Stock.

         (e) The "APPLICABLE PERCENTAGE" shall mean a fraction, the numerator of
which is the product obtained by multiplying (1) the quotient obtained by
dividing (i) the total number of shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock to
be issued upon the conversion of the Newco Common Stock pursuant to Section
3.01(a) by (ii) the sum of (xx) the product obtained by multiplying the total
number of shares of JMS Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the "OLD JMS SHARES") and 1.1070 and (yy) the Applicable Number,
and (2) the difference obtained by subtracting the Applicable Number from the
Old JMS Shares; and the denominator of which is the Old JMS Shares. For
illustrative purposes, the Applicable Percentage is set forth as a formula on
Schedule 3.01(e) hereto. The Applicable Percentage shall be expressed as a
decimal and shall be rounded to the fourth decimal place. To the extent all of
the Supplemental Rulings are obtained in whole, the Applicable Number shall be
zero.

         (f) The "CASH AMOUNT" shall mean, to the extent that one or more of the
Supplemental Rulings are not obtained in whole or in part, the quotient obtained
by dividing (i) the product obtained by multiplying (x) the Applicable Number by
(y) a cash price equal to the average closing price for the JMS Common Stock on
the NYSE for the five Trading Days ending two Trading Days prior to the
Effective Time by (ii) the Old JMS Shares.

         (g) The "APPLICABLE NUMBER" shall mean, to the extent that one or more
of the Supplemental Rulings are not obtained in whole or in part, that number of
shares of JMS Common Stock that P&G determines in good faith and in its sole
discretion is required to be effectively redeemed by JMS through the Cash Amount
in (f) above in order to, together with the corresponding formulaic adjustment
to the Applicable Percentage in (e) above, reverse the potential tax effects of
failing to obtain any of the Supplemental Rulings in whole or in part (i.e. by
providing that the holders of shares of Newco Common Stock, as a group, and the
holders of Old JMS Shares, as a group, receive the same relative proportion of
the Surviving Corporation Common Stock to be issued in the Merger that they
would have received if the Supplemental Rulings had been obtained). For
avoidance of doubt, the parties intend that the Applicable Number be set so as
to reverse one half of the potential tax effects of failing to obtain any of the
Supplemental Rulings and that the balance of such effects are to be reversed
through the formulaic adjustment of the Applicable Percentage in (e) above.

         Section 3.02 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.

         (a) Prior to the Closing, P&G shall appoint a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to JMS as exchange agent (the "EXCHANGE AGENT") for the
purpose of holding the Spin Off Stock Certificate on behalf of the P&G
Shareholders on the Record Date and for exchanging the Spin Off Stock
Certificate and the Old Certificates for certificates representing that number
of shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock that are to be issued pursuant
to Section 3.01 hereof and cash for payment of the Cash Amount. The costs and
expenses of the

                                      -10-
<PAGE>   16

Exchange Agents shall be borne by Newco.

         (b) As soon as practicable, but in any event no later than 5 Business
Days following the Effective Time, JMS shall deposit with the Exchange Agent as
nominee for the benefit of the holders of Newco Common Stock and JMS Common
Stock, certificates representing the shares of Surviving Corporation Common
Stock (such shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock, together with cash for
payment of the Cash Amount and any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto being hereinafter referred to as the "EXCHANGE FUND") to be issued
pursuant to Sections 3.01(a) and 3.01(d).

         (c) The Exchange Agent shall, as soon as practicable, but in any event
no later than 10 days following the Effective Time, distribute to each holder of
shares of Newco Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
holders of shares of Newco Common Stock that are cancelled pursuant to Section
3.01(b)) and each holder of shares of JMS Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time (i) certificates representing the whole number of shares of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock into which the shares of Newco Common Stock
or JMS Common Stock, as the case may be, held by such Person have been converted
in accordance with Section 3.01(a) and Section 3.01(d), (ii) the amount of
dividends or other distributions, if any, with a record date on or after the
Effective Time which theretofore became payable with respect to such shares of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock and (iii) the Cash Amount, in each case which
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article
III, and the Spin Off Stock Certificate and the Old Certificates shall forthwith
be cancelled. In no event shall the holder of any shares of Newco Common Stock
or JMS Common Stock be entitled to receive interest on any funds to be received
in the Merger. From and after the Effective Time, the interest of the holders of
the Newco Common Stock immediately prior to the Merger in the Spin Off Stock
Certificate and the interest of the holders of shares of JMS Common Stock
immediately prior to the merger in the Old Certificates shall be limited to the
right to receive only (i) the whole number of shares of Surviving Corporation
Common Stock into which the shares of Newco Common Stock or JMS Common Stock
held by such Person have been converted in accordance with Sections 3.01(a) and
3.01(d), (ii) the amount of dividends or other distributions, if any, with a
record date on or after the Effective Time which theretofore became payable with
respect to such shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock, (iii) the Cash
Amount and (iv) the cash amount payable in lieu of fractional shares of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.02(e).

         (d) All shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock issued upon
conversion of shares of Newco Common Stock or JMS Common Stock in accordance
with the terms hereof (including the Cash Amount paid pursuant to Section
3.02(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued at the Effective Time in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Newco Common Stock or
JMS Common Stock.

         (e) In lieu of any such fractional shares of Surviving Corporation
Common Stock, each holder of shares of Newco Common Stock or JMS Common Stock
who would otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of a share of Surviving
Corporation Common Stock in exchange for such shares of Newco Common Stock or
JMS Common Stock (after taking into account all shares of Newco Common Stock or
JMS Common Stock held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time)
shall receive from the Exchange Agent, as applicable, a cash payment in

                                      -11-
<PAGE>   17

lieu of such fractional share of Surviving Corporation Common Stock. The cash
payment will be the amount whereby the Exchange Agent shall receive a number of
whole shares that represent the fractional shares, sells such shares and
distributes the proceeds to the holder of the Newco Common Stock and JMS Common
Stock who would otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of a share of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock (such amount not to exceed the value of one
share of Surviving Corporation Common Stock).

         (f) JMS shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the shares of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock any dividends and distributions thereon and
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock
otherwise payable hereunder to any holder of shares of Newco Common Stock such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to making of such
payment under any provisions of Federal, state, local or foreign income tax Law.
To the extent that JMS so withholds those amounts, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the shares of Newco Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by JMS.

         Section 3.03 APPRAISAL RIGHTS. Holders of JMS Common Stock that are
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held
by a holder who has not voted those shares in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement, who shall have delivered a written demand for appraisal of those
shares in accordance with the Ohio Corporation Law and who, as of the Effective
Time, shall not have effectively withdrawn or lost this right to appraisal (the
"DISSENTING SHARES") shall be entitled to those rights (but only those rights)
as are granted by Section 1701.85 of the Ohio Corporation Law. Each holder of
Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled to payment for those Dissenting Shares
pursuant to Section 1701.85 of the Ohio Corporation Law shall receive payment
from the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the Ohio Corporation Law;
provided, however, that (i) if any holder of Dissenting Shares shall have failed
to establish their entitlement to appraisal rights as provided in Section
1701.85 of the Ohio Corporation Law, (ii) if any holder of Dissenting Shares
shall have effectively withdrawn the holder's demand for appraisal of the
holder's shares or lost the holder's right to appraisal and payment for the
holder's shares under Section 1701.85 of the Ohio Corporation Law or (iii) if
neither any holder of Dissenting Shares nor the Surviving Corporation shall have
filed a petition demanding a determination of the value of all Dissenting Shares
within the time provided in Section 1701.85 of the Ohio Corporation Law, the
holder shall forfeit the right to appraisal of those Dissenting Shares and each
Dissenting Share shall be exchanged pursuant to Section 3.01 of this Agreement.

Adverse Effect.

         Section 5.02 AUTHORIZATION AND VALIDITY OF AGREEMENT. JMS has full
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the

                           competent Governmental Entity;

                  (ii)     which would otherwise reasonably be expected to cause

         Section 5.16 JMS RIGHTS AGREEMENT. None of the execution and delivery

connection with this Agreement or any of the Transactions.

         Section 5.18 TAX TREATMENT. None of JMS or any of its Subsidiaries have

Adverse Effect: (i) each trademark, trade name, brand name, service mark or
other trade designation used, owned or licensed by or to JMS or any of its
Subsidiaries, each patent, copyright and similar intellectual property owned or
licensed to or by JMS and each license, royalty, assignment or other similar

is material to the conduct of the business of JMS and its Subsidiaries taken as
a whole; and (ii) each agreement relating to technology, know-how or processes
that JMS or its Subsidiaries is licensed or authorized to use, or which it

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY"). No consent of third parties will be required for the
use of the JMS Intellectual Property after the Effective Time, except where the
failure to obtain such consent would not have or reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a JMS Material Adverse Effect. No claim has
been asserted by any Person against JMS or any of its Subsidiaries regarding the
ownership of or the right to use any JMS Intellectual Property or challenging
the rights of JMS or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any of the JMS
Intellectual Property which would have or reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a JMS Material Adverse Effect.

                           Agreement, except, in every case, as may be required

                           foregoing actions.

         Section 6.03 EFFORTS TO CLOSE; ANTITRUST CLEARANCE.

         (a) P&G and JMS will use their reasonable best efforts to cause all of
the conditions, as specified in Article VII of this Agreement, to the
obligations of the other to consummate the Transactions to be met as soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement.

         (b) P&G and JMS will comply fully with all applicable notification,
reporting and other requirements. P&G and JMS, within ten (10) Business Days
after the date of this Agreement, will file the required notifications with the
appropriate Governmental Entities pursuant to and in compliance with the
respective Antitrust Laws. P&G and JMS will as soon as practicable file any
additional information reasonably requested by any Governmental Entity.

         (c) P&G and JMS will each use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, as
soon as practicable, the Authorizations that may be or become necessary for the
performance of its obligations under this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements
and the consummation of the Transactions and will cooperate fully with each
other in promptly seeking to obtain such Authorizations.

         (d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the
parties contained in this Section 6.03, each of P&G and JMS shall use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections if any, as may be asserted
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law. In
connection with the foregoing, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any

                                      -24-
<PAGE>   30

Antitrust Law, each of P&G and JMS shall cooperate in all respects with each
other and use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any
such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned,
any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, including,
without limitation, vigorously defending in litigation on the merits any claim
asserted in any court by any party through a final and nonappealable judgment.

         (e) If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law or if any suit is instituted by any
Governmental Entity or any other Person challenging any of the transactions
contemplated hereby as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of P&G and JMS shall
use its reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections or challenge as such
Governmental Entity or other Person may have to such transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each
of P&G and JMS (and to the extent required by any Governmental Entity, its
respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates over which it exercises control) shall be
required to pursue a resolution with any Governmental Entity and if acceptable
to any Governmental Entity, enter into a settlement, undertaking, consent
decree, stipulation or other agreement with such Governmental Entity regarding
antitrust matters in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (each a "SETTLEMENT"). Notwithstanding anything else contained in this
Agreement, neither P&G nor JMS shall be required to enter into any Settlement
that requires P&G or JMS to sell or otherwise dispose of the Jif/Crisco Assets
(as defined in the Contribution Agreement) or any assets of JMS and its
Subsidiaries (any such action, a "DIVESTITURE") if such Divestiture would have a
material adverse effect on the pro forma combined business of Newco (after the
Contribution) and JMS.

         Section 6.04 CONFIDENTIALITY.

         (a) The parties acknowledge that in connection with the Transactions,
the parties have disclosed to each other technical and business information
which the parties consider proprietary and confidential. This information may
include, by way of example and without limitation, new products, commercial
plans, financial projections, technical or non-technical data, financial data,
know-how, formulae, processes, patterns, strategies, compilations, programs,
devices, methods, techniques, drawings, designs, sketches, photographs, plans,
specifications, samples, reports, pricing information, lists of actual or
potential customers and suppliers, studies, findings, inventions, ideas, and
trade secrets. Such information is herein referred to as the "INFORMATION." The
parties agree that, after the Effective Time, Information relating to the
Jif/Crisco Business shall be Information of the Surviving Corporation and P&G
shall be deemed to be the Receiving Party of such Information for purposes of
Section 6.04(b).

         (b) Each party receiving Information (the "RECEIVING PARTY") recognizes
and acknowledges (i) that Information of the other party may be commercially
valuable proprietary products of such party, the design and development of which
may have involved the expenditure of substantial amounts of money and the use of
skilled development experts over a long period of time and which afford such
party a commercial advantage over its competitors; (ii) that the loss of this
competitive advantage due to unauthorized disclosure or use of Information of
such party may cause great injury and harm to such party; and (iii) that the
restrictions imposed upon the

                                      -25-
<PAGE>   31

parties under this Section 6.04 are necessary to protect the secrecy of
Information and to prevent the occurrence of such injury and harm. The parties
agree that:

                  (i)      disclosure of Information will be received and held
                           in confidence by the Receiving Party and that such
                           Receiving Party will not, without the prior written
                           consent of the party from whom such Information was
                           obtained (the "DISCLOSING PARTY"), disclose, divulge
                           or permit any unauthorized person to obtain any
                           Information disclosed by the Disclosing Party
                           (whether or not such Information is in written or
                           tangible form);

                  (ii)     the Receiving Party will take such steps as may be
                           reasonably necessary to prevent the disclosure of
                           Information to others; and

                  (iii)    the Receiving Party will use the Information only in
                           connection with the Transactions unless otherwise
                           authorized in writing by the Disclosing Party.

         (c) The commitments set forth above shall not extend to any portion of
Information:

                  (i)      which is already known to the Receiving Party, or is
                           information generally available to the public; or

                  (ii)     which, hereafter, through no act on the part of the
                           Receiving Party becomes generally available to the
                           public; or

                  (iii)    which corresponds in substance to a disclosure
                           furnished to the Receiving Party by any third party
                           having a bona fide right to do so and not having any
                           confidential obligation, direct or indirect, to the
                           Disclosing Party with respect to the same; or

                  (iv)     which is required to be disclosed by Law, provided
                           that the Receiving Party provides reasonable prior
                           written notice of such required disclosure to the
                           Disclosing Party.

         The commitments set forth in this Section 6.04 shall promptly and
automatically terminate in their entirety upon the lapse of a period of three
(3) years from the Closing Date.

         Section 6.05 COOPERATION IN LITIGATION. For a period of three (3) years
after the Effective Time, P&G and JMS will, in the defense of any third-party
Action relating to the Jif/Crisco Business, make available during normal
business hours, but without unreasonably disrupting their respective businesses,
all personnel and records of the Jif/Crisco Business reasonably necessary to
permit the effective defense or investigation of such Action. If information
other than that pertaining to the Jif/Crisco Business is contained in such
records, P&G and JMS will either agree that such information may be omitted or
redacted by the producing party, or will enter into appropriate secrecy
commitments to protect such information.

         Section 6.06 COOPERATION IN TAX MATTERS.

         (a) Following the Effective Time, neither JMS nor its Affiliates
(including the

                                      -26-
<PAGE>   32

Surviving Corporation) shall take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail
to take any action or fail to cause any action to be taken, which action or
failure to act could (i) cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization
under Section 368(a) of the Code, or (ii) cause (x) gain or loss to be
recognized by the P&G Shareholders in the Spin Off, or (y) gain or loss to be
recognized by P&G in the Spin Off.

         (b) P&G and JMS will make available to each other during normal
business hours, but without unreasonably disrupting their respective businesses,
all personnel and records of the Jif/Crisco Business reasonably necessary in
connection with the filing of any Tax Return, amended return or claim for
refund; determining a liability for Taxes or a right to refund for Taxes; or in
conducting an audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes.

         (c) P&G and JMS will each use its reasonable best efforts to enable P&G
to prepare and submit, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, such
submissions as are reasonably necessary to obtain the letter ruling referred to
in Section 7.03(d). P&G and JMS will cooperate in good faith with each other in
making such submissions, including by allowing each other to receive and comment
upon all such materials. The parties further agree that the parties will further
seek a letter ruling to the effect that (i) any Surviving Corporation Common
Stock acquired by employees or directors of Surviving Corporation after the
Merger in connection with the performance of services for Surviving Corporation
in a transaction to which Section 83 of the Code applies, including without
limitation pursuant to the exercise of stock options, whether granted before or
after the Merger, and that is not excessive by reference to the services
performed, will not be treated for purposes of Section 355(e) as acquired as
part of plan or series of related transactions that includes the Spin Off; (ii)
fractional shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock sold by the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 3.02(e) will be treated for purposes of applying
Section 355(e) as received by the Newco Shareholders and then disposed of in
transactions which qualify under Safe Harbor V of Reg. 1.355-7T(e) or which
otherwise are not treated for purposes of Section 355(e) as part of a plan or
series of related transactions that includes the Spin Off; and (iii) for
purposes of applying Section 355(e) all shares of Surviving Corporation Common
Stock received by the ESOP in the Merger which are unallocated shares, will be
taken into account in determining the percentage of Surviving Corporation Common
stock (as successor the Newco) described in Section 355(e)(3)(A)(ii) and (iii)
and the subsequent disposition by the ESOP of such stock will be treated as
pursuant to transactions that qualify under Safe Harbor V of Reg. 1.355-7T(e) or
which otherwise are not treated for purposes of Section 355(e) as part of a plan
or series of related transactions that includes the Spin Off. The rulings
described in clauses (i) through (iii) above are collectively referred to as
"SUPPLEMENTAL RULINGS."

         Section 6.07 COOPERATION OF THIRD PARTIES. Where the cooperation of
third parties such as insurers or trustees would be necessary in order for a
party hereto to completely fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, such party will use its reasonable best efforts to cause
such third parties to provide such cooperation.

         Section 6.08 ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS. From time to time after the
Effective Time, P&G and JMS will, and will cause their officers, attorneys,
accountants and other respective representatives and Affiliates to, execute and
deliver, without further consideration, such documents as any of them may
reasonably request, in such form as may be appropriate, if

                                      -27-
<PAGE>   33

necessary or advisable in connection with the consummation of the Transactions.

         Section 6.09 ACCESS. From the date hereof to the Effective Time, each
of P&G and JMS shall allow all designated officers, attorneys, accountants and
other representatives of P&G or JMS, as the case may be, access at reasonable
times upon reasonable notice and in a manner as will not adversely impact the
conduct of the business of either party or the Jif/Crisco Business to the
personnel, records files, correspondence, audits and properties, as well as to
all information relating to commitments, contracts, titles and financial
position, or otherwise pertaining to the business and affairs of the Jif/Crisco
Business and JMS and its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, including inspection
of such properties; provided that no investigation pursuant to this Section 6.09
shall affect any representation or warranty given by any party hereunder, and
provided further that notwithstanding the provision of information or
investigation by any party, no party shall be deemed to make any representation
or warranty except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no party shall be required to provide any information which it
reasonably believes it may not provide to the other party by reason of
applicable Law, which such party reasonably believes constitutes information
protected by attorney/client privilege, or which it is required to keep
confidential by reason of Contracts with third parties. The parties hereto will
make reasonable and appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. Each of
P&G and JMS agrees that it will not, and will cause its respective
representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this Section
6.09 for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the Transactions All
information provided by a party to the other party hereunder shall be subject to
the confidentiality provisions of Section 6.04.

         Section 6.10 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. P&G and JMS will consult with each
other before issuing any press releases or otherwise making any public
statements with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions and neither of
them shall issue any such press release or make any such public statement

obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange.

effective from the Closing, to the Employees, as soon as reasonably practicable

to the Employees Following the Effective Time, any such person who accepts such
offer prior to the Effective Time (each, a "NEWCO EMPLOYEE") shall continue in
the employment of the Surviving Corporation. Subject to paragraph (f) hereof,
and clauses (i) and (iii) of this sentence below, the terms and conditions of

                           Employees upon the terms set forth in the JMS
                           salaried short term disability plan as in effect on
                           the date hereof, (b) life insurance for each Newco
                           Employee in an amount equal to one years' salary, (c)
                           vacation accrual as provided for under the JMS
                           vacation policy; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no Newco
                           Employee will be entitled to a lower vacation accrual
                           than he or she is entitled to under the P&G plan as
                           in effect on the date hereof, and (d) all other
                           compensation and insurance benefits which are
                           provided to employees of JMS and its Subsidiaries on
                           the Closing Date.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, JMS acknowledges its obligations to comply with
Laws regarding any changes in benefits to which the Employees who are covered by
the collective bargaining agreement for the Ivorydale facility were entitled
prior to the Closing Date.

JMS agrees to cause the terms and conditions of employment of any Newco Employee
not to be changed in a manner that is unfavorable to such Newco Employee
(including but not limited to termination or layoff, other than termination for
cause and company wide terminations due to reductions in demand affecting the
business of the Surviving Corporation) for at least one year after the Effective
Time.

         (b) Cessation of Participation in P&G Plans. As of the Effective Time,
neither the Surviving Corporation nor any Newco Employees shall continue to
participate in, be a member of or have any rights under any employee benefit
plan or arrangement of P&G or any of its Affiliates (except rights that
Surviving Corporation and Newco Employees may have under any such plan or
arrangement relating to participation therein prior to the Effective Time), and
P&G and the Surviving Corporation shall take, or cause to be taken, all such
action as may be necessary to effect the cessation of participation of the
Surviving Corporation and Newco Employees as of the Effective Time.

         (c) Transition Incentive Payments. JMS may, in its discretion, cause
the Surviving Corporation to offer one or more non-exempt Newco Employees a
transition payment to facilitate the transition of non-exempt Newco Employees to
JMS.

         (d) Employee Transition. P&G and JMS will use reasonable best efforts
to cause the Employees to maintain their employment in the Jif/Crisco Business.
P&G or any of its Affiliates will, however, have no liability nor make any
representation or warranty on the employment decisions of the Employees
whatsoever. JMS, P&G and Newco shall cooperate with each other in facilitating
the transition of Newco Employees from the plans, programs and arrangements of
P&G and its Affiliates to the plans, programs and arrangements of JMS and its
Affiliates, including but not limited to (i) meeting with the Employees at such
times as shall be agreed in advance by P&G and JMS and (ii) distributing to the
Employees such forms and other documents relating thereto as JMS shall
reasonably request. To the extent permitted by Law, P&G will make available to
JMS all information regarding the Employees in its possession as

                                      -29-
<PAGE>   35

may be reasonably requested to assist JMS in such transition. Where provisions
in this Agreement would require the cooperation of third parties such as
insurers or trustees, JMS and P&G agree to take reasonable best efforts to cause
such third parties to cooperate with JMS.

         (e) Certain Employee Liabilities. JMS and P&G acknowledge that (i) P&G
and its Affiliates shall be responsible for all liabilities and obligations
relating to the Newco Employees and their dependents that arise or are incurred
on or before the day on which the Effective Time occurs, whether or not reported
as of the Effective Time, and (ii) JMS and its Affiliates shall be responsible
for all liabilities and obligations relating to the Newco Employees and their
dependents that arise or are incurred after the day on which the Effective Time
occurs. For purposes of medical, dental, health and life insurance benefits, a
liability or obligation shall be deemed to have arisen or to have been incurred
upon the incurrence by a Newco Employee or dependent of a qualified expense for
which reimbursement or payment is sought. As soon as practicable following the
first anniversary of the Closing Date, P&G shall reimburse JMS for the costs and
expense incurred by JMS, if any, relating to any Newco Employee who is on
disability or other leave of absence and who is deemed not to have been an
Employee pursuant to this Agreement.

         (f) Credit for Seniority. JMS will cause to be extended to each Newco
Employee full credit for the entire period of continuous service preceding the
Effective Time rendered to P&G and Newco as if such service had occurred with
JMS, for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting under any of JMS's
and its Affiliates' benefit plans, pension, retirement and/or profit sharing
plans, insurance and vacation; provided, however, that this sentence shall not
apply to eligibility for equity-based compensation, and JMS shall, for this
purpose, be permitted to consider Newco Employees newly hired. JMS will further
cause to be extended full credit for service preceding the Effective Time
rendered to P&G and Newco by a Newco Employee (i) whose employment is terminated
by JMS at any time after the Effective Time for purposes of determining the
severance or other termination pay due to such terminated Newco Employee under
the applicable severance or termination plan or policy of JMS, if any, and (ii)
as to early retirement subsidies and the entitlement to higher levels of
benefits (such as matching combinations under a 401(k) plan, credits under a
cash balance plan and other similar benefits) in respect of service following
the Effective Time under any JMS pension and/or profit sharing plan, if any.

         Section 6.12 RESTRICTIONS ON SOLICITATION AND HIRING.

         (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the
Confidentiality Agreement, and except as P&G and JMS agree otherwise in writing,
JMS agrees that it will not (and JMS will cause its Affiliates not to), for a
period of two (2) years from the date of this Agreement, hire, or enter into any
form of consulting arrangement or agreement with, any employee, other than Newco
Employees, employed by P&G in P&G's Food and Beverage business as of the
Effective Time, or any other employee of P&G whom JMS came into contact with as
a result of the Transactions, nor will JMS (and JMS will cause its Affiliates
not to) solicit (other than by means of general advertisement not directed to
such employees) or otherwise induce any such employees of P&G to enter into any
type of employment or consulting arrangement or agreement that would be
prohibited by this Section 6.12(a). JMS acknowledges that (i) this provision is
reasonable, (ii) P&G would not enter into this Agreement without JMS

                                      -30-
<PAGE>   36

agreeing to and complying with this Section 6.12(a), (iii) P&G would suffer
irreparable harm upon JMS's violation of this provision and (iv) P&G shall be
entitled to obtain a temporary restraining order and/or injunction upon JMS's
breach of this provision.

         (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the
Confidentiality Agreement, and except as P&G and JMS agree otherwise in writing,
P&G agrees that it will not (and P&G will cause its Affiliates not to), for a
period of two (2) years from the date of this Agreement, hire, or enter into any
form of consulting arrangement or agreement with, any employee employed by JMS
as of the Effective Time, nor will P&G (and P&G will cause its Affiliates not
to) solicit (other than by means of general advertisement not directed to such
employees) or otherwise induce any such employees of JMS to enter into any type
of employment or consulting arrangement or agreement that would be prohibited by
this Section 6.12(b). P&G acknowledges that (i) this provision is reasonable,
(ii) JMS would not enter into this Agreement without P&G agreeing to and
complying with this Section 6.12(b), (iii) JMS would suffer irreparable harm
upon P&G's violation of this provision and (iv) JMS shall be entitled to obtain
a temporary restraining order and/or injunction upon P&G's breach of this
provision.

         Section 6.13 JMS SHAREHOLDER MEETING. JMS shall call and hold a meeting
of the JMS Shareholders (the "JMS SHAREHOLDER MEETING") as promptly as
practicable after the Merger Registration Statement shall have become effective
for the purpose of obtaining the JMS Shareholder Approval.

         Section 6.14 PREPARATION OF PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS; REGISTRATION
STATEMENT.

         (a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement,
(i) JMS shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
relating to the JMS Shareholder Meeting to be held in connection with the Merger
(the "PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS") and (ii) JMS shall prepare and file with the
SEC the Merger Registration Statement in which the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
shall be included as a prospectus, in connection with the registration under the
Securities Act of the shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock to be issued
to the holders of Newco Common Stock pursuant to the Merger. Prior to filing the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Merger Registration Statement with the SEC,
JMS will deliver to P&G for P&G's review and approval the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and the Merger Registration Statement (which approval will
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). JMS will use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Merger Registration Statement to become effective as
promptly as practicable, and, prior to the effective date of the Merger
Registration Statement, JMS shall take all or any Action required under any
applicable federal or state securities laws in connection with the issuance of
shares of JMS Common Stock in the Merger. JMS shall furnish all information
concerning it and the holders of its capital stock as required in connection
with such actions and the preparation of the Merger Registration Statement and
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. As promptly as practicable after the Merger
Registration Statement shall have become effective, JMS shall mail the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to the JMS Shareholders and the P&G Shareholders. The Proxy
Statement/Prospectus shall include the JMS Board Recommendation.

                                      -31-
<PAGE>   37

         (b) No amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Merger Registration Statement will be made by JMS without the consent of P&G
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). JMS will advise
P&G, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time which the Merger
Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment has
been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification
of the Surviving Corporation Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger
for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for
amendment of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Merger Registration Statement
or comments thereon and responses thereon or requests by the SEC for additional
information.

         (c) The information supplied by JMS for inclusion in the Merger
Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/ Prospectus shall not, at (i) the
time the Merger Registration Statement is declared effective, (ii) the time the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus (or any amendment thereof of supplement thereto) is
first mailed to the JMS Shareholders and the P&G Shareholders and (iii) the time
of the JMS Shareholder Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein not misleading. If at any time prior to the
Effective Time, any event or circumstances relating to JMS or any of its
Subsidiaries, or their respective officers or directors, should be discovered by
JMS and such information should be set forth in the Merger Registration
Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, JMS shall promptly inform P&G. All
documents that JMS is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the
Transactions will comply as to form and substance in all material aspects with
the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

         (d) P&G will provide JMS with the information concerning the Jif/Crisco
Business, including financial statements and other financial information, in the
form required to be included in the Merger Registration Statement and the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (including by reason of any SEC comments thereto or
subsequent requests thereon). Such information shall not, at (i) the time the
Merger Registration Statement is declared effective, (ii) the time the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (or any amendment thereof of supplement thereto) is first
mailed to the JMS Shareholders and the P&G Shareholders and (iii) the time of
the JMS Shareholder Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein not misleading. If at any time prior to the
Effective Time, any event or circumstance relating to P&G or any of its
Subsidiaries, or their respective officers or directors, should be discovered by
P&G and such information should be set forth in the Merger Registration
Statement or Proxy Statement/Prospectus, P&G shall promptly inform JMS. All
documents that P&G is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the
Transactions will comply as to form and substance in all material aspects with
the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

         Section 6.15 BOARD RECOMMENDATION. JMS's board of directors has made
the JMS Board Recommendation and shall, as promptly as practicable, cause JMS to
take all lawful action to solicit the JMS Shareholder Approval. Subject to
Section 6.16(d), neither the board of directors of JMS nor any committee thereof
shall withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse
to P&G, the JMS Board Recommendation, except as may be required by Law.

         Section 6.16 NO SOLICITATION.

         (a) JMS shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated and shall
not continue any discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Person conducted
before the date of this Agreement with respect to any Competing Transaction and,
without limitation, shall promptly, following the execution of this Agreement,
request the return of all confidential information provided by JMS to all
Persons who have had such discussions or negotiations or who have entered into
confidentiality agreements with JMS pertaining to a Competing Transaction.

         (b) JMS will not, and will cause its respective Affiliates and
representatives not to, directly or indirectly solicit, initiate, or encourage
any inquiries or proposals from, discuss or negotiate with, or provide any
non-public information to, any Person (other than P&G and its representatives)
relating to any transaction regarding (i) any merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination or other similar transaction or series of
transactions involving JMS, (ii) any sale, lease, exchange, transfer or other
disposition (including by way of merger, consolidation or share exchange), in a
single transaction or a series of related transactions, of any material portion
(which, for greater certainty, shall be deemed to be anything in excess of 20%
of book value) of the assets of JMS and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
(iii) any tender offer, exchange offer or similar transaction or series of
related transactions made by any Person or group of Persons, directly or
indirectly, involving the acquisition or lock-up of, or any acquisition by any
Person or group of Persons, directly or indirectly, of beneficial ownership of,
or the formation of any group of Persons to acquire beneficial ownership of,
that number of shares of JMS Common Stock which, when added to the number of
shares of JMS Common Stock then beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by
such Person or group of Persons, is 10% or more of the then outstanding shares
of JMS Common Stock, or (iv) any other substantially similar transaction or
series of related transactions that would hinder or delay the consummation of,
or otherwise defeat the purposes of, the Transactions (a "COMPETING
TRANSACTION").

         (c) JMS will promptly (and in any event within two calendar days)
advise P&G in writing of the receipt of any inquiries or proposals relating to a
Competing Transaction, including the identity of the Person submitting such
inquiry or proposal and the terms thereof.

         (d) Nothing contained in this Section 6.16 will prevent the board of
directors of JMS from taking, and disclosing to the JMS Shareholders, a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with
respect to any publicly announced unsolicited tender offer if, in its good faith
judgment based on the opinion of outside legal counsel, failure to so disclose
would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law; provided,
however, that the board of directors of JMS will not recommend that the JMS
Shareholders tender their shares of JMS Common Stock in connection with any such
tender offer unless (i) such tender offer is determined to be a Superior
Proposal, (ii) after consultation with

                                      -33-
<PAGE>   39

outside legal counsel, the board of directors of JMS concludes that failure to
do so would constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

         Section 6.17 NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN MATTERS. Each of P&G and JMS shall
give prompt written notice to the other of (i) any notice or other communication
from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required
in connection with the Transactions, (ii) any Action commenced or threatened in
writing against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting it or any of
its Subsidiaries that relate to the consummation of the Transactions, and (iii)
any change that is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Jif/Crisco Material Adverse Effect or reasonably likely to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a JMS Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be.

         Section 6.18 NYSE LISTING. JMS shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock to be issued in
connection with the Merger to be listed on the NYSE as of the Effective Time,
subject to official notice of issuance.

         Section 6.19 AFFILIATES. At least ten days prior to the mailing of the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, (i) P&G shall deliver to JMS a letter identifying
all persons who may be deemed to be Affiliates of Newco as of the date on which
P&G, as sole shareholder of Newco, approves and adopts the Merger (the "RULE 145
AFFILIATES") and (ii) P&G shall advise the persons identified in such letter of
the resale restrictions imposed by applicable securities law and shall use
reasonable best efforts to obtain from each person identified in such letter a
written agreement in customary form and substance.

         Section 6.20 ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS. The parties hereto agree to execute,
deliver and perform their respective obligations under each of the Ancillary
Agreements at or prior to the Effective Time.

         Section 6.21 CONSUMMATION OF THE SPIN OFF. P&G will use its reasonable
best efforts to consummate the Spin Off on the Closing Date.

                                      -34-
<PAGE>   40

         Section 6.22 COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE. For a period of 24 months after
the Closing Date, neither P&G nor any of its Affiliates shall, without the prior
consent of JMS, engage in the Geography in the manufacturing, packaging,
distributing and marketing of (i) peanut butter, peanut butter-based spreads for
human consumption and/or (ii) shortening and/or oil products for human
consumption (the "RESTRICTED BUSINESS"), and PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
foregoing shall not restrict P&G or its Affiliates from making any acquisition
of or investment in any business or Person (the "TARGET") if the annual net
sales attributable to the Restricted Business for the Target's most recent
fiscal year constitute less than 5% of the total net sales of the Target for
such year PROVIDED, FURTHER that if such net sales of the Restricted Business
for the Target's most recent fiscal year exceed $25 million, P&G shall sell or
otherwise dispose of the Restricted Business in a commercially reasonable manner
after the consummation of the acquisition of the Target. The parties agree that
the covenants included in this Section 6.22 are, taken as a whole, reasonable in
their geographic and temporal coverage and no party shall raise any issue of
geographic or temporal reasonableness in any proceeding to enforce such
covenant. P&G acknowledges and agrees that in the event of a breach by P&G of
the provisions of this Section 6.22, monetary damages shall not constitute a
sufficient remedy. Consequently, in the event of any such breach, JMS may, in
addition to any other rights and remedies existing in its favor, apply to any
court of law or equity of competent jurisdiction for specific performance and/or
injunctive relief or other relief in order to enforce or prevent any violation
of the provisions hereof. Any purchaser or successor in interest to P&G's
Olestra facility or the Culinary Sol Business shall not be bound by this Section
6.22 and P&G shall accordingly be released from any obligations relating
thereto. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 6.22, the parties
agree that the following shall not be violations of the covenants contained in
this Section 6.22: (x) continuation of the Culinary Sol Business by P&G or any
successor thereto; and (y) production and sale by P&G or any successor thereto
of any products produced at P&G's Olestra facility other than packaged goods and
oils substantially similar to the products produced by the Jif/Crisco Business.

         Section 6.23 STANDSTILL. As of the date of this Agreement, except as
previously disclosed to JMS in writing, none of P&G or any of its Subsidiaries
beneficially owns any JMS Common Shares or any options or other rights to
acquire any such securities (collectively, "VOTING SECURITIES"). For a period of
three years from the date of this Agreement (the "STANDSTILL PERIOD"), except
within the terms of a specific written request from JMS, P&G will not, and will
cause its Subsidiaries not to, propose or publicly announce or otherwise
disclose an intent to propose (i) any form of business combination, acquisition
or other transaction relating to JMS, (ii) any form of restructuring,
recapitalization or similar transaction with respect to JMS, (iii) any demand,
request or proposal to amend, waive or terminate any provision of this Section
6.23, (iv) acquire, or offer, propose or agree to acquire, by purchase or
otherwise, any Voting Securities, (v) make, or in any way participate in, any
solicitation of proxies with respect to any such Voting Securities (including by
the execution of action by written consent), become a participant in any
election contest with respect to JMS, seek to influence any Person with respect
to any such Voting Securities or demand a copy of the list of JMS Shareholders
or other books and records of JMS, (vi) participate in or encourage the
formation of any partnership, syndicate or other group which owns or seeks or
offers to acquire beneficial ownership of any such Voting Securities or which
seeks to affect control of the other party or has the purpose of circumventing
any provision of this Section 6.23, (vii) otherwise act, alone or in concert
with others (including by providing financing for another Person), to seek or to
offer to control or influence, in any

                                      -35-
<PAGE>   41

manner, JMS' management, board of directors, or policies, (viii) make any
proposal or other communication designed to compel another party to make a
public announcement thereof in respect of any matter referred to in this Section
6.23.

         Section 6.24 INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION. P&G shall, prior to the
Closing, provide to JMS within a reasonable period after it closes its books for
each monthly (or other) accounting period for the Jif/Crisco Business with
unaudited profit and loss statements for such period, together with statements
of inventory as of the end of such period. Such financial information shall be
in the same format and prepared on the same basis as the comparable portions of
the audited statements, except that such information may exclude footnotes and
are subject to normal audit adjustment.

         Section 6.25 INDEMNIFICATION.

         (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of P&G
and JMS will indemnify and hold harmless the other from and against all claims,
losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including without limitation
reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys incurred in investigation or defense
of any third-party Action, but excluding fees, costs and expenses of attorneys,
accountants, consultants and other experts and witnesses incurred in the
investigation or prosecution of any non-third-party Action) arising out of or
related to a breach by such party of the representations and warranties made by
the indemnifying party in Sections 4.04 and 5.07, respectively.

         (b) Promptly after receipt by the indemnified party of notice of any
third-party Action in respect of which indemnity may be sought against the
indemnifying party hereunder (for purposes of this Section 6.25, an
"ASSERTION"), the indemnified party will notify the indemnifying party in
writing of the Assertion, but the failure to so notify the indemnifying party
will not relieve the indemnifying party of any liability it may have to the
indemnified party, except to the extent the indemnifying party has suffered
actual prejudice thereby. The indemnifying party will be entitled to participate
in and, to the extent the indemnifying party elects by written notice to the
indemnified party within thirty (30) days after receipt by the indemnifying
party of notice of such Assertion, to assume the defense of such Assertion, at
the indemnifying party's own expense, with counsel chosen by it which will be
reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. With respect to any such
Assertion, the indemnified party will promptly provide the indemnifying party
with: (i) notice and copies of any documents served upon the indemnified party;
and (ii) all reasonable cooperation which the indemnifying party deems necessary
to defend such Assertion, including, without limitation, providing the
indemnifying party and its outside attorneys access to any potentially-relevant
documents, information, or individuals within the control of the indemnified
party, other than any privileged documents. If business information of the
indemnified party other than that pertaining to the Jif/Crisco Business is
contained in such documents or information, the indemnifying party and the
indemnified party will enter into appropriate secrecy commitments to protect
such documents or information. Notwithstanding that the indemnifying party may
have elected by written notice to assume the defense of any Assertion, the
indemnified party will have the right to participate in the investigation and
defense thereof, with separate counsel chosen by the indemnified party, but in
such event the fees and expenses of the indemnified party (above those which
would otherwise have been incurred) and such separate counsel will be paid by
the indemnified party.

                                      -36-
<PAGE>   42

         (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.25 to the contrary: (i)
the indemnifying party will have no obligation with respect to any Assertion if,
in connection therewith, the indemnified party, without the written consent of
the indemnifying party, settles or compromises any Action or consents to the
entry of any judgment; and (ii) the indemnifying party will not, without the
written consent of the indemnified party with respect to any Assertion: (A)
settle or compromise any Action or consent to the entry of any judgment which
does not include as an unconditional term thereof the delivery by the claimant
or plaintiff to the indemnified party of a duly executed written release of the
indemnified party from all liability in respect of such Action, which release
will be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to counsel for the
indemnified party; or (B) settle or compromise any Action in any manner that, in
the reasonable judgment of the indemnified party or its counsel, will materially
adversely affect the indemnified party other than as a result of money damages
or other money payments.

         (d) Upon the payment of any settlement or judgment pursuant to this
Section 6.25 with respect to any Assertion, the indemnifying party will be
subrogated to all rights and remedies of the indemnified party against any third
party in respect of such the Assertion to the extent of the amount so paid by
the indemnifying party.

         Section 6.26 TITLE POLICIES. P&G shall, if so requested by JMS and at
JMS' sole expense, cooperate with JMS in obtaining prior to the Closing title
insurance policies covering the Jif/Crisco Real Property in a customary form.

efforts to cause Mrs. H. Ray Clark to execute and deliver a shareholders

         (f) all other Authorizations of or filings with any Governmental Entity
required in connection with the consummation of the Transactions will have been

taken as a whole.

         Section 7.02 CONDITIONS TO THE OBLIGATION OF JMS. The obligation of JMS
to effect the Merger is subject to the satisfaction of each of the following
conditions (each of which is for the exclusive benefit of JMS and may be waived
by JMS):

Agreements to be performed on or before the Closing shall have been duly
performed by P&G in all material respects;

         (b) the representations and warranties of P&G in this Agreement and of
the Contributors in the Contribution Agreement (which for purposes of this
paragraph shall be read as though none of them contained any materiality or
material adverse effect qualifications) shall be true and correct in all
respects as of the Closing with the same effect as though made as of the
Closing, except that any representation and warranty made as of a date other
than the date of this Agreement will continue on the Closing Date to be true and
correct in all respects as of the specified date and except where the failure of
the representations and warranties to be true and correct in all respects would
not in the aggregate have, a Jif/Crisco Material Adverse Effect, and JMS shall
have received a certificate of P&G addressed to JMS and dated the Closing Date,
signed on behalf of P&G by an executive officer of P&G (on P&G's behalf and
without personal liability), confirming the matters set forth in Section 7.02(a)
and this Section 7.02(b); and

from Ernst & Young, tax advisor to JMS, to the effect that the Merger will be

be permitted to rely upon and assume the accuracy of certificates executed by
officers of Newco, P&G and JMS substantially in compliance with IRS published
advanced ruling guidelines, with customary exceptions and modification thereto
to enable such firms to deliver the legal opinions;

         (d) the total number of shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock
that will be issued to holders of shares of JMS Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be at least equal to 45% of the
outstanding shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock issued in the Merger;

         Section 7.03 CONDITIONS TO THE OBLIGATION OF P&G. The obligation of P&G
to effect the Merger is subject to the satisfaction of each of the following
conditions (each of which is for the exclusive benefit of P&G and may be waived
by P&G):

         (a) all covenants of JMS under this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements to be performed on or before the Closing Date shall have been duly
performed by JMS in all material respects;

         (b) the representations and warranties of JMS (which for purposes of
this paragraph shall be read as though none of them contained any materiality or
material adverse effect qualifications) shall be true and correct in all
respects as of the Closing Date with the same effect as though made as of the
Closing Date, except that any representation and warranty made as of a date
other than the date of this Agreement will continue on the Closing Date to be
true and correct in all respects as of the specified date and except where the
failure of the representations and warranties to be true and correct in all
respects would not in the aggregate have a JMS Material Adverse Effect, and P&G
shall have received a certificate of JMS addressed to P&G and dated the Closing
Date, signed on behalf of JMS by an executive officer of JMS (on JMS's behalf
and without personal liability), confirming the matters set forth in Section
7.03(a) and this Section 7.03(b);

         (c) P&G will have received a written opinion, dated as of the Closing
Date, from Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, counsel to P&G, to the
effect that the Merger will be treated for federal income tax purposes as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. In rendering
the foregoing opinion, counsel will be permitted to rely upon and assume the
accuracy of certificates executed by officers of Newco, P&G and JMS
substantially in compliance with IRS published advanced ruling guidelines, with
customary exceptions and modification thereto to enable such firm to deliver the
legal opinions;

         (d) P&G shall have received a letter ruling from the IRS, reasonably
satisfactory to P&G to the effect that (i) no gain or loss will be recognized by
(and no amount will be includible in the income of) the P&G Shareholders as a
result of the Spin Off pursuant to Section 355(a) of the Code, (ii) no gain will
be recognized by P&G as a result of the Spin Off pursuant to Section 361(c)(1),
(iii) consummation of the Merger will not adversely affect the rulings described
in clauses (i) or (ii) above, (iv) for purposes of applying Section 355(e) of
the Code to the Spin Off, each share of Surviving Corporation Common Stock will
be considered to have one vote per share for all periods after the Merger and
(v) for purposes of determining whether the Merger qualifies as a reorganization
under Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code, the Merger will be respected as a
separate transaction occurring after the Distribution; provided that the
condition described in this clause (v) shall be deemed satisfied if P&G has
received written advice from the IRS, reasonably satisfactory to P&G, to the
same effect and that written advice clearly indicates that the only reason the
IRS is not providing a favorable formal ruling is because the request does not
raise a significant issue within the meaning of Section 3.01(29) of Rev. Proc.
2001-3 and as such issuing a formal ruling would violate the Revenue Procedure's
prohibition against "comfort rulings;" and

         (e) the Cash Amount to be paid in the Merger will not be greater than
$50,000,000.

                           TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT

         Section 8.01 TERMINATION. Except as otherwise provided in this Section
8.01, this Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time,
whether before or after the JMS Shareholder Approval:

         (a) by mutual written consent of P&G and JMS;

         (b) by JMS (provided that JMS is not then in material breach of any
covenant, representation or warranty or other agreement contained herein), if
there has been a breach by P&G of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or of the Contributors in
the Contribution Agreement, or any such representation and warranty shall have
become untrue, in either case such that Section 7.02(a) or Section 7.02(b) would
be incapable of being satisfied, and such breach or condition has not been cured
within thirty days following receipt by JMS of notice of such breach;

         (c) by P&G (provided that P&G is not then in material breach of any
covenant, representation or warranty or other agreement contained herein), if
(i) there has been a breach by JMS of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, or any such representation
and warranty shall have become untrue, in either case such that Section 7.03(a)
or Section 7.03(b) would be incapable of being satisfied, and such breach or
condition has not been cured within thirty days following receipt by P&G of
notice of such breach or (ii) the condition contained in Section 7.03(d) shall
be incapable of being satisfied;

         (d) by either P&G or JMS if any Order by any Governmental Entity
preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Transactions shall have become
final and nonappealable;

         (e) by either P&G or JMS if the Merger shall not have occurred prior to
June 30, 2002, unless the failure of the Merger to have occurred by such date
shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to
perform or observe in all material respects the covenants and agreements of such
party set forth herein;

         (f) by either P&G or JMS if the JMS Shareholder Approval is not
obtained at the JMS Shareholder Meeting;

Board Recommendation within seven (7) Business Days of P&G's request; or

         (h) by P&G on or prior to the Closing Date if the product of (x)
0.5254, (y) the aggregate number of shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock
to be issued in the Merger, and (z) the average closing price of JMS Common
Stock on the NYSE for the preceding fifteen Trading Days ending two Trading Days
prior to the Closing Date is less than $715,000,000.

         Section 8.02 EFFECT OF TERMINATION.

         (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either P&G or JMS
pursuant to Section 8.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there
shall be no liability under this Agreement on the part of P&G or JMS, except to
the extent that such termination results from the material breach by a party of
any of its covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement; provided
however, that the provisions of Sections 6.04, 9.12 and this Section 8.02 shall
remain in full force and effect and shall survive any termination of this
Agreement.

         (b) If P&G terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(g), JMS
shall pay to P&G, within one Business Day following the delivery of notice of
such termination, a termination fee of $20 million (the "TERMINATION Fee") by
wire transfer of immediately available funds.

         (c) If P&G terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f) if a
Competing Transaction shall have been publicly announced prior to the JMS
Shareholders Meeting, JMS shall pay to P&G, within one (1) Business Day
following the delivery of notice of such termination, the amount of $10 million
by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         Section 9.01 NONSURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS.
None of the representations, warranties and agreements in this Agreement or in
any Ancillary Agreements shall survive the Merger; provided, however, that the
agreements contained in Article II, Article III and in Sections 6.04, 6.05,
6.06, 6.07, 6.08, 6.11, 6.12, 6.20 and this Article IX that by their terms apply
or are to be performed in whole or part after the Effective Time shall survive
the Merger and that the representations and warranties of the Contributors
contained in the Contribution Agreement shall survive in accordance with the
terms of the Contribution Agreement.

         Section 9.02 AMENDMENT AND MODIFICATION. Subject to applicable Law,
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements may be amended, modified, or
supplemented only by the written agreement by the parties hereto in any and all
respects before the Effective Time and at any time before or after the JMS
Shareholder Approval; provided, however that after the JMS Shareholder Approval
is obtained there shall not be any amendment that by Law requires further
approval by the shareholders of JMS without further approval of such
shareholders.

         Section 9.03 WAIVER OF COMPLIANCE. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, the failure by any Person to comply with
any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition under such agreements may be
waived by the Person entitled to the benefit thereof only by a written
instrument signed by the Person granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure
to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition will not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other failure. The failure of any Person to enforce at any time
any of the provisions of such agreements will in no way be construed to be a
waiver of any such provision, nor in any way to

                                      -41-
<PAGE>   47

affect the validity of such agreements or any part thereof or the right of any
Person thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of any
breach of such provisions will be held to be a waiver of any other or subsequent
breach.

         Section 9.04 NOTICES. All notices required or permitted pursuant to
this Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed to be properly given when
actually received by the Person entitled to receive the notice at the address

         Section 9.05 THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement,
expressed or implied, is intended to confer on any Person other than the parties
hereto or their respective successors and assigns any rights, remedies,

         Section 9.06 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the signatories
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Neither P&G, Newco
nor JMS may assign this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements, or any of
their rights or liabilities thereunder, without the prior written consent of the
other parties thereto, provided that P&G and Newco may so assign, in

<PAGE>   48

whole or in part, to one or more of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries. Any such
assignment will not relieve the party making the assignment from any liability
under such agreements. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to
the contrary, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to
confer on any person other than the parties hereto or their respective
successors and assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or
by reason of this Agreement; provided that the third parties referenced in
Section 6.20 shall be third-party beneficiaries of the agreement contained in
such Section.

         Section 9.07 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements constitute the entire agreement between the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter thereof and will supersede all previous
negotiations, commitments, and writings with respect to such subject matter,
including the Confidentiality Agreement.

         Section 9.08 SEVERABILITY. The illegality or partial illegality of any
or all of this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements, or any provision
thereof, will not affect the validity of the remainder of such agreements, or
any provision thereof, and the illegality or partial illegality of any such
agreements will not affect the validity of any such agreements in any
jurisdiction in which such determination of illegality or partial illegality has
not been made, except in either case to the extent such illegality or partial
illegality causes such agreements to no longer contain all of the material
provisions reasonably expected by the parties to be contained therein.

         Section 9.09 CAPTIONS. The captions appearing in this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements are inserted only as a matter of convenience and as a
reference and in no way define, limit or describe the scope or intent of such
agreements or any of the provisions thereof.

         Section 9.10 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be
an original, but all of which will constitute one agreement.

         Section 9.11 GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Ohio, whether
common law or statutory, without reference to the choice of law provisions
thereof.

         Section 9.12 EXPENSES. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, whether or not the Transactions are
consummated, each of P&G and JMS will bear its own costs and expenses.

         Section 9.13 SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. The parties hereby acknowledge and
agree that the failure of any party to perform its agreements and covenants
hereunder, including its failure to take all actions as are necessary on its
part to the consummation of the Transactions, will cause irreparable injury to
the other parties for which damages, even if available, will not be an adequate
remedy. Accordingly, each party hereby consents to the issuance of injunctive
relief by any court of competent jurisdiction to compel performance of such
party's obligations and to the granting by any court of the remedy of specific
performance of its obligations hereunder.
