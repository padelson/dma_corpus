adjustments the best information then reasonably available. Prior to the
Closing, Buyer may notify Seller of any objections to the Preliminary
Settlement Statement; provided, however, that Buyer\'s failure to notify

Closing. The Purchase Price, adjusted as provided in the
Preliminary Settlement Statement, is referred to herein as the " _Preliminary
Purchase Price_." If Buyer and Seller are unable to agree upon the final

may deliver to Buyer at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing.

use of any Assets;

  



  

(v) materialmen\'s, mechanics\', repairmen\'s, employees\',
contractors\', operators\', tax and other similar liens or charges arising in
the ordinary course of business incidental to the construction, maintenance
or operation of any of the Oil and Gas Properties (A) if they have not been
filed pursuant to law, or (B) if filed, they have not yet become due and
payable and payment; and

  



    

26 
--- 

 



    



  

(vi) any other liens, charges, encumbrances, contracts, agreements,
instruments, obligations, defects or irregularities of any kind
whatsoever affecting the Oil and Gas Assets that (X) do not materially reduce
the value of or materially interfere with the use, ownership or operation of
the Oil and Gas Assets subject thereto or affected thereby, (Y) would be
accepted by a reasonably prudent purchaser engaged in the business of owning
and operating oil and gas properties, (Z) do not prevent Company from
receiving the proceeds of production, and (iv) do not operate to: (A) reduce
the Net Revenue Interest for any Oil and Gas Property below that set forth on
_Schedule 2.13(b)_ for such Oil and Gas Property; (B) increase the Working
Interest for any Oil and Gas Property above that set forth on _Schedule
2.13(b)_ for such Oil and Gas Property without a proportionate increase in the
corresponding Net Revenue Interest; or (C) reduce the number of Net Acres for
an Oil and Gas Property below the number of Net Acres set forth for such Oil
and Gas Property on _Schedule 2.13(b)(1)_.

  



  

(d) The term " _Title Benefit_ " as used herein shall mean any
condition that (i) entitles Company to receive as to an Oil and Gas Property
set forth in _Schedule 2.13(b)_ a greater Net Revenue Interest than that set
forth on _Schedule 2.13(b) _ for such Oil and Gas Property; (ii) obligates
Company to bear costs and expenses relating to the drilling, maintenance,
development and operation and plugging and abandonment of an Oil and Gas
Property in an amount less than the Working Interest set forth in  _Schedule
2.13(b)_ for such Oil and Gas Property, unless there is a proportionate
decrease in the corresponding Net Revenue Interest; or (iii) entitles Company
to more Net Acres in an Oil and Gas Property than those set forth for such Oil
and Gas Property on _Schedule 2.13(b)(1)._

  



  

(i) If the alleged Title Defect is based on owning a Net Revenue
Interest in an Oil and Gas Property which is less than the Net
Revenue Interest percentage necessary for the Company to have had Defensible
Title in such Oil and Gas Property, then a downward adjustment to the
Purchase Price shall be calculated by multiplying the Allocated Value set
forth on _Schedule 2.13(b)_ for such Oil and Gas Property by a fraction, the
numerator of which is an amount equal to the Net Revenue Interest percentage
necessary for the Company to have had Defensible Title to such Oil and Gas
Property, less the Net Revenue Interest to which the Company is
actually entitled taking such Title Defect into account, and the denominator
of which is the Net Revenue Interest percentage necessary for the Company to
have had Defensible Title to such Oil and Gas Property.

  



  

(ii) If the Title Defect is based on owning fewer Net Acres in an Oil
and Gas Property than those represented on _Schedule 2.13(b)(1)_ , then the
downward adjustment to the Purchase Price shall be calculated by multiplying
the Allocated Value set forth for such Net Acres on _Schedule 2.13(b)(1)_ ,
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Net Acres shown on
_Schedule 2.13(b)(1)_ , for such Oil and Gas Property minus the actual Net
Acres owned within such Oil and Gas Property taking such Title Defect
into account, and the denominator of which is the number of Net Acres shown
on _Schedule 2.13(b)(1)_ , for such Oil and Gas Property.

  



  

(iii) If the Title Defect is based on a lien upon an Oil and Gas
Property that is liquidated in amount, then the adjustment is the lesser of
the amount necessary to remove such lien from the affected Oil and Gas
Property or the Allocated Value of the affected Oil and Gas Property.

  



    

27 
--- 

 



    



  

(iv) If the Title Defect is based on an obligation, burden or
liability upon a Property for which the Buyer's economic detriment is not
liquidated but can be estimated with reasonable certainty, then, subject to
the other provisions hereof, the adjustment is the lesser of the amount
necessary to compensate Buyer for the adverse economic effect on the affected
Oil and Gas Property or the Allocated Value of the affected Oil and Gas
Property.

  



  

Section 5.03 Title Defect Adjustments. Buyer shall give Seller
written notice of any Title Defects alleged by Buyer at least three (3) days
prior to the Closing Date. Such notice (a " _Defect Notice_ ") shall be in
writing and shall include: (i) a description of each Title Defect; (ii) the
Allocated Value of the Properties affected by each Title Defect; (iii) the
amount by which Buyer believes the Allocated Value of each of such Properties
has been reduced because of each Title Defect, and (iv) documentation or other
evidence reasonably supporting Buyer\'s assertion of each Title Defect and
the reduction in Allocated Value asserted pursuant to the preceding
clause (iii) with respect thereto. Buyer shall be deemed to have waived all
Title Defects of which Seller has not been given timely notice and all Title
Defects that, individually or in the aggregate, do not meet the requirements
set forth in _Section 5.03(a)_  and _5.03(b)_. All adjustments to the
Purchase Price based on Title Defects will be based on the Allocated Values
attributable to the affected Properties. Upon timely delivery of a Defect
Notice under this _Section 5.03_ , Buyer and Seller will in good faith
negotiate the validity of the Title Defect and the amount of any adjustment to
the Purchase Price using the following criteria:

  



  

(a)  No action (including no adjustment to the Purchase Price) shall
be required under this _Article V_ in respect of any individual Title Defect
unless the value of such Title Defect equals or exceeds a threshold of One
Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500.00) with respect to an Oil and Gas
Property. With respect to all Title Defects meeting such threshold, no action
(including no adjustment to the Purchase Price) shall be required under this
_Article V_ except and only to the extent that the aggregate value of all
such Title Defects and all timely asserted Adverse Environmental Conditions
meeting the individual claim threshold set forth in _Article VI_ , net of all
Title Benefit Offsets, exceeds a deductible equal to one percent (1%) of the
Purchase Price.

  



  

(b) With respect to each Well or Lease affected by any Title Defect
reported under this _Article V_ , the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an
amount (the " _Title Defect Amount_ ") equal to the reduction in the Allocated
Value for such Well or Lease caused by such Title Defect, as determined
pursuant to _Section 5.03_.

  



  

Section 5.04 Title Benefit Offsets. Buyer shall promptly
notify Seller of any Title Benefits identified by Buyer prior to the Closing,
such notice to include a description of the Title Benefit and the Properties
affected. Seller shall give Buyer written notice of any Title Benefits alleged
by Seller at least ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date. Such notice (a "
_Benefit Notice_ ") shall be in writing and shall include: (i) a description
of each Title Benefit; (ii) the Allocated Value of the Properties affected by
each Title Benefit; (iii) the amount by which Seller believes the value of
each of such Properties has been increased because of each Title Benefit, and
(iv) documentation or other evidence reasonably supporting Seller's assertion
of each Title Benefit and the increase in value asserted pursuant to the
preceding clause (iii) with respect thereto. The upward adjustment to the
Purchase Price in respect of each Title Benefit shall be determined in the
same manner as provided in _Section 5.03_ with respect to Title Defects.
Seller shall be deemed to have waived all Title Benefits of which Buyer has
not been given timely notice and all Title Benefits that do not meet
the requirements set forth in this _Section 5.04_. Subject to the proviso of
the following sentence and to the final sentence of this _Section 5.04_ , in
the event of a Title Benefit, Buyer and Seller shall agree upon the adjustment
to the Purchase Price with respect to such Title Benefit (a " _Title Benefit
Offset_ "). All Title Benefit Offsets shall be netted against the value of
the Title Defects and Adverse Environmental Conditions as provided in
_Sections 5.03_ and _6.03_. Upon a timely delivery of a Benefit Notice under
this _Section 5.04_ , Buyer and Seller will in good faith negotiate the
validity of the claim and the amount of any adjustment to the Purchase Price;
_provided that_ , no action (including no adjustment to the Purchase Price)
shall be required under this _Section 5.04_ in respect of any individual Title
Benefit unless the value of such Title Benefit Offset equals or exceeds a
threshold of One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500.00) with respect to an
Oil and Gas Property. With respect to all Title Benefits meeting such
threshold, no action (including no adjustment to the Purchase Price) shall be
required under this _Article V_ except and only to the extent that the
aggregate value of all such Title Benefits meeting the individual claim
threshold set forth in this _Article V_ , net of all Title Defects and
timely asserted Adverse Environmental Conditions, exceeds a deductible equal
to one percent (1%) of the Purchase Price.

no later than three (3) days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer may determine,
through the Environmental Diligence Review, subject to the requirements of
this _Article VI_ , if any Adverse Environmental Conditions exist. For
avoidance of doubt, the Environmental Diligence Review (a) shall be treated
as confidential and Buyer and its Representatives shall be prohibited from
disclosing any violations of applicable Environmental Law or any other
findings to anyone unless required by Environmental Law, including any
Governmental Authority with applicable jurisdiction unless the Closing occurs
and until after the Closing occurs and (b) provided that Buyer provides to
the Company (i) advance written notice of its intent to conduct the
Environmental Diligence Review that includes a list of the Oil and Gas
Properties that will be assessed and a copy of the scope of such assessment,
(ii) the opportunity for an in-house Representative or third party
Representative (such as an environmental consultant) of the Company to
observe the Environmental Diligence Review and to split any soil, groundwater
or other media samples collected by Buyer's Representative, and (iii) proof
that Buyer or Buyer's Representative who is performing the Environmental
Diligence Review for Buyer has adequate insurance to cover any potential

which the Company is named as additional insureds. Upon the request of the
Company, Buyer will promptly provide a copy of the results of such assessment
and any and all reports that document the assessment.

(iii) with respect thereto. Buyer shall be deemed to have waived all Adverse
Environmental Conditions of which Seller has not been given timely notice
hereunder and all Adverse Environmental Conditions that do not meet the
requirements set forth in _Section 6.03(b)_. All adjustments to the Purchase
Price based on Adverse Environmental Conditions will be based on Allocated
Values attributable to the affected Properties. Upon a timely delivery of a
notice of an Adverse Environmental Condition under this _Section 6.03_ , Buyer
and Seller will in good faith negotiate the validity of the claim and the
amount of any adjustment to the Purchase Price using the following criteria:

  



  

(b) Subject to _Section 6.03(a)_ above, no action (including no
adjustment to the Purchase Price) shall be required under this _Article VI_
in respect of any individual Adverse Environmental Condition existing on an
Oil and Gas Property unless the value of such Adverse Environmental Condition
equals or exceeds a threshold of Twenty Thousand Dollars ($20,000.00) with
respect to an Oil and Gas Property. With respect to all Adverse Environmental
Conditions meeting such threshold, no action (including no adjustment to the
Purchase Price) shall be required under this _Article VI_ except and to the
extent that the aggregate value of all such Adverse Environmental Conditions
and all timely asserted Title Defects meeting the individual claim threshold
set forth in this _Article VI_ and _Article V_ , net of all Title Benefit
Offsets, exceeds a deductible equal to one percent (1%) of the Purchase
Price.

  



  

(c) With respect to each Well or Lease affected by any Adverse
Environmental Condition reported under this _Article VI_ , the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by an amount (the " _Environmental Defect Amount_ ") equal to
the reduction in the Allocated Value for such Well or Lease caused by such
Adverse Environmental Condition, as determined pursuant to this _Section
6.03_.

the right to make copies of all Records delivered to Buyer. Buyer shall
retain, or shall cause its assigns to retain, the Records and make them

Section 10.05 Indemnification Procedures. The Party making a
claim under this _Article VIII_ is referred to as the " _Indemnified Party_
", and the Party against whom such claims are asserted under this _Article
VIII_ is referred to as the " _Indemnifying Party_ ".

  



  

(a) Third Party Claims. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of
the assertion or commencement of any Action made or brought by any Person who
is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a Party to this Agreement
or a Representative of the foregoing (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") against such
Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is
obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified
Party shall give the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice
thereof, but in any event not later than thirty (30) calendar days after
receipt of such notice of such Third Party Claim. The failure to give such
prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of
its indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure. Such
notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Third Party Claim in
reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material written evidence
thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of
the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in, or by giving
written notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume the defense of any Third
Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party's expense and by the Indemnifying
Party's own counsel, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith
in such defense. In the event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense
of any Third Party Claim, subject to _Section 10.05(b)_ , it shall have the
right to take such action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute, defend,
appeal or make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third Party Claim in
the name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall
have the right to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim with
counsel selected by it subject to the Indemnifying Party's right to control
the defense thereof. The fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be at
the expense of the Indemnified Party, _provided_ , that if in the
reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, (A) there are legal
defenses available to an Indemnified Party that are different from or
additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party; or (B) there exists a
conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
that cannot be waived, the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party in each
jurisdiction for which the Indemnified Party determines counsel is required.
If the Indemnifying Party elects not to compromise or defend such Third Party
Claim, fails to promptly notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its
election to defend as provided in this Agreement, or fails to diligently
prosecute the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may,
subject to _Section 10.05(b)_ , pay, compromise, defend such Third Party Claim
and seek indemnification for any and all Losses based upon, arising from or
relating to such Third Party Claim. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with
each other in all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any
Third Party Claim, including making available (subject to the provisions of
_Section 4.07_ ) records relating to such Third Party Claim and furnishing,
without expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses)
to the defending party, management employees of the non-defending party as
may be reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of such Third
Party Claim.

  



    

39 
--- 

 



    



  

(b) Settlement of Third Party Claims. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter
into settlement of any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party, except as provided in this _Section 10.05(b)_. If a
firm offer is made to settle a Third Party Claim without leading to liability
or the creation of a financial or other obligation on the part of the
Indemnified Party and provides, in customary form, for the unconditional
release of each Indemnified Party from all liabilities and obligations in
connection with such Third Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party desires to
accept and agree to such offer, the Indemnifying Party shall give written
notice to that effect to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party
fails to consent to such firm offer within ten (10) days after its receipt of
such notice, the Indemnified Party may continue to contest or defend such
Third Party Claim and in such event, the maximum liability of the Indemnifying
Party as to such Third Party Claim shall not exceed the amount of such
settlement offer. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm
offer and also fails to assume defense of such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party may settle the Third Party Claim upon the terms set forth
in such firm offer to settle such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party
has assumed the defense pursuant to _Section 10.05(a)_ , it shall not agree
to any settlement without the written consent of the Indemnifying
Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  



  

(c) Direct Claims. Any Action by an Indemnified Party on account of
a Loss which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ")
shall be asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party
reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later than
thirty (30) days after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of such Direct
Claim. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however,
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and
only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses by
reason of such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe
the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material
written evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if
reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after
its receipt of such notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. The
Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party and its professional
advisors to investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to
the Direct Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in
respect of the Direct Claim and the Indemnified Party shall assist the
Indemnifying Party's investigation by giving such information and
assistance (including access to the Company's premises and personnel and the
right to examine and copy any accounts, documents or records) as the
Indemnifying Party or any of its professional advisors may reasonably request.
If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such 30-day period, the
Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case
the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be
available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the
provisions of this Agreement.

(d) Cooperation. Upon a reasonable request by the Indemnifying
Party, each Indemnified Party seeking indemnification hereunder in respect of
any Direct Claim, hereby agrees to consult with the Indemnifying Party and
act reasonably to take actions reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party
in order to attempt to reduce the amount of Losses in respect of such Direct
Claim. Any costs or expenses associated with taking such actions shall be
included as Losses hereunder.

  



  

(e) Tax Claims. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the control of any claim, assertion, event or proceeding
in respect of Taxes of the Company (including, but not limited to, any such
claim in respect of a breach of the representations and warranties in
_Section 2.09_ hereof or any breach or violation of or failure to fully
perform any covenant, agreement, undertaking or obligation in _Article XI_ )
shall be governed exclusively by _Article XI_ hereof.

  



  

Section 10.06 Payments. Once a Loss is agreed to by the
Indemnifying Party or finally adjudicated to be payable pursuant to this
_Article X_ , the Indemnifying Party shall satisfy its obligations within
fifteen (15) Business Days of such final, non-appealable adjudication by wire
transfer of immediately available funds. The Parties hereto agree that should
an Indemnifying Party not make full payment of any such obligations within
such fifteen (15) Business Day period, any amount payable shall accrue
interest from and including the date of agreement of the Indemnifying
Party or final, non-appealable adjudication to the date such payment has been
made at a rate per annum equal to the U.S. federal prime rate plus two
percent (2 %). Such interest shall be calculated daily on the basis of a three
hundred sixty-five (365) day year and the actual number of days elapsed,
without compounding.

  



  

Section 10.07 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All
indemnification payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the
Parties as an adjustment to Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by Law.

  



  

Section 10.08 Effect of Investigation. The representations,
warranties and covenants of the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified
Party's right to indemnification with respect thereto, shall not be affected
or deemed waived by reason of any investigation made by or on behalf of the
Indemnified Party (including by any of its Representatives) or by reason of
the fact that the Indemnified Party or any of its Representatives knew or
should have known that any such representation or warranty is, was or might
be inaccurate or by reason of the Indemnified Party's waiver of any condition
set forth in _Section 7.02_ or _Section 7.03_ , as the case may be.

  



  

Section 10.09 Exclusive Remedies. Subject to _Section 13.11_ , the
Parties acknowledge and agree that their sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to any and all claims (other than claims arising from fraud, criminal
activity or intentional or willful misconduct on the part of a Party hereto in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) for any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set
forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement,
shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in  _Article
XI_ and this _Article X_. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Party hereby
waives, to the fullest extent permitted under Law, any and all rights, claims
and causes of action for any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to
the subject matter of this Agreement it may have against the other Parties
hereto and their Affiliates and each of their respective Representatives
arising under or based upon any Law, except pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in _Article XI_ and this _Article X_. Nothing in this
_Section 10.09_ shall limit any Person's right to seek and obtain any
equitable relief to which any Person shall be entitled or to seek any remedy
on account of any Person's fraudulent, criminal or intentional or willful
misconduct.

ARTICLE XI 
 Tax Matters

  



  

Section 11.01 Tax Covenants.

  



  

(a) Without the prior written consent of Buyer, Seller (and, prior
to the Closing, the Company and their respective Representatives) shall not,
to the extent it may affect, or relate to, the Company, make, change or
rescind any Tax election, amend any Tax Return or take any position on any
Tax Return, take any action, omit to take any action or enter into any other
transaction that would have the effect of increasing the Tax Liability or
reducing any Tax asset of Buyer or the Company in respect of any Post-Closing
Tax Period. Seller agrees that Buyer is to have no Liability for any Tax
resulting from any action of Seller, the Company or any of their respective
Representatives, and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Buyer (and, after
the Closing Date, the Company) against any such Tax or reduction of any Tax
asset.

  



  

(b) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration,
value added and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties
and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents (including any real property transfer Tax and any other
similar Tax) shall be borne and paid by Seller when due. Seller shall, at its
own expense, timely file any Tax Return or other document with respect to
such Taxes or fees (and Buyer shall cooperate with respect thereto as
necessary).

  



  

(c) Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, all Tax Returns
required to be filed by the Company after the Closing Date with respect to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period. Any such Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practice (unless otherwise required by Law) and without
a change of any election or any accounting method and shall be submitted by
Buyer to Seller (together with schedules, statements and, to the extent
requested by Seller, supporting documentation) at least forty-five (45) days
prior to the due date (including extensions) of such Tax Return. If Seller
objects to any item on any such Tax Return, it shall, within ten (10) days
after delivery of such Tax Return, notify Buyer in writing that it so objects,
specifying with particularity any such item and stating the specific factual
or legal basis for any such objection. If a notice of objection shall be duly
delivered, Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith and use their
reasonable best efforts to resolve such items. If Buyer and Seller are unable
to reach such agreement within ten (10) days after receipt by Buyer of such
notice, the disputed items shall be resolved by the Accounting Referee and
any determination by the Accounting Referee shall be final. The Accounting
Referee shall resolve any disputed items within twenty (20) days of having
the item referred to it pursuant to such procedures as it may require. If the
Accounting Referee is unable to resolve any disputed items before the due date
for such Tax Return, the Tax Return shall be filed as prepared by Buyer and
then amended to reflect the Accounting Referee's resolution. The costs, fees
and expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be borne equally by Buyer and
Seller. The preparation and filing of any Tax Return of the Company that does
not relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be exclusively within the control
of Buyer.

  



    

42

Section 11.02 Termination of Existing Tax Sharing Agreements.
Any and all existing Tax sharing agreements (whether written or not) binding
upon the Company shall be terminated as of the Closing Date. After such date
neither the Company, Seller nor any of Seller's Affiliates and their
respective Representatives shall have any further rights or Liabilities
thereunder.

  



  

Section 11.03 Tax Indemnification. Seller shall indemnify the
Company, Buyer, and each Buyer Indemnitee and hold them harmless from and
against (a) any Loss attributable to any breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty made in _Section 2.09_ ; (b) any Loss attributable
to any breach or violation of, or failure to fully perform, any covenant,
agreement, undertaking or obligation in _Article XI_ ; (c) all Taxes of the
Company or relating to the business of the Company for all Pre-Closing Tax
Periods; (d) all Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated,
combined or unitary group of which the Company (or any predecessor of the
Company) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date by reason of a
liability under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any comparable
provisions of foreign, state or local Law; and (e) any and all Taxes of any
Person imposed on the Company arising under the principles of transferee or
successor liability or by Contract, relating to an event or transaction
occurring before the Closing Date. In each of the above cases, together
with any out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including attorneys' and
accountants' fees) incurred in connection therewith. Seller shall reimburse
Buyer for any Taxes of the Company that are the responsibility of Seller
pursuant to this _Section 11.03 _ within ten (10) Business Days after payment
of such Taxes by Buyer or the Company.

  



  

Section 11.04 Straddle Period. In the case of Taxes that are
payable with respect to a taxable period that begins before and ends after
the Closing Date (each such period, a " _Straddle Period_ "), the portion of
any such Taxes that are treated as Pre-Closing Taxes for purposes of this
Agreement shall be:

  



  

(a) in the case of Taxes based upon, or related to, income or
receipts, deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the
taxable year ended with the Closing Date; and

  



  

(b) in the case of other Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such
Taxes for the entire period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which
is the number of days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire period.

  



  

Section 11.05 Contests. Buyer agrees to give written notice
to Seller of the receipt of any written notice by the Company, Buyer or any
of Buyer's Affiliates which involves the assertion of any claim, or the
commencement of any Action, in respect of which an indemnity may be sought by
Buyer pursuant to this _Article XI_ (a " _Tax Claim_ "); _provided_ , that
failure to comply with this provision shall not affect Buyer's right to
indemnification hereunder. Buyer shall control the contest or resolution of
any Tax Claim; _provided, however_ , that Buyer shall obtain the prior
written consent of Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) before entering into any settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend
such claim; and, _provided further_ , that Seller shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of such claim and to employ counsel of its choice
for such purpose, the fees and expenses of which separate counsel shall be
borne solely by Seller.

  



    

43 
--- 

 



    



  

Section 11.06 Cooperation and Exchange of Information. Seller and
Buyer shall provide each other with such cooperation and information as either
of them reasonably may request of the other in filing any Tax Return pursuant
to this _Article XI_ or in connection with any audit or other proceeding in
respect of Taxes of the Company. Such cooperation and information shall
include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions
thereof, together with accompanying schedules, related work papers and
documents relating to rulings or other determinations by tax
authorities. Each of Seller and Buyer shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules
and work papers, records and other documents in its possession relating to
Tax matters of the Company for any taxable period beginning before the Closing
Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable
periods to which such Tax Returns and other documents relate, without regard
to extensions except to the extent notified by the other Party in writing of
such extensions for the respective Tax periods. Prior to
transferring, destroying or discarding any Tax Returns, schedules and work
papers, records and other documents in its possession relating to Tax matters
of the Company for any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date,
Seller or Buyer (as the case may be) shall provide the other Party with
reasonable written notice and offer the other Party the opportunity to take
custody of such materials.

  



  

Section 11.07 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. Any
indemnification payments pursuant to this _Article XI_ shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price by the Parties for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by Law.

  



  

Section 11.08 Survival. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the provisions of _Section 2.09_ and this _Article
XI_ shall survive until the Survival Date. In this connection, any claims
asserted by Buyer with reasonable specificity (to the extent known at such
time) and in writing by notice to Seller prior to the Survival Date, shall
not thereafter be barred by the expiration of the relevant representation or
warranty and such claims shall survive until finally resolved.

  



  

Section 11.09 Overlap. To the extent that any obligation or
responsibility pursuant to _Article VIII_ may overlap with an obligation or
responsibility pursuant to this _Article XI_ , the provisions of this
_Article XI_ shall govern.

(i) Buyer is not then in material breach of any provision of this
Agreement and there has been a breach, inaccuracy in or failure to
perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Seller or
the Company pursuant to this Agreement that would give rise to the failure of
any of the conditions specified in _Article VII_ and such breach, inaccuracy
or failure has not been cured by Seller or the Company within ten (10) days
of Seller's receipt of written notice of such breach from Buyer; or

(provided that Buyer is not at the time of such termination in
material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants under
this Agreement); or

  



  

(iii) any of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.01_ or _Section
7.02_ shall not have been, or if it becomes apparent that any of such
conditions will not be, fulfilled by the Target Closing Date, unless such
failure shall be due to the failure of Buyer to perform or comply with any of
the covenants, agreements or conditions hereof to be performed or complied
with by it prior to the Closing;

  



  

(c) by Seller by written notice to Buyer if:

  



  

(i) Seller is not then in material breach of any provision of this

(iii) any of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.01_ or _Section
7.03_ shall not have been, or if it becomes apparent that any of such

consummated on or before the Target Closing Date because of Buyer's failure to
perform any of its material obligations hereunder or Buyer's material breach
of any representation herein, Seller has performed all of its material
obligations hereunder and has not breached any of its representations herein,
and Seller is ready, willing and able to close the transactions contemplated
hereby, then Seller shall have the option to terminate this Agreement, in
which case, within three (3) Business Days after the event giving rise to
such termination, Seller shall be entitled to receive the Deposit, plus any
interest accrued thereon, from the Deposit Bank, free of any claims by Buyer
with respect thereto, as liquidated damages on account of Buyer's failure to

of such actual damages and (iii) such liquidated damages do not constitute a
penalty. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the transactions
contemplated hereby are not consummated on or before the Target Closing Date

satisfied, Seller shall not be entitled to receive the Deposit, plus any
interest accrued thereon, from the Deposit Bank, and instead Buyer shall be
entitled to receive the Deposit, plus any interest accrued thereon, from the
Deposit Bank, free of any claims by Seller with respect thereto.

  



  

(b) If all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of Seller
hereunder have been met, the transactions contemplated hereby are not
consummated on or before the Target Closing Date because of Seller's failure
to perform any of its material obligations hereunder or Seller's breach of
any representation herein, Buyer has performed all of its material obligations
hereunder and has not breached any of its representations herein, and Buyer
is ready, willing and able to close the transactions contemplated hereby,
then Buyer shall have the option to (i) terminate this Agreement, in which
case, within three (3) Business Days after the event giving rise to such
termination, Buyer shall be entitled to receive the Deposit, plus any interest
accrued thereon, from the Deposit Bank, free of any claims by Seller with
respect thereto, and Buyer shall be entitled to receive the Deposit
(as defined therein) under the Fund XI Purchase and Sale Agreement, plus any
interest accrued thereon, from the Deposit Bank (as defined therein), free of
any claims by Seller with respect thereto or (ii) seek specific performance.

  



  

(c) If this Agreement is terminated for any reason other than as set
forth in _Section 12.03(a_ ) or _Section 12.03(b)_ , then within three (3)
Business Days after the event giving rise to such termination, Buyer shall be
