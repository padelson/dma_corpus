(b) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver the
Closing Statement to U.S. Seller. The Closing Statement shall be prepared in
accordance with GAAP on a basis consistent with the past practice of the
Sellers and the Companies (to the extent such past practice is permitted under

relating to Purchase Price contained in this Agreement and the accounting
principles, practices, procedures, policies and methods set forth on Schedule
1.4 (collectively, the "Accounting Principles"). At the request of U.S.
Seller, Buyer shall deliver to U.S. Seller or its advisors the work papers
used by Buyer to prepare the Closing Statement, as long as U.S. Seller and its
advisors have executed customary release letters reasonably requested by
Buyer's advisors, including its independent auditors, in connection therewith.



(c) U.S. Seller shall deliver to Buyer, within 60 days after Buyer's delivery
of the Closing Statement to U.S. Seller, either a notice indicating that the
Sellers accept the Closing Statement or a statement describing the Sellers'
objections to the Closing Statement, which statement of objections shall
describe in reasonable detail the nature and amount of the Sellers'
objections. If the Sellers do not object to the Closing Statement delivered by
Buyer within the 60-day period, the Closing Statement shall be final and
binding on the Parties.



(d) If the Sellers object to the Closing Statement within the 60-day period
and any such objections are not resolved by U.S. Seller and Buyer within 60
days after U.S. Seller's delivery to Buyer of the Sellers' objection statement
pursuant to Section 1.4(c), Buyer and U.S. Seller shall (1) jointly prepare
and sign a statement setting forth (A) those objections (if any) that Buyer
and U.S. Seller have resolved and the resolution of such objections and (B)
those objections that remain unresolved and (2) engage the Neutral Accountant
to resolve such unresolved objections. Buyer shall deliver promptly to the
Neutral Accountant the work papers used by Buyer to prepare the Closing
Statement and to determine the basis of any unresolved objection by Buyer
described in the preceding sentence, and U.S. Seller shall deliver promptly to
the Neutral Accountant the work papers used by Seller to prepare the objection
statement described in Section 1.4(c) and to determine the basis of any
unresolved objection by U.S. Seller described in the preceding sentence. Each
of Buyer and U.S. Seller shall provide to the Neutral Accountant any
information of such Party that the Neutral Accountant reasonably requests for
purposes of resolving such unresolved objections. Buyer and U.S. Seller shall
instruct the Neutral Accountant that (x) the scope of its review and authority
shall be limited to resolving such unresolved objections, (y) it may not
assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value claimed for such
unresolved objection or less than the smallest value for such unresolved objection claimed by either Buyer
or U.S. Seller and (z) the Neutral Accountant shall issue, within 60 days of
delivery of the last delivery of workpapers according to the second sentence
of this Section 1.4(d), a ruling that sets forth the resolution of each such
unresolved objection, the Closing Statement and the components of Purchase
Price contained therein, reflecting the Neutral Accountant's resolution of
such unresolved objections. The resolution by the Neutral Accountant of such
unresolved objections, the Closing Statement and the components of Purchase
Price contained in the Closing Statement prepared by the Neutral Accountant
giving effect to its resolution shall be final, conclusive and binding upon
the Parties and not subject to review by any Governmental Entity or otherwise.
The procedures set forth in this Section 1.4(d) for resolving disputes with
respect to the Closing Statement shall be the sole and exclusive method for
resolving any such disputes; provided that this provision shall not prohibit
any Party from instituting litigation to enforce the determination of the
Closing Statement and the Adjusted Purchase Price by the Neutral Accountant in
a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with Section 12.12. Buyer and
the Sellers shall share equally the fees and expenses of the Neutral
Accountant for its services under this Section 1.4(d).



(e) If the Purchase Price calculated using the amounts shown on the Final
Closing Statement is less than the Estimated Purchase Price paid at the
Closing pursuant to Section 1.2, then (1) the Purchase Price shall be reduced
by an amount equal to the difference of (A) the Estimated Purchase Price paid
at the Closing pursuant to Section 1.2 minus (B) the Purchase Price calculated
using the amounts shown on the Final Closing Statement and (2) the Sellers
shall pay to Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, within
three Business Days after the date on which the Final Closing Statement is
finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.4, an amount equal to such
reduction in the Purchase Price. If the Purchase Price calculated using the
amounts shown on the Final Closing Statement is greater than the Estimated
Purchase Price paid at the Closing pursuant to Section 1.2, then (i) the
Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount equal to the difference of (A)
the Purchase Price calculated using the amounts shown on the Final Closing
Statement minus (B) the Estimated Purchase Price paid at the Closing pursuant
to Section 1.2 and (ii) Buyer shall pay to the Sellers designated by U.S.
Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, within three Business
Days after the date on which the Final Closing Statement is finally determined
pursuant to this Section 1.4, an amount equal to such increase in the Purchase
Price. Payment in accordance with this Section 1.4(e) shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Parties for disputes regarding the Estimated Purchase
Price and the Adjusted Purchase Price, and Article VI shall not apply to any
such dispute.



1.5 Allocation of Purchase Price. Buyer shall prepare and deliver to U.S.
Seller, within 90 days following the final determination of the Adjusted
Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.4, a schedule setting forth a proposed
allocation of (i) the Tax Purchase Price among each of the Companies, the
Mexico Assets and the Reznor U.S. Marks and (ii) the portion of the Tax
Purchase Price so allocated to U.S. Company among the U.S. Assets. Such
allocation schedule will be prepared in a manner consistent with Schedule 1.5
and, to the extent applicable, Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder. If U.S. Seller does not deliver a written objection
within the 60-day period following the date of delivery of Buyer's allocation
schedule to U.S. Seller, then effective as of the close of business on such
60th day (or upon the earlier delivery of notice by U.S. Seller to Buyer that
U.S. Seller has accepted such allocation schedule), such allocation schedule
shall be deemed to be accepted by U.S. Seller. If U.S. Seller objects to
Buyer's schedule within such 60-day period and such objection is not resolved
by Buyer and U.S. Seller within 15 days following U.S. Seller's notice to
Buyer of such objection, then Buyer and U.S. Seller shall jointly engage the
Neutral Accountant to resolve any unresolved objections. Buyer and U.S. Seller
agree to provide to the Neutral Accountant such information as the Neutral
Accountant may reasonably request in connection with its review. Buyer and
U.S. Seller shall instruct the Neutral Accountant that (x) the scope of its
review and authority shall be limited to resolving such unresolved objections and (y) it shall resolve such unresolved objections based upon its
assessment of the fair value of the Companies, the Mexico Assets and the U.S.
Assets and in a manner consistent with Schedule 1.5. U.S. Seller and Buyer
shall request that the Neutral Accountant provide such allocation schedule
within 60 days of the engagement of the Neutral Accountant under this Section
1.5. The resolution by the Neutral Accountant of the matters set forth in this
Section 1.5 shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the Parties and the
Companies and not subject to review by any Governmental Entity or otherwise.
The procedures set forth in this Section 1.5 shall be the sole and exclusive

Purchase Price. The Parties shall file all Tax Returns (including Form 8594)
in a manner consistent with the allocation schedule as finally determined
pursuant to this Section 1.5. Buyer and U.S. Seller shall share equally the
fees and expenses of the Neutral Accountant for its services under this

or in respect of, any payments pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it

under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Law relating to
Taxes. All such amounts so deducted and withheld shall be paid over to or
deposited with the relevant Taxing Authority by Buyer and, provided such
payment or deposit is made, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.



1.7 Consents to Assignment. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, this Agreement will not constitute an agreement to assign,
transfer, convey or deliver any Contract, authorization, license, permit,
property or other asset within the scope of the Mexico Assets, or any claim,
right or benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom unless and until
such consent or waiver has been obtained, if either (a) (i) an attempted
assignment or transfer thereof, without the consent or waiver of a third party
thereto or of the issuing Governmental Entity, as the case may be (a
"Counterparty), would constitute a breach or result in the termination or
cancellation thereof and (ii) such consent or waiver is not obtained or (b)
such Contract, authorization, license, permit, property or other asset, or
claim, right or benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom is not
transferable by its nature or terms or pursuant to applicable Law (the
foregoing clauses (a) and (b), collectively, "Non-Assignable Assets"). In such
case, (x) such item will be withheld from the assignment pursuant to this
Agreement, (y) from and after the Closing, Buyer and Mexico Seller will
cooperate, in all reasonable respects, to obtain such consent as soon as
practicable after the Closing, and (z) to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, (1) the Non-Assignable Assets will be held, as of and from the Closing,
by Mexico Seller in trust for the benefit of Buyer, and all rights, benefits
and obligations existing thereunder will be for Buyer's account, (2) Buyer
will pay, perform or otherwise discharge (in accordance with the respective
terms and subject to the respective conditions thereof, and in the name of
Mexico Seller) all of the covenants and obligations of Mexico Seller incurred
after the Closing with respect to such Non-Assignable Assets, and (3) the
Mexico Seller will take or cause to be taken, subject to the last sentence of
this Section 1.7, such actions in its name or otherwise as Buyer may
reasonably request so as to provide Buyer with the rights and benefits of such
Non-Assignable Assets and, using commercially reasonable efforts, to effect
the collection of money or other consideration that becomes due and payable
under such Non-Assignable Assets, and to pay to Buyer all money or other
consideration received by it in respect of such Non-Assignable Assets in
accordance with Section 10.2. If and when such consent or waiver is obtained,
Mexico Seller will transfer, assign, convey and deliver such Non-Assignable
Asset to Buyer for no additional consideration. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, if the Counterparty conditions its grant of a consent or
waiver (including by threatening to exercise a "recapture" or other
termination right) upon, or otherwise requires in response to a consent or
waiver request regarding this Agreement, the payment of a fee or other
consideration or the provision of additional security (including a guaranty),
neither Mexico Seller nor its Affiliates will be required to make any such payments or to provide
any such additional security; it being acknowledged that nothing in this
Section 1.7 shall limit the rights of any Buyer Party to indemnification for
breaches of Section 2.4 of this Agreement.



1.8 Further Assurances. At any time and from time to time after the Closing
Date, as and when requested by either Party hereto, the other Party shall
promptly execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such

effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Sellers' Affiliates (on the one hand) nor Buyer or any of its Affiliates (on
the other hand) shall exercise any option or right available to it under
applicable Law to voluntarily qualify any of the transactions contemplated
hereunder as taxable transactions for VAT purposes.

Agreement (as the same may be amended, modified or supplemented, the "Debt
Financing Commitment," and such debt financing contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitment, the "Debt Financing"). As of the date hereof, the Debt

both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach
or a failure to satisfy a condition precedent on the part of Buyer or any
other party thereto under the Debt Financing Commitment. As of the date
hereof, Buyer and its Affiliates do not have any reason to believe that any of
the conditions to the Debt Financing will not be satisfied or that the Debt
Financing will not be available to Buyer at the Closing as contemplated by the
Debt Financing Commitment Letters, and Buyer and its Affiliates do not have
any knowledge that any of the lenders that are parties to the Debt Financing
Commitments Letters will not perform their obligations thereunder.

necessary to comply with confidentiality obligations), as of the date hereof,
there are no side letters or other Contracts relating to the Debt Financing
Commitment that could adversely affect the availability of the full amount of
the Debt Financing. None of the Debt Financing Commitment Letters have been
modified, amended or altered prior to the date of this Agreement and, as of
the date of this Agreement, no such amendment or modification is contemplated, and none of the respective commitments under any

immediately available funds to enable it to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to fulfill its obligations hereunder,
including payment to the Sellers of the Estimated Purchase Price at the
Closing and payment of any transaction fees and expenses of or payable by
Buyer; provided, however, that the receipt of the amounts to be funded under
the Debt Financing Commitment is not a condition to Closing. All commitment
fees and other fees required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Debt
Financing Commitments have been paid in full or will be paid in full when due.



(e) Buyer's obligations under this Agreement are not subject to any conditions
regarding Buyer's, its Affiliates' or any other Person's ability to obtain

Agreement regardless of the reasons why such Debt Financing, any alternative
financing, or other financing is not obtained or whether such reasons are
within or beyond the control of Buyer.



3.7 Solvency. Assuming (a) satisfaction of the conditions to Buyer's
obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and

its Affiliates in order to effect the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Buyer shall have adequate capital to carry on its business. No

connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
closing of any financing to be obtained by Buyer or any of its Affiliates in
order to effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the
intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of
Buyer.

its satisfaction an independent investigation of the financial condition,
results of operations, assets, liabilities, properties, projected operations,
workforce and affairs of the business of the Companies and the business
conducted by U.S. Seller and Mexico Seller with the U.S. Assets and the Mexico
Assets (including the Mexico Assumed Liabilities and the U.S. Assumed
Liabilities) and, in making its determination to proceed with the transactions

U.S. Assets and the Mexico Assets as-is and where-is (subject to the benefit
of the representations and warranties set forth in Article II, as qualified
and limited by the Sellers' Disclosure Schedule). Except in the case of fraud,
Buyer acknowledges that none of the Sellers nor any other Person will have or
be subject to any liability to any Buyer Party or any other Person resulting

information regarding the business of the Companies, the business conducted by
U.S. Seller and Mexico Seller with the U.S. Assets and the Mexico Assets, the

to any information regarding (1) pending or proposed bids for new contracts or
subcontracts or any related information where Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer
also has submitted or intends to submit a bid for such contract or subcontract
or (2) pending or proposed materials or product supply or service contracts.



(d) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, the Sellers shall
furnish to Buyer, within 15 days after the end of each calendar month, a copy
of the internal unaudited combined income statement and balance sheet of the
Companies and the business conducted by the U.S. Seller and Mexico Seller with
the U.S. Assets and the Mexico Assets, as of the end of and for the month.



4.4 Elimination of Intercompany Items. Effective as of the Closing, all
payables, receivables, liabilities and other obligations between the
Companies, on the one hand, and the Sellers or any of their Affiliates (other
than the Companies), on the other hand, shall be eliminated without any
liability to, or other obligation of, the Companies, except to the extent (a)
expressly provided for in this Agreement or (b) such payables, receivables,
liabilities and other obligations relate to bona fide transactions entered
into or conducted on substantially prevailing market terms at substantially
prevailing market prices.



4.5 Financing.



(a) Efforts to Consummate. Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt
Financing Commitment, including using reasonable best efforts to (1) subject
to Section 4.5(b), maintain in effect the Debt Financing Commitment in
accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, (2) satisfy
on a timely basis (or obtain any waiver of) all conditions and covenants
applicable to Buyer in the Debt Financing Commitment that are within Buyer's
control and otherwise comply with its obligations thereunder, (3) enter into
definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment (the "Definitive
Financing Agreements"), (4) consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to
Closing, and (5) enforce its rights under the Debt Financing Commitment and
procure that the providers of the Debt Financing comply with all of their
obligations (including negotiating and entering into the agreements
contemplated thereby promptly and, at Closing, funding the Debt Financing)
required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including, if the conditions set forth in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 and the Debt
Financing Commitment Letters or the Definitive Financing Agreements have been
satisfied or waived, through threatening, commencing or pursuing litigation,
arbitral or other adversarial proceedings). 

(b) Amendment and Replacement of Debt Financing Commitment. Buyer shall not
permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or waive any provision or
remedy under, the Debt Financing Commitment, except that notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer shall have the right to amend or replace the Debt Financing
Commitment from time to time between the date hereof and Closing (i) to add or
replace lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar
entities as a party thereto or (ii) in any other manner that would not, taken
as a whole, have the effect of (A) reducing the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing such that Buyer's representation in Section 3.6 would no longer be
true and correct, (B) imposing new or additional conditions to the receipt of
the Debt Financing or otherwise expanding, amending or modifying any of the
conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing, in each case in a manner that
would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the Closing, or (C) adversely
impacting the ability of Buyer to enforce its rights against the other parties
to the Debt Financing Commitment. If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Financing
Commitment, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain
alternative sources of funds in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The terms "Debt Financing
Commitment" and "Debt Financing" shall be deemed to refer to the Debt
Financing Commitment as it may be amended or replaced as permitted by this
Section 4.5(b) and the financing contemplated by the amended or replacement
Debt Financing Commitment.



(c) Information and Notices to U.S. Seller. Upon the reasonable request of
U.S. Seller from time to time, Buyer shall keep U.S. Seller informed in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange and obtain the Debt
Financing, including any amendment or replacement. Without limiting the
generality of the preceding sentence, Buyer shall give U.S. Seller prompt
notice: (1) of any material breach or default (or any event or circumstance
that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be
expected to give rise to any material breach or default) by any party to the
Debt Financing Commitment, Definitive Financing Agreements or any agreement
contemplated thereby; (2) of the receipt by Buyer or any of its Affiliates or
representatives of any written notice or other written communication from any
Person with respect to any actual or potential breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to the Debt Financing Commitment, Definitive
Financing Agreements or any agreement contemplated thereby; and (3) if for any
reason Buyer or any of its Affiliates believes in good faith that (A) there is
a dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt Financing
Commitment, Definitive Financing Agreements or any agreement contemplated
thereby; or (B) it is reasonably likely that it will not be able to obtain all
or any portion of the Debt Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the
sources contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment. Buyer will furnish to
U.S. Seller correct and complete copies of any Definitive Financing Agreements
or any alternative Debt Financing Commitment and, in each case, ancillary
documents thereto (redacted to the extent necessary to comply with
confidentiality agreements, as long as information relating to the amounts or
conditionality of, or conditions precedent to, the funding of the Debt
Financing is not redacted).



4.6 2013 Audited Financial Statements. Sellers shall cause to be prepared and
delivered to Buyer as soon as practicable an independent audit report from
KPMG LLP with respect to the 2013 Audited Financial Statements, it being
understood that the costs incurred in connection with the carve-out and
preparation of the 2013 Audited Financial Statements shall constitute a U.S.
Assumed Liability (as defined in the U.S. Contribution Agreement) and shall
not be included in Seller Transaction Expenses. Delivery to Buyer of the 2013
Audited Financial Statements is not a condition to the obligation of Buyer to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



4.7 Seller Release. Subject to the next sentence, effective as of the Closing
Date, the Sellers, on behalf of themselves, their Affiliates and their
respective successors and assigns (collectively, the "Seller Releasing Parties"), hereby irrevocably and unconditionally release
and forever discharge (a) the Companies and each of their respective current
and former officers, directors, employees, successors and assigns, (b) solely
with respect to the business conducted by U.S. Seller and Mexico Seller with
the U.S. Assets and the Mexico Assets, the Business Employees and (c) solely
with respect to the business conducted by U.S. Seller and Mexico Seller with
the U.S. Assets and the Mexico Assets, Buyer and its permitted assignees
pursuant to Section 12.5 and the Business Employees (clauses (a), (b) and (c),
collectively, the "Buyer Released Parties") of and from any and all actions,
causes of action, suits, proceedings, executions, judgments, duties, debts,
dues, accounts, bonds, Contracts and covenants (whether express or implied),
and all other claims and demands whatsoever, including any rights to
indemnification, contribution or reimbursement from any Buyer Released
Parties, in each case whether arising in law or in equity and whether pursuant
to the Organizational Documents of the Buyer Released Parties, Contracts or
otherwise, which the Seller Releasing Parties may have against each of the
Buyer Released Parties, now or in the future, in respect of any cause, matter
or thing occurring before the Closing solely in connection with the business
conducted by the Companies or the business conducted by U.S. Seller or Mexico
Seller with the U.S. Assets and the Mexico Assets. The preceding sentence does
not apply to (1) the liabilities and obligations of or performance by the
Buyer Parties under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, including the
Assumed Liabilities, (2) causes or matters that occur after the Closing and
(3) fraud, bad faith or intentional misconduct by any Buyer Released Party.



4.8 Conduct of Buyer. During the period from the date of this Agreement until
the Closing Date, except for the Debt Financing and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any of
its subsidiaries to:



(a) enter into any Contract or incur any obligation requiring Buyer or its
subsidiaries to make (1) any acquisition or purchase of a material amount of
the assets of or any equity interest in any Person or (2) any merger,
consolidation, business combination or joint venture with any Person, in the
case of each of the foregoing clauses (1) and (2), for an aggregate purchase
price in excess of $25,000,000;



(b) incur, assume, guarantee, prepay or otherwise become liable, directly,
contingently or otherwise, for any indebtedness for borrowed money in excess
of $25,000,000 in the aggregate, except (1) in the ordinary course of business
and (2) for (A) indebtedness for borrowed money incurred pursuant to the
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of December 17, 2010 (as
amended, restated, amended and restated, extended, refinanced, replaced,
supplemented or otherwise modified as of the date of this Agreement), by and
among inter alios Buyer, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and
the lenders from time to time party thereto, (B) indebtedness for borrowed
money incurred pursuant to the Credit Agreement, dated as of April 26, 2011
(as amended, restated, amended and restated, extended, refinanced, replaced,
supplemented or otherwise modified as of the date of this Agreement), by and
among inter alios Buyer, UBS AG Stamford Branch as administrative agent and
collateral agent and the lenders from time to time party thereto, (C)
indebtedness for borrowed money in replacement of or to refinance existing
indebtedness for borrowed money, (D) guarantees by Buyer of indebtedness for
borrowed money of wholly owned subsidiaries of Buyer, which indebtedness is
incurred in compliance with this Section 4.8(b), (E) interest rate swaps on
customary commercial terms, consistent with past practices, and (F)
indebtedness in respect of overdrafts protections applied in the ordinary
course of business in connection with Buyer's cash management system; or



(c) take or agree to take any action which would reasonably be expected to
cause Buyer's representations or warranties contained in Sections 3.6 or 3.7
to be untrue or incorrect in any material respect. 

4.9 Further Action Regarding Intellectual Property.



(a) If, after the date of this Agreement, Buyer or any of its Affiliates
identify any gap or defect in the chain of title, ownership or lien status of
any registration or pending application included in the Designated
Intellectual Property, Sellers shall promptly at their own expense execute and
file all documents and take all other appropriate actions as necessary to
reflect a Company as the sole and exclusive owner of good and valid title to
such registrations or pending applications, free and clear of any Security
Interest other than Permitted Liens, and to eliminate or correct any such gaps
or defects in the chain of title, ownership or lien status thereof. If, after
the Closing, either Buyer or any Seller identifies any item of Designated
Intellectual Property that inadvertently was not previously transferred by a
Seller or its Affiliates to a Company, then Sellers shall (or shall cause
their Affiliates to) promptly transfer such Designated Intellectual Property
to Buyer (or its designated Affiliate) for no additional consideration.



(b) If, after the Closing, either Buyer or any Seller identifies any item of
Intellectual Property that constitutes an Excluded Asset (as such term is
defined in the Contribution Agreement) that was erroneously transferred by a
Seller or its Affiliates to a Company, Buyer shall (or cause such Company to)
promptly transfer such Intellectual Property to a Seller (or its designated
Affiliate) for no additional consideration.



4.10 Transition Services Agreement. U.S. Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in
good faith to prepare and agree to Schedule A of the Transition Services
Agreement as promptly as practicable following the date hereof, and in any
event prior to Closing. The version of Schedule A of the Transition Services
Agreement that is included in Exhibit D to this Agreement as of the date
hereof, with any revisions thereto that are mutually agreed by Buyer and U.S.
Seller in writing prior to Closing, shall constitute Schedule A of the
Transition Services Agreement for the purpose of the delivery contemplated by
Section 1.3(b)(7). After the Closing, at the request of Buyer, U.S. Seller and
Buyer shall negotiate additional services under the Transition Services
Agreement according to Section 1.4 thereof.



4.11 Title Insurance Policy. At or prior to Closing, U.S. Seller shall deliver
to Buyer such deed as is reasonably necessary for Buyer to obtain an American
Land Title Association (ALTA) standard title insurance policy, issued by
Chicago Title Insurance Company or a similarly rated title company ("Title
CompanyTitle "), insuring U.S. Company's fee title to the Owned Real Property,
free and clear of all defects and encumbrances, excepting only Permitted Liens
(it being understood that U.S. Seller may be required to deliver certain
documentation to the Title Company, including a title affidavit). Buyer's
obtaining the policy described in the preceding sentence is not a condition to
the obligation of Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

pursuant to this Agreement, but nevertheless elects to perform, and actually
performs, the Closing, and the other Party is obligated to perform, the
Parties shall proceed with the consummation of this Agreement as if all
Parties were obligated to do so, and the Party who is not obligated to proceed
but elects to do so (the "Waiving Party") shall be deemed to have specifically

5.4 Frustration of Closing Conditions. Neither the Sellers nor Buyer may rely

its reasonable best efforts to cause the closing conditions of the other Party
to be satisfied, as required by Section 4.1(a).



ARTICLE VI



INDEMNIFICATION



6.1Indemnification by the Sellers. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Article VI and Section 7.12, from and after the Closing, the Sellers shall
jointly and severally defend and indemnify Buyer, its Affiliates (including
the Companies) and their respective successors, assigns (if and to the extent
permitted under this Agreement), stockholders, partners, members, agents,
representatives, officers, directors and employees (each, a "Buyer Party")
against Damages sustained by a Buyer Party arising from or in connection with:



(a)any failure of a representation or warranty of the Sellers contained in
this Agreement (other than those set forth in Section 2.8) to be true and
correct on the date hereof and on the Closing Date as if made on such date, or
any failure of a representation or warranty of U.S. Seller contained in
Section 2.3 of the Contribution Agreement to be true and correct when made;

 (b)any failure by a Seller to perform any covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement;



(c)any Excluded Liabilities (other than the liabilities specified in clause
(f) of the definition of Excluded Liabilities set forth in the U.S.
Contribution Agreement and clause (C) of the definition of Mexico Excluded
Liabilities);



(d)the Special Indemnities; or



(e)any Qualified Event.



6.2 Indemnification by Buyer. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Article VI, from and after the Closing, Buyer shall defend and indemnify the
Seller, its Affiliates and their respective successors, assigns (if and to the
extent permitted under this Agreement), stockholders, partners, members,
agents, representatives, officers, directors and employees (each, a "Seller
Party") against Damages sustained by a Seller Party arising from or in
connection with:



(a) any failure of a representation or warranty of Buyer contained in this
Agreement to be true and correct on the date hereof and on the Closing Date as
if made on such date;



(b) any failure by Buyer to perform any covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement; or



(c) any Mexico Assumed Liabilities and any U.S. Assumed Liabilities, in each
case, other than such liabilities that give rise to indemnifiable Damages
pursuant to Section 6.1(a) or 6.1(b).



6.3 Claims for Indemnification.



(a) Procedure for Third-Party Claims. Except as provided in Section 7.6
(relating to Tax Claims) and Section 7.12, all claims for indemnification made
under this Agreement resulting from, related to or arising out of a third-
party claim against an Indemnified Party shall be made in accordance with the
following procedures. An Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party
promptly, and in any event not more than 30 days after becoming aware of any
third-party claim, of the commencement of any action, suit or proceeding
relating to a third-party claim for which indemnification may be sought by
delivering a Claim Notice with respect thereto. No delay on the part of the
Indemnified Party in notifying an Indemnifying Party shall relieve the
Indemnifying Party from any obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to
the extent) the Indemnifying Party is thereby prejudiced. Within 45 days of
delivery of such notification, the Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice
thereof to the Indemnified Party that includes an unqualified acknowledgment
by the Indemnifying Party that any Damages arising out of such third party
claim are indemnifiable pursuant to this Article VI, assume control of the
defense of such action, suit, proceeding or claim, at the sole cost and
expense of the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume
control of such defense, the Indemnified Party shall control such defense, at
the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party. The Party not controlling
such defense may participate therein at its own expense, except that, if in
the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party a conflict or
potential conflict exists between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party that would make separate representation of the Indemnified Party
advisable, then the expense of the separate representation shall constitute
Damages incurred by the Indemnified Party. The Party controlling such defense
shall keep the other Party advised of the status of such action, suit,
proceeding or claim and the defense thereof. No Party shall agree to any
settlement of such action, suit, proceeding or claim without the prior written consent of the other Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Notwithstanding anything to contrary contained in this Article VI, the
Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to control the defense of any
third party claim against an Indemnified Party if such third party claim (i)
seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against an Indemnified Party or
its business, (ii) is a criminal claim or (iii) would reasonably be expected
to result in Damages in excess of the amounts indemnifiable pursuant to this
Article VI.



(b) Procedure for Claims for Indemnification. An Indemnified Party wishing to
assert a claim for indemnification under this Article VI shall deliver to the
Indemnifying Party a Claim Notice. Except to the extent otherwise expressly
stated in a written notice, if any, delivered by the Indemnifying Party within
45 days following receipt of the Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party shall be
deemed to have not contested that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive
any portion or all of the Damages claimed in such Claim Notice or is otherwise
entitled to indemnification with respect to the matter described in the Claim
Notice. If a dispute relating to a Claim Notice is not resolved within 120
days following the delivery of the Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party shall each have the right to submit such dispute to a
court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with Section 12.12. For the
avoidance of doubt, in the event an Indemnified Party delivers a Claim Notice
within the applicable survival period set forth in Section 6.4 that involves
Damages in an amount that has not yet been determined, the Indemnifying Party
shall not be required to make payments in respect of its indemnification
obligation pursuant to this Agreement unless and until such Damages have been
finally determined according to the first sentence of this Section 6.3(b), by
agreement of the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party or by a court of
competent jurisdiction in accordance with Section 12.12, it being understood
that such indemnification obligation shall survive in accordance with Section
6.4 until the applicable claim is fully and finally resolved and the amount of
Damages arising out of or related thereto has become finally determined.



6.4 Survival. The representations and warranties and covenants of the Sellers
and Buyer set forth in this Agreement, the Sellers' Certificate and the
Buyer's Certificate shall survive the Closing and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and continue until April 15, 2015,
at which time they shall expire, except for (1) the Fundamental
Representations, which representations and warranties shall survive until the
April 15, 2019, (2) the covenant set forth in Section 7.2 (except with respect
to the representations and warranties in Section 2.8 (Taxes), which shall be
governed by clause (1) of Section 6.4), which covenant shall survive until 60
days following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, (3)
the representations and warranties in Section 2.18 (Environmental Matters) and
Section 2.3 (Other Matters) of the Contribution Agreement survive until April
15, 2017 and (4) the covenants and other provisions set forth in Article I,
Article IX and Article X and any other covenant or provision that contemplates
performance after the Closing, which will survive the Closing in accordance
with their respective terms. For the avoidance of doubt, all applicable
statutes of limitations or other claims periods set forth in this Section 6.4
with respect to claims for Damages pursuant to this Article VI and Article VII
shall be shortened to the applicable claims periods set forth in this Section
6.4 and all applicable claims periods and survival periods expressly set forth
in this Section 6.4 shall be definitive and shall not be modified or
superseded by any statutory or other limitations period, except that if an
indemnification claim is properly asserted in writing pursuant to Section 6.3
or Section 7.6 prior to the expiration of the representation, warranty or
covenant that is the basis for such claim, then such representation, warranty
or covenant shall survive until, but only for the purpose of, the resolution
of such claim, and all applicable statutes of limitations and other claim
periods shall be tolled until such claim is fully and finally resolved. For
the avoidance of doubt, if a Claim Notice or notice of a Tax Claim is
delivered within the applicable period provided in this Section 6.4, nothing
in this Agreement shall limit the Indemnified Party's right thereafter to
commence an action in a court of competent jurisdiction with respect to any dispute relating to such Claim Notice or notice of Tax Claim,
regardless of whether the applicable representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement has subsequently expired.



6.5 Limitations.



(a) The following limitations shall apply to claims under this Article VI
(other than Excluded Liabilities and Special Indemnities) or otherwise made
with respect to the Sellers' Certificate:



(1) Except for Damages arising from or in connection with the Fundamental
Representations, the Sellers shall not be liable for any Damages under Section
6.1(a) unless and until (x) for any individual matter or series of related
matters, the aggregate amount of all Damages with respect to any individual
matter or series of related matters exceeds $100,000 and (y) the aggregate
amount of all Damages that the Buyer Parties have otherwise become entitled to
recover under Section 6.1(a), other than Damages arising from or in connection
with the Fundamental Representations, exceeds $2,500,000, whereafter the Buyer
Parties shall be entitled, subject to this Article VI and Article VII, to
recover such Damages in excess of $2,500,000.



(2) The Sellers shall not be liable for any Damages under Section 6.1(e)
unless and until the aggregate amount of all such Damages exceeds $500,000,
whereafter the Buyer Parties shall be entitled, subject to this Article VI, to
recover such Damages in excess of $500,000.



(3) Except for Damages arising from or in connection with the Fundamental
Representations, the Sellers shall not be liable with respect to any Damages
under Section 6.1(a) or Section 6.1(e) to the extent that such Damages, when
aggregated with all other Damages that the Buyer Parties have become entitled
to recover under Section 6.1(a) (other than Damages arising from or in
connection with the Fundamental Representations) or Section 6.1(e), exceed 10%
of the Adjusted Purchase Price.



(4) The Sellers shall not be liable with respect to any Damages under Section
6.1(a) arising from or in connection with the Fundamental Representations or
Section 6.1(b) to the extent that such Damages, when aggregated with all other
Damages that the Buyer Parties have become entitled to recover under Section
6.1(a), Section 6.1(b) or Section 6.1(e), exceed the Adjusted Purchase Price.



(5) The amount of Damages to which a Buyer Party is entitled with respect to
any claim shall be calculated net of any accruals, reserves or provisions for
the events or circumstances giving rise to the Damages that are reflected as a
liability in the Balance Sheet (other than Excluded Liabilities and Special
Indemnities) or in the calculation of Closing Working Capital in the Final
Closing Statement.



(6) The amount of Damages recoverable by a Buyer Party under this Agreement
shall be reduced by (x) the amount of any payment, indemnity, contribution or
similar benefit actually received by the Buyer Party with respect to such
Damages from any insurance provider or any other third party (net of any costs
of collection and increases in premiums), and (y) the amount of any Tax
Benefit actually realized by any Buyer Party or any Company that is
attributable to any deduction, loss, credit or other Tax Benefit in the form
of a reduction in cash Taxes payable or cash Tax refund resulting from or
arising out of any Damages within 3 years of the date of such Damages being
incurred. The Buyer Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue,
and to cause its Affiliates to pursue, all insurance claims and other third
party payments to which it may be entitled in connection with any Damages it
incurs. If the Buyer Party actually receives any insurance or other third-
party payment in connection with any claim for Damages for which it has already received a payment from the
Sellers (or any of their Affiliates), it shall pay to U.S. Seller or its
designee, within 30 days after such payment is actually received, an amount
equal to the excess of (A) the amount previously received by the Buyer Party
from the Sellers (or any of their Affiliates) with respect to such claim plus
the amount of such insurance or other third party payment (net of any costs of
collection and increases in premiums), over (B) the amount of Damages to which
the Buyer Party has become entitled from the Sellers under this Agreement in
connection with such claim.



(7) If Buyer Parties may be entitled to assert a claim for indemnification on
the basis of a set of facts and circumstances under any of Sections 6.1(a) or
6.1(b), then the Buyer Parties shall assert the claim under Section 6.1(a)
(unless such claim arises out of a willful breach of any covenant of this
Agreement, in which case it may be asserted under Section 6.1(b)). If Seller
Parties may be entitled to assert a claim for indemnification on the basis of
a set of facts and circumstances under any of Sections 6.2(a) or 6.2(b) then
the Seller Parties shall assert the claim under Section 6.2(a) (unless such
claim arises out of a willful breach of any covenant of this Agreement, in
which case it may be asserted under Section 6.2(b)).



(8) In no event shall the Sellers, Buyer or their respective Affiliates have
any obligation or liability for



(A)any Damages arising from or relating to any act, omission or transaction

 ARTICLE VII



TAX MATTERS



7.1Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes.



(a)The Sellers shall be responsible for the preparation and timely filing of
(1) all Tax Returns of the Sellers for all periods (including all the
consolidated, unitary and combined income Tax Returns for the Sellers which
include the operations of the business of the Companies and the business
conducted by U.S. Seller and Mexico Seller with the U.S. Assets and the Mexico
Assets for any Pre-Closing Tax Period) and (2) all Tax Returns of the
Companies that are filed or required to be filed (taking into account any
extensions that have been obtained prior to the Closing Date) on or prior to
the Closing Date; provided that, with respect to the Tax Returns referred to
in clause (2), (x) each such Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practices, unless otherwise required by Law and (y) the
Sellers shall furnish a completed copy of each such Tax Return to Buyer for
Buyer's review and approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) not later than 20 days before the due date
for filing such Tax Return (including extensions thereof). In the event the
Parties are unable to resolve any dispute within 10 days prior to the due date
for filing such Tax Return, such dispute shall be resolved pursuant to Section
7.9, which resolution shall be binding on the Parties.



(b)Following the Closing, Buyer shall be responsible for the preparation and
timely filing of all Tax Returns for the Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period or any Straddle Period that are not covered by Section 7.1(a) and,
subject to the rights to payment from the Sellers under Section 7.1(c), Buyer
shall make or cause to be made all payments required with respect to any such
Tax Returns. To the extent that such Tax Returns relate to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past
practices, unless otherwise required by Law. Buyer shall furnish a completed
copy of such Tax Return to the applicable Seller for such Seller's review and
approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) not later than 20 days before the due date for filing such Tax Return
(including extensions thereof), together with a statement setting forth the
amount of Taxes for which the Sellers are responsible pursuant to Section 7.2
(the "Tax Statement"). In the event the Parties are unable to resolve any
dispute within 10 days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return, such
dispute shall be resolved pursuant to Section 7.9, which resolution shall be
binding on the Parties.



(c)Not later than 5 days before the due date for the payment of Taxes with
respect to any Tax Return covered by Section 7.1(b), and notwithstanding any
dispute as to the Tax Statement, the Sellers shall pay to Buyer an amount
equal to the Taxes shown on the Tax Statement as being the responsibility of
the Sellers under Section 7.2, but only to the extent that the amount of Taxes
shown on the Tax Statement exceeds the amount of such Taxes that are reflected
as a liability in the calculation of Closing Working Capital in the Final
Closing Statement. In the event that the Sellers fail to timely make such
payment, the Sellers shall be required to pay Buyer interest at the applicable
statutory rate for underpayment of Taxes with respect to the amount of such
Tax from the date the payment was required to be made until the date the
Sellers actually pay such amount to Buyer. No payment pursuant to this Section
7.1 shall excuse the Sellers from their indemnification obligations pursuant
to Section 7.2 if the amount of Taxes as ultimately determined (on audit or
otherwise) for the periods covered by such Tax Returns that are the
responsibility of the Sellers exceeds the amount of any payments by the
Companies or the Sellers under this Section 7.1(c).

 (d)Unless otherwise required by Law, without the applicable Sellers' consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
Buyer shall not cause or permit the filing of any amended Tax Return with
respect to the Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period if the Sellers would
be liable for additional Taxes as a result of such amendment under Section
7.2.



(e)All transfer, sales, use, stamp, conveyance, value added, recording,
registration, documentary, filing or similar Taxes and administrative fees
(including notary fees) ("Transfer TaxesTransfer Taxes7.1(e)") arising in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (other than any Transfer Taxes attributable to the contribution of
U.S. Assets to the U.S. Company prior to Closing) shall be borne by Buyer. All
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such
Transfer Taxes shall be filed by the Party legally obligated to file such Tax
Return, and, if required by applicable Law, the Parties will, or will cause
their Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns.



7.2 Indemnification by the Sellers. From and after the Closing, the Sellers
shall jointly and severally defend and indemnify the Buyer Parties against
Damages sustained by the Buyer Parties arising from or in connection with: (i)
Taxes of any of the Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (allocated, with
respect to any Straddle Period, as provided in Section 7.3), (ii) Taxes
imposed on any Company by reason of being a member of a consolidated,
combined, unitary, or similar group on or prior to the Closing Date, and that
are imposed pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of Law), (iii) any failure of a representation or warranty of the
Sellers contained in Section 2.8 to be true and correct on the date of this
Agreement and on the Closing Date as if made on such date and the failure of
the Sellers or, prior to the Closing, any of the Companies, to perform any
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement with respect to Taxes, (A)
in each case determined without regard to any qualification related to
materiality or Business Material Adverse Effect contained therein and (B) in
each case, except with respect to the representations and warranties set forth
in Sections 2.8(g), 2.8(h), clauses (i), (ii), (iv) and (v) of Section 2.8(j)
and clause (ii) of Section 2.8(l), only insofar as such failure results in Tax
for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iv) any Transfer Taxes arising as a result of
the contribution of U.S. Assets to the U.S. Company prior to Closing, (v)
Taxes that are Excluded Liabilities and (vi) Taxes of another Person for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period imposed on any of the Companies by reason of Contract,
assumption, transferee or successor liability, operation of Law or otherwise;
provided that the Sellers shall not be liable with respect to any Taxes (A) to
the extent of the amount of such Taxes that are reflected as a liability in
the calculation of Closing Working Capital in the Final Closing Statement, (B)
for any Taxes incurred as a result of any acts by Buyer or Buyer's Affiliates
(including the Companies following the Closing) after the Closing on the
Closing Date that are outside the ordinary course of business and not
otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, (C) to the extent that such Damages
(other than Damages arising from or in connection with Section 7.2(ii) and
Section 7.2(v)), when aggregated with all other Damages to which the Buyer
Parties have become entitled to recover under this Agreement or in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, exceed the Adjusted
Purchase Price, or (D) if a notice of a Tax Claim in respect of such Taxes is
not delivered within the applicable period provided in Section 6.4.



7.3 Allocation of Certain Taxes. Taxes attributable to any Straddle Period
shall be determined as follows: (a) real, personal and intangible property or
ad valorem Taxes for the portion of any period ending at the close of the
Closing Date shall equal the amount of such Taxes for the entire period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the
portion of such period and the denominator of which is the total number of
days in such period; and (b) any other Taxes shall be computed based on the
Taxes accrued as of the period ended at the close of the Closing Date.

 7.4 Refunds and Carrybacks.



(a)The Sellers shall be entitled to any refund of Taxes (including any
interest paid thereon) or any credit of Taxes in lieu of a refund with respect
to the Companies, the Mexico Assets or the operations of the business
conducted by U.S. Seller and Mexico Seller with the U.S. Assets and the Mexico
Assets attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than any such Tax
refund or credit, or portion thereof, (1) to the extent reflected as an asset
in the calculation of Closing Working Capital in the Final Closing Statement
or (2) arising from the carryback of losses, credits or other Tax attributes
from a taxable period, or portion thereof, beginning after the Closing Date).

thereon) or any credit of Taxes in lieu of a refund with respect to the
Companies, the Mexico Assets or the operations of the business conducted by

Sellers are not entitled pursuant to Section 7.4(a), including any refund or
credit attributable to taxable periods or portions thereof beginning after the
Closing Date.



(c)Buyer shall promptly forward to or reimburse the Sellers for any such
refund of Taxes (including any interest paid thereon) or any credit of Taxes
in lieu of a refund due a Seller pursuant to Section 7.4(a) after receipt
thereof, and the Sellers shall promptly forward to Buyer or reimburse Buyer
for any such refund (including any interest paid thereon) or any credit of
Taxes in lieu of a refund due Buyer pursuant to Section 7.4(b) after receipt
thereof, in each case, net of any Taxes and expenses incurred in connection
therewith.



7.5 Cooperation on Tax Matters. Buyer and the Sellers and their respective
Affiliates shall cooperate in the preparation of all Tax Returns for any Tax
periods for which one Party could reasonably require the assistance of the
other Party in obtaining any necessary information. Such cooperation shall
include, but not be limited to, furnishing in a timely manner any information
within a Party's possession or subject to that Party's control as may be
reasonably requested by the Party filing such Tax Returns. Such cooperation

conducted by U.S. Seller and Mexico Seller with the U.S. Assets and the Mexico
Assets. Buyer, the Sellers and their respective Affiliates shall make their
respective employees and facilities available on a mutually convenient basis
to explain any documents or information provided hereunder.

(a)If a written notice of audit, contest, examination, claim, litigation,
assessment, deficiency, adjustment, proposed adjustment or other
administrative or court proceeding, suit or dispute relating to any Taxes or
Tax Returns of the Sellers, the Companies, the Mexico Assets or the operations
of the business conducted by U.S. Seller and Mexico Seller with the U.S.
Assets and the Mexico Assets is received by Buyer, any Company or any of their
respective Affiliates for which the Sellers would be expected to be liable
pursuant to Section 7.2 (a "Tax Claim"), Buyer shall give the Sellers prompt
notice of such Tax Claim; provided that no delay on the part of Buyer in
notifying the Sellers shall relieve the Sellers from any indemnification
obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent) the Sellers are
thereby prejudiced.



(b)The Sellers shall have the right, at their own expense, to control any Tax
Claims relating to (1) any Taxes or Tax Returns of the Sellers (including any
consolidated, unitary, combined, or similar Tax Return that includes any of the Sellers and reports any of the

Companies for any taxable period or portion thereof after the Closing Date,
Buyer's failure to approve the settlement shall not be considered
unreasonable).

deductible or annual or lifetime maximum out-of-pocket requirements under such
Buyer Plan during the plan year in which such participation begins; and (c)
recognize all service of such Business Employees with the Sellers and the
Companies and their Affiliates and predecessors (including recognition of all
prior service with any entity (including any such Affiliate prior to its
becoming an Affiliate of the Sellers or the Companies) that was recognized by

Agreement in the ordinary course of administering their (or such Affiliate's)
employee benefits), for purposes of eligibility to participate in and vesting
in benefits under such Buyer Plan, to the extent that such service was

Flexible Account Plan with respect to reimbursement claims that have not been
received by U.S. Seller or its Affiliates as of the Closing Date for such
Business Employees as of the Closing Date and (b) provide the same level of
dependent care and medical expense reimbursement account benefits as those
provided under Seller's Flexible Account Plan in accordance with the terms of
Buyer's Flexible Account Plan at least through the end of the plan year in
effect as of the Closing. Buyer shall be responsible for all liability for and
administration of reimbursement claims that have not been received by U.S.
Seller or its Affiliates as of the Closing Date, regardless of when the claim
was incurred. U.S. Seller shall transfer to Buyer accumulated net
contributions to each such account that covers each such Business Employee.

 9.7 Defined Contribution Plan. To the extent Business Employees participate in
a defined contribution plan of U.S. Seller immediately prior to the Closing
Date, Buyer shall, as soon as practicable after the Closing Date, establish a
defined contribution plan for the benefit of such Business Employees and/or
allow such Business Employees to participate in a defined contribution plan
Buyer presently maintains (in either case, the "Buyer's 401(k) Plan"). As soon
as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, either (a) U.S. Seller
shall, subject to applicable Law, cause to be transferred from the Thomas and
Betts Corporation Employees' Investment Plan to Buyer's 401(k) Plan in a
spinoff/merger transaction liability for the vested and unvested account

together with cash (or other assets acceptable to the trustee of Buyer's
401(k) Plan) equal to such liability, and Buyer shall cause Buyer's 401(k)

401(k) Plan. The obligations of U.S. Seller and Buyer under this Section 9.7
are conditioned upon the receipt from the other of a current favorable IRS

Company to, assume and comply with all obligations under the Collective
Bargaining Agreements.

The terms "continuation coverage," "qualified beneficiaries" and "qualifying
event" shall have the meanings ascribed to them under Section 4980B of the
Code and Sections 601-608 of ERISA.



9.11 Eligibility Service. When a Business Employee listed on Schedule 9.11
terminates employment with Buyer, Buyer shall notify U.S. Seller and provide
U.S. Seller with the Business Employee's date of termination within 30 days of
such date. After the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide to U.S. Seller any
additional information reasonably requested by U.S. Seller so that U.S. Seller
can continue to record such Business Employees' "Years of Eligibility Service"
and "Years of Credited Service" pursuant to the Thomas and Betts Corporation
Pension Plan for Bargaining Unit Employees, effective December 1, 2008, and any such information shall be provided as soon
as reasonably practicable after Buyer receives the request from U.S. Seller.



9.12 No Third-Party Beneficiary Rights. Nothing in this Article IX, whether

prepared or will prepare in connection with their representation of the
Companies, in each case that relate to this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements and were delivered or prepared before the Closing (collectively,
the "Sellers' Counsel Work Product"). The Parties further acknowledge that
Sellers' Counsel has been and will be providing, prior to the Closing, legal
advice to the Companies in connection with the transactions contemplated by

of its obligations under this Section 10.4, the Sellers and their Affiliates
may proceed against Buyer in law or in equity for such damages or other relief
as a court may deem appropriate. Buyer acknowledges that a violation of this
Section 10.4 may cause the Sellers and their Affiliates irreparable harm which

10.4, each Seller and any of its Affiliates shall be entitled, in addition to
other remedies that they may have, to a temporary restraining order and to
preliminary and final injunctive relief against Buyer or such Affiliate of
Buyer to prevent any violations of this Section 10.4, without the necessity of
posting a bond.

Parties, subject to Section 10.3, except that any Party may restrict the
foregoing access to the extent that (A) such restriction is required by
applicable Law, (B) such access would result in a violation of confidentiality
obligations to a third party or (C) disclosure of any such information would
result in the loss or waiver of the attorney-client privilege (as long as such
Party and/or counsel for such Party shall use their reasonable best efforts to
enter into such joint defense agreements or other arrangements, as
appropriate, so as to allow for such disclosure in a manner that does not
result in the loss of attorney-client privilege).



10.6 Non-Competition. Until the third anniversary of the Closing Date, the
Sellers and their respective Affiliates will not engage in the Business in

for a period of two years from and after the Closing Date, the Sellers and
their respective Affiliates shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit for
employment or employ any Business Employee holding the positions listed on
Schedule 10.7 as of the Closing Date (each a "Key Employee"), except that this
restriction shall not prohibit the Sellers or any of their Affiliates from
soliciting for employment or employing any such Person whose employment
relationship with Buyer or any of its Affiliates has been terminated (i) by
Buyer, as long as discussions between the Sellers or their Affiliates and such
Person did not commence prior to the date of such termination, or (ii) by such
Person, as long as the Sellers or any of their Affiliates do not solicit such
Person for employment or employ such Person during the period from the date of
such termination to the date that is 90 days after the date of such
termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 10.7 shall
prohibit general mass solicitations of employment (including by way of a
search firm, newspaper or other periodical, or on a website or blog) that are
not targeted at any Key Employees. This Section 10.7 shall bind only ABB Ltd.
and its Subsidiaries and not any other Affiliate of ABB Ltd., unless such

applicable Key Employee from, ABB Ltd. or any of its Subsidiaries.

interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil
investigation demand or similar process), as long as in the event disclosure
is required by applicable Law or pursuant to any judicial or administrative
proceeding, the Sellers shall, to the extent reasonably possible, provide
Buyer with prompt notice of such requirement prior to making any disclosure so
that Buyer may, at its own expense, seek an appropriate protective order. For
purposes of this Section 10.8, "Buyer Confidential Information" means any non-

business conducted by U.S. Seller and Mexico Seller with the U.S. Assets and
the Mexico Assets, including methods of operation, customer lists, products,

or other similar specialized information or proprietary matters. "Buyer
Confidential Information" does not include, and there shall be no obligation
hereunder with respect to, information that (i) is or becomes available to a

long as such other source is not, to such Seller's knowledge, bound by a
confidentiality obligation to the any of the Companies, (ii) is generally

ARTICLE XII



MISCELLANEOUS



12.1 Press Releases and Announcements. No Party shall issue (and each Party
shall cause its Affiliates not to issue) any press release or public
disclosure relating to the subject matter of this Agreement without the prior
written approval of the other Party, except that any Party may make any public
disclosure it believes in good faith is required by Law, regulation or stock
exchange rule (in which case the disclosing Party shall advise the other Party
or Parties and the other Party or Parties shall, to the extent permitted by
Law, have the right to review and comment on such press release or
announcement, and the disclosing Party shall incorporate all reasonable
comments of the other Party, prior to its publication).



12.2 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as set forth in Article VI and
Article VII with regard to the Buyer Parties and the Seller Parties, this
Agreement shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than
the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns and, to the
extent specified herein, their respective Affiliates; provided, however, that
Section 12.2, Section 12.7, Section 12.11, Section 12.12 and Section 12.17 are intended to be for the benefit of
and shall by enforceable by the lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities that are party to the Debt Financing
Commitment Letter.



12.3 Treatment of the Companies. Prior to the Closing, the Companies will be
deemed, for purposes of this Agreement, to be Affiliates of the Sellers and
not of Buyer. Following the Closing, the Companies will be deemed, for
purposes of this Agreement, to be Affiliates of Buyer and not of the Sellers.



12.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Ancillary Agreements and
the Sellers' Disclosure Schedule) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute
the entire agreement between Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the
other hand. This Agreement supersedes any prior agreements, letters of intent,
term sheets or understandings among Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers,
on the other hand, and any representations or statements made by or on behalf
of the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates to Buyer, whether written
or oral, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, other than in
the Confidentiality Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the Sellers'
Disclosure Schedule, and the Parties hereto specifically disclaim reliance on
any such prior representations or statements to the extent not embodied in
this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the Sellers' Disclosure Schedule.



12.5 Succession and Assignment. No Party may assign either this Agreement or
any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior
written approval of U.S. Seller (in the case of an assignment by Buyer) or
Buyer (in the case of an assignment by any Seller), which written approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding
the preceding sentence, Buyer may assign all or a portion of its rights
hereunder to any Affiliate of Buyer or to any lenders (including any agent or
other representative thereof) to Buyer or Affiliate thereof as collateral
security for obligations to such lenders (including any agent or other
representative thereof) in respect of the Debt Financing, including any
refinancings, extensions, refundings or renewals thereof without the consent
of U.S. Seller (including the right to acquire any of the Shares, U.S. Assets
or Mexico Assets), but any such assignment shall not relieve Buyer of its
obligations under this Agreement. In addition, Buyer may assign and delegate
all or a portion of its rights to the Mexico Assets, its obligations under the
Mexico Assumed Liabilities and its rights and obligations under Section 9.1 to
Prodensa Servicios de Consultoria, S.A. de. C.V. or any of its Affiliates (the
"Mexico Permitted Assignee ") without the consent of U.S. Seller, but any such
assignment and delegation shall not relieve Buyer of its obligations under
this Agreement. If Buyer assigns and delegates its rights and obligations to
the Mexico Permitted Assignee as permitted under the preceding sentence, the
Mexico Permitted Assignee shall be treated as a Buyer Party for the purpose of
calculating Damages that are indemnifiable under Article VI or Article VII,
but the right to seek indemnification for such Damages and to exercise all
other rights under Article VI or Article VII shall be exercised only by Buyer
and its Affiliates on behalf of such assignee. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns.

that the party giving notice receives electronic confirmation of sending from
the sending telecopy machine (or if such day is not a Business Day, on the

delivery service, on the Business Day that receipt by the addressee is confirmed pursuant to the
service's systems (or if such day is not a Business Day, on the next Business

12.7 Amendments and Waivers. The Parties may mutually amend or waive any
provision of this Agreement at any time; provided, however, that amendments,
waivers and other modifications of Section 12.2, this Section 12.7, Section
12.11, Section 12.12 and Section 12.17 shall not be effective against or with
respect to the lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or
similar entities that are party to the Debt Financing Commitment Letter
without the written consent thereof, which may be withheld for any reason. No
amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be valid unless
the same shall be in writing and signed by all of the Parties. No waiver by
any Party of any default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant
hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior
or subsequent default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant
hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or
subsequent such occurrence.



12.8 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision
in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of
a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this
Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the body making
the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to
reduce the scope, duration or area of the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified.

 12.9 Expenses. Except as otherwise specifically provided to the contrary in
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, each of the Parties shall bear its
own costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.



12.10 Specific Performance. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the other
Party or Parties would be irreparably harmed in the event any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms, and that money damages or other legal remedies would not be an
adequate remedy for any such damage harm. Accordingly, in any action seeking
specific performance of this Agreement or any provision thereof, each Party
(a) stipulates that there is no adequate remedy at law for the harm or
prospective harm arising from a breach of the Agreement or any provision
thereof and (b) agrees that the other Party or Parties may enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, and this right shall
include the right of the Sellers to cause Buyer to cause the purchase
transaction provided for in Article I to be consummated. A Party's pursuit of
specific performance at any time shall not be deemed an election of remedies
or waiver of the right to pursue any other right or remedy to which such Party
may be entitled, including the right to pursue remedies for Damages incurred
or suffered by such Party in the case of a willful breach of this Agreement,
as long as in no event shall Sellers or their Affiliates be entitled to both
an award of specific performance to cause Buyer to cause the purchase
transaction provided for in Article I to be consummated and an award of
monetary damages for any breach of this Agreement prior to Closing, other than
monetary damages comprised of reasonable attorneys' and other professionals'
fees, costs of investigation and court costs sustained by a Party in a

FORM OF TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT

This TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT dated [__] (together with all schedules
attached hereto, this "Agreement") is by and between Nortek, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Buyer") and Thomas and Betts Corporation, a Tennessee corporation
("U.S. Seller"). U.S. Seller and Buyer are referred to herein collectively as
the "Parties" and individually as a "Party." Capitalized terms used but not
otherwise defined in this Agreement have the meanings ascribed to them in the
Purchase Agreement (as defined below).

1. This Agreement is executed and delivered as a condition to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated as of March 21, 2014 (the "Purchase Agreement"), by and among Buyer, U.S. Seller and certain of U.S. Seller's Affiliates regarding the acquisition of the Shares and the Mexico Assets and assumption of the Mexico Assumed Liabilities by Buyer.

2. Buyer and the Companies (collectively, "Buyer Group") desire to obtain from U.S. Seller, and U.S. Seller has agreed to provide to Buyer Group, for the periods and on the terms and conditions set forth herein certain transition services related to the operation of the business conducted by the Companies and by Buyer with the U.S. Assets and Mexico Assets.

In consideration of the mutual agreements and covenants set forth herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are
hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties
agree as follows:

| 
---|--- 

1.

|

SERVICES PROVIDED BY U.S. SELLER OR ITS AFFILIATES 

1.General. During the term of this Agreement, U.S. Seller shall provide, or
shall cause one or more of its Affiliates to provide, each service to Buyer
Group described in Schedule A (individually, a "Service" and collectively, the
"Services"), unless an earlier termination date for a given Service is set
forth under the heading "Service Termination Date" next to such Service on
Schedule A or unless such Service is earlier terminated in accordance with
Section 5 of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, if Schedule A does
not specify an earlier termination date for a given Service, the "Service
Termination Date" for such Service shall be the last day of the term of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 5.1. During the term of this Agreement, the
Parties may amend Schedule A by mutual written agreement. The parties intend
that this Agreement provides for (a) the continued provision of all
applications, systems processes, support and services by U.S. Seller or its
Affiliates as such parties have provided to the Business prior to the Closing,
as long as (1) Buyer or its Affiliates provide prior funding for any payroll
payments, other payments and related Tax payments that are issued as a Service
and (2) U.S. Seller is not required to make any accounting judgments in
connection with the provision of any Services, and (b) the migration of all
such services to the systems of Buyer, in the case of both clauses (a) and
(b), including but not limited to the Services set forth on Schedule A.

2.Cooperation.

(a)U.S. Seller and Buyer each shall cause its and its Affiliates' employees to
reasonably cooperate with the other Party's and its Affiliates employees to
the extent required for effective delivery of the Services. The U.S. Seller
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts
to make reasonably available to the Buyer Group appropriate personnel to respond
to inquiries from Buyer Group with respect to the Services. In addition, each
of U.S. Seller and Buyer shall designate a point of contact who shall be
responsible for the day-to-day implementation of this Agreement, including
attempted resolution pursuant to Section 1.3 or Section 7.7 of any issues that
may arise during the performance of any of the Parties' respective obligations
hereunder. The initial point of contact designated by U.S. Seller shall be
[__], and the initial point of contact designated by Buyer shall be [__]
(collectively, the "Contact Managers"). Each of U.S. Seller and Buyer may
change its Contact Manager by written notice to the other Party. Each of U.S.
Seller and Buyer shall also designate points of contact on Schedule B hereto
who shall be responsible for the day-to-day operations for each category of
Services set forth on Schedule B.

(b)U.S. Seller's employees, consultants and agents shall have the rights of
ingress to and egress from Buyer's and its Affiliates' premises upon
reasonable prior notice for the purpose of providing or receiving Services
hereunder; provided that U.S. Seller shall cause such employees, consultants
and agents to comply with the provisions of Section 4 and shall be responsible
for any non-compliance by any such person with the provisions of Section 4.
Buyer Group's employees, consultants and agents shall have the rights of
physical ingress to and physical egress from U.S. Seller's and its Affiliates'
premises upon reasonable prior notice for the purpose of (i) accessing and
monitoring the Services hereunder, (ii) accessing, monitoring, and migrating
related data, information and documentation for such Services and (iii)
migrating the Services; provided that the Buyer shall cause such employees,
consultants and agents to comply with the provisions of Section 4 and shall be
responsible for any non-compliance by any such person with the provisions of
Section 4. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Buyer Group's employees,
consultants and agents shall not have any rights to access the IT systems,
software or networks owned or operated by or on behalf of U.S. Seller and its
Affiliates, except (1) for data links that are implemented with industry-
standard security protections against unauthorized intrusions or breaches and
provide Buyer Group with read-only access to order, accounting and other data
recorded in the IT systems of U.S. Seller or its Affiliates that are created
pursuant to the Services and (2) as specifically provided in Schedule A.

(c)U.S. Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, (i) use the same
effort as U.S. Seller uses for its business operations (but in no
circumstances less than its reasonable efforts) to make available the
resources and the personnel required or advisable to provide and migrate the
Services and (ii) prioritize equally the requests of the Buyer Group with the
requests of the business operations of U.S. Seller. In addition, U.S. Seller
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist the Buyer in negotiating
any new agreements required or advisable to migrate the Services.

(d)Buyer may request modifications to the Services as the Companies or U.S.
Seller or Mexico Seller, in operating the business they conducted with the
U.S. Assets or Mexico Assets, may have requested during the ordinary course of
business and U.S. Seller shall (i) consider in good faith the requested
modifications of Buyer and (ii) facilitate the consideration of such
modifications with respect to any Third-Party Providers (as defined below).

(e)For such time as any employees of U.S. Seller or any of its Affiliates or
any Third-Party Provider are providing Services to Buyer Group under this
Agreement, (i) such employees will remain employees of U.S. Seller or such
Affiliate or Third-Party Provider, as applicable, and shall not be deemed to
be employees of Buyer or any Company for any purpose, and (ii) U.S. Seller or
such Affiliate or Third-Party Provider, as applicable, shall be solely
responsible for the payment and provision of all wages, bonuses and
commissions, disability, life and group health insurance and other employee
benefits, including severance and worker\'s compensation, social security and
401(k) benefits, and the withholding and payment of applicable Taxes relating
to such employment.

3.Third-Party Services. U.S. Seller shall have the right to engage the
services of independent contractors to deliver or assist it in the delivery of
any Service without the consent of Buyer ("Third-Party Providers"). U.S.
Seller shall remain responsible, in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, for the performance of any Service it causes to be provided pursuant to this Section
1.3, including compliance with the Quality Level (as defined below) with
respect to such Services. To the extent that any Third-Party Provider fails to
meet the Quality Level for the applicable Service, U.S. Seller shall use
efforts commensurate to those efforts used to support U.S. Seller's own
business operations to address any failures of such Third-Party Provider to
meet the Quality Level. If any Services fail to comply with the Quality Level,
to the extent possible such Services will be performed again at no additional
cost to Buyer. If Buyer's Contact Manager has notified U.S. Seller's Contact
Manager that Buyer has determined that U.S. Seller is unable to provide, or
cause to be provided, Services that comply with the Quality Level and the
Contact Managers are unable to resolve the assertion of noncompliance, then
any Contact Manager may notify (including by email) both Stan Locke and David
LaGrand, or any successors to their respective offices with U.S. Seller and
Buyer, who shall attempt to resolve the assertion of noncompliance. If Messrs.
Locke and LaGrand, or any successors, are unable to resolve the assertion of
noncompliance within two Business Days of the notice, then either Messrs.
Locke and LaGrand, or any successors, may notify (including by email) Charles
Treadway and Michael Clarke, or any successors to their respective offices
with U.S. Seller and Buyer. If Messrs. Treadway and Clarke, or their
respective successors, are unable to resolve the assertion of noncompliance
within two Business Days of the notice, then U.S. Seller shall be required to
directly contract with an alternative provider for such Services, which U.S.
Seller shall select from a list of at least three nationally recognized and
reputable providers for such Services identified by Buyer, and U.S. Seller
shall be responsible for any reasonable additional costs and expenses incurred
as a result of substituting such Service until the earlier of (a) the date
that U.S. Seller resumes providing the applicable Service, in compliance with
any applicable Quality Level, and (b) the applicable Service Termination Date.
U.S. Seller\'s engagement of an alternative service provider pursuant to this
Section 1.3 shall occur no later than the later of (x) two Business Days after
Buyer provides the list of alternative service providers described in the
immediately preceding sentence (it being agreed that Buyer may provide such
list at any time after an assertion of noncompliance under this Section 1.3)
and (y) two Business Days after an assertion of noncompliance is escalated to
Messrs. Treadway and Clarke, or their respective successors (if such
noncompliance has not been resolved as of such date).

4.Additional Services. To the extent that there are services not included in
Schedule A that either (a) were provided by U.S. Seller or its Affiliates to
the Companies or the business of U.S. Seller and Mexico Seller conducted with
the U.S. Assets and Mexico Assets prior to the date hereof (the "Business")
and that are requested by Buyer in writing in order to operate the Business in
the same manner in which it was operated prior the date hereof, or (b) are
required in order for Buyer Group to separate the Business from that of U.S.
Seller and its Affiliates at or prior to the termination of this Agreement
and/or to migrate all of such Services and related data and systems to Buyer
Group then, in either case, U.S. Seller shall, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, upon the written request of Buyer, undertake to provide, or cause
to be provided, such services (the "Additional Services") pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement. The cost of any Additional Services shall be the
pricing set forth in Section 3.1.

5.Quality. The Services shall be performed at the quality level and manner in
which and with a consistent degree of care, skill, professionalism,
responsibility, diligence, priority, timeliness, frequency and, as necessary,
volume as such Services were provided by or on behalf of U.S. Seller or its
Affiliates immediately prior to the date of this Agreement and with the level
of priority and service level response commensurate to that given to any other
business of U.S. Seller to which U.S. Seller provides comparable services (the
"Quality Level"). The Quality Level shall also include certain critical
service level response times for certain business critical functions, to the
extent that the service level response times are measured and standards
therefor exist as of the date of the Purchase Agreement in connection with the
conduct of the Business. The critical service level response times shall be
set forth next to the corresponding service on Schedule A and shall be the
standards described in the immediately preceding sentence. Buyer shall use
such Services for substantially the same purposes and in substantially the
same manner as the Companies and U.S. Seller and Mexico Seller in connection
with the U.S. Contributed Assets and Mexico Assets had used such Services prior to the date hereof,
subject to changes necessary or appropriate based on ordinary course organic
expansion of the Business and post-Closing separation and migration
activities. U.S. Seller shall provide Buyer with reasonable advance notice of
any changes in the Services that are permitted by this Section 1.5 and shall
cooperate with Buyer to use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that
such changes do not adversely affect Buyer's use of the Services or ability to
migrate such Services, but U.S. Seller is not obligated to defer or suspend
any changes to its information technology systems or other business operations
that do not adversely affect U.S. Seller's ability to provide the Services.
Messrs. Treadway and Clarke, or any successors to their respective offices
with U.S. Seller and Buyer, shall confer regarding the quality level and
manner of performance of the Services at least once per fiscal quarter during
the period that Services are provided under this Agreement.

6.Disclaimer. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement (including
Schedule A hereto), the Services and any materials provided by U.S. Seller
under this Agreement are provided "as is" and "where is" without warranty of
any kind, and U.S. Seller expressly disclaims all warranties regarding the
Services, any work or any materials provided by U.S. Seller under this
Agreement, including any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for
any particular purpose, title or non-infringement.

7.Intellectual Property and Data.

(a)Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Schedule A, U.S. Seller,
for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates, hereby grants to Buyer Group
(collectively, the "Licensees") a royalty free, non-exclusive, worldwide,
fully-paid license for the term of this Agreement to use any Intellectual
Property owned or controlled by U.S. Seller or any of its Affiliates solely to
the extent that such Intellectual Property is used in connection with the
Business and is reasonably necessary for Buyer to receive, use or enjoy the
benefit of the Services. U.S. Seller will (at its sole expense) procure the
rights, including by procuring licenses, as are necessary for Buyer to use any
Intellectual Property owned or controlled by third parties solely to the
extent that such Intellectual Property is currently used by U.S. Seller or its
Affiliates in connection with the Business and is reasonably necessary or
advisable for Buyer to receive, use or enjoy the benefit of the Services (the
"Third-Party IP") during the term of this Agreement.

(b)In relation to the Services provided under this Agreement, all data
generated or collected and all Intellectual Property created by U.S. Seller or
its Affiliates either (x) in performance of the Services for Buyer Group or
(y) relating solely to Buyer Group (collectively, "Buyer Data and IP") will,
in either case, be owned by (and automatically vest in) the Buyer Group. Upon
the earlier of (i) migration of the applicable Service to Buyer Group or its
Affiliates and (ii) expiration or termination of this Agreement, the U.S.
Seller or its Affiliates shall copy and deliver to Buyer Group, in a format
reasonably acceptable to Buyer, copies of (A) all data and information
generated or collected for Buyer Group (including financial data and
information, all books, records, files or other documents received, stored or
created for the benefit of Buyer Group prior to and during the provision of
such Service) and (B) all data and information that such Buyer Group entity
has the right to use pursuant to the Purchase Agreement or the Contribution
Agreement. To the extent that a Buyer Group entity requests data in a format
that U.S. Seller or its Affiliates have not previously provided such data,
U.S. Seller or its Affiliates shall provide such data in the requested format
and Buyer shall pay to U.S. Seller its actual cost for any such data
transformation required. U.S. Seller shall separate the assets of the Business
(at U.S. Seller's sole expense, except for the cost of additional hardware and
infrastructure for physical separation of the assets of the Business) from the
systems of U.S. Seller or its Affiliates, and shall separate the Buyer Group's
data from the U.S. Seller's data (at U.S. Seller's sole expense) in
preparation for the separation of and transfer of such data from the systems
of the U.S. Seller or its Affiliates to the systems of the Buyer Group.

(c)To the extent that any right, title or interest in or to any Buyer Data and
IP vests in U.S. Seller or any of its Affiliate or Third-Party Providers, by
operation of law or otherwise, U.S. Seller shall (or shall cause such Affiliate or Third-Party Provider to), and hereby
does, perpetually and irrevocably assign to Buyer any and all such right,
title, and interest throughout the world in and to such Buyer Data and IP,
free and clear of all liens and encumbrances without the need for any further
action by either Party.

Buyer additional documentation in a format and design reasonably sufficient to
substantiate, and to explain the methodology applied in calculating, the fees
charged in such invoice. Buyer shall pay all amounts due under each Invoice no
later than 30 calendar days following receipt of an Invoice, except that
payments for Invoices (or portions thereof) that are disputed in good faith in
writing within such thirty (30) calendar days period by Buyer may be withheld
until the resolution of such dispute pursuant to Section 7.7. Every Invoice
that is not paid when due shall bear interest from and after the date on which

harmless from and against, any and all Damages sustained by Buyer arising or
resulting from (i) Buyer's use of Third-Party IP or (ii) the negligence or
willful misconduct of U.S. Seller or its Affiliates in the performance of its
obligations hereunder, except to the extent any such Damage in clause (ii) is
caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of Buyer. Buyer agrees to
indemnify U.S. Seller for, and to defend and hold U.S. Seller harmless from
and against, any and all Damages sustained by U.S. Seller arising or resulting
from the negligence or willful misconduct of Buyer or its Affiliates in the
performance of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent any such Damage
is caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of U.S. Seller.

(b)Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold U.S. Seller harmless for any and all
Damages sustained by U.S. Seller arising or resulting from each and every
claim for benefits made against U.S. Seller that arises out of or is made in
connection with the Services provided by U.S. Seller to Buyer, including U.S.
Seller's administration of the Employee Benefit Plans as it relates to those
employees of Buyer Group that participate in the Employee Benefit Plans,
except to the extent any such claim for benefits is caused by the failure of
U.S. Seller or its Affiliates to administer the Employee Benefit Plans in
accordance with the Quality Level. For purposes of the preceding sentence,
"claim for benefits" shall mean and include any and all claims, including
claims for benefits in the ordinary course of plan administration and

indemnification under this Section 6.1(b), U.S. Seller will promptly notify
Buyer of such claim, which notice shall describe in reasonable detail the
facts constituting the basis for the claim. Buyer shall not be required to
indemnify U.S. Seller for any Damages to U.S. Seller resulting from any
prejudice resulting from any delay on the part of U.S. Seller to promptly give
such notice. Buyer shall be permitted to receive information and consult with
U.S. Seller regarding, but not to control, the defense of any claim
indemnifiable under this Section 6.1(b), except to the extent that U.S. Seller
determines that such receipt of information would result in the loss of any attorney-client privilege or right under the work-product doctrine of U.S.
Seller. Buyer will use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with U.S.
Seller in exchanging such information and providing such assistance as U.S.
Seller may reasonably request in connection with the defense of a claim
indemnifiable under this Section 6.1(b). U.S. Seller shall not settle,
compromise or agree to an entry of judgment with respect to any claim that is
indemnifiable pursuant to this Section 6.1(b) without the prior written
consent of Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary expressed or implied herein,
nothing in this Agreement shall in any way limit or otherwise adversely affect
(i) the representations and warranties made by Sellers in the Purchase
Agreement or (ii) any Party's rights to indemnification under the Purchase
Agreement. In the event any Damages are indemnifiable by Sellers under the
Purchase Agreement, no indemnification obligation of Buyer under this
Agreement shall apply to such Damages and Buyer's right to indemnification
under the Purchase Agreement shall not otherwise be reduced or offset by
virtue of any provision of this Agreement.

6.2 No Punitive Damages. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, U.S.
Seller shall not be liable, whether in contract, tort (including negligence
and strict liability), or otherwise, for any punitive damages that in any way
arise out of, relate to or are a consequence of its performance or
nonperformance of any obligation hereunder, or the provision of or failure to
provide any Service.

out of or related to this Agreement will not exceed, in the aggregate, an
amount equal to $4,000,000, however caused and whether arising in contract,
tort (including negligence and strict liability) or otherwise, even if such
Party and its Affiliates or suppliers have been advised of the possibility of
such damages. These limitations will apply notwithstanding any failure of
essential purpose of any limited remedy. The limitation on liability in this

Services under Section 1.3, (ii) the cost of any licenses or other rights to
Third-Party IP pursuant to Section 1.7(a), (iii) the aggregate rent obligation

shall provide a written notice to the other describing, in reasonable detail,
the substance of such dispute or disagreement ("Dispute Notice"). The Contact

defined under Section Article 101(35A) of the United States Bankruptcy Code or

7.10 Specific Performance. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the other
Party would be irreparably harmed in the event any of the provisions of
Section 1.7 (other than the last sentence of Section 1.7(a)) or Section 4.2
are not performed in accordance with their specific terms, and that money
damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such
harm. Accordingly, in any action seeking specific performance of Section 1.7
(other than the last sentence of Section 1.7(a)) or Section 4.2, each Party
(a) stipulates that there is no adequate remedy at law for the harm or
prospective harm arising from a breach of such provisions and (b) agrees that
the other Party may enforce specifically such provisions. A Party's pursuit of
specific performance at any time shall not be deemed an election of remedies
or waiver of the right to pursue any other right or remedy to which such Party
may be entitled.

reasonable efforts, to effect the collection of money or other consideration
that becomes due and payable under such Non-Assignable Assets, and to pay to
U.S. Company all money or other consideration received by it in respect of
such Non-Assignable Assets in accordance with Section 1.5. If and when such
consent or waiver is obtained, U.S. Seller will, transfer, assign, convey and
deliver such Non-Assignable Asset to U.S. Company for no additional
consideration. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the
Counterparty conditions its grant of a consent or waiver (including by
threatening to exercise a "recapture" or other termination right) upon, or
otherwise requires in response to a consent or waiver request regarding this
Contribution Agreement, the payment of a fee or other consideration or the
provision of additional security (including a guaranty), neither U.S. Seller
nor its Affiliates will be required to make any such payments or to provide
any such additional security, it being acknowledged that nothing in this

Contribution Date, as and when requested by either Party hereto, the other
Party will promptly execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and

failure to be qualified that would not reasonably be expected to be materially
adverse to the U.S. Business. U.S. Seller has all requisite corporate power

the U.S. Business, and to own and use the properties now owned and used by it,

Agreement and such Contribution Ancillary Agreements and the consummation by
U.S. Seller of the transactions contemplated by this Contribution Agreement
and such Contribution Ancillary Agreements have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of U.S. Seller. This
Contribution Agreement and the Contribution Ancillary Agreements have been
validly executed and delivered by U.S. Seller and, assuming this Contribution
Agreement and each Contribution Ancillary Agreement to which U.S. Company is
party constitute valid and binding obligations of U.S. Company, constitute
valid and binding obligations of U.S. Seller, enforceable against U.S. Seller
in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or
other similar Laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally and by equitable principles, including those limiting the
availability of specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable
remedies and those providing for equitable defenses.

provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing

dispute arising under or related in any way to this Contribution Agreement,

Agreement dated as of March 21, 2014 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise

amendment in writing signed by all of the Parties;



WHEREAS, Buyer and the Sellers each intend to (i) amend certain provisions of

acknowledge the terms by which the closing condition relating to Sellers'
obligation to obtain consents and approvals under the Monterrey Lease shall be
deemed to be satisfied, and Buyer intends to consent to an amendment to the
Limited Liability Company Agreement of Reznor Manufacturing Company, LLC
regarding such company's name change, pursuant to Section 4.2(c) of the
Purchase Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and the mutual covenants
and agreements contained herein, Buyer and the Sellers hereto agree and
acknowledge as follows:



1.Defined Terms.

Capitalized terms used herein that are not otherwise defined have the meanings
set forth in the Purchase Agreement.

2.Amendments to Purchase Agreement.

2.1 Section 1.3(a) of the Purchase Agreement is hereby amended and restated in
its entirety to read as follows:

"(a) Time and Location. The Closing shall take place at the offices of Jones
Day at 222 East 41st Street, New York, New York (or remotely by electronic
exchange of documents and signatures), commencing at 9:00 a.m. North American
Eastern Time on the Closing Date and shall be effective as of the
Determination Time."



2.2 Section 1.3(b)(6) of the Purchase Agreement is hereby amended by adding
the following language at the end of such section:

"provided that if such invoice is not delivered on the Closing Date, the
Sellers shall deliver such invoice as soon as practicable, and in any event
within five Business Days, after the Closing Date;"

2.3 Section 1.9 of the Purchase Agreement is hereby amended by adding the
following language at the end of such section: "Any VAT remitted by Mexico Seller out of the portion of the Purchase Price
paid to Mexico Seller on the Closing Date is a Tax with respect to the Mexico
Assets attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period."

2.4 The following is hereby incorporated into the Purchase Agreement as
Section 1.4(f):

"(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Closing
Working Capital, Closing Cash, and Closing Indebtedness and all elements
thereof shall be calculated without giving effect to the purchase price
payments occurring as part of the Closing."

2.5 The definition of the term "Determination Time" in Section 11.1 of the
Purchase Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as
follows:



""Determination Time" means 11:59 p.m. Central European Summer Time on the
Closing Date."



2.6 The definition of the term "Closing Date" in Section 11.1 of the Purchase
Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:



""Closing Date" means (i) the earlier of (a) the first Monday, (b) the first
Business Day of a calendar month to occur on or after the fourth Business Day
after the first date on which the conditions to the obligations of the Parties
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (excluding the
delivery of any documents to be delivered at the Closing by any of the
Parties, it being understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall remain
subject to the delivery of such documents) have been satisfied or waived or
(ii) such other date as the Parties may agree."



2.7 The phrase "until the Closing Date" appearing in each of Sections 4.2(a),
4.2(b) and 4.2(c) of the Purchase Agreement is hereby deleted and replaced
with the following: "until the Determination Time".



2.8 The phrase "prior to the Closing Date" appearing in Schedule D-6 of the
Purchase Agreement is hereby deleted and replaced with the following: "prior
to the Determination Time".



2.9 Section 9.7 of the Purchase Agreement is hereby amended and restated in
its entirety to read as follows:



"9.7 Defined Contribution Plan. To the extent Business Employees participate
in a defined contribution plan of U.S. Seller immediately prior to the Closing
Date, Buyer shall, as soon as practicable after the Closing Date, establish a
defined contribution plan for the benefit of such Business Employees and/or
allow such Business Employees to participate in a defined contribution plan
Buyer presently maintains (in either case, the "Buyer's 401(k) Plan"). Each
Business Employee participating in a defined contribution plan of U.S. Seller
as of the Closing Date shall become fully vested under such plan on the
Closing Date. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, either
(a) U.S. Seller shall, subject to applicable Law, cause to be transferred from
the Thomas and Betts Corporation Employees' Investment Plan to Buyer's 401(k)
Plan in a spinoff/merger transaction liability for the vested and unvested
account balances, including any outstanding loans, of such Business Employees,
together with cash (or other assets acceptable to the trustee of Buyer's
401(k) Plan) equal to such liability, and Buyer shall cause Buyer's 401(k)
Plan to accept such transfer or, if Buyer and U.S. Seller mutually agree, (b)
Buyer shall, subject to applicable law, take any and all necessary action to
cause the trustee of the Buyer's 401(k) Plan, if requested to do so by a
Business Employee, to accept a direct "rollover" in cash of all or a portion
of such employee's distribution in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the Thomas and Betts Corporation Employees' Investment Plan. In the case of a Business Employee with an outstanding loan under the Thomas and Betts
Corporation Employees' Investment Plan, Buyer and U.S. Seller shall take any
and all necessary action, to the extent allowable by Law, to permit the
Business Employee to continue to participate in the Thomas and Betts Corporation
Employees' Investment Plan (as vested terminated participants) without an
acceleration of the outstanding loan balance, and such Business Employee shall
be eligible to continue to make loan repayments (not through Buyer's payroll
system) during the time that he or she remains employed by U.S. Company or an
Affiliate of Buyer. The obligations of U.S. Seller and Buyer under this
Section ý9.7 are conditioned upon the receipt from the other of a current
favorable IRS determination letter or opinion letter with respect to the other
Party's 401(k) plan (or such other evidence of the tax-qualified status of
such plan as Buyer or U.S. Seller may reasonably request)."



2.10 The phrase "events occurring before the Closing Date" in Section 10.9(a)
of the Purchase Agreement is hereby deleted and replaced with the following:
"events occurring prior to the Closing".



3.Satisfaction of the Condition Requiring Consent in connection with the
Monterrey Lease.



The Parties hereby agree that the execution and delivery of a new lease for
the Mexico Property by and between Urbanizaciones San Rafael, S.A. de C.V., as
lessor, and Manufactura e Innovacion Monterrey, S. de R.L. de C.V., as lessee,
in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer, will satisfy the
Sellers' obligation to obtain the consents and approvals for the Monterrey
Lease that are required pursuant to Section 5.1(h) of the Purchase Agreement.

4.Consent to Amendment to the Limited Liability Company Agreement of Reznor
Manufacturing Company, LLC

Pursuant to Section 4.2(c) of the Purchase Agreement, Buyer hereby consents to
the amendment to the Limited Liability Company Agreement of Reznor
Manufacturing Company, LLC to effect the change of such company's name to
Reznor LLC.

5.Effect on Purchase Agreement.

Other than as specifically set forth herein, all other terms and provisions of
the Purchase Agreement shall remain unaffected by the terms of this Amendment,
and shall continue in full force and effect.

6.Entire Agreement.

This Agreement, together with the Purchase Agreement (including the Ancillary
Agreements) and Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement
between the parties hereto.

7.Counterparts and Facsimile Signature.

This Amendment may be executed in one or more counterparts, and by the
different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed
will be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together will
constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of
a signature page to this Amendment by telecopy or by electronic delivery in
Adobe Portable Document Format or other electronic format based on common
standards will be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of
