guarantees to Buyer and its successors, transferees and assigns, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, the prompt and complete satisfaction by Seller as and when due of Seller&#146;s obligations arising under Article VII of this Agreement
(the &#147;Obligations&#148;). Such guaranty is an absolute, unconditional, present and continuing guaranty of performance and not only of payment and is in no way conditioned or contingent upon any attempt to obtain performance from Seller or any
other Person or any other action, occurrence or circumstance whatsoever. The undersigned unconditionally and irrevocably waives (a)&nbsp;any and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension or accrual of, presentment, demand for performance,
non-performance, default, acceleration, protest or dishonor and any other notice with respect to any of the Obligations and notice or proof of reliance by Buyer upon this guaranty or acceptance of this guaranty; (b)&nbsp;any right to revoke this
guaranty and acknowledges that this guaranty is continuing in nature and applies to all presently existing and future Obligations; (c)&nbsp;any defense based on any right of set-off or recoupment or counterclaim against or in respect of the
Obligations of the undersigned hereunder; (d)&nbsp;any defense arising out of an election of remedies even though such election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or to extinguish any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration,
contribution or indemnification or other right or remedy of the undersigned against any member of the Company Group; (e)&nbsp;any right of subrogation against any member of the Company Group; and (f)&nbsp;any defense to enforcement of this guaranty
by reason of: (i)&nbsp;any rescission, waiver, amendment or other modification of the Agreement or other Transaction Document; (ii)&nbsp;any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Obligations; or (iii)&nbsp;the
dissolution of, winding of the affairs of, or consolidation, merger or other reorganization of Seller. The Obligations, and any of them, shall conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred, or renewed, extended, amended or
waived, in reliance upon this guaranty, and all dealings between Seller and the undersigned, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other, shall likewise be conclusively presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance upon this guaranty. The
undersigned acknowledges that this guaranty is, and shall be construed as, a continuing, absolute and unconditional guaranty of payment and performance. </FONT></P>
