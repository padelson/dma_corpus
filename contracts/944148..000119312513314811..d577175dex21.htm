Purchase and Sale

Section 2.1 Purchase and Sale. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, at the Closing, Seller shall sell, assign, transfer and deliver to
Buyer all of the Shares, free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than any
restrictions under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws),
and Buyer shall purchase from Seller, the Shares, for the consideration
specified in _Section 2.2_.

 

Section 2.2 Purchase Price. The aggregate purchase price for the Shares shall
be an amount equal to $201,600,000.00 (the "Purchase Price"). The Purchase
Price shall be _increased_ by the amount of all Closing Date Cash, _decreased_
by the amount of all Closing Date Indebtedness, and _increased_ or _decreased_
, as the case may be, by the amount of the Working Capital Adjustment, if
any. Such adjustments to the Purchase Price shall be estimated and finally
determined as provided in _Section 2.5_ below. The Escrow Deposit shall be
retained by Seller and applied against the Purchase Price at the time of
Closing.

Section 2.3 Transactions to be Effected at the Closing. 

(a) At the Closing, Buyer shall:

(i) Execute and deliver to Seller the Seller Note and pay the Estimated Cash
Purchase Price (less the Escrow Deposit, which shall be retained by Seller and
applied against the Purchase Price) to Seller by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to a bank account (which account shall be designated by Seller
and communicated to Buyer no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date).

 

(ii) Deliver all other agreements, documents, instruments or certificates
required to be delivered by Buyer at or prior to the Closing pursuant to
_Section 6.3_ of this Agreement.

(b) At the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer:

 

(i) stock certificates evidencing the Shares, free and clear of all
Encumbrances (other than any restrictions under the Securities Act
and applicable state securities laws), duly endorsed in blank or accompanied
by stock powers or other instruments of transfer duly executed in blank, with
all required stock transfer tax stamps affixed thereto; and

 

(ii) all other agreements, documents, instruments or certificates required to
be delivered by Seller at or prior to the Closing pursuant to _Section 6.2_
of this Agreement.

Section 2.4 Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the purchase and sale of the Shares contemplated hereby shall take place at a
closing (the "Closing")

 



-13-   to be held at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on August 30, 2013, subject to the
prior satisfaction and/or waiver of all conditions to Closing set forth in
Article VI, other than such conditions to be satisfied solely at the Closing
(the "Scheduled Closing Date"), at the offices of Baker and Hostetler LLP, 1900
E. 9th Street, Cleveland, Ohio (or remotely by electronic exchange of
documents and signatures), or at such other time or on such other date or at
such other place or by such other means as Seller and Buyer may mutually agree
upon in writing (the day on which the Closing takes place being the "Closing
Date"); provided, however, that if one or more of Buyers Committed Lenders
is unable or unwilling to close on its financing commitment on or before the
Scheduled Closing Date, Buyer shall have the one time right to extend the
Closing Date (the "Buyer Closing Extension") for a period of up to thirty
(30) days by delivering written notice to Seller (the "Extension Notice") no
later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the third Business Day following the
Scheduled Closing Date (the date to which the Closing Date has been extended
is hereafter referred to as the "Extended Closing Date"). In the event that
the Buyer exercises the Buyer Closing Extension, then except for the
conditions contained in _Sections 6.2(b)_ ,  _6.2(e)_ and _6.2(f)_ , the
satisfaction of each of the conditions set forth in Article VI will be
determined as of the Scheduled Closing Date unless otherwise waived by the
applicable party. Notwithstanding anything contained herein, in the event
that the Buyer exercises the Buyer Closing Extension, then from and after the
effective date of the Extension Notice, Buyer shall no longer have, and shall
be deemed to have irrevocably and unconditionally waived, its right to
terminate this Agreement (i) pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ on the basis of a
material breach or inaccuracy of any of Sellers representations and
warranties, and _Section 8.1(e)_, and (ii) on the basis of the failure of
any condition to the Closing set forth in _Section 6.2_ (other than _Sections
6.2(b)_ , _6.2(e)_ and _6.2(f)_ ).

 

Section 2.5 Purchase Price Adjustment.

(a) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
cause to be prepared and delivered to Buyer a statement (the "Estimated
Closing Statement") setting forth, with reasonable supporting detail: (i) a
balance sheet of the Company Group, on a consolidated basis, estimated in good
faith as of the Closing Time (the "Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet");
(ii) based thereon a good faith estimate of (A) the Closing Date Cash, (B)
the Closing Date Indebtedness, (C) the Closing Date Working Capital; and (iii)
based thereon, a good faith estimate of the Working Capital Adjustment (the
Purchase Price  _plus_ such estimate of the Closing Date Cash, _minus_ such
estimate of the Closing Date Indebtedness, and _plus_ or _minus_ , as the case
may be, such estimate of the Working Capital Adjustment, if any, the
"Estimated Purchase Price"). The Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be prepared
in a format identical, in all material respects, to the Balance Sheet and in a
manner using the accounting procedures, methodologies, tests and approaches as
those described in Section 2.5 of the Disclosure Schedule. Buyer shall be
entitled to review and comment upon (prior to its delivery) the Estimated
Closing Date Balance Sheet if the amount of the estimated Closing Date Working
Capital is in excess of $9,250,000.

(b) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to
Seller a statement (the "Closing Statement") setting forth, with reasonable
supporting detail: (i) a balance sheet of the Company Group, on a consolidated
basis, as of the Closing Time (the "Closing Date Balance Sheet"); (ii) based
thereon, its determination of the Closing Date Cash, the Closing Date
Indebtedness, and the Closing Date Working Capital; and (iii) based thereon,
its

 



-14-   calculation of the Working Capital Adjustment. The Closing Date Balance
Sheet shall be prepared in a format identical, in all material respects, to
the Balance Sheet and in a manner using the accounting procedures,
methodologies, tests and approaches as those described in Section 2.5 of the
Disclosure Schedule.

(c) If Seller has any objections to the Closing Date Balance Sheet or the
Closing Statement as prepared by Buyer, Seller must, within thirty (30) days
after its receipt thereof, give written notice (the "Notice") to Buyer
specifying in reasonable detail such objections and indicating each disputed
item or amount and the basis for Sellers disagreement therewith. During the
period beginning upon Sellers receipt of the Closing Statement and ending on
the date on which the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement are
determined to be final pursuant to this _Section 2.5_, Seller and its
accountants and representatives shall be permitted to discuss with Buyer and
its employees, accountants and representatives the proposed Closing Date
Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement, and shall have access upon reasonable
notice at all reasonable times during normal business hours to the work
papers and supporting records of Buyer so as to allow Seller and its
accountants and representatives to become informed concerning all matters
relating to the preparation of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing
Statement and the accounting procedures, methodologies, tests and approaches
being used in connection therewith; provided, that such access shall be in a
manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the normal business
operations of Buyer or any member of the Company Group. If Seller does not
deliver the Notice within such thirty (30) day period, Buyers determination
of the Closing Date Cash, the Closing Date Indebtedness, the Closing Date
Working Capital, the Working Capital Adjustment, the Closing Date Balance
Sheet and the Closing Statement shall be final, binding and conclusive on
Seller and Buyer. With respect to any disputed amounts, Buyer and Seller shall
negotiate in good faith during the thirty (30) day period (the "Resolution
Period") after the date of Buyers receipt of the Notice to resolve any such
disputes. If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve all such disputes within
the Resolution Period, then within ten (10) Business Days after the
expiration of the Resolution Period, all disputes shall be submitted for
arbitration to Deloitte or any other nationally or regionally recognized
accounting firm acceptable to Seller and Buyer (the "Accountant"), who shall
be engaged to provide a final and conclusive resolution of all unresolved
disputes within thirty (30) Business Days after such engagement. In selecting
the Accountant for purposes of this Agreement, Seller and Buyer hereby waive
any conflict or potential conflict arising from any services performed by
such firm for Seller, Buyer, the Companies or a Company Group Subsidiary or
any of their respective Affiliates. The Accountant shall act as an arbitrator
to determine, based solely on the presentations by Buyer and Seller and not
by independent review, only those issues that remain in dispute. The
determination of the Accountant shall be final, binding and conclusive on
Seller and Buyer. Each of Buyer and Seller agrees to execute, if requested by
the Accountant, an engagement letter containing reasonable and customary
terms. Buyer and Seller shall each pay their own costs and expenses incurred
under this _Section 2.5_. The Accountant shall determine the allocation of
its costs and expenses based upon the percentage which the portion of the
contested amount not awarded to Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller, on the
other hand, bears to the amount actually contested by such parties.
For example, if Seller claims the Purchase Price as finally determined
hereunder is $1,000 more than the amount determined by Buyer, and Buyer
contests only $500 of the amount claimed by Seller, and if the Accountant
ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding Seller $300 of the $500
contested, then

 



-15-   the costs and expenses of arbitration will be allocated 60% ( _i.e.,_
300/500) to Buyer and 40% ( _i.e._ , 200/500) to Seller.

 

(d) Upon the determination, in accordance with this _Section 2.5_, of the
final amounts of the Closing Date Cash, the Closing Date Indebtedness and
Closing Date Working Capital (and the Working Capital Adjustment calculated by
reference thereto), the Purchase Price shall be recalculated by using such
finally determined amounts of Closing Date Cash, Closing Date Indebtedness
and Closing Date Working Capital (the Purchase Price as so recalculated, the
"Adjusted Purchase Price"). If the Adjusted Purchase Price is greater than the
Estimated Purchase Price, then Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid the amount
of any such excess to Seller. If the Adjusted Purchase Price is less than the
Estimated Purchase Price, then Seller shall pay or cause to be paid the amount
of any such deficiency to Buyer. Any payments required to be made pursuant to
this _Section 2.5_ shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available
funds no later than three (3) Business Days after the final determination
referred to in the first sentence of this _Section 2.5(d)_ and shall be
deemed to be adjustments to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes.

Section 2.6 Election To Utilize Alternative Structure

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, Buyer shall have
the right to elect by written notice delivered to Seller on or before August
6, 2013 (the "Merger Election"), to acquire the MMP Share by way of a
statutory merger transaction (the "Merger") pursuant to which: (a)
Buyer shall form a new, single purpose entity ("Merger Sub"); (b) MMP shall
be merged with and into Merger Sub with Merger Sub surviving the merger; and
(c) as a result of the merger, by operation of law, and without the further
action of any party hereto, the MMP Share shall be cancelled, retired,
extinguished and converted into the right to receive the portion of the
Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant to this Agreement) allocable to the MMP
Share (the "MMP Consideration").

If Buyer properly exercises the Merger Election:

 

(i) the "Purchase Price" shall remain unchanged and still subject to
adjustment pursuant to Sections 2.2 and 2.5;

 

(ii) the Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant to the provisions of Sections
2.2 and 2.5) shall be allocated $40,000,000.00 to the MM Shares and the
remaining amount of the Purchase Price to the assets of MMP, as mutually
agreed upon by Buyer and Seller;

(iii) notwithstanding anything contained herein, Seller and its Affiliates
shall have no Liability for any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty to the extent such breach or inaccuracy would not have occurred had
Buyer not exercised the Merger Election;

(iv) Buyer and Seller shall amend and restate this Agreement on terms mutually
acceptable to Buyer and Seller to reflect the foregoing and to reflect that
the acquisition of the MMP Share will be effected by the Merger; provided,
that no such amendment and restatement shall have the effect of increasing (A)
the scope of any of Sellers representations and warranties or (B) any
obligation of Seller pursuant to this Agreement; and

 



-16-  (v) Any and all costs associated with effecting the Merger, other than legal,
accounting and professional fees of Seller and its Affiliates, shall be borne
by Buyer.

Buyer that the statements contained in this Article III are true and correct
as of the date hereof.

(a) Seller is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Ohio. Seller has all necessary
corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents to which Seller is a party, to carry out its
obligations hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution and delivery by Seller of this

Seller. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Seller.

(b) Seller has all necessary power and authority to own, operate or lease the

business as it is currently conducted. Seller is duly licensed or qualified to

properties owned or leased by it or the operation of its business as
currently conducted makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except
where the failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good standing would not
have a Material Adverse Effect. 

(c) Assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Buyer, this
Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Seller,
enforceable against Seller in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors rights generally and
by general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought
in a proceeding at law or in equity) (collectively, the "General
Enforceability Exceptions"). When each other Transaction Document to which
Seller is or will be a party has been duly executed and delivered by Seller
(assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by each other party
thereto), such Transaction Document will constitute a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Seller enforceable against it in accordance with its terms,
except as such enforceability may be limited by the General Enforceability
Exceptions.

of the Company Group is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in
good standing (or its equivalent) in each jurisdiction in which the
properties owned or leased by it or the operation of its business as currently
conducted makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the

any material Losses. All corporate or limited liability company actions, as
the case may be, taken by each member of the Company Group in connection with
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents will be duly authorized on
or prior to the Closing.

provision of the Governing Documents of Buyer; (b) result in a violation or
breach of any provision of any Law or Governmental Order applicable to Buyer;
or (c) require the consent, notice or other action by any Person under, result
in a violation or breach of, constitute a default under or result in the
acceleration of any agreement to which Buyer is a party, except in the cases
of clauses (b) and (c), where the violation, breach, default, acceleration or
failure to give notice would not have a material adverse effect on Buyers
ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. No consent,
approval, Permit, Governmental Order, declaration or filing with, or notice
to, any Governmental Authority is required by or with respect to Buyer in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents to which Buyer is a party and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, except for such filings as may
be required under the HSR Act and such consents, approvals, Permits,
Governmental Orders, declarations, filings or notices which would not have a
material adverse effect on Buyers ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.

Section 4.3 Investment. Buyer is acquiring the Shares solely for its own
account for investment purposes and not with a view to, or for offer or sale
in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities
Act. Buyer acknowledges that the Shares are not registered under the
Securities Act or any state securities laws, and that the Shares may not be
transferred or sold except pursuant to the registration provisions of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or pursuant to an applicable exemption
therefrom and subject to state securities laws and regulations, as applicable.
Buyer is able to bear the economic risk of holding the Shares for
an indefinite period (including total loss of its investment), and has
sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so as to
be capable of evaluating the merits and risk of its investment in the Shares,
has independently evaluated the merits of purchasing the Shares and has made
an informed, independent investment decision with respect thereto. Buyer is an
"accredited investor" within the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D
promulgated under the Securities Act.

 



-39-  Section 4.4 Brokers. Except for William Blair and Co., no broker, finder or
investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other fee or
commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Buyer.

 

Section 4.5 Financing. Buyer has delivered to Seller signed counterpart(s) of
the Commitment Letters. Each of the Commitment Letters, in the form attached
hereto, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of each party thereto,
enforceable against each such party in accordance with its terms, except as
such enforceability may be limited by the General Enforceability Exceptions,
and is in full force and effect. None of the Commitment Letters have been
withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any material
respect (and no such amendment or modification is contemplated by Buyer).
There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the
funding of the full amounts of the financing contemplated by any of the
Commitment Letters (the "Financing"), other than as set forth in the
Commitment Letters, and there are no agreements, side letters or arrangements
to which Buyer or any of its Affiliates is a party relating to the Commitment
Letters that could affect the availability of any of the Financing. Buyer has
fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by any of the
Commitment Letters to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement. The
funds in the amounts set forth in the Commitment Letters would be sufficient
to enable Buyer to pay the full Purchase Price and to pay all of the related
fees and expenses, in each case as contemplated by the Commitment Letters.

Section 4.6 Legal Proceedings. There are no Actions pending or, to Buyers
knowledge, threatened against or by Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer that
challenge or seek to prevent, enjoin or otherwise delay the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. 

Section 4.7 Healthcare Regulatory Compliance. Since January 1, 2008, Buyer has
not been a party to any Action relating to an alleged failure by Buyer to
comply with any federal or state healthcare regulatory Laws, and to Buyers
knowledge, no such Action is currently threatened against Buyer.

Covenants

 

Section 5.1 Conduct of Business Prior to the Closing. From the date hereof
until the Closing, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or
consented to in writing by Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably

Company Group to: (x) conduct its business in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice; and (y) use commercially reasonable
efforts consistent with its past practice and custom to maintain and preserve
intact its current organization, business and franchise and to preserve the
rights, franchises, goodwill and relationships of its employees, customers,
lenders, suppliers, regulators and others having business relationships with
it. Without limiting the foregoing, from the date hereof until the Closing
Date, Seller shall:

 

(a) cause each member of the Company Group to preserve and maintain all of its
Permits;

 



-40-  (b) cause each member of the Company Group to pay its debts, Taxes and other
obligations when due, unless the same is being contested in good faith;

(c) cause each member of the Company Group to maintain the properties and
assets owned, operated or used by it in the same condition as they were on the
date of this Agreement, subject to reasonable wear and tear;

(d) cause each member of the Company Group to continue in full force and
effect all Insurance Policies, except as required by applicable Law;

the Company Group not to take or permit any action that would cause any of
the changes, events or conditions described in _Section 3.7_ to occur.

Section 5.2 Access to Information and Personnel. From the date hereof until
the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause each member of the Company Group
to: (a) afford Buyer and its Representatives reasonable access to and the
right to inspect all of the Real Property, properties, assets, premises, books
and records, Contracts and other documents and data related to each member of
the Company Group; (b) furnish Buyer and its Representatives with such
financial, operating and other data and information related to each member of
the Company Group as Buyer or any of its Representatives may reasonably
request; and (c) instruct the Representatives of Seller and the members of
the Company Group to cooperate with Buyer in its investigation of the Company
Group and to do preliminary integration and transition planning. Any
investigation or other activities pursuant to this _Section 5.2_ shall
be conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct
of the business of the Company Group. No investigation by Buyer or other
information received by Buyer shall operate as a waiver or otherwise affect
any representation, warranty or agreement given or made by Seller in this
Agreement. All requests by Buyer for access pursuant to this _Section 5.2_
shall be submitted or directed exclusively to Michael W. Gleespen or such
other individuals as Seller may designate in writing from time to time.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Seller nor
any member of the Company Group shall be required to disclose any information
to Buyer if such disclosure would, in Sellers reasonable discretion: (x)
cause significant competitive harm to any member of the Company Group and
their respective businesses if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
are not consummated; (y) jeopardize any attorney-client or other privilege;
or (z) contravene any applicable Law, fiduciary duty or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. At all times prior to
Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, abide by the

-41-  Section 5.3 Supplement to Disclosure Schedule. From time to time prior to
the Closing, Seller shall supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedule hereto,
to the extent necessary to make them true and correct as of the Closing, with
respect to transactions and events occurring after the date hereof and not in
violation of any obligation of Seller or a member of the Company Group
hereunder (each a "Schedule Supplement"), and each such Schedule Supplement
shall be deemed to be incorporated into and to supplement and amend the
Disclosure Schedule as of the Closing Date; _provided,_ that in the event
such event, development or occurrence which is the subject of the Schedule
Supplement constitutes or relates to something that: (a) has had a Material
Adverse Effect, then Buyer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement
for failure to satisfy the closing condition set forth in _Section
6.2(a)(ii)_; or (b) causes the closing condition set forth in _Section
6.2(n)_ to fail or not be satisfied, then Buyer shall have the right to
terminate the Agreement for failure to satisfy such closing condition.
Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this _Section 5.3_, the failure
of Seller to give any Schedule Supplement pursuant to this _Section 5.3_
shall not give rise to a failure of the condition set forth in _Section
6.2(b)_ hereof or to any liability of Seller to Buyer.

 

Section 5.4 Plant Closings and Mass Layoffs. Buyer shall not take or cause to
be taken, or omit to take, any action that would trigger any liability for
Seller or its Affiliates under, the WARN Act.

Section 5.5 Benefit Plans.

 

(a) With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Buyer or its
Affiliates (collectively, "Buyer Benefit Plans") in which any employees of
the Company Group (as of immediately prior to the Closing) will participate
effective as of the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause the applicable member
of the Company Group to, recognize all service of such employees with the
Company Group prior to Closing as if such service were with Buyer, for vesting
and eligibility purposes (but not for benefit accrual purposes) in any Buyer
Benefit Plan in which such employees may be eligible to participate after
the Closing Time; _provided, however_ , such service shall not be recognized
to the extent that (x) such recognition would result in a duplication of
benefits or (y) such service was not recognized under the corresponding
Benefit Plan. Buyer or its Affiliates shall establish and offer, as new
employee benefit plans as of the Closing Date, to the Company Group Member
Employees and their eligible spouses and dependents group health and other
welfare benefit plans that are reasonably comparable in the aggregate than
the Benefit Plans in effect immediately prior to the Closing. Buyer shall (or
shall cause its Affiliates to) assume all obligations to provide continued
health coverage in accordance with Section 4980B of the Code and Title I,
Subtitle B, Part 6 of ERISA ("COBRA") with respect to Company Group Member
Employees and their qualified beneficiaries who experience a COBRA eligible
event on or after the Closing Date, including all obligations with respect to
all health claims incurred on or after the Closing Date. Subject to applicable
Law, Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer to provide information
necessary to implement the provisions of this _Section 5.5(a)_. Subject to
applicable Law, Buyer shall credit each employee of the Company Group with an
amount of paid vacation, personal time-off and sick leave days following the
Closing Date equal to the amount of vacation time, personal time-off and sick
leave days each such employee has accrued but not yet used or cashed out as
of the Closing Date under the vacation, personal time-off and sick leave
policies of the Company Group as in effect immediately prior to the date of
this Agreement, and allow each such employee to use such

 



-42-   accrued vacation, personal time-off and sick leave days at such times as
each would have been allowed under the vacation, personal time-off and sick
leave policies of the Company Group listed in Section 3.14(b) of the
Disclosure Schedule as in effect immediately prior to the date of this
Agreement.

(b) Employees who are employed by a member of the Company Group immediately
prior to the Closing Date (collectively, the "Company Group Member Employees")
shall continue in employment with the Company Group members, Buyer or
Buyers Affiliate, except to the extent expressly noted in Section 5.5(b) of
the Disclosure Schedule. The term "Company Group Member Employees" shall not
include any employee who is listed in Section 5.5(b) of the
Disclosure Schedule.

(c) Effective as the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the Company
Group members shall cease to be participating employers in all of the Benefit
Plans that are not maintained solely for the benefit of current or former
employees of one or more Company Group members (collectively, the "Parent
Benefit Plans"), and all Company Group Member Employees and their spouses and
dependents shall cease to actively participate in and accrue further benefits
under the Parent Benefit Plans as of the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date. Before the Closing Date, Seller shall, or shall cause the Company Group
members to, take all actions necessary to cause the members of the Company
Group to cease to be participating employers in the Parent Benefit Plans and
to cause the Company Group Member Employees to cease to actively participate
in or accrue further benefits under the Parent Benefit Plans as of the day
before the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 5.5(c)_, Company Group Member Employees may continue after
the Closing Date to participate in accordance with, and subject to, their
eligibility under the terms of the applicable Parent Benefit Plans as in
effect from time to time as follows:

 

(i) Company Group Member Employees may continue participation under the Parent
Benefit Plans which provide "welfare benefits" (within the meaning of Section
3(1) of ERISA), tuition reimbursement benefits or other fringe benefits with
respect to claims incurred by such employees and their eligible spouses,
dependents or qualified beneficiaries, as applicable, on or prior to the
Closing Date;

(ii) Company Group Member Employees shall continue participation under the
CBIZ, Inc. Retirement Savings Plan (the "CBIZ Savings Plan") with respect to
vested, accrued benefits as of the Closing Date, to the extent permitted under
the terms and conditions of such plan;

 

(iii) Company Group Member Employees shall continue participation under the
CBIZ Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan with respect to vested, accrued
benefits as of the Closing Date, to the extent permitted under the terms and
conditions of such plan;

(iv) Company Group Member Employees shall continue participation under the
CBIZ, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan with respect to vested, accrued
benefits as of the Closing Date to the extent permitted under the terms and
conditions of such plan; and 

 



-43-  (v) Company Group Member Employees shall continue participation under the
Parent Benefit Plans with respect to outstanding stock options or other
equity awards and shall fully vest all Company Group Member Employees in such
benefits as of the Closing Date to the extent permitted under the terms and
conditions of such plan.

 

(d) Seller shall cause the CBIZ Savings Plan to fully vest Company Group
Member Employees in their account balances immediately prior to Closing.
Buyer shall cause one or more defined contribution plans intended to qualify
under Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code maintained by Buyer or its
Affiliates to provide for the receipt of rollover contributions of "eligible
rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31)(D) of the
Code) of Company Group Member Employees account balances under the CBIZ
Savings Plan, including outstanding loan balances, within ninety (90) days
after the Closing Date. Such rollovers shall be made in the form of cash,
provided that rollovers of outstanding loan balances shall be made in kind.
Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer to provide payment schedules,
promissory notes and any other information necessary to implement the
provisions of this _Section 5.5(d)_.

(e) As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall assume all obligations to each
Company Group Member Employee pursuant to any cash incentive or bonus program
listed in Section 3.14(a) of the Disclosure Schedule covering such Company
Group Member Employee as of the Closing Date; provided, however, that with
respect to any obligation relating to a measurement period prior to the
Closing Date, Buyer only shall assume such obligation to the extent that such
amount is accrued and reflected as a current liability on the Closing Date
Balance Sheet (for purposes of clarity, any such accrual shall include the
applicable accrued obligation pursuant to the applicable incentive or bonus
program in effect on the date hereof with respect to any Company Group Member
Employee notwithstanding that such Company Group Member Employee may enter
into a new agreement or arrangement, effective commencing upon or after the
Closing, with any member of the Company Group or Buyer and notwithstanding
that any such new agreement or arrangement may affect the amount or timing of
payment of any such incentive amounts). Consistent with Buyers obligations
under this _Section 5.5(e)_, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to,
pay Company Group Member Employees incentive compensation on the same basis
as in effect prior to the Closing Date for the applicable performance
measurement period which includes the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, Buyer and its Affiliates shall not be
obligated to continue or maintain such incentive compensation program
following the end of the applicable performance measuring period which
includes the Closing Date and shall not be precluded from changing
and/or eliminating such program from time to time or at any time thereafter.

(f) Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, provide severance benefits
to any Company Group Member Employee whose employment is terminated during the
one-year period following the Closing Date in an amount that is equal to the
greater of (i) the severance benefits that the employee would have been
entitled to pursuant to and under circumstances consistent with the terms of
the applicable Benefit Plans listed in Section 3.14(b) of the Disclosure
Schedule as in effect on the Closing Date or (ii) the severance
benefits provided under the severance arrangements of Buyer and its
Affiliates applicable to similarly situated employees, in each case to be
calculated, however, on the basis of the employees compensation and service
at the time of the termination of employment.

 



-44-  (g) Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to waive limitations on
benefits relating to any pre-existing conditions of the Company Group Member
Employees and their eligible spouses and dependents and any active at work
requirements applicable to Company Group Member Employees for participation in
Buyer Benefit Plans (to the extent the comparable Benefit Plan provides for
the waiver of such conditions or requirements).

(h) Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, maintain a general purpose
health flexible spending account plan, a limited purpose health flexible
spending account plan and a dependent care flexible spending account plan, and
to accept a "FSA Transfer" (as defined below) from the applicable Parent
Benefit Plans that are general purpose health flexible spending accounts,
limited purpose health flexible spending accounts and dependent care flexible
spending accounts of Company Group Member Employees (collectively, the
"Parent FSA Plans"). For purposes of this _Section 5.5(h)_, a "FSA Transfer"
involves Buyer or one of its Affiliates effectuating the election of the
Company Group Member Employees in effect under the Parent FSA Plans
immediately prior to the Closing Date and assuming responsibility for
administering and paying under the applicable plans of Buyer or one of its
Affiliates all eligible reimbursement claims of such Company Group Member
Employees incurred in the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs that are
submitted for payment on or after the Closing Date. As soon as practicable
following the Closing Date, Seller shall cause to be transferred to Buyer an
amount in cash equal to (i) the sum of all contributions to the applicable
Parent FSA Plans made with respect to the plan year in which the Closing Date
occurs by or on behalf of such Company Group Member Employees prior to the
Closing Date, reduced by (ii) the sum of all claims incurred by such Company
Group Member Employees under the applicable Parent FSA Plans in the plan year
in which the Closing date occurs that are submitted for payment prior to the
Closing Date. Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer to provide
information necessary to implement the provisions of this _Section 5.5(h)_.

 

(i) Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, provide current or former
employees of any member of the Company Group who are receiving short-term or
long-term disability benefits as of the Closing Date with at least the same
short-term and long-term disability benefits provided to such individuals
immediately as of the Closing Date under the Benefit Plans and
such individuals shall cease to participate in the Benefit Plans providing
short-term or long-term disability benefits effective as of the Closing Date.
Seller and its Affiliates shall have no obligation or Liability to pay or
provide short-term or long-term disability benefits to current or former
employees of any member of the Company Group on or after the Closing Date.

 

(j) Subject to applicable Law, Seller and Buyer shall provide each other with
such documents or other information as may be reasonably required to carry
out the agreements described in this _Section 5.5_. Buyer and Seller shall
cooperate reasonably with each other in connection with any steps required to
be taken as part of their respective obligations under this  _Section 5.5_,
and shall (i) furnish upon request to each other such further information;
(ii) execute and deliver to each other, and file where appropriate, such other
documents; and (iii) do such other acts and things, all as the other party
may reasonably request for the purpose of carrying out the intent of this
_Section 5.5_. If any of the agreements described in this _Section 5.5_ is
determined by any Governmental Authority to be prohibited by Law, Seller and
Buyer shall modify such agreement to reflect as closely as possible their
expressed intent and retain the

 



-45-   allocation of economic benefits and burdens to the parties contemplated
herein in a manner that is not prohibited by Law.

(k) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.5_, nothing
contained herein, whether expressed or implied, (i) shall be treated as an
amendment or other modification of any employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement maintained by Seller, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates
or (ii) create any obligation on the part of the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates to continue the employment of any employee for any definite
period. Seller and Buyer acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained
in this _Section 5.5_ are included for the sole benefit of Seller, Buyer and
their respective Affiliates, and that nothing herein, whether expressed or
implied, shall create any third party beneficiary or other rights (x) in any
other Person, including any employees, former employees, or any participant
(or any eligible spouse, dependent or beneficiary thereof) in any
employee benefit plan, program or arrangement maintained by Buyer or any of
its Affiliates or (y) to continued employment with Seller, Buyer or any of
their respective Affiliates or continued participation in any employee benefit
plan, program or arrangement.

Section 5.6 No Solicitation of Other Bids.

 

(a) Seller shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of its Affiliates
(including members of the Company Group) or any of its or their
Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) encourage, solicit, initiate,
facilitate or continue inquiries regarding an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) enter
into discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to,
any Person concerning a possible Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into
any agreements or other instruments (whether or not binding) regarding an
Acquisition Proposal. Seller shall immediately cease and cause to be
terminated, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the members of the
Company Group) and all of its and their Representatives to immediately cease
and cause to be terminated, all existing discussions or negotiations with any
Persons conducted heretofore with respect to, or that could lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal.

(b) In addition to the other obligations under this  _Section 5.6_, Seller
shall promptly (and in any event within three (3) Business Days after receipt
thereof by Seller, any Company member or any of its or their Representatives)
advise Buyer orally and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal, any request
for information with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry with
respect to or which could reasonably be expected to result in an Acquisition
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry, and the identity of the Person making the same.

(c) Seller agrees that the rights and remedies for noncompliance with this
_Section 5.6_ shall include having such provision specifically enforced by
any court having equity jurisdiction, it being acknowledged and agreed that
any such breach or threatened breach shall cause irreparable injury to Buyer
and that money damages would not provide an adequate remedy to Buyer.

Section 5.7 Notice of Certain Events. From the date hereof until the Closing,
Seller shall, within two (2) Business Days of becoming aware of the following,
notify Buyer in writing of (a) any notice or other communication from any
Governmental Authority in connection with

 



-46-   any of the matters covered by the Healthcare Compliance Representation or in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (b) any
fact, circumstance, event or action the existence, occurrence or taking of
which (i) has had, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect, (ii) reasonably could have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect, or (iii) has resulted in the failure of any of the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.2_ to be satisfied.
Buyers receipt of information pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ shall not
operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any representation, warranty or
agreement given or made by Seller in this Agreement and (subject to _Section
5.3_) shall not be deemed to amend or supplement the Disclosure Schedules.
Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this _Section 5.7_, the failure
of Seller to give any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.7_ shall not give
rise to a failure of the condition set forth in  _Section 6.2(b)(ii)_ hereof
or to any liability of Seller to Buyer.

Section 5.8 Confidentiality. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the
Confidentiality Agreement remains in full force and effect. If this Agreement
is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality
Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect. The
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate, however, upon the Closing. Further,
from and after the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
hold, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its or their
respective Representatives to hold, in confidence any and all information,
whether written or oral, concerning the Company Group and/or any member of the
Company Group and/or their respective businesses, except to the extent
that Seller can show that such information: (a) is generally available to and
known by the public through no fault of Seller, any of its Affiliates or their
respective Representatives; or (b) is lawfully acquired by Seller, any of
its Affiliates or their respective Representatives from and after the Closing
from sources which are not prohibited from disclosing such information by a
legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation. If Seller or any of its Affiliates
or their respective Representatives are compelled to disclose any information
by judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of Law, Seller
shall promptly notify Buyer in writing and shall disclose only that portion of
such information which Seller is advised by its counsel in writing is legally
required to be disclosed, provided that Seller shall, to the extent practical,
give Buyer the opportunity to obtain an appropriate protective order or other
reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such
information. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this _Section 5.8_,
Seller may use any of the information covered by this _Section 5.8_ for
purposes of discharging its duties and obligations pursuant to this
Agreement, for purposes of complying with any Tax Law or for purposes of
contesting or defending any claim by any Buyer Indemnified Party for
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement.

 

Section 5.9 Non-competition; Non-solicitation.

(a) Except as permitted by this _Section 5.9_, for a period of four (4) years
commencing on the Closing Date (the "Restricted Period"), Seller shall not,
and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, (i)
engage in or assist others in engaging in the Restricted Business in the
Territory; (ii) have an interest in any Person that engages directly or
indirectly in the Restricted Business in the Territory in any capacity,
including as a partner, shareholder, member, employee, principal, agent,
trustee or consultant; or (iii) intentionally interfere in any material
respect with the business relationships (whether formed prior to or after the
date of this Agreement) between any member of the Company Group and customers
or

 



-47-   suppliers of any member of the Company Group. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this Agreement shall preclude, prohibit or restrict Seller or its
Affiliates from any of the following: 

(i) owning, directly or indirectly, solely as an investment, securities of any
Person traded on any national securities exchange if Seller is not a
controlling Person of, or a member of a group which controls, such Person and
does not, directly or indirectly, own 1% or more of any class of securities of
such Person;

 

(ii) engaging in any manner in any business activity that would otherwise
violate this _Section 5.9_ to the extent such business activity is conducted
on the date hereof through one of Sellers Affiliates that is not a member of
the Company Group (each, an "Existing Business") and the gross revenue from
the competing portion of such Existing Business does not exceed the lesser of
15% of the aggregate revenue of such Existing Business or $20,000,000.00 for
the fiscal year immediately preceding the measurement date;

(iii) engaging in any manner in any business activity that would otherwise
violate this _Section 5.9_ that is acquired from any Person (an "After-
Acquired Business") or is carried on by any Person that is acquired by Seller
or any of its Affiliates in each case after the Closing (an "After-Acquired
Company") provided that, with respect to this clause (3), the gross revenue
from the competing portion of such After-Acquired Business or After-Acquired
Company does not exceed the lesser of 15% of the aggregate revenue of any such
After-Acquired Business or After-Acquired Company or $20,000,000.00 for the
fiscal year immediately preceding the measurement date; or

(iv) providing consulting services of the type provided by CBIZ KA Consulting
Services, LLC, as described in reasonable detail in Section 5.9 of the
Disclosure Schedule, on the date of this Agreement to the healthcare industry.

(b) During the Restricted Period, Seller shall not, and shall not permit any
of its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, hire or solicit any employee of
a member of the Company Group or encourage any such employee to leave such
employment or hire any such employee who has left such employment, except
pursuant to a general solicitation which is not directed specifically to any
such employees; provided, that nothing in this  _Section 5.9(b)_ shall
prevent Seller or any of its Affiliates from hiring (i) any employee whose
employment has been terminated by a member of the Company Group or (ii) after
180 days from the date of termination of employment, any employee whose
employment has been terminated by the employee.

(c) Except with respect to any activity permitted pursuant clauses (1), (2),
(3) or (4) of _Section 5.9(a)_, during the Restricted Period, Seller shall
not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly,
solicit or entice, or attempt to solicit or entice, any clients or customers
of any member of the Company Group or potential clients or customers of any
member of the Company Group for purposes of diverting their business or
services from a member of the Company Group.

(d) Seller acknowledges that a breach or threatened breach of this _Section
5.9_ would give rise to irreparable harm to Buyer, for which monetary damages
would not be an adequate

 



-48-   remedy, and hereby agrees that in the event of a breach or a threatened
breach by Seller of any such obligations, Buyer shall, in addition to any and
all other rights and remedies that may be available to it in respect of such
breach, be entitled to equitable relief, including a temporary restraining
order, an injunction, specific performance and any other relief that may be
available from a court of competent jurisdiction (without any requirement to
post bond).

(e) Seller acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this  _Section
5.9_ are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of Buyer
and constitute a material inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement and
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that
any covenant contained in this _Section 5.9_ should ever be adjudicated to
exceed the time, geographic, product or service, or other limitations
permitted by applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then any court is expressly
empowered to reform such covenant, and such covenant shall be deemed reformed,
in such jurisdiction to the maximum time, geographic, product or service, or
other limitations permitted by applicable Law. The covenants contained in
this  _Section 5.9_ and each provision hereof are severable and distinct
covenants and provisions. The invalidity or unenforceability of any such
covenant or provision as written shall not invalidate or render unenforceable
the remaining covenants or provisions hereof, and any such invalidity or

conditions, provisions and restrictions of this _Section 5.9_.

(a) Each party hereto shall, as promptly as possible, use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all consents,
authorizations, orders and approvals from all Governmental Authorities that
may be or become necessary for its execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the performance of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement. Each party
shall cooperate fully with the other party and its Affiliates in promptly
seeking to obtain all such consents, authorizations, orders and approvals. The
parties hereto shall not willfully take any action that will have the effect
of delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of any required consents,
authorizations, orders and approvals. If required by the HSR Act and if the
appropriate filing pursuant to the HSR Act has not been filed prior to the
date hereof, each party hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing pursuant
to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and to supply as promptly as practicable to the appropriate Governmental
Authority any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the other provisions of this 
_Section 5.10_, each of Buyer and Seller shall, within two (2) Business Days
after the date hereof, prepare and file a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby (all fees and expenses of which shall be paid one-half by Seller and
one-half by Buyer), shall supply as promptly as practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR
Act, and shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the expiration or termination of the

 



-49-   applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable. Each of
Buyer and Seller, acting solely through outside counsel, will (i) promptly
notify the other of any written communication to that party from any
Governmental Authority and, subject to applicable Law, if practicable, permit
the other party to review in advance any proposed written communication to any
such Governmental Authority and incorporate such other partys reasonable
comments thereto, (ii) not agree to participate in any substantive meeting or
discussion with any such Governmental Authority in respect of any filing,
investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to
the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend, and (iii) furnish the other party with copies of all
correspondence, filings and written communications between it and its
Affiliates and their respective representatives on one hand, and any such
Governmental Authority and its respective staff on the other hand, with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) Seller and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give all
notices to, and obtain all consents from, all third parties that are
described in Section 3.5 and Section 4.2 of the Disclosure Schedule;
_provided, however,_ that Seller shall not be obligated to pay any material
consideration therefor to any third party from whom consent or approval is
requested.

(d) Without limiting the generality of the parties undertakings pursuant to
subsections (a), (b) and (c) above, each of the parties hereto shall use all
reasonable best efforts to:

(i) avoid the imposition of any order or the taking of any action that would
restrain, alter or enjoin the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

 

(ii) in the event any Governmental Order adversely affecting the ability of
the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement has
been issued, to have such Governmental Order vacated or lifted.

(e) If any consent, approval or authorization necessary to preserve any right
or benefit under any contract or agreement to which any member of the Company
Group is a party is not obtained prior to the Closing, Seller shall,
subsequent to the Closing, cooperate with Buyer and the members of the
Company Group in attempting to obtain such consent, approval or authorization
as promptly thereafter as practicable.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 5.10_ shall
require, or be construed to require, Buyer, Seller or any of their respective
Affiliates to agree to: (i) sell, hold, divest, discontinue or limit, before
or after the Closing Date, any assets, businesses or interests of Buyer, any
member of the Company Group or any of their respective Affiliates; (ii) any
conditions relating to, or changes or restrictions in, the operations of any
such assets, businesses or interests which, in either case, reasonably could
result in a Material Adverse Effect or materially and adversely impact the
economic or business benefits to Buyer of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; or (iii) any material modification or waiver of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

incurred by Seller or its Affiliates prior to the Closing, or for any other
reasonable purpose (including, without limitation, the defense of any claims
for indemnity made pursuant to this Agreement), for a period of six (6) years
after the Closing, Buyer shall:

 

(i) retain the books and records (including personnel files) of each member of
the Company Group relating to periods prior to the Closing in a manner
reasonably consistent with the prior practices of the Company Group; and

(ii) upon reasonable notice, afford Seller reasonable access (including the
right to make, at the Sellers expense, photocopies), during normal business
hours, to such books and records.

above are subject to the provisions of _Section 5.17_ with respect to Tax
matters.

 

Section 5.12 Closing Conditions. From the date hereof until the Closing, each
party hereto shall, and Seller shall cause the members of the Company Group

to expeditiously satisfy the closing conditions set forth in Article VI
hereof.

 

Section 5.13 Public Announcements. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law
(based upon the reasonable advice of counsel) or stock exchange rules, no
party to this Agreement shall make any public announcements in respect of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise communicate
with any news media without the prior written consent of the other party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and the parties
shall cooperate as to the timing and contents of any such announcement.

Section 5.14 Further Assurances. Following the Closing, each of the parties
hereto shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute and
deliver such additional documents, instruments, conveyances and assurances,
and take such further actions as may be

 



-51-   reasonably required to carry out the provisions hereof and give effect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.15 Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, value added and other such Taxes and fees (including any
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement (including
any real property transfer Tax and any other similar Tax) shall be borne
equally by Buyer and Seller. Seller shall, at its own expense, timely file any
Tax Return or other document with respect to such Taxes or fees (and Buyer
shall cooperate reasonably with respect thereto).

Section 5.16 Names Following Closing. From and after the Closing, neither
Buyer nor any of its Affiliates (including, without limitation, any member of
the Company Group) shall use, or have the right to use, the name "CBIZ" or any
variations or derivatives thereof or any trademarks or logos of Seller or any
of its Affiliates (the "Names"), or any name that is deceptively similar to
the Names, except as provided in this _Section 5.16_. The Company Group may
continue to use the Names following the Closing until thirty (30) days
following the Closing Date, after which Buyer shall and shall cause each of
its Affiliates (including the Company Group) to (i) cease and discontinue use
of all Names, (ii) complete the removal of the Names from all signage,
vehicles, properties, technical information and promotional or other marketing
materials and other assets and (iii) change the name of each member of the
Company to remove the Names. Buyer shall indemnify and hold Seller and CBIZ
harmless from and against any Losses arising from or in connection with the
use of the Names by the Company Group following Closing.

Section 5.17 Tax Matters.

(a) Buyer agrees that it will not, and will not cause or permit any member of
the Company Group to (i) take any action on or after the Closing Date that
could reasonably be expected to give rise to any material Tax liability of
Seller under this Agreement or (ii) make or change any Tax election, amend
any Tax Return or take any position on any Tax Return, take any action, omit
to take any action or enter into any transaction that results in any increased
Tax liability or reduction in any Tax asset of Seller in respect of any Tax
period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the close of business on the
Closing Date, except in either case actions undertaken in the ordinary course
of business or that may be required by applicable Law.

 

(b) Seller shall cause the members of the Company Group to prepare and timely
file all Tax Returns of the members of the Company Group required to be filed
before the Closing Date and to pay all Taxes required to be paid with such Tax
Returns. Seller will be responsible for the preparation of, and the parties
shall cooperate in causing the members of the Company Group to timely file,
all Tax Returns of the members of the Company Group with a filing due date
that is after the Closing Date (taking into account extensions) for tax
periods of the members of the Company Group that end on or before the Closing
Date ("Stub Period Tax Returns", and collectively with the Tax Return
Amendments, the "Seller Returns"), and Seller will pay to Buyer at least five
(5) days preceding the date payment is due, any Taxes due with respect to
such Seller Returns that Seller is not required or able to remit directly.
Seller shall include the income of all members of the Company Group (including
any deferred items triggered into income by Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-13 and any excess loss account taken into

 



-52-   income under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-19) on Sellers
consolidated federal income Tax Returns for all periods that end on or prior
to the Closing Date. Buyer shall cause to be prepared and filed all Tax
Returns of the members of the Company Group for Tax periods of the members of
the Company Group ending after the Closing Date (collectively with the
Straddle Period Returns (as defined in clause (d) below), the "Buyer
Returns"). Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other and act in good
faith in connection with the preparation and filing of all Seller Returns and
all Buyer Returns. Seller and Buyer shall notify each other promptly of any
audit, investigation or inquiry by any taxing authority as to any Seller
Return or any Buyer Return that could reasonably be expected to affect the
liability for Taxes of the other party under this Agreement. Seller shall be
responsible for paying any costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
preparation and filing of any Seller Return required to be filed by Seller in
accordance with this _Section 5.17_ and Buyer shall be responsible for paying
any costs and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation and filing
of any Buyer Return required to be filed by it in accordance with this
_Section 5.17._

(c) The Stub Period Tax Returns shall include all Tax deductions and credits,
to the extent allowable by Law, relating to any Tax deductions and credits the
members of the Company Group are entitled to claim in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If any Stub Period Tax Return
shows an overpayment of Tax, such return shall request that the overpayment be
refunded. If any Stub Period Tax Returns shows a loss, within sixty (60) days
following the filing of the Stub Period Tax Returns, Seller shall cause to be
prepared and filed appropriate Tax Returns to carry such loss back to prior
taxable years (the "Tax Return Amendments"). The economic benefit of any such
refund or carryback shall be for the account of Seller.

(d) Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Seller with
copies of all state and local income Tax Returns of the members of the Company
Group for taxable periods that begin before and end after the Closing Date (a
"Straddle Period Return") for review and comment at least fifteen (15) days
prior to the applicable filing deadline (subject to any extensions of such
filing deadline) for such Tax Returns together with the Buyers calculation of
any Tax refund to be received, or any Taxes payable, with respect to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period (the "Tax Materials"). The amount of any Taxes based on or
measured by income, receipts or payroll of the Company Group for the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the
books as of the close of business on the Closing Date. The amount of other
Taxes of the Company Group for any taxable period that includes (but does not
end on) the Closing Date that relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable
period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number
of days in the entire taxable period. Seller shall have a period of ten (10)
days to provide Buyer with a statement of any disputed items with respect to
the Tax Materials. In the event Seller and Buyer are unable to reach agreement
with respect to any disputed items within a period of five (5) days, all such
disputed items shall be submitted to the Accountant for final resolution prior
to the applicable filing deadline. Seller shall pay to or as directed by Buyer
any amount payable with respect to the Pre-Closing Tax Period of a Straddle
Period Return by wire transfer of immediately available funds within three (3)
days after such amount is agreed to by Seller and Buyer or is finally
determined by the Accountant. Buyer and Seller agree that if any member of
the Company Group is permitted under any

 



-53-   applicable state or local income Tax law to treat the Closing Date as the
last day of the taxable period during which the Closing occurs, Buyer and
Seller shall treat (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to treat)
such date as the last day of such taxable period. Buyer and Seller shall cause
each federal or state income Tax Return of an Affiliated Group and each member
of the Company Group filed after the Closing Date that includes a Pre-Closing
Tax Period (including the Stub Period Tax Returns and any Tax Return
Amendments) to be prepared in accordance with the most recent past practices
of the members of the Company Group, except to the extent not permitted
under applicable Law.

(e) In connection with the Seller Returns and the Buyer Returns, (i) the
parties shall cause each member of the Company Group to carryback and apply
any net operating loss of each member of the Company Group for the Pre-Closing
Tax Period (the "Pre-Closing NOL") to any successive preceding Tax years, and
then to carryforward and apply any remaining Pre-Closing NOL to all Tax years
subsequent to the Closing Date, until all of the Pre-Closing NOL has been
applied, (ii) Buyer and Seller agree that any federal or state income Tax
refunds that relate to Pre-Closing Tax Periods or to the carryback of the
Pre-Closing NOL to any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be for the account of
Seller, and (iii) Buyer and Seller agree that any federal, state or local
income Tax refunds payable to any member of any Affiliated Group with respect
to the carryback of any net operating loss or other tax attribute of the
members of the Company Group for any taxable period that begins after the
Closing Date (a "Post-Closing Attribute") to any Pre-Closing Tax Period
shall be for the account of Buyer and its subsidiaries. At Buyers request,
Seller will cooperate with Buyer by filing an amended Tax Return or refund
claim with respect to any Post-Closing Attribute (a "Post-Closing
Attribute Return"). Buyer shall provide Seller with written notice that Buyer
wishes Seller to file a Post-Closing Attribute Return at least thirty (30)
days prior to the date of filing thereof. Seller shall have a period of
fifteen (15) days to provide Buyer with a written statement of objection to
such filing, provided that the basis for any such objection shall be limited
to Sellers failure to receive the maximum amount of refunds or credits
against income Tax available to them with respect to the application,
carryback or carryforward of the Post-Closing Attribute. In the event that
Seller and Buyer are unable to reach agreement with respect to any such
objection by Seller within a period of five (5) days, any such dispute shall
be submitted to the Accountant for final resolution prior to the filing of
such Post-Closing Attribute Return. Upon receipt, Seller shall immediately pay
to Buyer any Tax refund (or reduction in Tax liability) less all reasonable
costs and expenses of filing such amended return or refund claim resulting
from a carryback of a Post-Closing Attribute.

(f) Buyer and Seller shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each other,
upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information (including access
to books and records) and assistance relating to the members of the Company
Group as is reasonably necessary for the preparation and filing of any Tax
Return, for the preparation for any audit, and for the prosecution or defense
of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any proposed adjustment. For a
period of seven (7) years after the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Company
Group to maintain and not discard or destroy any of the Tax books and records
of the members of the Company Group as in existence as of the Closing and to
make available to Seller upon reasonable notice and at Sellers expense any
such books and records, including in order for Seller to make any copies of
such books and records at Sellers expense.

 



-54-  (g) Any and all existing Tax sharing agreements (whether written or not)
binding upon any member of the Company Group shall be terminated as of the
Closing Date and shall have no further effect for any Post-Closing Tax Period.

(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Seller may, in its
sole and absolute discretion and at its sole cost and expense, amend any of
its previously filed state Tax Returns in order to exclude one or more of the
members of the Company Group as part of a combined, consolidated or unitary
Tax group with CBIZ, Inc.

 

Section 5.18 Representation and Warranty Policy. Buyer and Seller agree to use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Representation
and Warranty Policy. At the Closing, Seller will pay, by wire transfer,
$500,330.00 toward the cost of the Representation and Warranty Policy.

 

Section 5.19 Cooperation with Insurance and Financing. Prior to the Closing,
Seller shall, and shall cause the members of the Company Group to, provide to
Buyer all cooperation reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with
obtaining, at Buyers expense, a "tail policy" with respect to the existing
general liability insurance covering the Company Group and any of its
businesses together with any debt financing being sought by Buyer in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Debt
Financing"), including, in connection with the Debt Financing, the
following: (a) causing the senior officers of the members of the Company
Group to participate in meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence
sessions (or other sessions with prospective lenders, investors and rating
agencies), drafting sessions, sessions with rating agencies or other
syndication activities; (b) assisting with the preparation of appropriate and
customary materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents, bank
information memoranda and similar documents reasonably required in connection
with the Debt Financing; (c) assisting with the preparation of any pledge and
security documents, any loan agreement, currency or interest hedging
agreement, and other definitive financing documents on terms satisfactory to
Buyer, provided that no obligation of a member of the Company Group under any
such document or agreement shall be effective until the Closing; (d)
facilitating the pledging of collateral, provided that no pledge shall
be effective until the Closing; (e) furnishing to Buyer and its financing
sources, as promptly as practicable, such financial and other pertinent
information regarding the Company Group as may be reasonably requested by
Buyer (provided that the recipients of such information execute and deliver
to Seller confidentiality agreements reasonably acceptable to Seller); (f)
providing requested officers certificates and representation letters; and (g)
causing to be prepared and rendered requested solvency opinions or
certificates from the chief financial officers of the members of the Company
Group, accountants comfort letters from the independent auditor of the
Company Group and opinions of counsel, in each of the foregoing cases as may
be necessary and customary in connection with a financing substantially
similar to the Debt Financing; provided, however, that, notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, until the Closing, the Company
Group shall not: (x) be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee
which is not reimbursed substantially concurrently by Buyer; (y) have any
Liability or obligation under any loan agreement or any related document or
any other agreement or document related to the Debt Financing which is not
contingent on the Closing; or (z) be required to incur any other Liability in
connection with the Debt Financing which is not contingent on the Closing.
Seller, for itself and the Company Group hereby consents to the use of the
logos of the Company Group in connection with the Debt Financing; provided,

 



-55-   that such logos shall be used solely in a manner that is not intended or
reasonably likely to harm, disparage or otherwise adversely affect the Company
Group. Buyer shall, promptly upon request by the Seller, reimburse the Seller
and each member of the Company Group for all reasonable and documented third
party out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred, with the prior approval of
Buyer, thereby in connection with such assistance. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, Seller shall have no liability to Buyer or any of
its Affiliates (including any member of the Company Group) with respect to any
Losses arising solely as a result of any assistance provided by Seller or any
member of the Company Group pursuant to this _Section 5.19_. No fees, costs
or expenses incurred by any member of the Company Group pursuant to this
_Section 5.19_ shall be treated as transaction expenses for purposes of this
Agreement, including, without limitation, pursuant to _Section 7.2(g)_ of
this Agreement. After the Closing, Seller shall reasonably cooperate in good
faith with any member of the Company Group to the extent such cooperation is
reasonably necessary for such member of the Company Group to initiate, submit
and pursue any claims with respect to the matters disclosed on _Schedule 3.12_
under any insurance policies of Seller and/or the Company Group which were in
effect as of the Closing and which insure such member of the Company Group.
Such cooperation shall include executing such documents, making available such
information and employees, and taking such actions as Buyer or any member of
the Company Group reasonably may request in connection with the foregoing.
Buyer shall, promptly upon request by the Seller, reimburse the Seller and
each member of the Company Group for all reasonable and documented third
party out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred thereby in connection with
such post-closing assistance.

Section 5.20 Distribution of MMP Texas Assets, Liabilities and Interests.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, prior to Closing, MMP
will cause MMP Texas to distribute all of its assets (other than Tax credits
and other Tax attributes) and all of its liabilities (other than with respect
to Taxes) to MMP and immediately following such transfer, MMP shall distribute
the MMP Texas Interests to Seller and following such distribution and
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary the MMP
Texas Interests shall be excluded from the sale contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 5.21 Medicaid and Medicare State Registrations. Within ten days
following the date of this Agreement, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a list of
the states where any member of the Company Group is registered to submit
Medicaid or Medicare billings and if applicable, the expiration date of such
registration.

indemnify Buyer, its Subsidiaries (including the members of the Company Group)
and its and their respective directors, officers, members, managers,
employees, agents, representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the
"Buyer Indemnified Parties") against, and shall hold each Buyer Indemnified
Party harmless 

 



-59-   from, any and all Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, any
Buyer Indemnified Party based upon or arising out of:

 

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties
made by Seller in Article III, other than the Healthcare Compliance
Representation;

(b) any criminal Liabilities, criminal fines or criminal penalties
assessed against any member of the Company Group after the Closing in
connection with any inaccuracy in or breach of the Healthcare Compliance
Representation;

(c) any breach or non-fulfillment by Seller of any of its covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement or in any Transaction Document;

 

(d) any Taxes of any member of the Company Group for the Pre-Closing Tax
Period;

 

(e) any Taxes of Seller, MMP Texas or any Affiliate of Seller that is not a
member of the Company Group for any Pre-Closing Tax Period; 

(f) any Closing Date Indebtedness that was not taken into account in
connection with determining the Purchase Price; 

(g) any fees, charges, expenses and other amounts incurred by or on behalf of
Seller or any member of the Company Group (including legal, accounting,
brokerage, investment banking, consulting and other professional or similar
fees, charges and expenses) relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby;

 

(h) any earn-out or similar payments owed to Pro Medical or any other earn-out
or similar payments to any other seller of any business (whether by merger,
stock or equity sale, asset sale or otherwise) to any member of the Company
Group (each, an "Earn-Out"); and

(i) any liabilities or obligations owing to the Company Group Member Employees
under the CBIZ, Inc. Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan.

 

(j) Any amounts incurred by any member of the Company Group with respect to
Item 10 of Section 3.12 of the Disclosure Schedule related to any alleged or
actual misappropriation by a Company Group Employee but not in excess of the
amount of any remaining retention or deductible with respect thereto under the
Liability Policy.

 

The items in clauses (a) through (j) of this _Section 7.2_ are collectively
referred to as the "Buyers Indemnifiable Claims"). For purposes of this
_Section 7.2_, any inaccuracy in or breach of, or the calculation of any
Losses with respect to, any Fundamental Representation or Tax Representation
shall be determined without regard to any materiality, Material Adverse
Effect or other similar qualification contained in such representation or
warranty.

 

Section 7.3 Indemnification by Buyer. Subject to the other terms and
conditions of this Article VII, from and after the Closing, Buyer shall
indemnify Seller and its Subsidiaries and its and their directors, officers,
members, managers, employees, agents, Representatives, successors and assigns
(collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties") against, and shall hold

 



-60-   each Seller Indemnified Party harmless from, any and all Losses incurred or
sustained by, or imposed upon, any Seller Indemnified Party based upon or
arising out of:

 

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties of
Buyer contained in this Agreement; or

 

(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation to
be performed by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement or in any Transaction
Document.

Section 7.4 Certain Limitations. The party making a claim under this Article
VII is referred to as the "Indemnified Party", and the party against whom
such claims are asserted under this Article VII is referred to as the
"Indemnifying Party". Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
the indemnification provided for in _Section 7.2_ and _Section 7.3_ shall be
subject to the following limitations:

(a) The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_ unless the aggregate amount of Losses with
respect to such Buyers Indemnifiable Claims exceeds $1,500,000.00 (the
"Deductible"), in which event the indemnity provided for in _Section 7.2(a)_
shall apply only to the amount of Losses that exceeds the Deductible;
provided, that the Deductible shall not apply to Losses arising from any
inaccuracy in or breach of the Fundamental Representations or the Tax
Representation. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any
indemnification claim involving Losses of less than $25,000.00 shall not be
entitled to indemnification under _Section 7.2(a)_ and shall not be counted
toward satisfaction of the Deductible.

(b) The maximum aggregate Liability of Seller for the Buyer Indemnified
Parties Losses with respect to Buyers Indemnifiable Claims pursuant to
_Section 7.2(a)_ shall not exceed an amount equal to $25,000,000.00;
provided, that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to Losses arising from
any inaccuracy in or breach of the Fundamental Representations or the Tax
Representation.

 

(c) The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)_ unless the aggregate amount of Losses with
respect to such Buyers Indemnifiable Claims exceeds $2,000,000.00 (the "HC
Deductible"), in which event the indemnity provided for in _Section 7.2(b)_
shall apply only to the amount of Losses that exceeds the HC Deductible. The
HC Deductible shall be determined by taking into account (i) all amounts paid
by any Buyer Indemnified Party in respect of the retention or deductible
required pursuant to the Representation and Warranty Policy for all claims
made thereunder whether or not such claims specifically include claims for
criminal Liability, criminal penalties or criminal fines plus (ii) all Losses
of any Buyer Indemnified Party that in the absence of the HC Deductible would
be recoverable by any Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)_.

(d) The maximum aggregate Liability of Seller for the Buyer Indemnified
Parties Losses with respect to Buyers Indemnifiable Claims pursuant to
_Section 7.2(b)_ shall not exceed an amount equal to $30,000,000.00 which
shall be determined by taking into account (i) all amounts recovered by any
Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to the Representation and Warranty Policy for
all claims made thereunder whether or not such claims specifically include
claims for 

 



-61-   criminal Liability, criminal penalties or criminal fines plus (ii) all
amounts paid by Seller pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)_.

 

(e) Payments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to _Section 7.2_ or _Section
7.3_ in respect of any Loss shall be limited to the amount of any Liability
or damage that remains after deducting therefrom any insurance proceeds (other
than proceeds from the Representation and Warranty Policy to be obtained by
Buyer at Closing) or any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment, in
each case, actually received by the Indemnified Party (or any of its
Affiliates) in respect of any such claim (net of premium increases and
collection costs relating thereto). The Indemnified Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to recover under insurance policies or
indemnity, contribution or other similar Contracts for any Losses (it being
agreed that if insurance or indemnification, contribution or similar proceeds
in respect of such Losses are recovered by the Indemnified Party subsequent
to the Indemnifying Partys making of an indemnification payment in
satisfaction of its applicable indemnification obligation, such proceeds shall
be promptly remitted to the Indemnifying Party to the extent of the lesser of
the indemnification payment made by the Indemnifying Party or the excess of
such payments over Losses sustained by the Indemnified Party); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no Indemnified Party shall have an obligation to seek
recoveries against a Person that was a customer of Buyer or a member of the
Company Group within the one (1) year period prior to such claim.

(f) Payments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to _Section 7.2_ or _Section
7.3_ in respect of any Loss shall be reduced by an amount equal to any net Tax
benefit realized as a result of such Loss by the Indemnified Party in the tax
year the Loss is incurred. For this purpose, the party entitled to
indemnification shall be deemed to recognize a net Tax benefit with respect to
a taxable year if, and to the extent that, the hypothetical Tax Liability, if
any, of the Indemnified Party (or any affiliated, combined, consolidated or
unitary group of which the Indemnified Party is a member) for such taxable
year, calculated without taking into account any Tax items attributable to
the indemnifiable Loss (and, for the avoidance of doubt, without taking into
account any net operating loss carryovers or carrybacks attributable to an
indemnifiable Loss incurred in any prior or subsequent taxable year), exceeds
the actual Tax liability, if any, of the Indemnified Party (or any affiliated,
combined, consolidated or unitary group of which the Indemnified Party is a
member) for such taxable year, calculated by taking into account any Tax
items attributable to such indemnifiable Loss (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, any net operating loss carryovers or carrybacks attributable to a
indemnifiable Loss incurred in any prior or subsequent taxable year
(determined by treating such indemnifiable Loss as the last item claimed in
any prior or subsequent taxable year)).

(g) In no event shall any Indemnifying Party be liable to any Indemnified
Party for any punitive, incidental, special or indirect damages, or
consequential damages which are not reasonably forseeable at the time of
breach or alleged breach, except to the extent paid or required to be paid to
a third party.

(h) The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification
with respect to any amounts that have been taken into account in connection
with determining the Purchase Price, including, without limitation, amounts
taken into account in determining the Closing Date Working Capital.

 



-62-  (i) The right of a Buyer Indemnified Party to indemnification, reimbursement
or other remedy for the breach or inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty made by Seller shall not be affected by any investigation conducted
with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at
any time, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with
any such representations and warranties.

Section 7.5 Indemnification Procedures. 

(a) If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the assertion or commencement
of any Action, suit, claim or other legal proceeding made or brought by any
Person who is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this
Agreement or a Representative of the foregoing (a "Third-Party Claim") against
such Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is
obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified
Party shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof. The
failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses or is otherwise
prejudiced by reason of such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party
shall describe the Third-Party Claim in reasonable detail, shall include
copies of all material written evidence thereof and shall indicate the
estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may
be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to participate in, or by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party,
to assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys
expense and by the Indemnifying Partys own counsel (reasonably acceptable to
the Indemnified Party), and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good
faith in such defense; provided, however, that if the Indemnifying Party is
Seller, such Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to defend or direct
the defense of any such Third-Party Claim (i) that seeks an injunction or
other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party; or (ii) that involves a
criminal or quasi criminal proceeding, Action, indictment, allegation or
investigation. In the event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of
any Third-Party Claim, subject to _Section 7.5(b)_, it shall have the right
to take such action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal
or make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third-Party Claim in the name and
on behalf of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the right
to participate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim with counsel selected
by it subject to the Indemnifying Partys right to control the defense
thereof. The fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be at the expense of
the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that if in the reasonable opinion of
counsel to the Indemnified Party (x) there are legal defenses available to an
Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to those available to
the Indemnifying Party; or (ii) there exists a conflict of interest between
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that cannot be waived, the
Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of one
counsel (meaning one law firm and not one lawyer within any firm) to the
Indemnified Party, but only to the extent directly related to such different
or additional legal defenses or matters covered by such conflict of interest,
in each jurisdiction for which opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party
reasonably determines counsel is required. If the Indemnifying Party elects
not to compromise or defend such Third-Party Claim, fails to promptly notify
the Indemnified Party in writing of its election to defend as provided in this
Agreement, or fails to prosecute the defense of such Third-Party Claim in
good faith, the Indemnified Party may, subject to _Section 7.5(b)_, pay,
compromise and defend such Third-Party Claim and seek indemnification for any
and all Losses based upon, arising from or 

 



-63-   relating to such Third-Party Claim. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with
each other in all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any
Third-Party Claim, including making available records relating to such Third-
Party Claim and furnishing, without expense (other than reimbursement of
actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the defending party, management employees of
the non-defending party as may be reasonably necessary for the preparation of
the defense of such Third-Party Claim.

(b) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, no
compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claim may be effected by the
Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified Partys consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless the
Indemnifying Party admits it is liable hereunder to indemnify the Indemnified
Party with respect to such Third-Party Claim, the sole relief provided is
monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party and such
compromise or settlement provides, in customary form, for the unconditional
release of each Indemnified Party from all liabilities and obligations in
connection with such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party has assumed
the defense of such Third-Party Claim as permitted hereby, it shall not agree
to any settlement without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided,
however, that the Indemnified Party may compromise or settle any Third-Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party if the
Indemnified Party does not seek indemnification therefor.

(c) Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss that does not
result from a Third-Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be asserted by the
Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party prompt written notice
thereof. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however,
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and
only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses,
or is otherwise prejudiced, by reason of such failure. Such notice by the
Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, shall
include copies of all material written evidence thereof and shall indicate
the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or
may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have
thirty (30) days after its receipt of such notice to respond in writing to
such Direct Claim. During such thirty (30) day period, the Indemnified Party
shall allow the Indemnifying Party and its professional advisors to
investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct
Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in respect of the
Direct Claim and the Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying Partys
investigation by giving such information and assistance (including access to
premises and personnel and the right to examine and copy any accounts,
documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of its professional
advisors may reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond
within such thirty (30) day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to
have rejected such claim, in which case the Indemnified Party shall be free to
pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party on the terms
and subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

 

(d) Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this _Section 7.5_, or any
other provision of this Agreement, Seller shall have the sole and absolute
right to control (i) all matters pertaining to any Earn-Out, including,
without limitation, any disputes as to amounts owed and any settlement
discussions, and (ii) all matters relating to any Taxes for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period.

 



-64-  Section 7.6 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All
indemnification payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the
parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by Law.

Section 7.7 Buyers Remedy for Breach of Healthcare Compliance Representation.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each
Buyer Indemnified Partys sole source of recovery for Losses arising from any
inaccuracy in or breach of the Healthcare Compliance Representation (other
than Losses for criminal Liabilities, criminal fines or criminal penalties
assessed against any member of the Company Group in connection with any
inaccuracy in or breach of the Healthcare Compliance Representation) shall be
recovery from the insurance coverage provided by the Representation and
Warranty Policy, and in no event will any Buyer Indemnified Party make a
claim for indemnification against, seek to recover from, or have any right to
recover from Seller or any of its Affiliates for such Buyer Indemnified
Partys Losses arising from any inaccuracy in or breach of the Healthcare
Compliance Representation (other than Losses for criminal Liabilities,
criminal fines or criminal penalties assessed against any member of the
Company Group in connection with any inaccuracy in or breach of the Healthcare
Compliance Representation). As soon as is reasonably practicable, Buyer shall
provide Seller with notice of any claim made against the Representation and
Warranty Policy. Seller shall cooperate with Buyer in all respects with
respect to the making of any such claim.

 

Section 7.8 Exclusive Remedies. The parties acknowledge and agree that their
sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims (other than
claims pursuant to _Section 7.7_ and claims that Seller or Buyer fraudulently
induced the other party to enter into, or perpetrated fraud in connection
with, this Agreement) for any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein, shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VII. Nothing in this
_Section 7.8_ shall limit any Persons right to seek and obtain (a) any
equitable relief, including specific performance, temporary restraining order
or temporary or permanent injunction, (b) any remedy on account of fraud or
criminal conduct in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the performance of a partys obligations hereunder, or (c)
recovery against the Representation and Warranty Policy.

Section 7.9 Indemnity Payments. Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying
Party or finally adjudicated to be payable pursuant to this Article VII, the
Indemnifying Party shall satisfy its obligations within twenty (20) Business
Days of such agreement or final, non-appealable adjudication by wire transfer
of immediately available funds. The parties agree that should an Indemnifying
Party not make full payment of any such liquidated amounts within such twenty
(20)-day Business Day period, any liquidated amount payable shall accrue
interest from and including the date of agreement of the Indemnifying Party or
final, non-appealable adjudication to the date such payment has been made at
a rate per annum equal to 5%.

ARTICLE VIII

breach of any provision of this Agreement and there has been a material
breach, inaccuracy in or failure to perform any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement made by Seller (without regard to any materiality,
Material Adverse Effect or similar qualifications contained in any
representation or warranty) pursuant to this Agreement that would give rise
to the failure of any of the conditions specified in Article VI and such
breach, inaccuracy or failure cannot be cured by Seller on or prior to the
Drop Dead Date; or

 

(c) by Seller by written notice to Buyer if Seller is not then in material

Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ shall not be available to such
party if the action or inaction of such party or any of its Affiliates has
been a principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the Closing to occur
on or before such date and such action or failure to act constitutes a breach
of this Agreement; or

(ii) if there shall be any Law that makes consummation of the transactions

(e) by Buyer if there has been a Material Adverse Effect;

Extended Closing Date as contemplated in Article II;

 

(h) by Buyer at any time, without cause, by written notice delivered to

Section 8.2 Termination Fee.

(a) If the Seller validly terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)_, _Section 8.1(d)_, _Section 8.1(f)_ or _Section 8.1(g)_ or if Buyer
terminates this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 8.1(h)_ or _Section 8.1(d)_
following Buyers election to exercise the Buyer Closing Extension, then
Seller shall receive as a termination fee (the "Termination Fee") the
Escrow Deposit (which is being released to Seller upon the execution and
delivery of this Agreement) and the Second Escrow Deposit, in each case free
and clear of any claim by Buyer The portion of the Termination Fee not paid
through Sellers permanent retention of the Escrow Deposit shall be paid from
the Second Escrow Deposit by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account of the Seller specified in writing by the Seller, such payment to
be made within five (5) Business Days of the Sellers delivery of notice of
such termination by Buyer or Seller. If Seller validly terminates this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(i)_, or Buyer validly terminates this
Agreement pursuant to  _Section 8.1(b)_, _Section 8.1(d)_ (prior to Buyers
election to exercise the Buyer Closing Extension) or _Section 8.1(e)_ (prior
to Buyers election to exercise the Buyer Closing Extension), or this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)_, Buyer shall not be
required to pay the Termination Fee and Buyer shall receive the Second Escrow
Deposit by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account of
Buyer specified in writing by Buyer, such payment to be made within five (5)
Business Days of the Sellers delivery of notice of such termination by Buyer
or Seller. Upon payment of the Termination Fee, Buyer shall (notwithstanding
the provisions of _Section 8.4_) have no further liability to the Seller or
any other Person with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. In the event that Buyer pays the Termination
Fee pursuant to this _Section 8.2_, payment of the Termination Fee
(including Sellers permanent retention of the Escrow Deposit) shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Seller and any other Person against any
Buyer Indemnified Parties and any Committed Lender for any Losses suffered or
incurred as a result of or under this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the failure of the Closing to occur.
Simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Buyer is
depositing the sum of $1,000,000.00 to be held in an escrow account with
JPMorgan Chase Bank pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement (the "Second
Escrow Deposit").

 

(b) Upon payment of the Termination Fee, no Person shall have any rights or
claims against any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties and any Committed Lender
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made
in connection herewith, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise, and none of the Buyer Indemnified Parties and none of the
Committed Lenders shall have any further liability relating to or arising out
of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or in respect
of any representations made or alleged

 



-67-   to be made in connection herewith. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that (i) in no event shall Buyer be required to pay the Termination Fee on
more than one occasion and (ii) any payment of the Termination Fee, including
Sellers permanent retention of the Escrow Deposit, described in this _Section
8.2_ is not a penalty but is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that
will compensate the Seller in the circumstances in which such fees are
payable for the efforts and resources expended and the opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

Section 8.3 Disposition of Escrow Deposit. If (i) Seller validly terminates
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(i)_, or (ii) Buyer validly terminates
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ or  _Section 8.1(e)_ (prior to
Buyers election to exercise the Buyer Closing Extension), or (iii) this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)_, then in addition to
Buyer receiving the Second Escrow Deposit pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_, the
Escrow Deposit shall be paid by Seller to Buyer by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account of Buyer specified in writing by
Buyer, such payment to be made within five (5) Business Days of the Sellers
or Buyers, as applicable, delivery of notice of such termination. If the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, then the Escrow
Deposit shall be applied against the Purchase Price at Closing. In the event
that the Termination Fee is properly payable by Buyer pursuant to _Section
8.2(a)_, Seller shall be entitled to permanently retain the Escrow Deposit
free of any claims of Buyer. The return of the Escrow Deposit shall be
Buyers sole and exclusive remedy in the case of a termination pursuant to
_Section 8.1(i)_ and, in such case, in no event will Seller, any member of
the Company Group or any of their respective Affiliates be liable to Buyer
for any damages unless Seller sells any member of the Company Group in one or
more separate transaction that are not part of an Enterprise Transaction at
any time within the 18-month period immediately following the date of
termination of this Agreement. In no event will Buyer be entitled to the
remedy of specific performance.

 

Section 8.4 Procedure and Effect of Termination. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with this Article VIII, written
notice thereof shall be given by a terminating party to the other parties, and
this Agreement shall terminate and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be abandoned without further action by any of the parties. If this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to this Article VIII:

(a) Buyer shall promptly cause to be returned to Seller or destroy all
documents and information obtained in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and all documents and information obtained in
connection with Buyers investigation of the Business from Seller or
its representatives, including any copies made by or supplied to Buyer or any
of Buyers agents of such documents or information.

(b) The parties hereto shall remain bound by the provisions of this Article
VIII and _Section 5.8_ and Article IX hereof.

 

(c) Except as provided to the contrary in _Section 8.2(a)_, nothing herein
will relieve any party from any liability for any breach by such party of its
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement occurring prior to such termination.

Section 9.3 Interpretation; Reliance on Counsel. For purposes of this
Agreement: (a) the words "include," "includes" and "including" shall be
deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation"; (b) the word "or" is
not exclusive; and (c) the words "herein," "hereof," "hereby," "hereto" and
"hereunder" refer to this Agreement as a whole. Unless the context otherwise
requires, references herein: (x) to Articles, Sections, Disclosure Schedule
and Exhibits mean the Articles and Sections of, and Disclosure Schedule and
Exhibits attached to, this Agreement; (y) to an agreement, instrument or other
document means such agreement, instrument or other document as amended,
supplemented and modified from time to time to the extent permitted by the
provisions thereof; and (z) to a statute means such statute as amended from
time to time and includes any successor legislation thereto and any
regulations promulgated thereunder. Each party has consulted such legal,
financial or other expert as it deems necessary or desirable before entering
into this Agreement and each party represents that it has read and understands
the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement shall be construed without regard
to any presumption or rule requiring construction or interpretation against
the party drafting an instrument or causing any instrument to be drafted. The
Disclosure Schedule and Exhibits referred to herein shall be construed with,
and as an integral part of, this Agreement to the same extent as if they were
set forth verbatim herein. Any disclosure under one section of the Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed disclosed in other sections of the Disclosure
Schedule to the extent the relevance of such disclosure to such other section
is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure.

Section 9.4 Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for reference only
and shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement.

 

Section 9.5 Severability. If any term or provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of
this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in
any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable
manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 



-70-  Section 9.6 Entire Agreement; No Other Duties. This Agreement,
the Confidentiality Agreement and the Escrow Agreement constitute the sole
and entire agreement of the parties to this Agreement with respect to the
subject matter contained herein, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous
representations, warranties, understandings and agreements, both written and
oral, with respect to such subject matter. In the event of any inconsistency
between the statements in the body of this Agreement, the Exhibits and
Disclosure Schedule (other than an exception expressly set forth as such in
the Disclosure Schedule), the statements in the body of this Agreement will
control. The only duties and obligations of the parties under this Agreement
are as specifically set forth in this Agreement, and no other duties or
obligations shall be implied in fact, law or equity or under any principle of
fiduciary obligation.

 

Section 9.7 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Neither party may assign its rights or
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided,
however, that Buyer may collaterally assign any of its rights, but not its
obligations, hereunder to any lender providing financing to Buyer in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. No assignment shall
relieve the assigning party of any of its obligations hereunder.

Section 9.8 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in  _Section
5.7_, Article VII and this _Section 9.8_, this Agreement is for the sole
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall
confer upon any other Person or entity any legal or equitable right, benefit
or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committed Lenders will have the
rights provided in _Section 8.2_, _Section 9.9_, _Section9.10,_ and
_Section 9.13_ shall be third party beneficiaries of such Sections and shall
have the right to enforce such Sections. 

Section 9.9 Amendment and Modification; Waiver. This Agreement may only be
amended, modified or supplemented by an agreement in writing signed by each
party hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall not be entitled to
amend any of _Sections 8.2_ , _9.8_ , this _9.9_ , _9.10_ , or _9.13_ without
the advance written consent of the Committed Lenders. No waiver by any party
of any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless explicitly set forth
in writing and signed by the party so waiving. No waiver by any party shall
operate or be construed as a waiver in respect of any failure, breach or
default not expressly identified by such written waiver, whether of a similar
or different character, and whether occurring before or after that waiver.
Except as otherwise set forth herein, no failure to exercise, or delay in
exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege arising from this Agreement
shall operate or be construed as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
remedy, power or privilege.

 

Section 9.10 Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal laws of the State of Ohio without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of law provision 

 



-71-   or rule (whether of the State of Ohio or any other jurisdiction) that would
cause the application of Laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the
State of Ohio. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereby
agrees that it will not bring or support any Action, proceeding or claim of
any kind or description (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise),
against the Committed Lenders arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the Commitment Letter, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the
actions of such party in the negotiation, administration, performance and
enforcement hereof or thereof, in any forum other than the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York or any New York state
court sitting in New York County, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives and agrees not to plead in any court any objection to the laying of
venue of any Action, proceeding or claim in any such court has been brought
in an inconvenient forum, and that the provisions of _Section 9.10(b)_
relating to the waiver of jury trial shall apply to any such Action,
proceeding or claim. The provisions of this  _Section 9.10(a) and (b)_ shall
be enforceable by each Committed Lender and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES
AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE COMMITMENT LETTERS OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES
AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION, (B) SUCH PARTY
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS
WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 9.10(b).

 

Section 9.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall be
deemed to be one and the same agreement.

Section 9.12 Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Mail. This Agreement and any
signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement,
and any amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by
means of a facsimile machine or electronic mail, shall be treated in all
manner and respects as an original agreement or instrument and shall be
considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original
signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request of any party hereto
or to any such agreement or instrument, each other party hereto or thereto
shall re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to all other parties.
No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument shall raise the use of
a facsimile machine or electronic mail to deliver a signature or the fact
that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated
through the use of a facsimile machine or electronic mail as a defense to the
formation of a contract and each such party forever waives any such defense.

 



-72-  Section 9.13 Financing Sources. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, (a) neither the Seller nor any of its stockholders,
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, controlling Persons or agents
shall have any rights or claims against any Committed Lender or any of their
respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
shareholders, managers, members, directors, officers or Affiliates in
connection with this Agreement, the debt financing provided for in the
Commitment Letters or any alternative or replacement financing, or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law, in contract,
in tort or otherwise; and (b) no Committed Lender or any of its respective
former, current or future general or limited partners, shareholders, managers,
members, directors, officers or Affiliates shall have any Liability or
obligation to the Seller or any of its Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, controlling Persons or agents relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the debt financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters or any
alternative or replacement financing, or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby.

 



-73-  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be
executed as of the date first written above by their respective officers
thereunto duly authorized.

[Signature Page to Stock Purchase Agreement] _CBIZ, Inc. Guaranty_

The undersigned, the ultimate parent entity of Seller, for good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which hereby are acknowledged,
hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to Buyer and
its successors, transferees and assigns, as primary obligor and not merely as
surety, the prompt and complete satisfaction by Seller as and when due of
Sellers obligations arising under Article VII of this Agreement (the
"Obligations"). Such guaranty is an absolute, unconditional, present and
continuing guaranty of performance and not only of payment and is in no way
conditioned or contingent upon any attempt to obtain performance from Seller
or any other Person or any other action, occurrence or circumstance
whatsoever. The undersigned unconditionally and irrevocably waives (a) any and
all notice of the creation, renewal, extension or accrual of, presentment,
demand for performance, non-performance, default, acceleration, protest or
dishonor and any other notice with respect to any of the Obligations and
notice or proof of reliance by Buyer upon this guaranty or acceptance of this
guaranty; (b) any right to revoke this guaranty and acknowledges that this
guaranty is continuing in nature and applies to all presently existing and
future Obligations; (c) any defense based on any right of set-off or
recoupment or counterclaim against or in respect of the Obligations of the
undersigned hereunder; (d) any defense arising out of an election of remedies
even though such election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or
to extinguish any right of subrogation, reimbursement,
exoneration, contribution or indemnification or other right or remedy of the
undersigned against any member of the Company Group; (e) any right of
subrogation against any member of the Company Group; and (f) any defense to
enforcement of this guaranty by reason of: (i) any rescission, waiver,
amendment or other modification of the Agreement or other Transaction
Document; (ii) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the
performance of the Obligations; or (iii) the dissolution of, winding of the
affairs of, or consolidation, merger or other reorganization of Seller. The
Obligations, and any of them, shall conclusively be deemed to have been
created, contracted or incurred, or renewed, extended, amended or waived, in
reliance upon this guaranty, and all dealings between Seller and the
undersigned, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other, shall likewise be
conclusively presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance upon this
guaranty. The undersigned acknowledges that this guaranty is, and shall be
construed as, a continuing, absolute and unconditional guaranty of payment and
performance.
