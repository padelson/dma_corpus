Cash shall be subject to Buyer's review and approval, which shall not be

(c) Following its receipt from Buyer of the draft Final Balance Sheet and the

Sheet and the Closing Statement (and Seller shall have the right, at its own
cost, to examine the work papers and financial records used or generated in
connection with the preparation of the draft Final Balance Sheet and the
Closing Statement and such other documents as Seller may reasonably request
in connection with its review of the draft Final Balance Sheet and the
Closing Statement) and to inform Buyer in writing of any disagreement that it
may have with the draft Final Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement, which
objection shall specify in reasonable detail Seller's disagreement with the
draft Final Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement (the " _Objection_ "). If
Buyer does not receive the Objection within such 30-day period, the draft
Final Balance Sheet and the amount of the Final Net Working Capital and the
Final Closing Cash set forth on the Closing Statement shall be deemed to have
been accepted by Seller and shall become binding upon Seller, and the
calculation of the Final Net Working Capital and the Final Closing Cash on
the Closing Statement shall be the Final Net Working Capital and the Final
Closing Cash, respectively. If Seller does timely deliver an Objection to
Buyer, Buyer shall then have 15 days from the date of receipt of such
Objection (the " _Review Period_ ") to review and respond to the Objection
(and Buyer shall have the right, at its own cost, to examine the work papers
and financial records used or generated in connection with the preparation of
the Objection and such other documents as Buyer may reasonably request in
connection with its review of the Objection). Buyer and Seller shall attempt
in good faith to resolve any disagreements with respect to the Final Balance
Sheet and the determination of the Final Net Working Capital and the Final
Closing Cash. If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve all of their
disagreements with respect to the Final Balance Sheet or the determination of
the Final Net Working Capital and the Final Closing Cash within 10 days
following the expiration of Buyer's Review Period, Buyer and Seller shall
promptly refer the dispute to the CPA Firm, which shall resolve such
disagreements. Buyer and Seller shall direct the CPA Firm to use its
reasonable best efforts to render its determination within 20 days after the
dispute is first submitted to the CPA Firm. The CPA Firm, acting as certified
public accountants and not arbitrators, shall issue a determination which
shall be conclusive and binding upon Buyer and Seller. Buyer and Seller shall
make readily available to the CPA Firm all relevant books and records relating
to the Closing Statement and all other items reasonably requested by the CPA
Firm. The Final Balance Sheet, the Final Net Working Capital and the Final
Closing Cash as determined by the CPA Firm shall be the Final Balance Sheet,
the Final Net Working Capital and the Final Closing Cash, respectively. The
Closing Statement as agreed to by Buyer and Seller or as determined by the CPA
Firm shall be referred to as the " _Final Closing Statement_."

  



  

(d) To the extent that the sum of the Final Net Working Capital and the Final
Closing Cash on the Final Closing Statement exceeds the sum of the Estimated
Net Working Capital and the Estimated Closing Cash, then Buyer shall pay,
within two Business Days of the determination of the Final Net Working
Capital and the Final Closing Cash as provided in _Section 2.3(c)_ , to Seller
in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
designated by Seller in writing, the amount of such excess. To the extent
that the sum of the Final Net Working Capital and the Final Closing Cash
reflected on the Final Closing Statement is less than the sum of the
Estimated Net Working Capital and the Estimated Closing Cash, then Seller
shall pay, within two Business Days of the determination of the Final Net
Working Capital and the Final Closing Cash as provided in _Section 2.3(c)_ ,
to Buyer in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account designated by Buyer in writing, the amount of such shortfall,
_provided_ , _however_ , that if Seller fails to pay such shortfall to Buyer
within the aforementioned time period, Buyer shall be permitted to direct the
release of such shortfall to Buyer from the Escrow Account, _provided_ ,
_further_ ,  _however_ , that Seller shall not be relieved of any liability
with respect to such shortfall notwithstanding its release from the Escrow
Account and Seller shall be responsible for any costs and expenses incurred by
Buyer in connection with the enforcement of this _Section 2.3(d)_.

(e) If any unresolved objections are submitted to the CPA Firm for resolution
as provided above, the fees and expenses of the CPA Firm shall be allocated
between Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, based upon the
relationship the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the
amount actually contested by such party. For example, if Buyer claims that the
appropriate adjustments are $1,000 greater than the amount determined by
Seller, and if the CPA Firm ultimately resolves such claim by awarding to
Buyer $300 of the $1,000 contested, then the fees, costs and expenses of the
CPA Firm will be allocated 70% to Buyer and 30% to Seller.

  



  

(f) Any payments due under this _Section 2.3_ shall bear interest from the
Closing Date to the date of actual payment(s) at a rate equal to the "prime
rate" adjusted on a daily basis as published from time to time in _The Wall
Street Journal_.

  



  

(g) Notwithstanding any provision set forth in this _Section 2.3_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement to the contrary, there is no general agreement
among the parties to submit disputes under this Agreement to arbitration.

  



  

2.4  _Escrow Amount_.

  



  

(a) At Closing, Buyer shall deposit $10,000,000 (the " _Escrow Amount_ ")
with SunTrust Bank, a Georgia banking corporation, as escrow agent (" _Escrow
Agent_ "), pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement by and among
the Escrow Agent, Buyer and Seller in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit
2.4_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), to be used to satisfy Losses, if any, for
which the Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification or
reimbursement in accordance with _Section 9.1_.

  



  

(b) On the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Escrow Termination
Date_ "), Buyer and Seller shall deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to pay to Seller any amount
remaining in the Escrow Account, less an amount sufficient to cover any
outstanding and unpaid indemnification claims pursuant to _Article IX_
 (whether disputed or undisputed) made on or prior to the Escrow Termination
Date. Any such withheld amount shall remain in the Escrow Account and shall
be paid either to Buyer or Seller as determined upon final resolution of each
such claim in accordance with the indemnification provisions of _Article IX_
__ hereof and the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

Wells Fargo Capital Finance, LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC together
with the fee letter, dated on or about the date hereof, from Morgan Stanley
Senior Funding, Inc., Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, Wells Fargo
Capital Finance, LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (collectively, the "
_Financing Commitment_ "), regarding the amounts set forth therein for the
purposes of financing the transactions contemplated hereby and related fees
and expenses (the " _Financing_ "). The Financing Commitment is in full
force and effect as of the date hereof and is the legal, valid and binding
obligations of the Buyer and, to the knowledge of Buyer, of the other parties
thereto, in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof, except as such
enforceability may be limited by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other Laws affecting the rights of creditors generally, and (b)
principles of equity, whether considered at law or in equity. Assuming the

funds sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to pay

Financing Commitment. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties set forth in _Articles III_ and _IV_ , as of the date hereof, no
event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to constitute a material default
or material breach on the part of Buyer or, to the Knowledge of Buyer, any
other party thereto under any of the Financing Commitment. Subject to the
satisfaction of the conditions contained in _Article VII_ , as of the date
hereof, Buyer has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the
Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitment will not be satisfied or
that the Financing or any other funds necessary for the satisfaction of all of
Buyer's obligations hereunder will not be available to Buyer. Buyer has fully
paid all commitment or other fees required to be paid prior to the date of
this Agreement pursuant to the Financing Commitment.

required to bear any cost or expense or pay any commitment fee or other fee
or payment to obtain consent or to incur any liability (other than liability
(x) that is contingent upon the Closing occurring or (y) for reasonable out-
of-pocket expenses subject to reimbursement by Buyer in accordance with this
_Section 6.3(c)_ ) with respect to the Financing prior to the Effective Time.
Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective representatives from and against any and
all Losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of
the Financing (including any action taken in accordance with this _Section
6.3(c)_ ) and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than
the Essential Marketing Information and the historical information relating to
Company or its Subsidiaries provided by Company in writing specifically for
use in the Financing offering document), except to the extent arising out of
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Seller, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries and/or their respective representatives. Buyer shall
promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

contemplated by this _Section 6.3(c)_. All material non-public
information provided by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of

confidential, except that Buyer shall be permitted to disclose such
information to its advisors, the Financing Sources and other potential
sources of capital, rating agencies and prospective lenders and investors
during syndication of the Financing or any permitted replacement, amended,
modified or alternative financing subject to the potential sources of capital,
ratings agencies and prospective lenders and investors entering into
customary confidentiality undertakings with respect to such information
(including through a notice and undertaking in a form customarily used in
confidential information memoranda for senior credit facilities). The Company
hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries' names, marks and logos
in connection with the Financing; provided that such names, marks and logos
are used solely in a manner that is not intended or not reasonably likely to
harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(d) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of the Financing is not
a condition to Closing and reaffirms its obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and independently of
the availability of the Financing, subject to fulfillment or waiver of the
conditions set forth in _Article VII_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing contained in this _Section 6.3_
shall require, and in no event shall the reasonable best efforts of Buyer be
deemed or construed to require, Buyer to (i) bring any enforcement action
against any source of the Financing to enforce its respective rights under
the Financing Commitment or (ii) pay any fees materially in excess of those
contemplated by the Financing Commitment (whether to secure waiver of any
conditions contained herein or otherwise).

  



  

6.4  _Cooperation; Consents and Approvals_.

  



  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
Buyer, the Company and Seller agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including (i) all actions necessary to satisfy the
closing conditions set forth in _Articles VII_ and _VIII_ , including,
without limitation, the provision by Buyer of any replacement collateral
security in connection with the termination of the letters of credit listed
on _Schedule 8.4_ or if Buyer determines to keep such letters of credit
outstanding, the provision by Buyer or Buyer's lenders of cash
collateralization or back-to-back letters of credit or guaranties in respect
thereof (provided that Buyer shall cash collateralize such letters of credit
on the Closing Date if necessary to allow Seller to meet the deliverables
requirement set forth in _Section 7.4(f)_ ), (ii) the obtaining of all
necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties (provided that in
connection therewith, except as provided in this Agreement, neither Buyer, on
the one hand, nor the Company or Seller, on the other hand, shall be
obligated to, or shall without the written consent of the other party,
pay, or agree to pay, any material amounts or agree to any material
concessions), (iii) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer agrees not to enter
into or consummate any agreements or arrangements for an acquisition (via
share purchase, merger, consolidation, purchase of assets or otherwise) or
joint venture reasonably likely to materially and adversely impact the timing
or ability of Buyer to pay the Purchase Price and consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Buyer and Seller shall, as promptly as practicable following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, file with the United States Federal
Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the United States Department of Justice
(the " _DOJ_ ") the notification and report form, if any, required for the
transactions contemplated hereby and any supplemental information
requested in connection therewith pursuant to the HSR Act. Buyer shall pay
the filing fees associated with all filings under the HSR Act made in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Any such
notification and report form and supplemental information shall be in
substantial compliance with the requirements of, and shall request early
termination of the waiting period under, the HSR Act. Buyer, Seller and the
Company shall furnish, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to furnish,
to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the
other may request in connection with its preparation of any filing or
submission that is necessary under the HSR Act. Buyer and Seller shall keep
each of the filing parties apprised of the status of any communications with,
and any written inquiries or requests for additional information from, the FTC
and the DOJ and shall comply promptly with any such inquiry or request. Each
of Buyer and Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
any clearance required under the HSR Act for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on or before the End Date. Each
Party shall be responsible for the payment of its expenses (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with complying
with any inquiries or requests for additional information by the FTC and the
DOJ.

(c) Buyer, on the one hand, and the Company and Seller, on the other hand,
shall cooperate with each other in connection with the making of any filings
in accordance with this _Section 6.4_. Neither Buyer, on the one hand, nor the
Company or Seller, on the other hand, shall intentionally take any action
that would have the effect of materially delaying, impairing or impeding the
receipt of any required regulatory approvals. Each of Buyer, Seller and the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to secure such approvals as
promptly as practicable.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing in this _Section 6.4_ or otherwise in this Agreement, shall require
Buyer to enter into any agreement, consent decree or other commitment
requiring Buyer or any of its Affiliates to (i) hold separate, divest or
license any of its material businesses, product lines, or other assets of
Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise limit in any
material respects or alter the business activities or the use of any assets
of Buyer, the Company, or any of their Affiliates, or (ii) take any other
action that would, or would reasonably be expected to, adversely affect Buyer
or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing Date, the Company and
its Subsidiaries) or their respective businesses, product lines, or other
assets in any material respects. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall not take any action of the type referred to in the
preceding sentence without Buyer's prior written consent. Furthermore,
nothing contained in this Agreement shall require Buyer, Seller or the Company
to litigate any actual, anticipated or threatened proceeding, injunction or
order.

  



  

6.5  _Non-solicitation_. Seller and its Affiliates shall not, for a period of
two years following the Closing Date (computed by excluding from such
computation any time during which Seller or an Affiliate is found by a court
of competent jurisdiction to have been in violation of any provision of this
_Section 6.5_ ), for any reason whatsoever, directly or indirectly,
solicit, hire (or assist or encourage any other Person to solicit or hire) or
otherwise interfere with the employment relationship of any employee of the
Company or its Subsidiaries who is listed on _Schedule 6.5_ hereof. For the
avoidance of doubt, an employee shall not be deemed to have been solicited or
as a result hired for employment solely as a result of (i) a general public
advertisement or other such general solicitation of employment, or (ii) the
employee voluntarily and without any direct or indirect solicitation from
Seller or any representative or Affiliate thereof (other than a general
solicitation to the public described above) seeks employment with Seller or
Affiliate thereof.

  



  

6.6  _Notice of Developments_. The Company, Seller and Buyer, as applicable,
will give prompt written notice to Buyer or Seller, as applicable, of any
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to result in
any of the conditions in _Article VII_ or _VIII_ not being satisfied. No
disclosure pursuant to this Section, however, shall be deemed to amend or
supplement the schedules attached to this Agreement or prevent or cure breach
of representation, warranty or covenant or limit or otherwise affect the
remedies, including those contained in _Article IX_ , available hereunder to
the parties hereto.

6.7  _Exclusivity_. From and after the date of this Agreement until the
Closing or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms, Seller and Company shall, and shall cause the Company's
Subsidiaries and any of its and their officers, directors, employees,
financial advisors, attorneys, accountants and other advisors, investment
bankers, representatives and agents (" _Representatives_ ") to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated all existing activities, discussions and
negotiations with any Person (other than Buyer and its Affiliates) conducted
heretofore with respect to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to,
a Company Acquisition Proposal. From and after the date of this Agreement
until the Closing or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, Seller shall not, nor shall it permit the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or the Representatives to, directly or indirectly,
(a) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage the making of a
Company Acquisition Proposal, (b) enter into any agreement, arrangement or
understanding with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal or (c)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish or
disclose to any Person (other than Buyer and its Affiliates) any non-public
information with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates in
connection with any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes
or could reasonably be expected to lead to any Company Acquisition Proposal. "
_Company Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from
any Person (other than Buyer and its Affiliates) to acquire or purchase from
Seller, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, all or any material part of
the revenues, income or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(whether in one transaction or a series of related transactions and whether
pursuant to (i) purchase of equity interests of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) merger, exchange, consolidation or similar
business combination with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii)
asset purchase (including any sale of profit interests or
similar transaction) from Seller, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries).

pursuant to _Section 9.1_ or _9.2_ (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") with respect

of which such party determines to assert a claim for indemnification against
the other party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") under this _Section 9.1_ or
_9.2_ , then the Indemnified Party shall promptly (and in any event within 10
Business Days after receiving notice of the Third Party Claim) notify the
Indemnifying Party thereof in writing. Failure to notify the Indemnifying
Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability that it may
have to the Indemnified Party, except to the extent the defense of such claim
is actually materially prejudiced by the Indemnified Party's failure to
give such notice.

  



  

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its sole option and
expense, to be represented by counsel of its choice, reasonably satisfactory
to the Indemnified Party, and to assume and thereafter conduct the defense of
any Third Party Claim and if the Indemnifying Party elects to assume and
thereafter conduct the defense of any Third Party Claim, it shall within 30
days (or sooner, if the nature of the Third Party Claim so requires) (the "
_Dispute Period_ ") notify the Indemnified Party of its intent to do so. If
the Indemnifying Party elects to assume and thereafter conduct the defense of
any Indemnification Claim, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to defend and protect the interests of the
Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim, (ii) the
Indemnified Party, prior to or during the period in which the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such matter, may take such
reasonable actions as the Indemnified Party deems necessary to preserve any
and all rights with respect to such matter, without such actions being
construed as a waiver of the Indemnified Party's rights to defense and
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall
indemnify the Indemnified Party for any Losses arising out of such claim and
shall not be able to claim that it does have any indemnification
obligations with respect thereto and (iv) the Indemnified Party may
participate, at its sole cost and expense, in the defense of such Third Party
Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Indemnified Party shall be entitled
to participate in any such defense with separate counsel at the expense of
the Indemnifying Party if, (A) so requested by the Indemnifying Party to
participate or (B) in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified
Party, a conflict or potential conflict exists between the Indemnified Party
and the Indemnifying Party that would make such separate representation
advisable; _provided_ _further_ that the Indemnifying Party shall not be
required to pay for more than one such counsel for all indemnified parties in
connection with any Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall keep the
Indemnified Party advised of the status of any such Third Party Claim and the
defense thereof and shall consider in good faith recommendations made by the
Indemnified Party with respect thereto. The parties hereto agree to cooperate
fully with each other in connection with the defense, negotiation or
settlement of any such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall not in
the defense of a Third Party Claim or any litigation resulting therefrom
settle, compromise or permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment
(other than a judgment of dismissal on the merits without costs) unless such
settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes a full release from all
liability with respect of such claim or litigation in favor of the
Indemnified Party, (ii) does not entail an admission of liability on the part
of any Indemnified Party, (iii) is solely for monetary damages that will be
promptly paid by Indemnifying Party, (iv) does not adversely affect the
ongoing business of the Indemnified Party, and (v) is such that the
Indemnifying Party will indemnify the Indemnified Parties for any and all
Losses arising therefrom or out of the claim giving rise thereto, and then
only with the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

(c) Unless the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the Third Party
Claim as provided in _Section 9.3(b)_ within the Dispute Period, the
Indemnified Party may defend against the Third Party Claim in any manner it
reasonably may deem appropriate;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall the Indemnified Party consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  



  

9.4  _Exclusive Remedy_. The parties acknowledge that, following the Closing,
except for any claim for intentional fraud and except for remedies of
specific performance and injunctive and other equitable relief against Seller
or the Company, the indemnities provided for in this _Article IX_ and in
_Section 6.2_ hereof shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Indemnified Party against the Indemnifying Party by contract, statute or
otherwise, at law or equity, for any claim, cause of action or other matter
arising from any breach by Buyer, the Company or Seller, as applicable, of any
of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements under this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. For the avoidance of doubt,
following the Closing, except for intentional fraud, Buyer shall not have any
right to rescind this Agreement.

  



  

9.5  _Indemnity Amounts to be Computed Net of Insurance Proceeds_.
Notwithstanding any other provision set forth herein to the contrary, the
amount of any indemnification payable under any of the provisions of this
Agreement shall be net of any insurance proceeds actually realized by and
paid to the Indemnified Party by reason of the facts and circumstances giving
rise to such indemnification, less any cost of recovery, including any
increase in the premium or other costs of obtaining insurance coverage
reasonably related to the claim for which indemnification is sought, as
determined in good faith by the Indemnified Party.

  



  

9.6  _Indemnity Amounts to be Computed on After-Tax Basis_. The amount of any
indemnification payable under any of the provisions of this Agreement shall
be (i) reduced by any net federal, state, local or foreign income Tax benefit
actually realized by the Indemnified Party (or, where Buyer is the
Indemnified Party, any of its Affiliates, including the Company) in the same
tax year in which the Loss giving rise to such indemnification has occurred
by reason of the facts and circumstances giving rise to the indemnification,
and (ii) increased by the amount of any federal, state, local or foreign
income Tax actually required to be paid by the Indemnified Party on the
accrual or receipt of the indemnification payment (including any amount
payable pursuant to this clause (ii)). For purposes of the preceding
sentence, the amount of any state, local or foreign income Tax benefit or cost
shall take into account the federal income Tax effect of such benefit or
cost.

9.7  _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a)  _Intended Tax Treatment_. Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that,
for U.S. federal income tax purposes and for state income tax purposes in
states that conform to the U.S. federal classification of single member
limited liability companies, the sale and purchase of the Equity Interests
pursuant to this Agreement will be treated as a sale of the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries by Seller and a purchase of the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries by Buyer, for the Purchase Price (as adjusted
pursuant to _Section 2.3_ ) and the assumption of liabilities of the Company
and its Subsidiaries. The Parties agree not to take, and not to permit any
Affiliate to take, any position inconsistent with such intended income tax
consequences.

  



  

(b) Post-Closing Tax Returns and Straddle Returns.

  



  

(i) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
all Straddle Returns and Post-Closing Tax Returns with respect to the
Company, each Subsidiary and their respective assets, as applicable. With
respect to Taxes owed for periods that begin before the Closing Date and end
after the Closing Date, the Seller will be responsible for the amount
apportioned (pursuant to this _Section 9.7(b)_ ) to days on or before the
Closing Date and the Buyer will be responsible for amounts apportioned to
days after the Closing Date. Buyer will pay such apportioned Taxes that are
due and payable after the Closing Date and bill the Seller for any part of
that amount apportioned to the Seller (except for Taxes included as
liabilities on the Final Balance Sheet). Provided, however, that federal
income taxes and state income taxes in states that conform to the federal
classification of single member limited liability companies attributable to
the ownership and operation of the assets of the Company and each Subsidiary
through the Closing Date will be reported on Seller's federal income Tax
Return and Seller's state income Tax Returns and paid by Seller in states
that conform to the federal classification of single member limited liability
companies. Seller shall be entitled to deduct for federal income Tax purposes
and for state income and franchise Tax purposes all payments made pursuant to
_Section 2.2(b)_ of this Agreement to the extent permitted by applicable Tax
law. None of Buyer or Buyer's Affiliates shall deduct for federal income Tax
or state income or franchise Tax purposes any payment made pursuant to
_Section 2.2(b)_. All foreign tax credits attributable to the ownership and
operation of Bulk Tank International, S. de R.L. de C.V., Bulk Services, S.
de R.L. de C.V., Extract Technology Limited and Extract Technology Pte. Ltd.
through the Closing Date shall be reported on Seller's federal income tax
return and shall be for the benefit of Seller and its members. Federal income
taxes and state income taxes in states that conform to the federal
classification of single member limited liability companies attributable to
the ownership and operation of the assets of the Company and each Subsidiary
after the Closing Date (and with respect to any transactions of the Company
and any Subsidiary outside the ordinary course of business after the Closing
on the Closing Date) will be paid by Buyer or its Affiliates and reported on
Buyer's or its Affiliate's federal income tax return and Buyer's or Buyer's
Affiliates state income tax returns in states that conform to the federal
classification of single member limited liability companies. Buyer shall be
responsible for, and indemnifies Seller from, payment of said post-Closing
federal and state income taxes.

(ii) For any Taxes that are payable with respect to a Straddle Period, (A) in
the case of Taxes such as property Taxes, ad valorem Taxes, and similar Taxes
imposed on a periodic basis, the portion of any such Tax that is attributable
to the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date shall be considered
to equal the amount of such Taxes for such taxable period, multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of such
taxable period that ends on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is
the number of days in the entire taxable period and (B) in the case of Taxes
that are imposed on, or are based in whole or in part on, the income, gross
receipts, operations or payroll of the Company or any Subsidiary (such as
income and franchise Taxes, payroll Taxes, and sales and use, value added,
and goods and services Taxes), the portion of such Taxes which is
attributable to the portion of such taxable period ending on the Closing Date
shall be determined by closing the books of the Company or the Subsidiary as
of the end of the day on the Closing Date. For purposes hereof, Taxes
attributable to any period or portion thereof ending on or prior to the
Closing Date shall include Taxes based in whole or in part on income, gain, or
receipts that accrue or are received on or prior to the Closing Date, payroll
Taxes attributable to compensation for services performed on or prior to the
Closing Date, sales, use, value added, goods and services and similar Taxes
imposed on sales or gross receipts that accrue or are received on or prior to
the Closing Date, and Taxes attributable to the ownership of property during
periods on or prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

(c)  _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_. Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared
and file or cause to be filed all Pre-Closing Tax Returns with respect to the
Company, each Subsidiary of the Company and their respective assets. Seller
shall pay or cause to be paid any Taxes due with respect to those Tax
Returns, except for Taxes included as liabilities on the Final Balance
Sheet and included in the Final Net Working Capital determined pursuant to
_Section 2.3_ of this Agreement (which Taxes Buyer shall pay or cause to be
paid).

  



  

(d)  _Claims for Refund_. After the Closing, except as required by Law, none
of the Company or Buyer shall, without the prior written consent of Seller,
(i) file or permit to be filed any amended Tax Return by or on behalf of the
Company or any Subsidiary or (ii) take any other action affecting the
Company's or any Subsidiary's taxable income or other tax items, or Taxes for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period.

  



  

(e)  _Confidentiality_. Any information shared in connection with Taxes shall
be kept confidential, except as may otherwise be necessary in connection with
the filing of Tax Returns or reports, refund claims, tax audits, tax claims
and tax litigation, or as required by Law.

(f)  _Audits_. Seller or Buyer, as applicable, shall provide prompt written
notice to the other party of any pending or threatened tax audit, assessment
or proceeding that Seller or Buyer becomes aware of related to the Company,
any Subsidiary or their respective assets for whole or partial periods for
which it is indemnified by the other party hereunder. Such notice
shall contain factual information (to the extent known) describing the
asserted tax liability in reasonable detail and shall be accompanied by
copies of any notice or other document received from or with any tax authority
in respect of any such matters. If an indemnified party has knowledge of an
asserted tax liability with respect to a matter for which it is to be
indemnified hereunder and such party fails to give the indemnifying party
prompt notice of such asserted tax liability, then (i) if the indemnifying
party is precluded by the failure to give prompt notice from contesting the
asserted tax liability in any forum, the indemnifying party shall have no
obligation to indemnify the indemnified party for any Taxes arising out of
such asserted tax liability, and (ii) if the indemnifying party is not so
precluded from contesting, but such failure to give prompt notice results in a
detriment to the indemnifying party, then any amount which the indemnifying
party is otherwise required to pay the indemnified party pursuant to this
_Section 9.7(f)_ shall be reduced by the amount of such detriment, _provided_
, the indemnified party shall nevertheless be entitled to the indemnification
to which it would otherwise be entitled under this Agreement to the extent,
and only to the extent, that such party can establish that the indemnifying
party was not prejudiced by such failure. This _Section 9.7(f)_  shall
control the procedure for Tax indemnification matters to the extent it is
inconsistent with any other provision of this Agreement.

  



  

(g)  _Control of Proceedings_. Except as set forth in this _Section 9.7(g)_ ,
below, the party responsible for the Tax under this Agreement shall control
audits and disputes related to such Taxes (including action taken to pay,
compromise or settle such Taxes). Reasonable out-of-pocket expenses with
respect to such contests shall be borne by Seller, on the one hand, and
Buyer, on the other hand, in proportion to their responsibility for such
Taxes as set forth in this Agreement. Buyer shall control all proceedings
with respect to any contests relating to any Straddle Period; provided,
however, that if the results of any such contest could reasonably be expected
to result in an indemnity payment to Buyer, then Seller shall, at its own
expense, have a right to participate in the defense and settlement of any
such contest and all parties shall cooperate with the other parties and
there shall be no settlement or closing or other agreement with respect
thereto without the consent of each party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

  



  

(h)  _Powers of Attorney_. To the extent permitted by Law, Buyer, the Company
and their respective Affiliates shall provide Seller and its Affiliates with
such powers of attorney or other authorizing documentation as are reasonably
necessary to empower them to execute and file returns they are responsible
for hereunder, file refund and equivalent claims for Taxes they are
responsible for, and contest, settle and resolve any audits and disputes that
they have control over under _Section 9.7(g)_ (including any refund claims
which turn into audits or disputes).

(i)  _Remittance of Refunds_. If Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer receives a
refund of any Taxes that Seller is responsible for hereunder, or if Seller or
any Affiliate of Seller receives a refund of any Taxes that Buyer is
responsible for hereunder, the party receiving such refund shall, within 30
days after receipt of such refund, remit it to the party who has
responsibility for such Taxes hereunder. For the purpose of this _Section
9.7(i)_ , the term "refund" shall include a reduction in Tax and the use of
an overpayment as a credit or other Tax offset, and receipt of a refund shall
occur upon the filing of a Tax Return or an adjustment thereto using such
reduction, overpayment or offset or upon the receipt of cash.

  



  

(j)  _Purchase Price Allocation_. Seller and Buyer shall use good faith
efforts to attempt to reach agreement on the allocation of the actual
Purchase Price to the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all
purposes (including Tax and financial accounting purposes) as set forth in an
allocation schedule to be prepared by Seller and Buyer within 90 days after
the Closing Date, in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the
Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and any comparable provision of
state, local or foreign law, as appropriate (the " _Allocation_ "). Seller
and Buyer agree (i) to report the federal, state and local income and other
Tax consequences of the transactions contemplated herein, and in particular to
report the information required by Section 1060(b) of the Code, and to
jointly prepare Form 8594 (Asset Acquisition Statement under Section 1060) in
a manner consistent with such allocation and (ii) not to take any position
inconsistent therewith upon examination of any Tax Return, in any
refund claim, in any litigation, investigation or otherwise unless Buyer and
Seller agree to such position. Seller and Buyer agree that each will furnish
the other a copy of Form 8594 (Asset Acquisition Statement under Section 1060)
proposed to be filed with the IRS within 10 days prior to the filing of such
form with the IRS. Buyer, Seller and their applicable Affiliates will file all
Tax Returns (including amended Tax Returns and claims for refund) and
information reports in a manner consistent with such allocation. If the
parties are unable to reach a timely agreement regarding the Allocation, each
party shall be entitled to adopt its own position regarding the Allocation.

  



  

(k)  _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such
Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and charges
(including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid
by Buyer when due. Buyer shall, at its expense, file all necessary Tax
Returns with respect to such Taxes, fees and charges and, if required by Law,
Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any
such Tax Returns and documentation.

  



  

(l)  _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax sharing agreements or similar
agreements with respect to or involving the Company and any Subsidiaries
(other than the provisions of this Agreement) shall be terminated prior to the
Closing Date, and, after the Closing Date, the Company and any Subsidiaries
shall not be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder for amounts due in
respect of any period prior to the Closing Date.

9.8  _Materiality_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, for the purposes of this _Article IX_ , all references to Material
Adverse Effect, material, materially or other correlative terms shall be
disregarded in (i) determining the existence of any breach of, or inaccuracy
in, any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement, and (ii) calculating the amount of Losses incurred in connection
with any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement contained in this Agreement.

  



  

9.9  _Knowledge_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein
(i) no right to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement shall be limited
by reason of any investigation or audit conducted before or after the Closing
Date or the knowledge of any party of any breach of a representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement by any other party at any time, or the
decision of any party to complete the Closing and (ii) Buyer shall have the
right, irrespective of any knowledge or investigation of such parties (or
their respective Affiliates, agents or Representatives), to rely fully on the
representations, warranties and covenants of the other parties contained
herein.

  



  

9.10  _Retention of and Access to Records_. After the Closing Date, Buyer
shall retain, and shall cause the Company and each of its Subsidiaries to
retain, for a period consistent with Buyer's record-retention policies and
practices (which policies and practices shall be reasonable and prudent) the
books and records delivered to Buyer. Buyer also shall provide Seller and
its representatives reasonable access thereto, during normal business hours
and on at least three Business Days' prior written notice, to enable them to
prepare financial statements or Tax Returns or respond to tax audits. In
addition, Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries to retain all records and information relating to Taxes until
at least one year after the expiration of all applicable statutes of
limitation. Buyer further agrees, upon Seller's request and at Seller's
expense, to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or
other document from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed.

Company and its Subsidiaries shall purchase a non-cancelable six-year "tail"
prepaid policy on their respective current directors' and officers' liability
insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Closing Date, covering each person covered by such insurance at a cost per

or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation, partnership or other
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of such entity assume the obligations set forth in this _Section
11.3_. The provisions of this _Section 11.3_ shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this
provision applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
indemnified party, his or her heirs and his or her legal representatives.

pertaining to the subject matter hereof. No amendment, supplement,
modification, waiver or termination of this Agreement shall be binding
unless executed in writing by the party to be bound thereby. No waiver of any
of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed, or shall constitute, a
waiver of any other provision of this Agreement, whether or not similar, nor
shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly
provided in writing.

  



  

11.7  _Expenses_. Each of the parties hereto shall pay the fees and expenses

_provided_ that (i) Buyer nonetheless shall remain responsible for the
performance of all of its obligations hereunder and (ii) in case of clause
(b), Seller's consent shall be required if such designation would result in

Purchase Agreement, of the Final Closing Statement and Seller's failure to
pay, within two Business Days of the determination of the Final Net Working
Capital and the Final Closing Cash as provided in _Section 2.3(c)_ , any
shortfall due to Buyer in accordance with _Section 2.3(d)_ , Buyer
may unilaterally deliver to Escrow Agent (providing a copy to Seller), a
certificate substantially in the form of _Exhibit A_  attached hereto (a "

amount by which the sum of the Estimated Net Working Capital and the
Estimated Closing Cash exceeds the sum of the Final Net Working Capital and
the Final Closing Cash reflected on the Final Closing Statement.

  



  

17.2 From time to time on or before the first anniversary of the Closing Date

shall release to Seller the entire balance of the Escrow Amount remaining at
the time of the Claim Deadline, _less_ (i) any amounts payable (but not yet
paid) to Buyer pursuant to a Disbursement Directive and (ii) the aggregate
amount of any and all Escrow Claims made on or before the Claim Deadline
with respect to which the Escrow Agent has not received a Disbursement
Directive (the " _Claim Reserve_ "). Any Claim Reserve shall be maintained in

stop all performance of this Agreement, save and except safekeeping of the
Escrow Amount, together with any and all interest or other income earned
thereon (and all notices or instructions received in connection herewith)
until Escrow Agent is satisfied that such disagreement has been resolved, as
evidenced by a Disbursement Directive, or (b) file a suit in interpleader and
obtain an order of the court of appropriate jurisdiction requiring all
persons involved to litigate in such court their respective claims arising
out of or in connection with the Escrow Amount. In the event that Escrow Agent
files a suit in interpleader, Escrow Agent's reasonable costs, including
reasonable attorneys' fees, in filing and prosecuting such lawsuit shall be
paid by the non-prevailing party in such controversy. Escrow Agent shall not
be or become liable to Buyer or Seller for the failure of Escrow Agent to
comply with the conflicting or adverse demands of Buyer and Seller except with
respect to Losses suffered by Buyer or Seller that are determined by a court
of competent jurisdiction through a final order to have been caused by the
fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith of Escrow Agent. Upon
the filing of a suit in interpleader, Escrow Agent may request to be
discharged from all further duties under this Agreement, but the filing of
any such suit shall not deprive Escrow Agent of its compensation hereunder
earned prior to such filing and discharge.

the Escrow Amount and hold the same intact, and to invest the Escrow Amount
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and shall not permit any
withdrawal or disbursal of the Escrow Amount except under the terms of this
Agreement. Escrow Agent shall be responsible only for the safekeeping of the
Escrow Amount, the investment of the Escrow Amount and the disbursement or
delivery of the Escrow Amount in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Escrow
Agent shall not have any responsibility for the performance by Buyer or
Seller of any of their obligations under this Agreement or be bound in any
way by any agreement, including the Purchase Agreement (whether or not Escrow
Agent has knowledge of any such agreement), between Buyer and Seller.

  



  

ARTICLE XXI _Performance of Escrow Agent; Indemnification_.

  



  

21.1 Escrow Agent undertakes to perform only such duties as are expressly set
forth herein, and no additional duties or obligations shall be implied
hereunder. In performing its duties under this Agreement, or upon the claimed
failure to perform any of its duties hereunder, Escrow Agent shall not be
liable to anyone for any damages, losses or expenses that may be incurred as a
result of Escrow Agent so acting or failing to so act; _provided_ , _however_
, that Escrow Agent shall not be relieved from liability for damages arising
out of its fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith under this
Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, Escrow Agent shall not incur any
liability with respect to (i) any action taken or omitted to be taken in good
faith upon advice of its legal counsel given with respect to any question
relating to the duties and responsibilities of Escrow Agent hereunder or (ii)
any action taken or omitted to be taken in reliance upon any instrument
delivered to Escrow Agent and believed by Escrow Agent to be genuine and to
have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.

  



  

21.2 Escrow Agent shall have no obligation to take any legal action in
connection with this Agreement or towards its enforcement, or to appear in,
prosecute or defend any action or legal proceeding which would or might
involve it in any cost, expense, loss or liability, unless security and
indemnity shall be furnished by Buyer and Seller.

and its officers, directors, employees and agents and save Escrow Agent and
its officers, directors, employees and agents harmless from and against any
and all Escrow Agent Claims (as hereinafter defined) and Escrow Agent Losses
(as hereinafter defined) that may be incurred by Escrow Agent or any of its
officers, directors, employees or agents as a result of or in connection with
Escrow Agent's capacity as such under this Agreement by any person or entity.
For the purposes hereof, (i) the term " _Escrow Agent Claims_ " shall mean all
claims, lawsuits, causes of action or other legal actions and proceedings of
whatever nature brought against (whether by way of direct action,
counterclaim, cross action or impleader) Escrow Agent or any of its officers,
directors, employees or agents, even if groundless, false or fraudulent, so
long as the claim, lawsuit, cause of action or other legal action or
proceeding is alleged or determined, directly or indirectly, to arise out of,
result from, relate to or be based upon, in whole or in part: (A) the acts or
omissions of Buyer or Seller; (B) the appointment of Escrow Agent as escrow
agent under this Agreement, except to the extent such claims, lawsuits,
causes of action or other legal actions or proceedings are directly
attributable to Escrow Agent's fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or
bad faith under this Agreement; or (C) the performance by Escrow Agent of its
powers and duties under this Agreement; and (ii) the term " _Escrow Agent
Losses_ " shall mean losses, costs, damages, expenses, judgments and
liabilities of whatever nature (including but not limited to attorneys',
accountants' and other professionals' fees, litigation and court costs and
expenses and amounts paid in settlement), directly or indirectly resulting
from, arising out of or relating to one or more Escrow Agent Claims, except
to the extent such losses, costs, damages, expenses, judgments or
liabilities are directly attributable to Escrow Agent's fraud, gross
negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith under this Agreement. Upon the
written request of Escrow Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees
or agents (each referred to hereinafter as an " _Indemnified Party_ "), Buyer
and Seller jointly and severally agree to assume the investigation and
defense of any Escrow Agent Claim, including the employment of counsel
acceptable to the applicable Indemnified Party and Buyer and Seller, agree to
assume the payment of all expenses related thereto and, notwithstanding any
such assumption, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, and Buyer and
Seller jointly and severally agree to pay the cost and expense, to employ
separate counsel with respect to any such Escrow Agent Claim and participate
in the investigation and defense thereof in the event that such Indemnified
Party shall have been advised by counsel that there may be one or more legal
defenses available to such Indemnified Party which are different from or
additional to those available to either Buyer or Seller. Buyer and Seller
hereby agree that the indemnifications and protections afforded Escrow Agent
in this _Section XXI_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

in the manner described herein). The schedule of fees is listed on _Exhibit
C_ attached hereto. In the event any controversy arises under or in
connection with this Agreement or the Escrow Amount or Escrow Agent is made a
party to or intervenes in any litigation pertaining to this Agreement or the
Escrow Amount, or in the event Buyer and Seller jointly ask Escrow Agent
to perform services not expressly set forth herein, Buyer and Seller each
agree to pay to Escrow Agent 50% of its reasonable compensation for its
extraordinary services and to reimburse Escrow Agent for 50% of all costs and

ARTICLE XXIII _Resignation/Removal of Escrow Agent_.

  



  

23.1 Escrow Agent may resign at any time from its obligations under this
Agreement by providing written notice to Buyer and Seller. Such resignation
shall be effective on the date set forth in such written notice, which shall
be no earlier than 30 days after such written notice has been given. In the
event no successor escrow agent has been appointed by Buyer and Seller on or
prior to the date such resignation is to become effective, Escrow Agent shall
be entitled to tender into the custody of a court of competent jurisdiction
all assets and properties then held by it hereunder and shall thereupon be
relieved of all further duties and obligations under this Agreement. Escrow
Agent shall have no responsibility for the appointment of a successor escrow
agent hereunder.

  



  

23.2 Escrow Agent may be removed, as such, at any time by the written consent
of Buyer and Seller or an order from a court with competent jurisdiction.
Upon the effective date of its resignation or removal, Escrow Agent will
deliver the Escrow Amount, together with any and all interest or other income
earned thereon, held hereunder to such successor escrow agent directed by the
joint written instructions of Buyer and Seller. After the effective date of
its resignation or removal, Escrow Agent shall have no duty with respect to
the Escrow Amount, together with any and all interest or other income earned
thereon, except to hold such property in safekeeping and to deliver same to
its successor or as is directed in writing by Buyer and Seller.

  



  

ARTICLE XXIV _Instructions and Notices_. All notices, requests, claims,
demands, disclosures and other communications required or permitted by this

ARTICLE XXV _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed and
interpreted according to the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to
the conflicts of law rules thereof to the extent that they would result in the
application of the laws of another jurisdiction.

  



  

ARTICLE XXVI _Headings_. The headings in this Agreement are inserted for
convenience and identification only and are in no way intended to interpret,
define or limit the scope, extent or intent of this Agreement or any provision
hereof.

  



  

ARTICLE XXVII _Severability_. Each provision of this Agreement is intended to
be severable. If any term or provision hereof is determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal or invalid for any reason whatsoever,
such illegality or invalidity shall not affect the validity or enforcement of
the remainder of this Agreement.

  



  

ARTICLE XXVIII _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in several
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but such
counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same Agreement. The
execution of this Agreement by any of the parties may be evidenced by way of
a facsimile transmission of such party's signature, or a photocopy of such
facsimile transmission, and such facsimile signature shall be deemed to

Agreement shall be valid unless reduced to writing and signed by Buyer,
Seller and Escrow Agent. No consent or waiver, expressed or implied, by any
party to or of any breach or default by any other in the performance by the
other of its obligations hereunder shall be deemed or construed to be a
consent or waiver to or of any other breach or default in the performance by
such party of the same or any obligations of the party. Failure on the part
of any party to complain of any act or failure to act of the other party or to
declare the other party in default, irrespective of how long such failure
continues, shall not constitute a waiver by that party of its rights under
this Agreement or otherwise.

  



  

ARTICLE XXX _Successors_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns
but shall not create any rights in any third parties. Any corporation into

consolidation to which Escrow Agent shall be a party, or any corporation to

transferred, shall be Escrow Agent under this Agreement without further
act. Escrow Agent shall not be bound by or incur any liability with respect
to the Purchase Agreement or any other agreement or understanding between

the standard FDIC insurance amount of $250,000, including principal and

Federated. The compensation rate to be paid by Federated for such fees for
services shall be 0.10% (10 basis points) annually of the total amount of the
account assets invested in the Federated money market mutual fund. If your

government agency. I further understand that investment in any mutual
fund involves some investment risk, including the possible loss of principal.
