modification or amendment of such recommendation, (A) the Company shall give
Parent at least seventy-two (72) hours prior written notice thereof (which
notice shall state in reasonable detail the reasons for the proposed taking of

determined in good faith (after consultation with the Company's outside
counsel) after taking into account any such modifications, changes or
revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent during such period
in a manner that would form a binding contract if accepted by the Company,
that a failure to withdraw, modify or amend its recommendation would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; and

  

  

(iii) as soon as reasonably practicable following the clearance of the Proxy
Statement by the SEC, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special
meeting of its stockholders (the "Stockholders' Meeting") for the purpose of

contrary, the Company shall be permitted to delay or postpone convening the
Stockholders' Meeting, or adjourn the Stockholders' Meeting beyond the time
that the Stockholders' Meeting would otherwise be held, if the Company Board
shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with the Company's
outside counsel) that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

ARTICLE III

  

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; TREATMENT OF COMPANY OPTIONS

  

  

Section 3.1. Conversion of Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or any holder of any share of capital stock of the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub:

  

  

(a) Common Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(b) Cancellation of Certain Shares. All Shares that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and owned by any of Parent, Merger Sub
and any other Subsidiary of Parent, and all Shares held in the treasury of the
Company, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  

  

(c) Conversion of Shares. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than any Shares to be cancelled in accordance
with Section 3.1(b) and any Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the
right to receive $16.30 in cash, payable to the holder thereof in accordance
with this Article III without interest (the "Merger Consideration" ) and net
of any Taxes required to be withhold therefrom, upon surrender and exchange of
a Certificate. All such Shares when so converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate (a "Certificate" ) that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any such outstanding Share (other than any
Dissenting Share) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor, without interest, upon
the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 3.2.

  

  

(d) Certain Adjustments. Without limiting the other provisions of this
Agreement, if, at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the number of Shares shall
occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into or exchangeable for Shares) with a
record date during such period, then the Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

Section 3.2. Exchange of Certificates.

  

  

(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank
or trust company (the "Paying Agent") reasonably acceptable to the Company to
act as paying agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance
with this Article III, pursuant to an agreement providing for the matters set
forth in this Section 3.2 and such other matters as may be appropriate and the
terms of which shall be mutually acceptable to Parent and the Company.
Concurrently with the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be
deposited with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of holders of Certificates,
funds that are sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable
upon conversion of Shares pursuant to Section 3.1(c). For purposes of
determining the aggregate amount to be so deposited, Parent shall assume that
no stockholder of the Company shall perfect any right to appraisal of his, her
or its Shares. If for any reason (including losses) such funds are inadequate
to pay all amounts to which holders of Shares shall be entitled under Section
3.1(c), Parent shall promptly deposit or cause the Surviving Corporation
promptly to deposit additional cash with the Paying Agent sufficient to make
all payments required under Section 3.1(c), and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall in any event be liable for payment thereof. Such funds shall
not be used for any purpose other than as set forth in this Article III, and
shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation solely in (i) direct obligations of the United States of America,
(ii) obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of
America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest, (iii)
commercial paper rated the highest quality by either Moody's Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, or (iv) a combination of any
of the foregoing. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income
produced by, such investments will be payable to Merger Sub or Parent, as
Parent directs.

  

  

(b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, but in any event
not more than three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail or otherwise deliver to each holder of record
of a Certificate representing Shares which were converted pursuant to Section
3.1(c), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to each Certificate shall pass, only
upon delivery of such Certificate to the Paying Agent and shall be in such
form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company shall mutually
agree) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of each such
Certificate in exchange for payment of the total amount of Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this
Agreement. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent, together with
the related letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration (subject to subsection (e) of this Section 3.2) for each Share
formerly represented by such Certificate, to be mailed within five (5)
Business Days after receipt of such Certificate and letter of transmittal by
the Paying Agent, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. If payment of any Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered,
it shall be a condition of payment of such Merger Consideration that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid to the Paying Agent in advance any Tax required by reason of the
payment of such Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

Back

 

 

   
 

  

that such Tax either has otherwise been paid or is not applicable. Subject to
Section 3.3, until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2, each
Certificate representing one or more Shares which were converted pursuant to
Section 3.1(c) shall at all times after the Effective Time represent only the
right to receive, in cash, the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly
represented by such Certificate as contemplated by this Section 3.2.

  

  

(c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares. After the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall
be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the
Company. After the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates evidencing
ownership of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, except as otherwise
provided for herein or by applicable Law and, without limitation of the
foregoing, subject to the Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay any and
all dividends with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have
been declared by the Company on Shares prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation
for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Article III. No dividend or other distributions with respect to the capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates.

  

  

(d) Termination of Fund; No Liability. At any time following eighteen (18)
months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled
to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest
received with respect thereto) which had been made available to the Paying
Agent for the payment of Merger Consideration and which have not been
disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall be
entitled (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Law) to look
only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation, which shall thereafter act as
the Paying Agent, as general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of
any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any
Certificate, as determined pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to return
any funds deposited with the Paying Agent in respect of Dissenting Shares with
respect to which the holders thereof have perfected their appraisal rights and
received payment of the fair value thereof in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
neither Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable
to any holder of a Certificate for Merger Consideration delivered to a public
official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  

  

(e) Withholding Taxes. The right of any Person to receive payment or
consideration payable in accordance with this Article III will be subject to
any applicable requirements with respect to the withholding of any Tax. To the
extent amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, (i) such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Certificate(s) in
respect of which the deduction and withholding was made and (ii) Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may
be, to, promptly pay over such withheld amounts to the appropriate
Governmental Entity.

Back

 

 

   
 

  

(f) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if requested by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the delivery by such
Person of a bond (in such amount as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may
reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the
Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation on account of the alleged
loss, theft or destruction of such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the total amount of
Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof as determined in
accordance with this Article III.

  

  

Section 3.3. Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, Shares which are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares to be cancelled pursuant to
Section 3.1(b)) and which are held by holders who shall have complied with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and holders of
such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive payment of the fair value
of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of
the DGCL, unless and until the applicable holder fails to comply with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL or effectively withdraws or otherwise
loses such holder's rights to receive payment of the fair value of such
holder's Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time,
any such holder fails to comply with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL
or effectively withdraws or loses such right, such Dissenting Shares shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent
prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of Shares received by the
Company under Section 262 of the DGCL, and shall give Parent the opportunity
to participate in negotiations and Proceedings with respect to such demands.
The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make
any payment with respect to any such demands for appraisal or offer to settle
or settle any such demands.

  

  

Section 3.4. Termination and Satisfaction of Company Options . Effective as of
the Effective Time, each outstanding option ("Company Option") to buy Shares
granted under any of the Company Option Plans (or otherwise) to any individual
who is or was an employee, officer or director of, or consultant or advisor
to, the Company, whether or not such Company Option is then exercisable and
vested, shall be cancelled and, in consideration of such cancellation, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to the holder of such
Company Option, whether or not such Company Option is then exercisable and
vested, an amount in respect thereof equal to the product of (x) the excess,
if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price of such
Company Option and (y) the number of Shares subject thereto (such payment, if
any, to be net of applicable withholding and excise taxes), without interest.
As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall,
and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to,
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the required consents from each
holder of Company Options granted under any Company Option Plan (or otherwise)
other than the Benihana Inc. 2007 Equity Incentive Plan. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Company shall not be required to expend funds to obtain consents
other than the general administrative costs of correspondence with option-
holders and related mailing. The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall
cause

the Surviving Corporation to) make all payments in accordance with this
Section 3.4 promptly after (within two (2) Business Days of) the Effective
Time.

  

  

ARTICLE IV

  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

  

  

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to
Parent and Merger Sub simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"), and except as disclosed in the
SEC Documents (other than non-factual disclosures in the "Risk Factors" or
"Forward Looking Statements" sections thereof or any other forward looking
disclosures in the SEC Documents which are cautionary in nature), the Company
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

  

  

Section 4.1. Corporate Organization.

  

  

(a) Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is (i) in the case of the
Company, a corporation, duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware or (ii) in the case of each
Company Subsidiary, a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, and
each has the requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease all of
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except for the failure to be so incorporated (or formed, as the
case may be), existing and in good standing or to have such power and
authority as would not reasonably be expected to have, when aggregated with
all such other failures, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries is duly licensed or qualified to do
business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by
it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased
by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so licensed or qualified would not reasonably be expected to
have, when aggregated with all other such failures, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

  

  

(b) The copies of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the
"Company Certificate"), and By-Laws, as amended (the "Company By-Laws"), most
recently filed with the Company's SEC Documents are complete and correct
copies of such documents as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. The
Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of the
certificate of incorporation, bylaws or similar organizational documents of
each Company Subsidiary, and all amendments thereto, as currently in effect.

  

  

Section 4.2. Capitalization.

  

  

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 24,000,000
shares of Common Stock, par value $.10 per share (the "Shares"), and (ii)
5,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share (the "Preferred
Shares"). At the close of business on May 21, 2012, (i) 17,929,188 Shares and
no Preferred Shares were issued and outstanding and (iii) no Shares were held
in the Company's treasury. At the close of business on May 12, 2012, there
were outstanding Company Options to acquire a total of 627,822 Shares. Except

interests in the Company

issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. All of the issued and
outstanding Shares have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully
paid, nonassessable and free of any preemptive rights. Section 4.2(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth each Company Option outstanding as of
May 21, 2012, including the name of holder of such Company Option, the number
of Shares subject to such Company Option and the exercise price for such
Option. As of the date of this Agreement, except (i) as provided in this
Agreement and (ii) for the Company Options, there are no outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any
character calling for the purchase or issuance of any security of the Company
to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party, including any
securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any Shares.
There are no outstanding phantom stock rights or stock appreciation rights
granted by the Company to any Person. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or
other indebtedness of the Company with voting rights (or convertible into, or
exchangeable for, securities with voting rights) on any matters to which
stockholders of the Company may vote. As of the date of this Agreement the
Company is not a party to any "poison pill" rights plan relating to any shares
of capital stock of the Company.

  

  

(b) Section 4.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the
date of this Agreement, the name and jurisdiction of organization of each
Company Subsidiary. The Company owns, directly or indirectly, all of the
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests
in, each of the Company Subsidiaries, free and clear of any Liens, except for
(i) Liens imposed under federal or state securities Laws and (ii) Liens
arising under the Company Credit Agreement. All such shares of capital stock
or other equity interests are duly authorized and validly issued and are fully
paid, nonassessable and free of any preemptive rights. Other than with respect
to Liens arising under the Company Credit Agreement, neither the Company nor
any of the Company Subsidiaries has any outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any character calling for the
purchase or issuance of any security of any of the Company Subsidiaries,
including any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise
receive any shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, any of
the Company Subsidiaries. There are no restrictions on the Company with
respect to voting the stock of any Company Subsidiary.

  

  

(c) There are no outstanding contractual obligations to which the Company or
any Company Subsidiary is a party (i) to repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or (ii) relating to the voting of any shares
of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, the Company (except for
Section 2.6(e)) or any Company Subsidiary.

  

  

(d) Except for the capital stock of the Company Subsidiaries, the Company does
not own, directly or indirectly, any material amount of equity interests in
any corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other Person.

  

  

Section 4.3. Authority.

  

  

(a) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Parent and
Merger Sub set forth in Section 5.7, the Company has all necessary corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate
the Transactions to be consummated by it, subject to the Company obtaining,
prior to the Effective Time, the vote in

Back

 

 

   
 

  

favor of the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the
issued and outstanding Shares, in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL (the
"Company Stockholder Approval"). The execution, delivery and performance by
the Company of this Agreement, and the consummation by the Company of the
Transactions to be consummated by it, have been duly authorized and approved
by the Company Board and, except for the receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, no other corporate action on the part of the Company is necessary to
authorize the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement and the
consummation by the Company of the Transactions to be consummated by it. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming
due and valid authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except
that such enforceability (i) may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium or other similar Laws affecting or relating to the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally and (ii) is subject to general principles of
equity.

  

  

(b) At a meeting duly called and held, the Company Board has, by the unanimous
vote of those voting, adopted resolutions (i) approving, and declaring to be
advisable, this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions to be
consummated by the Company and (ii) recommending that the Company's
stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement at the
Stockholders' Meeting, which resolutions have not been subsequently withdrawn
or modified in any respect (it is understood that this clause (ii) is not
intended to, and shall not, affect the Company's rights under clause (y) of
the proviso in Section 2.6(a)(ii), Section 6.2 or Section 8.1(c)).

  

  

Section 4.4. Consents and Approvals; No Violations.

  

  

(a) Except for (i) the consents and approvals set forth in Section 4.4(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, (ii) the filing with the SEC of the Proxy
Statement, (iii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of
State, (iv) such filings and approvals as may be required under liquor Laws in
the jurisdictions in which the Company and the Company Subsidiaries conduct
business and (v) such other filings, permits, authorizations, consents and
approvals as may be required under, and other applicable requirements of, the
Exchange Act and the HSR Act and the applicable requirements of the NASDAQ
Global Select Market ("NASDAQ") (all of the foregoing, collectively, the
"Company Required Governmental Approvals"), no consent or approval of, or
filing, declaration or registration with, any Governmental Entity, which has
not been received or made, is required to be obtained or made by the Company
for the consummation by the Company of the Transactions to be consummated by
it, other than such consents, approvals, filings, declarations or
registrations that, if not obtained or made, would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(b) None of the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement and
the consummation by the Company of the Transactions to be consummated by it,
and compliance by the Company with any of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, will (i) violate any provision of the Company Certificate or
Company By-Laws or any of the similar organizational documents of any Company
Subsidiary or (ii) assuming that the Company Stockholder Approval and the
Company Required Governmental Approvals are received or

respective properties or assets or (y) violate, result in the loss of any
material benefit under, constitute a default (or an event which, with notice
or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) under, result in the
termination of or a right of termination or cancellation under, or result in
the creation of any Lien upon any of the respective properties or assets of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries under, any Material Contract,
except, in the case of clause (ii) above, for such violations, losses of
benefits, defaults, events, terminations, rights of termination or
cancellation, or Lien creations as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

Section 4.5. SEC Documents; Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities.

  

  

(a) The Company has filed all reports, schedules, forms, proxy statements and
registration statements with the SEC required to be filed by it pursuant to
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, in each such case from March 29, 2009
through the date of this Agreement (collectively, the "SEC Documents"). As of
their respective dates (or if subsequently amended or superseded by a filing
prior to the date of this Agreement, on the date of such filing), the SEC
Documents complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and none of the SEC Documents as of such dates contained any untrue statement
of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary has listed its securities on any stock exchange in
any jurisdiction, other than the Shares listed by the Company on NASDAQ. No
Company Subsidiary is separately subject to the periodic reporting
requirements of the Exchange Act. As of the date of this Agreement, none of
the SEC Documents are subject to outstanding comments in comment letters
received by the Company from the SEC staff.

  

  

(b) The consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the SEC
Documents (the "SEC Financial Statements") have been prepared in accordance
with GAAP (except as may be otherwise indicated therein or in the notes
thereto and except, in the case of unaudited consolidated quarterly
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the Exchange Act), applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved, and (except as may be indicated
therein or in the notes thereto or as subsequently amended or superseded by a
filing prior to the date of this Agreement) fairly present in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the
consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity and cash flows for
the respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and the absence of
footnotes).

  

  

(c) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has any
liabilities or obligations of any nature that would have been required by GAAP
to be reflected in the consolidated balance sheet or notes thereto of the
Company as of such date, except (i) for such liabilities and obligations
reflected, reserved against or otherwise disclosed in the consolidated balance
sheets of the Company as of March 27, 2011 (including the notes thereto) that
are included in the SEC Financial Statements or as otherwise disclosed in the
SEC

Documents, (ii) for such liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice, (iii) for such liabilities
and obligations incurred pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement or
the Transactions, or (iv) for such liabilities and obligations as would not
reasonably be expected to have, in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. There are no off-balance sheet arrangements to which the Company or
any Company Subsidiary is a party required to be disclosed pursuant to Item
303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act that have not
been disclosed in the SEC Documents.

  

  

(d) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") and
the related rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The Company has
established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal
control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e)
and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by
Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. The Company's disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that
all such material information is accumulated and communicated to the
management of the Company as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The management of the Company
completed its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal
control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended March 27,
2011, and such assessment concluded that as of March 27, 2011 such controls
were effective. The Company's principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to

conjunction with any other event) will: (i) increase any benefits otherwise
payable under any Benefit Plan; (ii) result in any acceleration of the time of
payment or vesting of any such benefits; or (iii) result in any payment
(whether severance pay or otherwise) becoming due to, or with respect to, any
current of former employee or director of the Company.

Section 4.18. Restrictions on Business Combinations. Assuming the accuracy of
the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in
Section 5.7, the Company Board has taken all necessary action such that the
restrictions imposed on business combinations by Section 203 of the DGCL are
inapplicable to this Agreement and the Merger. To the Company's Knowledge,
other than Section 203 of the DGCL, no so-called "moratorium", "control share
acquisition", "fair price" or other state anti-takeover laws apply to this
Agreement and the Transactions.

  

  

Section 4.19. Opinion of Financial Advisor. The Company Board has received the
opinion of Jefferies and Company, Inc. ("Jefferies"), the Company's financial
advisor, to the effect that, as of the date of this Agreement, the Merger
Consideration is fair from a financial point of view to the holders of Shares.
As of the execution of this Agreement, such opinion has not been withdrawn,
rescinded, amended or superseded. A copy of such opinion will be provided to
Parent solely for information purposes as promptly as practicable after the
date hereof.

  

  

Section 4.20. Broker's Fees. Except for Jefferies and the fees and expenses
payable to it (including amounts payable to it at the Closing), neither the
Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries nor any of their respective
officers or directors on behalf of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries has employed any financial advisor, broker or finder in a manner
that would result in any liability for any broker's fees, commissions or
finder's fees in connection with any of the Transactions. The Company has
delivered or made available to Parent prior to or simultaneously with the
execution of this Agreement a complete and correct copy of the Company's
engagement letter with Jefferies.

  

  

Section 4.21. Suppliers. Set forth on Section 4.21 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule is a complete and correct list of the ten (10) suppliers that
accounted for the largest dollar volume of purchases by the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries during the fiscal year ended April 1, 2012 (the "Major
Suppliers"). Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any
written notice during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the date of
this Agreement that any Major Supplier intends to cancel or otherwise
materially modify its relationship with the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries.

  

  

Section 4.22. No Other Representations or Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties expressly contained in this Article IV (giving
effect to the Company Disclosure Schedule), neither the Company nor any other
Person makes any express or implied representation or warranty on behalf of
the Company. The Company hereby disclaims any such other representation or
warranty, whether by the Company, any Company Subsidiary, or any of their
respective Representatives or any other Person, notwithstanding the delivery
or disclosure to Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person of any documentation
or other written or oral information by the Company, any Company Subsidiary or
any of their respective Representatives or any other Person, and, in the
absence of fraud, neither the Company nor any other Person will have or be
subject to any liability or indemnification obligation to Parent, Merger Sub
or any other Person resulting from such delivery or disclosure, or Parent's or
Merger Sub's use, of any such documentation or other information (including
any information, documents, projections, forecasts, business plans or other

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

  

OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

  

  

Parent and Merger Sub jointly and severally represent and warrant to the
Company as follows:

  

  

Section 5.1. Corporate Organization. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a
corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has the requisite corporate
power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which
the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the
properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified would not reasonably be expected to have, when aggregated with all
other such failures, a material adverse effect on Parent's or Merger Sub's
ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or prevent the
consummation of the Transactions (a "Parent Material Adverse Effect").

  

  

Section 5.2. Authority. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all necessary
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to
consummate the Transactions to be consummated by it. The execution, delivery
and performance by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement, and the
consummation by each of Parent and Merger Sub of the Transactions to be
consummated by it, have been duly authorized and approved by Parent and Merger
Sub, and no other corporate action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or their
respective stockholders is necessary to authorize the execution and delivery
by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation by each of
Parent and Merger Sub of the Transactions to be consummated by it. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and,
assuming due and valid authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement
by the Company, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each of Parent
and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of them in accordance with its terms,
except that such enforceability (i) may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium or other similar Laws affecting or relating to the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally and (ii) is subject to general principles of
equity.

  

  

Section 5.3. Consents and Approvals; No Violations.

  

  

(a) Except for (i) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary
of State and (ii) such other filings, permits, authorizations, consents and

Approvals"), no consent or approval of, or filing, declaration or registration
with, any Governmental Entity which has not been received or made is required
to be obtained by or made by Parent, Merger Sub or any other Affiliate of

Parent for the consummation by each of Parent and Merger Sub of the
Transactions to be consummated by it, other than such consents, approvals,
filings, declarations or registrations that, if not obtained or made, would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(b) None of the execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this
Agreement and the consummation by each of Parent and Merger Sub of the
Transactions to be consummated by it, and compliance by Parent and Merger Sub
with any of the terms and provisions of this Agreement, will (i) violate any
provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws (or similar
organizational documents with different names) of Parent or Merger Sub or (ii)
assuming that the Parent Required Governmental Approvals are received or made,
as the case may be, prior to the Effective Time, (x) violate any Law
applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective properties or
assets or (y) violate, result in the loss of any material benefit under,
constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time, or
both, would constitute a default) under, result in the termination of or a
right of termination or cancellation under, accelerate the performance
required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the respective
properties or assets of Parent or Merger Sub under any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, deed of trust, license, permit, lease, contract, agreement or other
instrument to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party, or by which either of
them or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or affected,
except, in the case of clause (ii) above, for such violations, losses of
benefits, defaults, events, terminations, rights of termination or
cancellation, accelerations or Lien creations as would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

  

  

Section 5.4. Merger Sub.

  

  

(a) Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Merger and
the other Transactions and has not engaged in any business activities or
conducted any operations, in each case since the date of its incorporation
other than in connection with the Merger and the other Transactions.

  

  

(b) The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of which 1,000 shares are issued and
outstanding. All such issued and outstanding shares are owned beneficially and
of record by Parent.

  

  

Section 5.5. Sufficient Funds. Prior to the date of this Agreement, Parent has
delivered to the Company complete, correct and executed copies of all
financing agreements and/or commitment letters (except that the fee amounts in
the fee letters have been redacted) entered into in connection with this
Agreement, including, (i) the equity commitment letter (the "Equity Commitment
Letter") to provide equity financing in an aggregate amount set forth therein
(the "Equity Financing") and (ii) the debt commitment letter(s) from GCI
Capital Markets, LLC, Ares Capital Corporation and General Electric Capital
Corporation (collectively, the "Debt Financing Sources") dated as of the date
hereof (the "Debt Commitment Letters" and, together with the Equity Commitment
Letter, the "Financing Commitments"), pursuant to which the Debt Financing
Sources have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to
provide or cause to be provided to Parent, debt financing in an aggregate
amount set forth therein (the "Debt Financing", and together with the Equity
Financing, the "Financing") in connection with

the financing of the Transactions, including all exhibits, schedules or
amendments thereto (except that fee amounts in the fee letters have been
redacted), which as of the date hereof, have not been amended or modified (and
no such amendment or modification is contemplated) and the commitments
contained in such letters have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect.
As of the date hereof, the Financing Commitments are in full force and effect,
are legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent and, to Parent's Knowledge,
the other parties thereto, and are enforceable in accordance with their terms
against Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, and, to Parent's Knowledge, the
other parties thereto (in each case, as may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting or relating to the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and general principles of equity).
As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of
Parent or Merger Sub under the Financing Commitments. The aggregate proceeds
contemplated by the Financing Commitments, when funded in accordance with
their terms (in the case of the Debt Financing, at the maximum amount of the
term loan facility contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters), together with
Immediately Available Cash in an amount not less than the Minimum Cash Amount,
will be sufficient for Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions
(including sufficient funds to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant
to Article III, to make all payments in respect of the Company Options
pursuant to Section 3.4, to pay all amounts which become payable under the
Benefit Plans solely as a result of the Transactions, to perform Parent's and
Merger Sub's other obligations under this Agreement, and to pay all fees,
expenses and other amounts related to the Transactions or the Financing
payable by either of them). The Financing Commitments contain all of the
conditions precedent or other contingencies to the obligations of the parties
thereunder to make Financing available to Parent and Merger Sub on the terms
therein, and as of the date hereof, Parent and Merger Sub have no reason to
believe that any of the conditions precedent to the Financing will not be
satisfied in connection with the consummation of the Transactions or that the
Financing will not be available to Merger Sub on the Closing Date. Parent and
Merger Sub have obtained the consent of the lenders under the Financing
Commitments to publicly file the Financing Commitments with the SEC if
requested by the SEC or required by Law (provided that all fee amounts in the
fee letters shall be redacted). Parent and Merger Sub shall comply with and
accept any "flex" terms contained in any of the Financing Commitments as may
be necessary to complete the Financing.

  

  

Section 5.6. Solvency. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into the
Transactions with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or
future creditors. As of the Effective Time, assuming (i) satisfaction of the
conditions to Parent's and Merger Sub's obligation to consummate the Merger,
or waiver of such conditions, (ii) the accuracy in all material respects of
the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article III
hereof (for such purposes, such representations and warranties shall be true
and correct in all material respects without giving effect to any "knowledge",
materiality or "Company Material Adverse Effect" qualification or exception),
(iii) estimates, projections or forecasts provided by the Company to Parent
prior to the date hereof were prepared in good faith on assumptions that were,
at the time of preparation and the date of this Agreement, reasonable, and
(iv) Immediately Available Cash in an amount not less than the Minimum Cash
Amount, and after giving effect to all of the Transactions (including the
Financing (and any other repayment or refinancing of debt that may be
contemplated in the Financing Commitments), the payment of the aggregate
Merger Consideration pursuant to Article III, the payments in respect of the
Company Options pursuant

the Transactions or the Financing), and immediately after the consummation of
the Transactions, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation (i) will be
able to pay its debts as they become due and shall own property having a fair
saleable value greater than the amounts required to pay its debts and other
liabilities (including a reasonable estimate of the amount of all contingent
liabilities) as they become due; and (ii) shall not have an unreasonably small
amount of capital to carry on the businesses in which is it engaged or
proposed to be engaged. For all purposes of this Agreement, clauses (i) and
(ii) shall mean that each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be able
to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or
a combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become due.

  

  

Section 5.7. Ownership of Shares. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the other
Affiliates of Parent is not, nor at any time during the last three (3) years
has been, an "interested stockholder" (as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL)
of the Company. None of Parent, Merger Sub and the other Affiliates of Parent
beneficially owns any Shares.

  

  

Section 5.8. Other Agreements. As of the date hereof, neither Parent, Merger
Sub nor any other Affiliate of Parent has entered (or committed to enter) into

in connection with any of the Transactions or otherwise or (ii) pursuant to
which any stockholder of the Company would be entitled to receive
consideration of a different amount or nature than the Merger Consideration or
pursuant to which any stockholder of the Company agrees to vote to adopt this
Agreement or agrees to vote against (or refrain from voting in favor of) any
Superior Proposal.

  

  

Section 5.9. Litigation. Except (i) as would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect and
(ii) for any litigation (or threatened litigation) concerning this Agreement,
any of the Transactions, or any agreement or arrangement referred to in
Section 5.8, there is no Proceeding (with respect to investigations, to the
Parent's Knowledge) pending or, to Parent's Knowledge, threatened in a writing
delivered to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
against Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of
their respective properties or assets or any of their respective officers or
directors (in their capacity as officers or directors of Parent or Merger Sub
or any of their respective Subsidiaries) before any Governmental Entity.
Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, neither Parent nor Merger Sub is
subject to any outstanding judgment, order, writ, injunction or decree of any
Governmental Entity.

  

  

Section 5.10. Acknowledgments of Parent and Merger Sub. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub acknowledges, understands and agrees to Section 4.22 and
acknowledges and agrees that (i) Parent has conducted its own independent
investigation and analysis of the business, assets, condition and operations
of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) in entering into this Agreement,

Time"), the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives shall have the right to: (i) initiate, solicit and facilitate
Alternative Proposals from any other Person or group of Persons (including,
following entry by such Person(s) into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
(unless such Person(s) is/are subject to a confidentiality agreement with the
Company entered into prior to the date of this Agreement; it being understood
that the Company shall have the right to waive any provision with respect to
submission of Alternative Proposals or amendments thereto), by way of
furnishing to such Person(s) and its/their Representatives, Affiliates and

Parent and Merger Sub; and (ii) enter into and maintain or continue
substantive discussions or negotiations with respect to Alternative Proposals
or otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in, or facilitate, any

(b) After the Solicitation Period End Time until the earlier of the Effective
Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1, the
Company agrees that (i) the Company shall not, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers, directors and employees
not to, and neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall
authorize any of their other respective Representatives to, directly or
indirectly, initiate, propose, solicit or knowingly facilitate (including by
way of furnishing non-public information or granting any waiver, amendment or
release under any standstill agreement or takeover laws; it being understood
that the Company shall have the right to waive any provision to permit the
submission of Alternative Proposals or amendments thereto privately to the
Company Board or its Representatives) the making of any inquiry, proposal or
offer that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an Alternative
Proposal from any Person or group of Persons or engage in any discussions
(other than discussions for the purpose of informing any Person(s) of the

6.2) or negotiations with, or provide any non-public information to, any

with any Person(s) conducted theretofore with respect to any Alternative

and their respective Representatives may continue to take any of the actions
described in Section 6.2(a) after the Solicitation Period End Time with
respect to any Person or group of Persons that has made, and not withdrawn, an
Alternative Proposal prior to the Solicitation Period End Time if, in the good
faith judgment of the Company Board (after consultation with the Company's
financial advisor and outside counsel), such Alternative Proposal constitutes,
or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal (such Person or group
of Persons, an "Excluded Person"); provided, however, that any such Person or
group of Persons shall cease to be an Excluded Person immediately at such
time, if any, as the Alternative Proposal made by such Person(s) is withdrawn
or terminates (it being understood and agreed that any modification or
amendment or such Alternative Proposal shall not constitute the withdrawal or
termination thereof). Promptly (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours
thereafter) following the Solicitation Period End Time, the Company shall
deliver to Parent a written summary of the material terms and conditions
(including the basic financial terms) of the Alternative Proposal made by each
Excluded Person (without identifying such Excluded Person). Following the
Solicitation Period End Time, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and material terms
and conditions (including any change agreed to in writing to the financial
terms or any other material term thereof) or developments of any such
Alternative Proposal.

(c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary (but
subject to the second sentence of Section 6.2(b)), after the Solicitation
Period End Time until the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1, the Company (directly or
through its Representatives) may:

  

  

(i) until receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, engage in substantive
discussions or negotiations with a Person or group of Persons that makes an
unsolicited bona fide written Alternative Proposal (provided that such
Alternative Proposal does not arise from any material breach of the
restrictions in Section 6.2(b)) and may furnish to such Person(s) and
its/their Representatives information concerning, and may afford such
Person(s) and its/their Representatives access to, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and their businesses, properties, assets, books and records, if
(x) in the good faith judgment of the Company Board (after consultation with
the Company's financial advisor and outside counsel), such Alternative
Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal,

substantive discussions (except as to the existence of this Section 6.2 or to
ask such Person(s) to clarify the terms and conditions of such Alternative
Proposal) or negotiations with, such Person(s), (A) the Company receives from
such Person(s) an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (or such
Person(s) is/are subject to a confidentiality agreement with the Company
entered into prior to the Solicitation Period End Time; it being understood

submission of Alternative Proposals or amendments thereto privately to the
Company Board or its Representatives) and (B) the Company promptly (and in any
event within forty-eight (48) hours) notifies Parent to the effect that it

that any such disclosure (other than any communication contemplated by Section
6.2(c)(iii) below) shall be deemed to be a Change in Recommendation (as
defined in Section 6.2(d) below) unless the Company Board expressly publicly
reaffirms its approval and recommendation of the Merger and this Agreement
within five (5) Business Days following any written request by Parent or, in
the case of the commencement of any Alternative Proposal pursuant to
Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act (a "Tender Offer Commencement"), prior
to the later of the fifth (5th) Business Day following any written request by
Parent or the tenth (10th) Business Day following such commencement);

(iv) make any other disclosure to the Company's stockholders, and take any
other action, if the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with the Company's outside counsel) that the failure to make such
disclosure or take such other action which would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with applicable Law; provided, however, that any such disclosure
shall be deemed to be a Change in Recommendation unless the Company Board
expressly publicly reaffirms its approval and recommendation of the Merger and
this Agreement within five (5) Business Days following any written request by
Parent, or, in the case of a Tender Offer Commencement, prior to the later of
the fifth (5th) Business Day following any written request by Parent or the
tenth (10th) Business Day following such commencement); provided, further,
that if such request is made at least five (5) Business Days prior to the

Board may not (i) withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent,
the approval or recommendation by the Company Board of the Merger or this
Agreement, or fail to include such approval or recommendation in the Proxy
Statement or reaffirm such approval and recommendation within five (5)
Business Days after Parent's written request (or, in the case of a Tender
Offer Commencement, prior to the later of the fifth (5th) Business Day
following any written request by Parent or the tenth (10th) Business Day
following such commencement), (ii) approve or recommend to the stockholders of
the Company an Alternative Proposal or fail to publicly recommend against any
Alternative Proposal within five (5) Business Days after Parent's written
request (or, in the case of a Tender Offer Commencement, prior to the later of
the fifth (5th) Business Day following any written request by Parent or the
tenth (10th) Business Day following such commencement) (any action described
in the foregoing clause (i), this clause (ii), clause (y) of the proviso in
Section 2.6(a)(ii) or as set forth below in subsections (i)(x), (i)(y),

(iii) cause the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to enter into any

Company Board (after consultation with the Company's financial advisor and
outside counsel) determines in good faith that (A) any Alternative Proposal

case, with any identifying information redacted), which notice need only be

48-hour period shall be commenced upon the delivery of such new notice); (B)
within the Notice Period, the Company, shall, and shall cause its financial

eight (48) hour period, Parent makes a bona fide offer that the Company Board

such offer and (II) such legal, financial, regulatory, timing, financing,
conditionality (i.e. closing conditions) and other aspects of such offer and
the Merger which the Company Board deems relevant (including any stockholder
litigation in connection with the Merger)), and Parent agrees in writing to

(A) any Alternative Proposal referred to in clause (i) of Section 6.2(c) or
any Alternative Proposal submitted by an Excluded Person constitutes a
Superior Proposal, (B) the Company shall have complied in all material
respects with all of its obligations under this Section 6.2 and (C) the

shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other
announcement with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the other
Transactions without the prior written approval of the Company and Parent,
except as may be required by Law or by any listing agreement with a securities
exchange as determined in the good faith judgment of the party wanting to make
such release or announcement based on the advice of counsel. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Company shall not be required to obtain the prior written

Parent access to senior executives of the Company to answer Parent's questions
concerning the business, operations and affairs of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and access to the Company's and each of the Company Subsidiaries'
properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, in each case, as
reasonably requested by Parent; provided, that in each case, such access shall
be given at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice and Parent and its
Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the business, operations or personnel of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries (it being agreed that such access shall in
no way include any Phase II environmental investigation or other invasive
procedure or investigation, including any sampling, testing or the removal of
materials from the offices and properties of the Company). Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, neither the Company nor any of
the Company Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information if such access or disclosure would violate any confidentiality
obligation, jeopardize the work product privilege or the attorney-client
privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information,
compromise the value of any trade secret, or contravene any Law (including
antitrust laws), fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the
date of this Agreement.

Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall not, and
shall cause their respective Representatives and Affiliates not to, contact or
otherwise communicate with the respective employees of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries regarding the businesses of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, this Agreement or any of the Transactions without first
obtaining the consent of the Company in writing (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

  

  

(c) The Company makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy of any
information provided pursuant to Section 6.4(a), and neither Merger Sub nor
Parent may rely on the accuracy of any such information, other than as
expressly set forth in the Company's representations and warranties in Article
IV.

  

  

(d) The information provided pursuant to Section 6.4(a) will be used solely
for the purpose of effecting the Transactions and will be governed by the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

  

Section 6.5. Further Assurances; Regulatory Matters.

  

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,
cooperate with each other and use (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use)
commercially reasonable efforts (i) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements
which may be imposed on such party with respect to the Merger or the other
Transactions and, subject to the conditions set forth in Article VII, to
consummate the Transactions as promptly as practicable and (ii) promptly to
prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all necessary
applications, notices, petitions, filings and other documents, and to use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, as soon as practicable after the
date of this Agreement, all necessary permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all Governmental Entities and other Persons necessary or
advisable in connection with consummating the Transactions, including the
Company Required Governmental Approvals and Parent Required Governmental
Approvals (it being understood that (A) the failure to obtain any such
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations shall not constitute a breach
by the Company of its obligations under this Section 6.5(a) provided that the
Company shall have used, and shall have caused each of the Company
Subsidiaries to use, its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations (it being understood that in
connection with such efforts, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
shall be required to pay any fee or incur any other liabilities or obligations
prior to the Effective Time) and (B) neither the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any of their respective Representatives shall agree to make any
payment, incur any liability or make any material amendment to the terms of
any applicable Contract in order to obtain any such any such permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations without Parent's prior written
approval). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of this
Section 6.5(a), each party shall, within ten (10) Business Days after the
execution of this Agreement, file the Notification and Report Form and related
documents under the HSR Act and its associated regulations, and shall, as
promptly as practicable, file all necessary documentation required pursuant to
additional requests

for information to obtain termination of applicable waiting periods for the
Transactions under the HSR Act.

  

  

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
hereto contained in Section 6.5(a), each of the parties hereto shall use (and
Parent shall cause its Affiliates to use) commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve all objections, if any, to the Transactions by any Governmental Entity
under the HSR Act and ensure the expiration of all waiting periods under the
HSR Act, including reaching an agreement, settlement or consent providing for
divestiture, a "hold separate" agreement, contractual undertakings with third
Persons or any other relief with the Governmental Entity investigating the
Merger or any of the other Transactions. In connection with the foregoing, if
any Proceeding, including any Proceeding by a private Person, is instituted
(or threatened to be instituted) challenging any of the Transactions as
violative of the HSR Act or any other antitrust Law or other Law in any
jurisdiction, the parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use (and
Parent shall cause its Affiliates to use) their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to contest and resist any such Proceeding and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any judgment or other order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of any of the Transactions, including
defending through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any such
Proceeding by any Person.

  

  

Section 6.6. Employee Benefit Plans.

  

  

(a) Subject to Section 6.6(e), Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, honor and perform in accordance with
their terms all the Benefit Plans.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, for a
period ending on the twelve (12)-month anniversary of the Closing, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to,
provide employees of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries with base
salary or base wages and annual and quarterly incentive compensation
opportunities that are no less favorable to the base salary or base wages and
annual and quarterly incentive compensation opportunities such employee
received immediately prior to the Closing and other material employee benefits
which, in the aggregate, are substantially comparable to the compensation and
employee benefits (excluding any equity based compensation or benefits or
other long-term incentive compensation) in effect for such employees under
Benefit Plans of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Closing.

  

  

(c) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, (i) credit all service with the Company and any of the
Company Subsidiaries (including service recognized by the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries for service with other Persons) for all purposes

of Section 3(35) of ERISA) under any employee benefit plan, policy or program
applicable to employees of the Surviving Corporation or any of its

dependents under any group health plan or other welfare benefit plan to the
extent such pre-existing condition or limitation or exclusion or actively at
work requirement was satisfied under the Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date ,

the plan year in the Closing Date occurs, recognize the dollar amount of all
expenses incurred by employees of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries and their dependents in the plan year in which the Closing occurs
for purposes of deductibles, co-payments and maximum out-of pocket limits
under any group health plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Section 6.6 shall be construed to require crediting of service that would
result in duplication of benefits.

  

  

(d) Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.6, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, pay
severance benefits to persons who were employees of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time and whose employment with the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries is
involuntarily terminated within twelve (12) months following the Effective
Time in amounts no less favorable than the amount of severance benefits to
which such persons would have been entitled under the terms of the Company's
or the Company Subsidiaries' severance plans, programs, policies and
agreements as set forth on Section 6.6(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

  

  

(e) The Parties agree that nothing herein expressed or implied (i) is intended
to confer on any Person other than the parties hereto or their respective
successors and permitted assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or
liabilities under or by reason of this Section 6.6, (ii) shall create any
right to continued employment with the Company, any of its subsidiaries,
Parent or the Surviving Company, (iii) shall interfere with Parent's right to
amend, modify or terminate any Benefit Plan or to terminate the employment of
any employee of the Company or its subsidiaries for any reason (or no reason)
after the Effective Time, or (iv) shall be an amendment to any Benefit Plan,
or benefit plan or arrangement of the Parent, its subsidiaries, or the
Surviving Company.

  

  

Section 6.7. Indemnification and Insurance.

  

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall, jointly and severally (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to), indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the fullest extent authorized or
permitted under the DGCL or other applicable Law, each Person who is now, or
has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes such
prior to the Effective Time, an officer, director or employee of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries (individually, an "Indemnified Party," and
collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against any and all losses, claims,
damages, costs, expenses (including attorneys' fees and disbursements),
obligations (including experts' fees, travel expenses, court costs, retainers,
transcript fees, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well as
telecommunications, postage and courier charges), fines, liabilities,
judgments, and amounts that are paid in settlement (collectively, "Indemnified
Liabilities"), paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending,
serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating in (and
including preparation for any of the foregoing) any pending, threatened,
asserted or completed Proceeding (including any Proceeding brought by an
Indemnified Party

under this Section 6.7, any action on appeal, or any arbitration or other
alternative dispute resolution mechanism), whether civil or criminal, and
whether instituted by the Company, the Surviving Corporation, any Governmental
Entity or any other party (each, an "Indemnity Proceeding"), based in whole or
in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining in whole or
in part to the fact that such Person is or was an officer or director of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary (or served at the request of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary as a director, officer or trustee of another Person
(including any employee benefit plan)) at or prior to the Effective Time
(including acts or omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement, any
of the Transactions or any Benefit Plan), in any such case whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after, the Effective Time. In the event that any claim
for Indemnified Liabilities is asserted or made by an Indemnified Party, any
determination required to be made with respect to whether such Indemnified
Party's conduct complies with the standards set forth under the DGCL or other
applicable Law shall be made by independent legal counsel selected by such
Indemnified Party and reasonably acceptable to the Surviving Corporation (it
being understood and agreed that the burden of proof shall be on Parent and
the Surviving Corporation to establish that such Indemnified Party does not so
comply). Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly
advance all out-of-pocket expenses of each Indemnified Party in connection
with any Indemnity Proceeding as such expenses (including attorneys' fees and
disbursements) are incurred upon receipt from such Indemnified Party of a
request therefor (accompanied by invoices or other relevant documentation),
provided (if and to the extent required by the DGCL or other applicable Law)
that such Indemnified Party undertakes to repay such amount if it is
ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be
indemnified under the DGCL or other applicable Law with respect to such
Indemnity Proceeding. In the event any Indemnity Proceeding is brought against
any Indemnified Party (and in which indemnification could be sought by such
Indemnified Party hereunder), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall each
use commercially reasonable efforts to assist in the vigorous defense of such
matter, provided that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall
settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in such Indemnity
Proceeding without the prior written consent of such Indemnified Party if and
to the extent the terms of the proposed settlement, compromise or judgment
involve any non-monetary relief from such Indemnified Party.

  

  

(b) All rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses existing in
favor of, and all exculpations and limitations of the personal liability of,
the directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries and agents of any of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries in the Company Certificate or Company By-
Laws (or comparable organizational documents of the Company Subsidiaries) as
in effect as of the Effective Time with respect to matters occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time, including the Merger and the other Transactions,
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect
thereafter, without any amendment thereto. The Surviving Corporation shall
not, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to, distribute or
dispose of assets in a manner that would render the Surviving Corporation
unable to satisfy any of its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.7.

  

  

(c) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, maintain in effect the
current directors' and officers' liability insurance policies maintained by or
for the Company and/or the Company Subsidiaries for the

benefit of those Persons who are covered by such policies as of the Effective
Time with respect to claims arising in whole or in part from matters occurring
or allegedly occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (provided that the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries may substitute therefor policies of
at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions that are at least
as beneficial to the beneficiaries of the current policies and with reputable
carriers having a rating comparable to the Company's current carrier);
provided, however, that each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, first use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a "tail"
policy on substantially the same terms and conditions for claims arising out
of acts or conduct occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and effective
for claims asserted prior to or during the six (6)-year period referred to
above (and, with respect to claims made prior to or during such period, until
final resolution thereof), and only if Parent and the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries are unable, after exerting commercially reasonable
efforts, to obtain such a "tail" policy, then Parent or the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries will be required to obtain such coverage from
such carriers in annual policies; and, provided, further that (i) if the
existing policies expire or are terminated or cancelled during such six (6)-
year period, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain policies of at least the
same coverage containing terms and conditions that are at least as beneficial
to the beneficiaries of the current policies with reputable carriers having a
rating comparable to the Company's current carrier, (ii) Parent or the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, shall not be
required to spend as an annual premium therefor an amount in excess of three
hundred percent (300%) of the annual premium therefor as of the date of this
Agreement and (iii) if, during such six (6)-year period, such insurance
coverage cannot be obtained at all or can be obtained only for an amount in
excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the current annual premium therefor,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be obtained as much
directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage as can be obtained for
an amount equal to three hundred percent (300%) of the current annual premium
therefor, on terms and conditions substantially similar to the Company's and
the Company Subsidiaries' existing directors' and officers' liability
insurance.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, prior to
the Effective Time the Company shall be permitted to purchase prepaid "tail"
policies in favor of the individuals referred to in Section 6.7(c) with
respect to the matters described therein (provided that the annual premium
therefor shall not exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the annual premium
therefor as of the date of this Agreement). If and to the extent such policies
have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policies in effect and continue to
honor the obligations of the Company thereunder.

  

  

(e) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor and
perform in accordance with their terms all indemnification agreements in
effect as of the date of this Agreement between the Company, on the one hand,
and any director or officer of the Company, on the other hand.

(f) The provisions of this Section 6.7 (i) are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Person who is now, or who has been at
any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, an Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her personal
representatives, (ii) shall be binding on Parent and the Surviving Corporation
and their respective successors and assigns, (iii) are in addition to, and not
in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such Person may have, whether pursuant to Law, Contract, any Benefit Plan,
the Company Certificate or Company By-Laws (or comparable organizational
documents of the Company Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation), or
otherwise and (iv) shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not
be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Party without the consent of such Indemnified Party.

  

  

(g) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or permitted assigns (each, an "Indemnifying Party") (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of such Indemnifying Party assume all the
obligations of such Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 6.7. In
addition, if upon or following any merger, consolidation or sale of assets any
Indemnifying Party is or becomes a direct or indirect Subsidiary of another
Person, the ultimate parent entity of such Indemnifying Party shall guaranty
the obligations of such Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 6.7.

  

  

Section 6.8. Additional Covenants. Prior to the earlier of the Effective Time
or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1:

  

  

(a) Merger Sub shall not, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub not to, undertake
any business or activities other than in connection with this Agreement and
engaging in the Merger and the other Transactions.

  

  

(b) Parent shall take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger and the other
Transactions on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

  

  

(c) Parent and Merger Sub shall not and Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the other Affiliates of Parent not to, and the
Company shall not and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, engage in
any action or enter into any transaction or permit any action to be taken or
transaction to be entered into that would reasonably be expected to materially
delay or prevent the consummation of, or otherwise adversely affect in any
material respect, the Merger or any of the other Transactions. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall not and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Affiliates not to, and the
Company shall not and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, acquire
(whether via merger, consolidation, stock or asset purchase or otherwise), or
agree to so acquire, any material amounts of assets of or any equity in any
Person or any business or division thereof, unless that acquisition or
agreement would not reasonably be expected to (i) result in any material delay
in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any
authorizations, consents, orders, declarations or approvals of any
Governmental Entity necessary

termination of any waiting period under applicable Law, or (ii) materially
increase the risk of any Governmental Entity entering an order prohibiting the
consummation of the Merger, or the other Transactions or materially increase
the risk of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise.

  

  

Section 6.9. Financing.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent and Merger Sub shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to arrange the Financing, including using their
commercially reasonable efforts to enter into definitive agreements with
respect thereto on terms and conditions in accordance with those set forth in
the Financing Commitments, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
not to (and Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
other Affiliates of Parent not to) take any action in connection with the
Financing Commitments or the Financing that would reasonably be expected to
delay or otherwise adversely affect the funding of the Financing on the
Closing Date or enforcement thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
shall have the right from time to time to amend, replace, supplement or
otherwise modify, or waive any of its rights under, the Financing Commitments
or any definitive agreements with respect to the Financing, and/or substitute
other debt or equity financing for all of any portion of the Financing from
the same and/or alternative financing sources, as long as any such amendment,
replacement, supplement or other modification to or waiver of any provision of
the Financing Commitments or other definitive agreements shall not expand upon
the conditions precedent contained therein or materially delay or otherwise
affect in any material respect the funding of the Financing. In the event that
any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable so as not to enable
Parent and Merger Sub to proceed with the Transactions in a timely manner,
Parent and Merger Sub shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
arrange to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount
sufficient to consummate the Transactions (as provided in Section 5.5) with
terms and conditions that are not less favorable (from the standpoint of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation) than those set forth in the
initial Debt Commitment Letters (for the avoidance of doubt, with conditions
precedent to such alternative financing and other terms that would not
reasonably be expected to materially delay or otherwise adversely affect in
any material respect the funding of such alternative financing or enforcement
thereof as compared to the Financing in accordance with the initial Debt
Commitment Letters) as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of
such event, including using their commercially reasonable efforts to enter
into definitive agreements with respect thereto (such definitive agreements
entered into pursuant to the first, second or third sentence of this Section
6.9(a) being referred to as the "Definitive Financing Agreements") and, any
reference to the Debt Commitment Letters in this Agreement shall be deemed to
include any replacement or amendment entered into pursuant to the second or
third sentence of this Section 6.9(a), and any reference to Debt Financing
Sources in this Agreement shall be deemed to include any source of debt
financing under any such replacement or amendment). Parent and Merger Sub
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to, and shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause their Affiliates and Representatives
to, comply with the terms and satisfy on a timely basis the conditions of the
Financing Commitments, any alternate financing commitments and the Definitive
Financing Agreements and any related fee and engagement letters. Any material
breach of any of the Financing Commitments, the Definitive Financing
Agreements, any alternate financing commitment and any related fee and
engagement letters by Parent or Merger Sub (a "Financing Agreement

Breach") not cured or waived (in writing by the applicable financing
source(s)) within thirty (30) days notice thereof shall be deemed a breach by
Parent of this Section 6.9(a); provided, that if Parent and Merger Sub enter
into any replacement financing with alternate financing source(s) within
thirty (30) days of such Financing Agreement Breach (covering at least the
amount of financing applicable to such breached financing) in accordance with
the second or third sentences of this Section 6.9(a), and there is no material
breach by Parent or Merger Sub thereunder, such original Financing Agreement
Breach shall be deemed cured for purposes of this sentence. Parent shall (i)
furnish complete, correct and executed copies of the Definitive Financing
Agreements to the Company promptly upon their execution, (ii) give the Company
prompt notice (x) of any material breach by any party of, or material dispute
or disagreement between any of the parties to, the Financing Commitments, any
alternate financing commitment or the Definitive Financing Agreements of which
Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware or any termination thereof or (y) if for
any reason Parent or Merger Sub believes in good faith that it is reasonably
likely that it will not be able to obtain all or any material portion of the
Financing in the amounts or from the sources contemplated by the Financing
Commitments and that it is not reasonably likely that it will be able to
obtain acceptable alternative financing and (iii) otherwise keep the Company
reasonably informed on a current basis of the status of its efforts to arrange
the Financing (or any replacements thereof). Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge
and agree that the obtaining of the Financing, or any alternative financing,
is not a condition to their respective obligations to effect the Merger.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in
this Section 6.9 shall require, and in no event shall the commercially
reasonable efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or construed to require,
either Parent or Merger Sub to (i) seek equity financing from any source other
than the party providing Equity Financing under the initial Equity Commitment
Letter or an amount of equity financing in excess of the Equity Financing
contemplated by the initial Equity Commitment Letter or (ii) pay any fees in
excess of those contemplated by the Financing Commitments or to agree to any
"market flex" term less favorable to Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation than such corresponding market flex term contained in or
contemplated by the initial Debt Commitment Letters (in the case of this
clause (ii), other than any increase(s) from the interest rate contemplated by
the initial Debt Commitment Letters in an amount not to exceed twelve point
five (12.5) basis points in the aggregate); provided, that this sentence shall
not excuse Parent from its obligation to pay the Parent Termination Fee in
accordance with Section 8.4 due to its failure to obtain the Financing, or in
any way prejudice the Company's rights under the Limited Guarantee or, to the
extent contemplated by Section 9.13, the Equity Commitment Letter.

  

  

(b) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section
8.1, the Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to,
use its commercially reasonable efforts, at Parent's sole expense, to
cooperate with Parent and Parent's Affiliates and Debt Financing Sources in
connection with the arrangement of the Financing (or any replacements
thereof), including (i) furnishing Parent, Merger Sub and the Debt Financing
Sources with financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries in connection with the Financing as may be
reasonably be requested in writing by Parent, including using commercially
reasonable efforts to furnish all financial statements and other financial
data and financial information that is required in order for the Parent to
satisfy its obligations under the Debt Commitment Letters and using
commercially reasonable efforts to furnish all other financial information
required from the Company pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letters as

and when required thereby, (ii) assisting with the preparation of customary
materials such as offering documents and private placement memoranda in
connection with the Financing, (iii) using commercially reasonable efforts to
seek comfort letters from accountants, legal opinions, surveys, title
insurance policies (including by providing any affidavit, indemnity or other
assurances reasonably requested by any title company) and consents from third
parties, in each case as reasonably requested by Parent (it being understood
that (A) the failure to obtain any comfort letters, legal opinions, surveys,
title insurance or consents from third parties shall not constitute a breach
by the Company of its obligations under this Section 6.9(b) provided that the
Company shall have used, and shall have caused each of the Company
Subsidiaries to use, its commercially reasonable efforts to seek to obtain
such documents and (B) neither the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of
their respective Representatives shall agree to make any payment, incur any
liability or make any material amendment to the terms of any applicable
Contract in order to obtain any such any certificate, document or instrument
without Parent's prior written approval), (iv) participating in due diligence
sessions by Company officers and employees, all as may reasonably be requested
by Parent and (v) participating in a reasonable number of meetings,
presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and
sessions with rating agencies in connection with the arrangement of the
Financing, including direct contact between senior management and Parent's and
Merger Sub's financing sources, (vi) executing and delivery such agreements,
officer's certificates, corporate consents and resolutions and other
instruments (including a certificate of the chief financial officer of the
Company with respect to solvency of the Company and its subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis to the extent required in connection with the Financing
officer's certificates) as are customary in financings of such type, and
agreeing to pledge, grant security interests in, and otherwise grant liens on,
the Company's assets pursuant to such agreements as may be reasonably
requested and (vii) take all corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of
the Effective Time, reasonably requested by Parent to permit the consummation
of the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters and the direct
borrowing or incurrence of all of the proceeds of the financing contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letters; provided, however, that (x) such requested
cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere with the business or ongoing
operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, (y) no obligation of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any certificate, document or
instrument shall be effective until the Effective Time and neither the Company
or any Company Subsidiary shall be required to pay any commitment or other
similar fee or incur any other liability in connection with the arrangement of
the Financing (or any replacements thereof) prior to the Effective Time and
(z) such requested cooperation shall not require the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to take any action that would conflict with any applicable Law, the
Company Certificate or the Company By-Laws (or the organizational documents of
any Company Subsidiary), or result in the contravention of, or that would
reasonably be expected to result in a violation or breach of, or default
under, any Contract to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party.
Parent shall, upon request by the Company, following the termination of this
Agreement, promptly reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries in
connection with such financing cooperation and shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives (including, following the Effective Time, their respective
officers and directors as of the Closing) from and against any and all losses,
damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in
connection with the arrangement of the Financing and any information used in

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

55

connection therewith. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be
required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other
liability in connection with the Financing (or any replacements thereof) prior
to the Effective Time. The non-public information regarding the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries provided to Parent, Merger Sub and their
Representatives pursuant to this Section 6.9 will be used solely for the
purpose of effecting the Transactions and will be governed by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

  

  

Section 6.10. Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions
of Shares (including any derivative securities with respect thereto) resulting
from the Transactions by each individual who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company
to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  

  

Section 6.11. Resignation of Directors. At the Closing, if requested by
Parent, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver
evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the resignation of any or all
the members of the Company Board and the directors of the Company
Subsidiaries, effective as of the Effective Time.

  

  

Section 6.12 Stockholder Actions. In the event that any Proceeding related to
this Agreement or the Transactions is brought or, to the Company's Knowledge
or Parent's Knowledge (as applicable), threatened in a writing delivered to
any party hereto (or any of the Subsidiaries of such party), by any
stockholder(s) of the Company against any party hereto or any of such party's
respective Affiliates or any of the directors of the foregoing (the
"Transaction Litigation"), such party shall promptly notify the other parties
in writing of such litigation and shall keep the other parties informed on a
reasonably current basis with respect to the status thereof, in each case,
only to the extent that providing such information would not, in the
reasonable judgment of such party based on advice of outside counsel,
jeopardize any privilege with respect thereto regarding any such litigation.
The Company and Parent shall give each other a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the defense, settlement and/or prosecution of any Transaction
Litigation (in each case, at such party's own expense), and the Company shall
not settle any Transaction Litigation without the prior written consent of
Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

  

  

Section 6.13 Delisting. Prior to the Closing, the Company agrees to cooperate
with Parent in a commercially reasonable manner with respect to the delisting
of the Shares from NASDAQ and the termination of the Company's registration
under the Exchange Act after the Effective Time.

penalties, interest and additions to Tax) and all such reasonable costs
(including accounting and legal fees) associated with filing all Tax returns
related to transfer Taxes incurred by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement and the other Transactions
("Transfer Taxes") shall be paid by Parent or the Surviving Corporation.
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be responsible for filing all Tax

Transfer Taxes. All parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to avail themselves of any available exemptions from any such Transfer Taxes,
and to cooperate with the other Parties hereto in providing any information
and documentation that may be necessary to obtain such exemptions. The Company
shall promptly provide to Parent all information and documentation reasonably
requested by Parent in order to calculate potential parachute payments under
Section 280G of the Code and the associated taxes in Section 4999 of the Code
(including all information reasonably requested by Parent to determine whether
an individual is a "disqualified individual" under Section 280G of the Code).

  

  

Section 6.15 Notice of Material Breach . The Company shall promptly notify
Parent and Merger Sub, and Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly notify the
Company, of any breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement by such party of which such party's Board of
Directors has actual knowledge and which, if not cured, would reasonably be
expected to cause the failure of any of the Closing conditions set forth in
Article VII to be satisfied. In no event shall the delivery of any notice by a
party pursuant to this Section 6.15 (x) limit or otherwise affect the
respective rights, obligations, representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under this Agreement, or (y) be deemed to amend or supplement a Disclosure
Schedule or constitute an exception to any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement. This Section 6.15 shall not constitute an agreement or covenant
for purposes of Sections 7.2(a) or 7.3(a).

  

  

Section 6.16 Tax Certificate. At the Closing, the Company shall provide to
Parent an affidavit certifying that interests in the Company are not "United
States real property interests" (within the meaning of Section 897 of the
Code), which affidavit shall be dated as of the Closing Date, signed under
penalties of perjury and in accordance with the provisions of Treasury
Regulations Sections 1.1445-2(c) and 1.897-2(h).

  

  

Section 6.17 Takeover Laws. If any "interested stockholder", "moratorium",
"control share acquisition", "fair price" or other state anti-takeover laws
(including Section 203 of the DGCL) becomes or is deemed to be applicable to
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement or any of
the Transactions (including the Merger), then the Company and the Company
Board, as applicable, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take all
actions necessary to ensure the Transactions (including the Merger) may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated herein and
otherwise use commercially reasonable efforts to eliminate, or if not possible
use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize to the maximum extent
permissible, the effects of any such anti-takeover laws on this Agreement and
the Transactions (including the Merger).

immediately following such Change in Recommendation.

  

  

(e) By the Company, if (x) Parent or Merger Sub shall have materially breached

with by Parent or Merger Sub such that the Closing condition set forth in

(a) If (i) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c),
(ii) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d) or (iii) (x)
either Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(b)(ii) or Section 8.1(b)(iv) or Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant

pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(ii)), the Stockholder's Meeting (in the case of a
termination pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iv)) or the breach that gave rise to

publicly by such Person(s) or as a result of any other public disclosure by
any Person) or, in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(ii) or
Section 8.1(f), privately to the Company Board, made an Alternative Proposal
and such proposal shall not have been unequivocally and, if appropriate,
publicly, terminated or withdrawn prior to the termination of this Agreement
referred to in clause (x) of this Section 8.3(a)(iii), and (z) at any time
after the date of this Agreement and prior to the one-year anniversary of the
termination of this Agreement, the Company consummates an Alternative Proposal
with any Person or group of Persons (for purpose of this clause (iii), all
references to twenty percent (20%) in the definition of Alternative Proposal
shall be replaced with fifty percent (50%)), then:

  

  

(A) in the case of a termination by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c) at

termination by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d) as a result of a Change of
Recommendation at or prior to sixty (60) hours after the Solicitation Period
End Time in respect of a Superior Proposal (provided that in each case, the
Superior Proposal that gave rise to the termination is not made by any
Specified Party), the Company shall pay to Parent or such Person as Parent may
designate in writing in its sole discretion (such Person, the "Fee Payee"),
the amount of $5,928,000 in cash; and

be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e), the

Affiliates of Parent, on the other hand, in connection with the Transactions,
whether incurred before or after the date of this Agreement, including
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred in
connection with its investigation, structuring, financing, negotiation, due
diligence, and financial, operating, legal and other analysis with respect to
the Transactions, provided that such payment to the Fee Payee shall not exceed
$1,750,000 (the "Expense Reimbursement"); provided that the existence of
circumstances which could require the Termination Fee to become subsequently
payable by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(a) shall not relieve the
Company of its obligations to pay the Expense Reimbursement pursuant to this
Section 8.3(b), and the payment by the Company of the Expense Reimbursement
pursuant to this Section 8.3(b) shall not relieve the Company of any
subsequent obligation to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(a);
provided, however, that (x) any Expense Reimbursement paid by the Company to
Parent pursuant to this Section 8.3(b) shall be deducted from any Termination
Fee that subsequently becomes payable pursuant to Section 8.3(a)(iii), and (y)
in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub seek to recover damages from the
Company in accordance with the proviso in Section 8.2 for amounts that have
already been paid by the Company to the Fee Payee as Expense Reimbursement
pursuant to this Section 8.3(b) (or vice versa).

  

  

(c) The Company shall pay the Termination Fee to the Fee Payee, by wire
transfer of same day funds, to one or more accounts designated in writing by
Parent (x) at or prior to the time of termination, in the case of such
termination by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c), (y) as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within two (2) Business Days of receipt of
Parent's termination notice pursuant to Section 8.2), in the case of such
termination by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d), or (z) the date on which an
Alternative Proposal is consummated, in the case of any instance in which a
Termination Fee is payable pursuant to Section 8.3(a)(iii); provided, that any
Expense Reimbursement previously paid to the Fee Payee pursuant to Section
8.3(b) (or damages previously paid to Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to the
proviso in Section 8.2) shall be deducted from the Termination Fee amount
payable pursuant to the terms of Section 8.3(a)(iii). The Company shall pay
the Expense Reimbursement to Parent by wire transfer of same day funds within
five (5) Business Days of receipt from Parent of documentation in accordance
with Section 8.3(b). Except to the extent required by applicable Law, the
Company shall not withhold any withholding taxes from any payment made
pursuant to this Section 8.3.

and Merger Sub agree that (i) payment of the Termination Fee or the Expense
Reimbursement (as applicable, and in either case together with the costs and
expenses referred to in Section 8.5, if applicable), if such payment is
payable and actually paid, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent
and Merger Sub against the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of

Group"), and (ii) in such event, none of the members of the Company Group

or (ii)) relating to, arising out of or with respect to this Agreement or any
of the Transactions (whether relating to, arising out of or with respect to
any matter(s) forming the basis for such termination or otherwise); provided,
however, that the preceding sentence shall not affect Parent's right to seek
specific performance prior to the termination of

this Agreement to the extent permitted pursuant to Section 9.13 hereof.
Without limitation of the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, any of their
respective Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or
maintain any proceeding, claim, suit or action against, or seek damages from,
any member of the Company Group, in contravention of the preceding sentence.
Under no circumstances shall the Termination Fee or the Expense Reimbursement
be payable more than once.

  

  

(e) In no event shall Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates seek
or permit to be sought on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub any damages or any
other recovery, judgment or damages of any kind, including consequential,
indirect, or punitive damages, from any member of the Company Group other than
the Company, in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. Parent and
Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that they have no right of recovery against,
and no personal liability shall attach to, any member of the Company Group
(other than Company to the extent provided in this Agreement), through the
Company or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the
corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil, by or
through a claim by or on behalf of the Company against a stockholder or any
other member of the Company Group, by the enforcement of any assessment or by
any legal or equitable Proceeding, by virtue of any applicable Law, or
otherwise, except for its right to recover from the Company in accordance with
the terms herein.

  

  

Section 8.4. Parent Termination Fee .

  

  

(a) In the event this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 8.1(g), Parent shall pay or cause to be paid the amount of $17,920,000
(the "Parent Termination Fee") to the Company as soon as practicable after
such termination (and in any event within two (2) Business Days of receipt of
the Company's termination notice pursuant to Section 8.2), by wire transfer of
same day funds to one or more accounts designated by the Company; provided,
however, any damages paid previously by Parent or Merger Sub to the Company
pursuant to the proviso in Section 8.2 shall be deducted from the Parent
Termination Fee payable pursuant to this Section 8.4(a).

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
Company agrees that (i) payment of the Parent Termination Fee (together with
the costs and expenses referred to in Section 8.5, if applicable, and amounts
payable by Parent under Section 6.9(b) (the second sentence thereof) and
Section 9.11 (the proviso thereof)), if such payment is payable and actually
paid, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company against the Parent
Group and each Debt Financing Source under the Debt Commitment Letters, and
(ii) in such event, no member of the Parent Group or any Debt Financing Source
under the Debt Commitment Letters shall have any further liability or
obligation, in any such case (clause (i) or (ii)) relating to, arising out of
or with respect to this Agreement or any of the Transactions (whether relating
to, arising out of or with respect to any matter(s) forming the basis for such
termination or otherwise); provided, however, that the preceding sentence
shall not affect the Company's right to seek specific performance prior to the
termination of this Agreement to the extent permitted pursuant to Section 9.13
hereof. Without limitation of the foregoing, none of the Company, any of its
Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any

circumstances shall the Parent Termination Fee be payable more than once.

  

  

(c) Subject to the Company's right to seek specific performance of the Equity
Commitment Letter pursuant to and to the extent permitted by Section 9.13(a),
in no event shall the Company or its Affiliates seek or permit to be sought on
behalf of the Company any damages or any other recovery, judgment or damages
of any kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, from any
member of the Parent Group other than Parent or, with respect to the Limited
Guarantee, the Fund, in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions.
The Company acknowledges and agrees that it has no right of recovery against,
and no personal liability shall attach to, any member of the Parent Group
(other than Parent to the extent provided in this Agreement or the Fund to the
extent provided in the Limited Guarantee or, subject to Section 9.13 of this
Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter), through Parent or otherwise, whether
by or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or
limited liability company veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of
Parent against the Fund or any other member of the Parent Group, by the
enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable Proceeding, by
virtue of any applicable Law, or otherwise, except for its rights to recover
from the Fund (but not any other member of the Parent Group (including any
general partner or managing member)) under and to the extent provided in the
Limited Guarantee or, subject to Section 9.13 of this Agreement, the Equity
Commitment Letter, and subject to the other limitations described therein. The
Company acknowledges that both Parent and Merger Sub are newly-formed
companies and do not have any material assets except in connection with this
Agreement or the Financing Commitments as expressly set forth herein and
therein.

  

  

Section 8.5. Certain Acknowledgement. Each party hereto acknowledges that (i)
the agreements contained in Section 8.3 and Section 8.4 are an integral part
of the Transactions, (ii) the damages resulting from termination of this
Agreement under circumstances where a Termination Fee, Expense Reimbursement
or Parent Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate
calculation and therefore, the amounts payable pursuant to Section 8.3 or
Section 8.4 are not a penalty but rather constitute liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate Parent or the Company, as the case may
be, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, and (iii) without the
agreements contained in Section 8.3 and Section 8.4, the parties would not
have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to
promptly pay any amount due pursuant to Section 8.3 or if Parent fails to
promptly pay any amount due pursuant to Section 8.4 and, in order to obtain
such payment, Parent or the Company, as the case may be, commences a suit that
results in a judgment against the other party for the amount set forth in
Section 8.3 or Section 8.4 or any portion thereof, the Company shall pay to
Parent, or Parent shall pay to the Company, as the case may be, all costs and
expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by the prevailing party and its
Affiliates in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount
of such amount or portion thereof at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect
on the date such payment was required to be made through the date of payment.

taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors at any time prior
to the Effective Time; provided, however, that after the adoption of this
Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, no amendment, modification or

Section 9.5. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and
shall become effective when each party has received counterparts signed by
each of the other parties, it being understood and agreed that delivery of a
signed counterpart of this Agreement by facsimile transmission or by email
shall constitute valid and sufficient delivery thereof.

  

  

Section 9.6. Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement
(including the documents and the instruments referred to herein) and the
Confidentiality Agreement: (i) constitute the entire agreement and supersede
all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the
parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, and (ii) are not
intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies whatsoever, except (x) if the Effective Time occurs, (A) with respect
to the right to receive Merger Consideration in respect of their Shares,
former stockholders of the Company and (B) with respect to Section 6.7 (which
shall inure to, and may be enforced by, the Persons benefiting therefrom as
intended third party beneficiaries thereof), (y) the indemnified parties
pursuant to Section 6.9(b) (who are intended third party beneficiaries
thereunder), and (z) each of the Debt Financing Sources shall be express third
party beneficiaries and shall be able to enforce the agreements contained in
Sections 8.3(b), 8.4(b), 9.1, 9.6(B)(z), 9.8 and 9.12(b) hereof and none of
the foregoing sections may be modified, amended, waived or terminated without
the prior written consent of the Debt Financing Sources in any manner that is
materially adverse in any respect to any of the Debt Financing Sources. In any
successful Proceeding to enforce any provision of this Agreement referred to
in clauses (x), (y) or (z) of the preceding sentence, and without limiting any
other remedies, each third party beneficiary commencing or participating in
such Proceeding shall be entitled to recover from Parent all costs and
reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by it in connection therewith. In some
instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent
an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular
matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

  

  

Section 9.7. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority
to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect and shall in no
way be affected, impaired or invalidated. Upon such determination that any
term, provision, covenant or restriction is invalid, illegal, void,
unenforceable or against regulatory policy, the parties hereto shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties hereto as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the Transactions are consummated as originally contemplated to the
greatest extent possible.

  

  

Section 9.8. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware that apply to agreements
made and performed

entirely within the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflicts of laws
provisions thereof or of any other jurisdiction.

  

  

Section 9.9. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned by any of the parties
hereto, in whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise),
without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto; provided,
however, that prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Company's
stockholders, Parent and Merger Sub may assign this Agreement (in whole but
not in part) to Parent or any of its Affiliates; provided, further, that (i)
no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub from their respective
obligations hereunder or affect the Limited Guarantee and (ii) no such
assignment shall be permitted hereunder without the prior written consent of
the Company if such assignment would be reasonably likely to materially delay
the termination of applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment in violation of the provisions
of this Agreement shall be null and void ab initio.

  

  

Section 9.10. Schedules.

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, a
disclosure set forth under one Section of a Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed to be disclosed in any other Section or Sections of such Disclosure
Schedule to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from a reading of such
disclosure that it is relevant or applicable to such other Section(s);
provided, however, that no disclosure in any section or subsection of the
Company Disclosure Schedule shall qualify or be deemed to qualify the
representations and warranties set forth in the first sentence of Section 4.6
of the Agreement or constitute an exception to the covenants in Section 6.1 of
the Agreement, unless such disclosure is specifically set forth in, or cross-
referenced in, Section 4.6 and Section 6.1, respectively, of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. Cross-references have been added for convenience and do
not waive or diminish the Company's rights. It is understood and agreed that
(i) nothing in any Disclosure Schedule is intended to broaden the scope of any
representation or warranty of any party contained in this Agreement and (ii)
the fact that any information is disclosed in a Disclosure Schedule shall not
be construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this
Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, the information set forth in a
Disclosure Schedule, and the dollar thresholds set forth in this Agreement,
shall not be used as a basis for interpreting the terms "material" or "Company
Material Adverse Effect" or other similar terms in this Agreement.

  

  

(b) The inclusion of, or the reference to, any item within any particular
Section of a Disclosure Schedule does not constitute an admission by Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company that such item meets any or all of the criteria set
forth in the Agreement for inclusion in such Section. The disclosure of any
matter in any Section of a Disclosure Schedule shall expressly not be deemed
to constitute a waiver by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company of any attorney-
client privilege, any protection afforded by the work-product doctrine or any
similar privileges and protections. Nothing disclosed in a Disclosure Schedule
constitutes an admission of liability or obligation of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or is an admission against the interest of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

69  

  

 

Back

 

 

   
 

  

Subsidiaries. All section headings are inserted for convenience of reference
only and will not affect the meaning or interpretation of the Disclosure
Schedules.

  

  

Section 9.11. Expenses. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement,
whether or not the Merger is consummated, all fees, costs and expenses
incurred by any party to this Agreement or on its behalf in connection with
this Agreement and the Transactions expressly contemplated by this Agreement
shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses; provided, that (i) Parent
shall pay all filing fees for the filings required under the HSR Act and (ii)
the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the filing, printing and
mailing of the Proxy Statement (including any SEC filing fees) shall be borne
equally by the Company and Parent.

  

  

Section 9.12. Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers.

  

  

(a) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub irrevocably agrees that any
Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
Transactions shall be brought and determined in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware or, if exclusive jurisdiction over the matter is vested in
the federal courts, any court of the United States located in the State of
Delaware (and each such party shall not bring any Proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions in any court other than
the aforesaid courts), and each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby
irrevocably submits with regard to any such Proceeding for itself and in
respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as
a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any such Proceeding, (i) any claim
that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named
courts for any reason other than the failure to lawfully serve process, (ii)
that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of such court or
from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of
notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of
judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and (iii) that (x) such
Proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (y) the
venue of such Proceeding is improper and (z) this Agreement, the Transactions
or the subject matter hereof or thereof, may not be enforced in or by such
courts.

  

  

(b) Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that any controversy which may
arise under this Agreement is likely to involve complicated and difficult
issues and, therefore, each party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally
waives any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any Proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions
(including against any Debt Financing Source in connection with the Debt
Commitment Letters). Each party hereto certifies and acknowledges that (i) no
representative of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise,
that such other party would not seek to enforce the foregoing waiver in the
event of any such Proceeding, (ii) such party has considered the implications
of this waiver, (iii) such party makes this waiver voluntarily, and (iv) such
party has been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things,
the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 9.12(b). No party
hereto, nor any of its Affiliates, will bring, or support the bringing of, any
claim, whether at law or in equity, whether in tort or otherwise, against any
Debt Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letters or the performance
thereof, anywhere other than in any

federal or state court located in the State of New York, Borough of Manhattan,
but only if such Debt Financing Source has consented to jurisdiction and venue
therein.

  

  

(c) For purposes of the proviso to Section 8.2, each party agrees that the
prevailing party shall be entitled to reimbursement of all costs and expenses
including without limitation, all attorney's fees, in connection with any
Proceeding arising out of or relating to a willful breach of this Agreement on
the part of the other party. Such costs and expenses shall be deemed to be
damages for purposes of the proviso to Section 8.2.

  

  

Section 9.13. Specific Performance.

  

  

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that, prior to the termination of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at
law or in equity. Each of the parties hereto (i) agrees that it shall not
oppose the granting of any such relief; (ii) hereby irrevocably waives any
requirement for the security or posting of any bond in connection with any
such relief (it is understood that clause (i) of this sentence is not intended
to, and shall not, preclude any party hereto from litigating on the merits the
substantive claim to which such remedy relates); and (iii) agrees that the
prevailing party shall be entitled to reimbursement of all costs and expenses
including without limitation, all attorney's fees; provided, however, that it
is explicitly agreed that the right of the Company to seek an injunction,
specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection with (x)
enforcing the Fund's obligations under the Equity Commitment Letter and
Parent's obligation to enforce the Equity Commitment Letter shall be subject
to the requirements that (i) all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1
and Section 7.2 (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied at the Closing) are satisfied or waived in accordance with this
Agreement, (ii) the Debt Financing (including any alternate financing) has
been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded
at the Closing, in each case at the maximum amount of the term loan facility
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters, (iii) at the time the Company
first seeks to exercise such remedy, the Company has Immediately Available
Cash in an amount not less than the Minimum Cash Amount and (iv) the Company
has irrevocably confirmed in writing that if specific performance is granted
and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then it would take
such actions required of it by this Agreement to cause the Closing to occur
and (y) causing Parent and Merger Sub to enforce the terms of the Debt
Commitment Letters (or the alternate financing commitments or Definitive
Financing Agreement(s)), including seeking enforcement of the Debt Commitment
Letters through the commencement of one or more lawsuits against the sources
of Debt Financing upon reasonable request by the Company, shall be subject to
the requirements that (i) all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and
Section 7.2 (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied at the Closing) are satisfied or waived in accordance with this
Agreement, (ii) the conditions to the consummation of the financing provided
by the Debt Commitment Letters (other than those conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied in a manner that
would require the Debt Financing Sources to fund the maximum amount of the
term loan facility contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters, (iii) at the
time the Company first seeks to exercise such remedy,

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

71  

  

 

Back

 

 

   
 

  

the Company has Immediately Available Cash in an amount not less than the
Minimum Cash Amount and (iv) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing
that if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt
Financing are funded, then it would take such actions required of it by this
Agreement to cause the Closing to occur.

  

  

(b) The parties hereto further agree that nothing set forth in this Agreement
shall require any party hereto to institute any Proceeding for specific
performance under this Section 9.13 as a condition to exercising any
termination right under Article VIII.

  

  

Section 9.14. Construction of Agreement.

  

  

(a) The terms and provisions of this Agreement represent the results of
negotiations among the parties hereto, each of which has been represented by
counsel of its own choosing, and none of which has acted under duress or
compulsion, whether legal, economic or otherwise. Accordingly, the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted and construed in accordance
with their usual and customary meanings, and each of the parties hereto hereby
waives the application in connection with the interpretation and construction
of this Agreement of any Law to the effect that ambiguous or conflicting terms
or provisions contained in this Agreement shall be interpreted or construed
against the party whose attorney prepared the executed draft or any earlier
draft of this Agreement.

  

  

(b) All references in this Agreement to Sections, Articles and Schedules
without further specification are to Sections and Articles of, and Schedules
to, this Agreement.

  

  

(c) The Table of Contents and the captions in this Agreement are for
convenience only and shall not in any way affect the meaning, interpretation
or construction of any provisions of this Agreement.

  

  

(d) Unless the context otherwise requires, "or" is not exclusive.

  

  

(e) Unless the context otherwise requires, "including" means "including but
not limited to".

  

  

(f) The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular
as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as the
feminine and neuter genders of such term.

  

  

(g) Time is of the essence in the performance of the parties' respective
obligations under this Agreement.
