Shareholders providing for the issuance of warrants (the "Warrants") to purchase
the  aggregate of 150,000  shares of PRI Common Stock,  at an exercise  price of

            (b)   ALLOCATION.  The Cash Purchase  Price, as such may be adjusted
pursuant  to Sections  2.2(d) and 2.4 hereof,  the  Warrants,  the Initial  ANDA
Payment (if any), the Second ANDA Payment (if any) and the Market Price Payments
(if any) shall be allocated among the Kali  Shareholders in the manner set forth

as such may be adjusted pursuant to Section 2.4(a) hereof based on the Estimated
Closing  Certificate,  shall be paid by PRI via  wire  transfer  of  immediately
available  funds to accounts of the Kali  Shareholders  designated in writing by
the Kali Shareholders' Rep prior to the Closing.

            (d)   ADJUSTMENT  TO CASH PURCHASE PRICE.  Following the Closing and
in accordance with Section 2.4 hereof,  the Cash Purchase Price shall be reduced
based on the amount by which any of $6,790,000,  representing  the cash and cash
equivalents  of Kali as of December 31, 2003 (the  "Execution  Cash"),  has been
expended by Kali from  December  31, 2003 until the Closing  Date outside of the
ordinary  course of business (other than the  expenditures  described in clauses
(ii) through (ix) below).  The amount,  if any, by which the Cash Purchase Price
shall be reduced (the  "Reduction  Amount") shall be the amount  remaining after

                  (i) all cash and cash  equivalents  of Kali as of the  Closing
            Date;

            Closing Date by Kali in connection with the New Hires;

                  (iii) all expenditures made from December 31, 2003 through the
            Closing  Date by Kali  in  connection  with  the  Permitted  Capital
            Expenditures;

                  (iv) all expenditures  made from December 31, 2003 through the
            Closing  Date  by  Kali  in  connection  with  purchase  orders  for
            equipment in fiscal year 2003 but for which payment has not yet been
            made (which amount shall not exceed $500,000);

                  (v) all  reasonable  expenditures  made from December 31, 2003
            through the Closing Date by Kali to professional advisors (including
            attorneys,  accountants and  environmental  consultants)  engaged or
            retained by Kali and/or the Kali Shareholders in connection with (I)
            the  negotiation,  execution and delivery of this  Agreement and the
            other  agreements and documents  contemplated  hereby and the Letter
            Agreement or (II) compliance with the HSR Act, ISRA or any other Law
            pursuant to which Kali or any Kali Shareholder is required to obtain
            a waiver, consent, approval,  authorization or release in connection
            herewith,  up  to  $400,000  (collectively,  the  "Kali  Transaction
            Costs");

                                       14
<PAGE>

                  (vi) the  provision of a loan by Kali to VGS, in the aggregate
            principal amount of $553,189 (the "Post-Effective Date VGS Loan");

                  (vii) the Separator Expenses;

                  (viii) the  purchase of certain  drugs from Barr  Laboratories
            for an estimated aggregate purchase price of $450,000,  the terms of
            which are being negotiated;

                  (ix) the  payment of unpaid  interest  on the  Perrigo  credit
            facility,  which  amount,  as of the  date of its  payment,  equaled
            $68,755.56; and

                  (x) all other expenditures made from December 31, 2003 through
            the  Closing  Date by Kali for  obligations  incurred by Kali in the
            ordinary course of business.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Reduction Amount, as determined above, shall not
be below zero and shall include and be increased by (i) the aggregate  amount of
any payments  made after  December 31, 2003 but prior to the Closing Date to the
Kali  Shareholders  on  account  of  their  respective  Accumulated  Adjustments
Accounts (the "AAA Payments"),  (ii) any payments made to any employees of Kali,
contingent on the Closing,  that are outside the ordinary  course of business of
Kali or pursuant to any agreement existing prior to the Effective Date (all such
payments to employees,  the "Closing Bonuses"),  (iii) all payments of rent (and
related amounts) since December 31, 2003 by Kali to VGS for the Facility and the
warehouse  owned by VGS and  located  in  Piscataway,  New  Jersey  and (iv) the
payment to the Kali  Shareholders of  distributions  to cover Tax liabilities in
the aggregate  amount of $90,000,  as set forth in Items 4-7 of Schedule  3.9(d)
hereto.  Subject to the  procedures  set forth in Section 2.4  hereof,  the Cash
Purchase Price shall be reduced $1.00 for each $1.00 of the Reduction Amount, as
increased above.

            (e)   ANDA PAYMENTS; MARKET PRICE PAYMENTS. The Initial ANDA Payment
shall be paid by wire transfer to the Kali Shareholders within ten (10) Business
Days of, and subject to, the  achievement  of the Initial  ANDA  Threshold.  The
Second  ANDA  Payment  (if  any)  shall  be paid by wire  transfer  to the  Kali
Shareholders  within ten (10) Business Days of, and subject to, the satisfaction
of the Second ANDA Threshold.  Any Market Price Payment(s) shall be paid by wire
transfer to the Kali Shareholders  within ten (10) Business Days of, and subject
to, the  achievement of the applicable  Market Value  condition(s)  set forth in
Section 2.2(a)(iv) hereof.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  neither the Initial
ANDA Payment nor the Second ANDA Payment nor any Market Price  Payments shall be
due and payable  if, at or prior to the time that the  applicable  condition  to
such payment shall have otherwise been achieved or satisfied,  a material breach
under Sections 6.4, 6.5, 6.9 or 6.10 hereof shall have occurred.

            (f)   RESERVATION OF RIGHTS. Subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 11 hereof,  PRI shall retain all rights and remedies with respect to any
breach(es)  of  any  representation(s)  and  warranty(ies)   contained  in  this
Agreement  by  the  Kali  Shareholders,  notwithstanding  the  existence  of any
reduction of the Cash Purchase Price effected in accordance with Sections 2.2(d)
and 2.4 hereof.

            (b)   PRI'S  DELIVERY OF OTHER AGREEMENTS.  Subject to the terms and
conditions  hereof,  and in  addition  to the  deliveries  set forth in  Section

PRI with the IRS promptly after the Closing.


            2.4.  PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT.
                  --------------------------

            (a)   On or prior to the Closing  Date,  the Kali  Shareholders  and
Kali shall deliver to PRI a certificate of the Chief  Executive  Officer of Kali
(the "Estimated  Closing  Certificate")  accurately  reflecting (on an estimated
basis) all cash  expenditures and  distributions  made by Kali from December 31,
2003  through the Closing  Date and the  estimated  Reduction  Amount.  The Cash
Purchase  Price  payable at the  Closing  shall be reduced  in  accordance  with
Section 2.2(d)  hereof,  based on the estimated  determination  of the Reduction
Amount  prior to the  Closing,  and the  portion  of such  Cash  Purchase  Price
allocable  to each Kali  Shareholder  shall be so reduced as agreed  upon by the
Kali Shareholders.

            (b)   Within  sixty  (60) days  after the  Closing  Date,  PRI shall
deliver to the Kali  Shareholders'  Rep (i) a certificate of the Chief Financial
Officer  of  PRI  (the  "Closing  Certificate")  setting  forth  such  Officer's
determination  of the  Reduction  Amount  and (ii) a balance  sheet of Kali (the


                                       16
<PAGE>

"Closing  Balance Sheet"),  which shall be audited by PRI's regular  independent
auditors and prepared in accordance with GAAP and shall fairly  present,  in all
material respects, the financial position of Kali as of the Closing Date.

            (c)   The Kali Shareholders' Rep shall have sixty (60) days from the
date on which the Closing  Certificate  shall have been  delivered by PRI to the
Kali Shareholders' Rep to raise any objection(s) to the Closing Certificate, but
only as it relates to the  determination of the Reduction Amount, by delivery of
written notice to PRI setting forth such  objection(s) in reasonable detail (the
"Disputed Items"). In the event that the Kali Shareholders' Rep shall fail to so
deliver such written objection(s) with respect to the Closing Certificate within
such sixty- (60) day period,  then the Closing Certificate shall be deemed final
for purposes of this Section 2.4. In the event that any such objection(s) are so
delivered,  the  Closing  Certificate  shall be deemed not final and PRI and the
Kali  Shareholders'  Rep shall attempt,  in good faith,  to resolve the Disputed
Items and,  if they are  unable to  resolve  all of the  Disputed  Items  within
fifteen (15)  Business Days of delivery of such notice,  shall,  within ten (10)
Business Days thereafter (or such earlier date as mutually agreed),  designate a
nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, mutually agreeable
to PRI and the Kali  Shareholders'  Rep (the  "Accountant  Arbitrator").  In the
event  that  PRI and the  Kali  Shareholders'  Rep are  unable  to  agree on the
Accountant  Arbitrator within such ten- (10) Business Day period, the Accountant
Arbitrator shall be designated jointly by the independent accountants of PRI and
the Kali Shareholders' Rep (which may be Kali's former independent  accountants)
within ten (10)  Business  Days  thereafter.  The  Accountant  Arbitrator  shall
resolve all remaining  Disputed Items in accordance  herewith within twenty (20)
Business  Days  from  the  date  of its  designation.  In  connection  with  the
foregoing,  the Accountant  Arbitrator  shall be instructed  to, and shall,  (i)
limit  its  determination(s)  only  to the  remaining  Disputed  Items  and  the
determination of the Reduction Amount, (ii) make its determination(s) as to each
remaining  Disputed Item based upon Section 2.2(d) hereof and (iii) not assign a
value to any  remaining  Disputed  Item  greater  than the higher value for such
Disputed Item claimed by either PRI or the Kali  Shareholders'  Rep or less than
the lower  value  for such  Disputed  Item  claimed  by  either  PRI or the Kali
Shareholders'  Rep. All  determinations  by the Accountant  Arbitrator  shall be
final  and  binding  upon PRI and the Kali  Shareholders  for  purposes  of this
Section 2.4. The fees and expenses of the Accountant  Arbitrator  shall borne by
PRI unless the Accountant Arbitrator shall provide otherwise.

            (d)   At such time as the Closing  Certificate shall become final in
accordance with Section 2.4(c) hereof, the Cash Purchase Price shall be adjusted
in accordance  with Section 2.2(d) hereof based on the Closing  Certificate,  as
finally determined pursuant to Section 2.4(c) hereof. In the event that the Cash
Purchase Price paid at the Closing  pursuant to Sections  2.2(a)(i) hereof shall
be more than the Cash Purchase Price as determined and adjusted pursuant to this
Section 2.4(d), the amount of such excess (which under no circumstances shall be
greater than the Execution Cash amount (x) less the cash and cash equivalents of
Kali as of the Closing  Date  (which  amount may not be below zero) plus (y) the
amounts actually paid by Kali with respect to the items described in clauses (i)
through (iv) of the final  paragraph of Section  2.2(d) hereof) shall be paid to
PRI by the Kali  Shareholders.  Any payment to be made  pursuant to this Section
2.4(d)  shall be made,  within  five (5)  Business  Days  from the date that the
Closing  Certificate is finally determined pursuant to Section 2.4(c) hereof, by
the Kali  Shareholders to PRI via wire transfer of immediately  available funds,
to an account of PRI  designated in writing to the Kali  Shareholders'  Rep. Any
amount  determined to be due under this Section  2.4(d),  in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Section 2.4, shall be subject to offset by the Kali


                                       17
<PAGE>

Shareholders against any amounts owing to any Kali Shareholder under Section 2.5
hereof.


            2.5   SECTION  338  MAKE-WHOLE  AMOUNT.  (a) If,  as a result of the
making  of the  Section  338(h)(10)  Election  and the  allocation  of the  Cash
Purchase  Price among the assets of Kali in accordance  with Section 7.4 hereof,
Kali realizes  ordinary income (rather than capital gains) on the deemed sale of
its assets that, in turn, passes-through to the Kali Shareholders, PRI shall pay
to the Kali Shareholders' Rep, for the benefit of the Kali Shareholders' Rep, in
his  capacity as a Kali  Shareholder,  and for the other Kali  Shareholders,  an
additional  amount (the "Additional  Amount"),  which Additional Amount shall be
determined as follows:  (i) the Cash Purchase Price shall be allocated among the
assets of Kali as provided in Section 7.4 hereof;  (ii) the  independent  public
accountants of PRI shall determine the gain realized by Kali with respect to its
Classes of Assets (as set forth in IRS Form 8883);  and (iii) the amount of such
gains that are treated for tax purposes as ordinary gains shall be multiplied by
twenty (20%) percent.

            (b)   In addition, PRI shall provide the Kali Shareholders' Rep with
sufficient funds (the "New Jersey Corporate Tax Reimbursement"), so as to enable
the Kali  Shareholders,  on  behalf  of  Kali,  to pay any New  Jersey  Business
Corporation  Tax imposed upon Kali resulting from the deemed sales of its assets
upon the making of the Section 338(h)(10)  Election,  which New Jersey Corporate
Tax Reimbursement  shall be calculated and determined by the independent  public
accountants  of PRI. The Parties  hereby agree that, in  determining  the amount
realized for purposes of computing the New Jersey  Corporate Tax  Reimbursement,
each of the Initial ANDA  Payment,  the Second ANDA Payment and the Market Price
Payments shall be valued at zero. PRI shall also reimburse the Kali Shareholders
for all transfer, real property transfer, sales, stamp, registration and similar
Taxes and fees  that  would not have  been  incurred  but for the  making of the
Section 338(h)(10) Elections (the "Transfer Tax Reimbursement").  The Additional
Amount,  the  New  Jersey  Corporate  Tax  Reimbursement  and the  Transfer  Tax
Reimbursement are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Gross-Up".

            (c)   PRI  shall  also  pay the Kali  Shareholders  an  amount  (the
"Second  Level  Gross-Up")  equal  to  twenty-five  (25%) of the  amount  of the
Gross-Up,  so as to make the Kali Shareholders  whole for any additional Federal
or New  Jersey  State  personal  income  taxes,  and to  reimburse  them for any
additional New Jersey Business Corporation Taxes,  resulting from the payment of
the Gross-Up. Both the Gross-Up and the Second Level Gross-Up shall be allocated
in accordance  with Section 7.4 hereof.  The Additional  Amount and the Transfer
Tax Reimbursement,  together with the Second Level Gross-Up  attributable to the
Additional Amount and the Transfer Tax Reimbursement, shall be payable by PRI to
the Kali Shareholders' Rep (on behalf of the Kali Shareholders)  within five (5)
Business Day following such time as the Closing  Certificate becomes final under
Section 2.4 hereof.  Although the  independent  public  accountants of PRI shall
calculate  the New Jersey  Corporate  Tax  Reimbursement  and the  Second  Level
Gross-Up  attributable thereto and present such calculations at such time as the
Closing  Certificate  becomes final in accordance  with Section 2.4 hereof,  PRI
shall not be required to pay to the Kali  Shareholders'  Rep, for the benefit of
the Kali  Shareholders'  Rep in his capacity as a Kali  Shareholder  and for the
other Kali  Shareholders,  the New Jersey  Corporate Tax  Reimbursement  and the
Second Level  Gross-Up  attributable  thereto until five (5) Business Days after
the Kali  Shareholders'  Rep has  presented to PRI a final New Jersey  corporate
income tax return for Kali,  as filed with the State of New Jersey,  showing the
payment  of all New  Jersey  corporate  income  taxes due for the  taxable  year

                                       18
<PAGE>

commencing on January 1, 2004 through the Closing Date  (including the amount of
the New Jersey  Corporate  Tax  Reimbursement),  and has  provided PRI with such
additional  documentation,  as PRI  shall  reasonably  request,  evidencing  the
payment by Kali of all New Jersey  corporate  income  taxes due for such taxable
year.

            (d)   PRI  shall have the right to offset  against the amount of any
Gross-Up or Second Level Gross-Up  payable to the Kali  Shareholders  under this
Section 2.5 the then  outstanding  principal amount and accrued interest thereon
of that  certain  secured  Promissory  Note dated as of the  Closing  Date to be
issued by VGS to Kali in the initial  principal  amount of $2,688,189  (the "VGS
Note"),  a copy of which is  attached  hereto as Exhibit D, as evidence of VGS's
indebtedness to Kali as of the Closing. The Kali Shareholders hereby agree that,
to the extent that PRI  exercises,  in its sole and  absolute  discretion,  such
right of offset at such  time(s) as the amount of any  Gross-Up or Second  Level
Gross-Up  would  otherwise be payable  under this Section 2.5, such offset shall
constitute payment of the Gross-Up and the Second Level Gross-Up at such time(s)
to the extent thereof.

possession of the property  described  under such Lease.  Kali is not in default
under any such Real Property  Lease. To the knowledge of Kali, Kali does not owe
any brokerage or leasing commission in respect of any Real Property Lease.

and the  operation  of Kali's  business  thereon (as  presently  conducted  as a
pharmaceutical  manufacturer  or  otherwise)  have been obtained and are in full
force  and  effect,  and  no  other  Permits,   Consents  or  variances  of  any
Governmental Authorities (whether Federal, state or local) are required for such
use, occupancy and operation thereof,  and no certificates of the local board of
fire underwriters (or other body exercising  similar functions) have been issued
or are required for any buildings or structures comprising the improvements with
respect to the Leased Real Property (the "Improvements").

            (d)   Except as set forth on SCHEDULE  3.17(d) hereto,  Kali has not
received  any  written  notice  from any  Federal,  state or local  Governmental
Authority or board of fire  underwriters  (or any other body exercising  similar

and all Improvements  (for their current or any contemplated  purpose)  violates
any zoning, safety, fire, seismic design, conservation,  parking,  architectural
barriers to the handicapped,  building or similar Law. Kali has not received any
written or oral notice from any Governmental or quasi-Governmental  Authority or
board of fire underwriters (or any other body exercising similar functions) with
respect to any portion of the Leased Real Property or any  Improvements  thereon
that (i) claims any material  defect or material  deficiency with respect to any
of the Leased Real  Property  or any  Improvements  thereon or (ii)  requires or
requests the performance of any material  repairs,  alterations or other work to
or in respect of any of the Leased Real Property.

            (e)   To the  knowledge  of Kali,  (i) no portion of the Leased Real
Property is subject to or affected  by any  special  assessment,  whether or not
there is presently a Lien thereon,  and (ii) no such assessment has been pending
or threatened.

            (f)   To the  knowledge of Kali,  there is no planned or  threatened
taking,  condemnation or expropriation proceeding for any public or quasi-public
purpose or use by a  Governmental  or  quasi-Governmental  Authority,  or by any
right of eminent domain, of all or any portion of the Leased Real Property.

            (g)   All public utilities  (including water, gas,  electric,  storm
and  sanitary  sewage,  and  telephone  utilities)  required  to operate  Kali's
business on the Leased Real  Property  (as  presently  conducted or as presently
contemplated  to be  conducted)  are  reasonably  available  to such Leased Real
Property,  and, to the knowledge of Kali, such utilities enter the boundaries of
such Leased  Real  Property  through  adjoining  public  streets,  easements  or
rights-of-way  of  record  in favor  of  Kali.  Such  public  utilities  are all
connected in accordance  with valid  Permits,  are all in  satisfactory  working

                                       31

order and repair and are reasonably adequate to service the operations of Kali's
business on the Leased  Real  Property as  currently  conducted  and permit full
compliance  with all  requirements  of applicable Law. Kali has not received any
written notice of any proposed,  planned or actual curtailment of service of any
utility  supplied to any portion of the Leased Real  Property.  Each Leased Real
Property is an independent unit that does not rely on any facilities  located on
any property not  included in such Leased Real  Property or any adjacent  Leased
Real  Property  to fulfill any  applicable  Laws or for the  furnishing  to such
Leased Real Property of any essential building systems or utilities,  other than
facilities  provided to such Leased Real Property  pursuant to one or more valid
easements.

including  all  amendments,   extensions  and  modifications  thereto,  and  all
subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreements, guarantees and similar
agreements relating to any of the Real Property Leases.

            (i)   The  Leased  Real  Property  and  the use  thereof  by Kali in
connection  with  the  conduct  of the Kali  Business  comply,  in all  material
respects, with all covenants, easements and restrictions of record affecting the
Leased Real Property.

Agreement,  the Warrant Agreement and the other agreements  contemplated  hereby
constitute (or will constitute  when executed  subsequent to the Effective Date)
valid and binding obligations of PRI, enforceable against PRI in accordance with
their  respective  terms,  except as such  enforcement  may be  affected  by the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.


            5.2.  NO  VIOLATION;  CONSENTS  AND  APPROVALS.  The  execution  and
delivery of this  Agreement,  the  Warrant  Agreement  and the other  agreements
contemplated  hereby and the  performance by PRI of its  obligations  under this
Agreement,  the Warrant  Agreement and such other agreements do not (or will not
when executed  subsequent to the Effective  Date) (i) conflict with or result in
any violation of any provision of the certificate of  incorporation or bylaws of
PRI; (ii) except in connection  with the HSR Act,  obtaining  ISRA Clearance and
any applicable  Federal or state  securities or "blue sky" Law filings,  require
the Consent of any Governmental Authority; or (iii) conflict with or violate, or

to which PRI is a party or by which PRI is otherwise bound.


            5.3.  INVESTMENT  INTENT. The Kali Shares to be acquired pursuant to
this Agreement will be acquired by PRI for investment and not with a view to the
distribution thereof in contravention of any applicable securities Laws.


            5.4.  LITIGATION.  There  are no  claims,  actions,  suits  or other
proceedings  pending or, to the  knowledge  of PRI,  threatened  against PRI in,
before  or  by  any   Governmental   Authority   relating  to  the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.


            5.5.  BROKERS.  Except pursuant to PRI's agreement with Bear Stearns
& Co.,  Inc.,  whose fees and  expenses  shall be paid  solely by it, PRI is not
party to any agreement,  arrangement or understanding  with any Person that will

<PAGE>

result in the obligation of PRI, Kali or any of the Kali Shareholders to pay any
finders' fee, brokerage  commission,  investment advisory fee or similar payment
in connection with the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement or the other
agreements contemplated hereby.


            5.6.  SECURITIES  LAW  FILINGS.  (a) During the one- (1) year period
immediately  preceding  the  Effective  Date,  PRI has timely filed all reports,
proxy statements, registration statements and documents that PRI was required to
file with the SEC under the  Securities  Act and the Exchange  Act, all of which
complied as to form in all material respects with all applicable requirements of
the  Securities  Act or the Exchange  Act, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations adopted  thereunder.  As of their respective filing dates, each such
report,  proxy  statement,  registration  statement  or other  document  did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements  made therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

            (b)   The  financial  statements of PRI contained in its most recent
filing with the SEC on Form 10-K fairly present,  in all material respects,  the
financial  position of PRI and its consolidated  subsidiaries and the results of
operations of PRI and its consolidated subsidiaries as at the end of and for the
fiscal year  covered  thereby.  Since the date of such Form 10-K,  there has not
been any material adverse change in the business,  assets or financial condition
of PRI and its consolidated subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that would adversely
affect PRI's ability to perform its obligations hereunder.

Kali's  or the Kali  Shareholders'  representations,  warranties,  covenants  or
agreements contained herein.

            6.3   COMMERCIALLY  REASONABLE EFFORTS;  ANTI-TRUST FILINGS; FURTHER

            (b)   Each  of the Parties shall take any and all  reasonable  steps

this  Agreement  so as to  enable  the  consummation  of  such  transactions  as
expeditiously as possible. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the

            6.4.  NON-COMPETITION.
                  ----------------

            (a)   In  consideration of PRI's payment of the Purchase Price, each
of the Kali Shareholders and its Affiliates and Associates shall not:

                  (i) directly or  indirectly,  for a period  commencing  on the
Closing  Date and  ending  thirty  (30)  months  after  the  Closing  Date  (the
"Non-Competition  Period"), by ownership of securities or otherwise (except as a
holder of less than five (5%) percent of any class of equity  securities  of any
other Person, which class of securities shall have been registered under Section
12 of the Exchange  Act),  manage,  control,  finance,  consult with,  engage or
participate in any manner in any business or activity (collectively,  "Compete")
anywhere in the world that is competitive  with any portion of the Kali Business
or any other business of PRI (or any of its Affiliates); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
in respect of Mr. Subramanian, the Non-Competition Period shall terminate on the
later of (A) the termination or expiration of Mr. Subramanian's  employment with
Par pursuant to the Subramanian  Employment Agreement and (B) thirty (30) months
after the Closing  Date  (unless Mr.  Subramanian's  employment  shall have been
terminated  pursuant to Sections  3.2.4 or 3.2.5 of the  Subramanian  Employment
Agreement), in which case the Non-Competition Period shall terminate twenty-four
(24) months after the Closing Date); and

                  (ii)  directly  or  indirectly,  at any time after the Closing
Date, Compete anywhere in the world with or in respect of (A) any products as to
which PRI (or any of its Affiliates),  or any co-development  partner of PRI (or
any of its Affiliates),  shall have filed  (irrespective of whether accepted for
filing  by  the  FDA)  in  good  faith  an  ANDA  or  NDA  (including  505(b)(2)
Applications)  with the FDA,  in each case,  with  respect to a drug  technology
substantially  developed  by  PRI  (or  any  of  its  Affiliates),   as  of  the
Determination  Date;  (B) any products  that PRI (or any of its  Affiliates)  is
manufacturing,  supplying, distributing or selling, either by itself or together
with any other Person  (including  any product  marketed  through any authorized

                                       41
<PAGE>

generic  product  agreement),  as of the Closing Date; (C) any products that PRI
(or  any of its  Affiliates)  shall  manufacture  or  shall  have  developed  or
co-developed and either supply, distribute or sell, either by itself or together
with any Person,  at any time from the  Effective  Date through the later of the
Subramanian  Termination  Date and date  that is  thirty  (30)  months  from the
Closing Date; or (D) any products that are marketed or  distributed  through any
brand authorized  generic product  agreement at any time from the Effective Date
through the later of the  Subramanian  Termination  Date and date that is thirty
(30) months from the Closing Date. As used herein, the term "Determination Date"
shall mean the later of (x) forty-two  (42) months from the Closing Date and (y)
twelve  (12)  months  from  the  Subramanian  Termination  Date,  other  than  a
termination  pursuant to Sections 3.2.4 or 3.2.5 of the  Subramanian  Employment
Agreement, in which case the Determination Date shall be twelve (12) months from
the date of such termination (irrespective of clause (x) above). Notwithstanding
the foregoing,  with respect to the products  described in clause (A) above,  if
the Subramanian Termination Date is on or after the thirtieth (30th) month after
the Closing  Date or Mr.  Subramanian's  employment  is  terminated  pursuant to
Sections 3.2.4 or 3.2.5 of the Subramanian  Employment  Agreement,  this Section
6.4(a)(ii) shall apply to all ANDAs or NDAs (including  505(b)(2)  Applications)
filed  before  such  Subramanian  Termination  Date and after  such  Subramanian
Termination Date only as to which material  development efforts relating to such
product shall have occurred prior to the Subramanian Termination Date.

                  PRI (or Par, on PRI's behalf) shall deliver to Mr. Subramanian
(i) at the Closing a then current  list of all products  included in clauses (A)
through  (D)  above,  including  a list of ANDAs and NDAs  (including  505(b)(2)
Applications)  that PRI (or any of its  Affiliates) has filed  (irrespective  of
whether  accepted for filing by the FDA),  and then  presently  expects to file,
with the FDA within  twelve (12)  months of  delivery of the list (the  "Product
List") and (ii) an update of the Product List monthly thereafter during the term
of Mr.  Subramanian's  employment  with Par or PRI and  (iii) a  proposed  final
Product List within  twenty (20) Business  Days of the  Subramanian  Termination
Date (the "Proposed  Definitive Product List"). In addition,  within twenty (20)
Business  Days of the  Determination  Date,  PRI (or Par, on PRI's behalf) shall
provide to Mr. Subramanian an updated version of the Proposed Definitive Product
List, which revised list shall be the definitive  Product List setting forth the
products with which the Kali  Shareholders  shall not Compete in accordance with
Section 6.4(a)(ii) hereof (the "Definitive  Product List"). For the avoidance of
doubt, if the Subramanian  Termination  Date is on or after the thirtieth (30th)
month after the  Closing  Date or Mr.  Subramanian's  employment  is  terminated
pursuant to Sections 3.2.4 or 3.2.5 of the Subramanian Employment Agreement, the
Definitive  Product  List shall not contain any  products  (x) that were not set
forth on the  Proposed  Definitive  Product List and (y) as to which no material
development  efforts occurred prior to the Subramanian  Termination  Date. PRI's
right to enforce this Section  6.4(a)(ii) shall be conditioned upon its delivery
to Mr.  Subramanian  of  both  the  Proposed  Definitive  Product  List  and the
Definitive  Product List. If requested by the Kali Shareholders' Rep in writing,
PRI (or Par, on PRI's  behalf)  shall provide  reasonably  satisfactory  written
evidence  (x) of the  filing  of each  ANDA  or NDA  with  the FDA and (y)  that
material  development efforts shall have been performed prior to the Subramanian
Termination  Date,  in each case,  with respect to each product set forth on the
Definitive Product List and, if reasonably satisfactory written evidence of such
filing is not  delivered  to Mr.  Subramanian  within  thirty  (30) days of such
request,  such product shall be deemed deleted from the Definitive Product List.
This Section 6.4(a)(ii) shall not be violated by any Kali Shareholder (or any of
their respective  Affiliates and Associates)  owning less than five (5%) percent


                                       42
<PAGE>

of any class of equity securities of any other Person (which class of securities
shall have been registered  under Section 12 of the Exchange Act), that Competes
with any of the products on the Product List.

            (b)   The  Kali   Shareholders   acknowledge  that  a  violation  or
threatened  violation of any of the provisions of this Section 6.4,  Section 6.9
or  Section  6.10  hereof  may  result  in PRI  and  its  Affiliates  sustaining
irreparable harm, which result may not be adequately redressed by the payment of
damages to PRI and its  Affiliates  and,  therefore,  in  addition  to any other
remedies that PRI and its Affiliates may have under this Agreement or otherwise,
PRI and its  Affiliates  shall be  entitled  to apply to any court of  competent
jurisdiction,  at law or in equity,  for an  injunction,  without  providing any
bond,  enjoining or restraining any such violation,  including the rescission of
any violative  transaction to the extent  permissible  under applicable Law. If,
for  any  reason,  a court  of  competent  jurisdiction  shall  find  any of the
provisions of this Section 6.4, Section 6.9 or Section 6.10 hereof  unreasonable
in duration,  geographic scope or otherwise,  the prohibitions  contained herein
shall be restricted to such time and geographic area as such court determines to
be  reasonable  and that  reflect  the  intention  of the Parties to the fullest
extent  permissible.  Such  restriction  shall  apply  only with  respect to the
operation  of such  provisions  in the  particular  jurisdiction  in which  such
adjudication is made.

            (c)   The  Parties  hereby  acknowledge  that this  Section  6.4 and
Sections 6.5, 6.9 and 6.10 hereof are essential terms of this Agreement.


            6.5.  BIOSTUDIES  PRODUCTION.  If,  for any  reason,  following  the
Closing, Kali shall fail to complete a Biostudy  (irrespective of the outcome of
any such Biostudy) in respect of at least one (1) new product during each of the
four  successive six- (6) month periods  immediately  following the Closing Date
(PROVIDED,  that, with respect to the last of such six- (6) month periods,  Kali
must  complete or be actively  conducting  a Biostudy  during the last three (3)
months of such period), any such failure (the "Failure to Complete  Biostudies")
shall constitute a material breach by the Kali Shareholders of this Agreement.
 Upon such a breach, the Kali Shareholders shall be jointly and severally liable
to PRI for their PRO RATA share of liquidated  damages in an aggregate amount of
$30,000,000 (the "Disruption  Damages").  Each Kali Shareholder's PRO RATA share
of the  Disruption  Damages shall be equal to such Kali  Shareholder's  PRO RATA
share of the Cash Purchase Price received by such Kali  Shareholder  pursuant to
Section 2.2(c) hereof.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the Kali  Shareholders
shall not be liable for  non-performance of Kali's obligations  pursuant to this
Section 6.5 if and to the extent any such  non-performance  is directly due to a
Force Majeure Event or a Business  Interruption Event. Such non-performance will
be excused for as long (but only for as long) as such event shall be continuing;
PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that the Kali  Shareholders'  Rep shall give prompt written
notice to PRI of the Force Majeure Event or Business Interruption Event. PRI and
the Kali  Shareholders' Rep shall exercise  commercially  reasonable  efforts to
eliminate the Force Majeure Event or Business  Interruption  Event and to resume
performance  of  Kali's  affected  obligations  as  soon  as  practicable.   The
occurrence  of any Force  Majeure  Event or Business  Interruption  Event in any
particular  six (6)-month  period shall not excuse or diminish the obligation of
Kali to  complete a  Biostudy  in any other  periods  or the Kali  Shareholders'
obligations  hereunder.  PRI and the Kali  Shareholders  hereby  agree  that the
Disruption Damages are reasonable and shall not constitute a penalty. Payment of
the Disruption Damages shall be subject to Sections 10.3(b) and (c) hereof. Each
of the Kali  Shareholders  hereby  acknowledges  and agrees to the provisions of


                                       43
<PAGE>

this  Section 6.5 and further  acknowledges  that such Kali  Shareholder  may be
required to pay a portion of the damages  provided  herein  notwithstanding  the
fact that he, she or it may or may not have been  involved  with the  Failure to
Complete  Biostudies.  The Disruption Damages payable hereunder shall not affect
or diminish the provisions of the last sentence of Section 2.2(e) hereof.


            6.6.  PUBLIC  ANNOUNCEMENTS.  Except as reasonably  determined to be
required  by  applicable  Law or the  rules of any  applicable  stock  exchange,
neither PRI or Kali nor the Kali  Shareholders  shall, nor shall they permit any
of their  respective  Affiliates to, make any public  announcement in respect of
this Agreement,  the other  agreements  contemplated  hereby or the transactions
contemplated  hereby or thereby,  without the prior written consent of the other
Party(ies) hereto (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

            6.7.  EMPLOYEES.   Kali  and  Mr.  Subramanian  shall,   subject  to
applicable Law,  support all efforts of PRI to retain all employees of Kali whom
PRI  shall  identify  to Kali  that it  desires  to  employ  to  continue  their
employment with Kali (the  "Continuing  Employees").  PRI shall use commercially
reasonable  efforts to  provide  the  Continuing  Employees  with such  employee
benefit plans as are provided  generally to employees of PRI and its  Affiliates
who have equivalent  responsibilities,  salaries and years of service, including
any  participation  in applicable  employee  incentive equity ownership or stock
option plans.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  the Continuing  Employees are not
intended to, and shall not, be  third-party  beneficiaries  of this or any other
provision of this Agreement.


            6.8.  RESIGNATIONS;  REVOCATIONS; RELEASES. On or before the Closing
Date,  Kali shall cause to be delivered to PRI (i) duly  executed  resignations,
effective immediately after the Closing, of those officers and directors of Kali
as shall be  requested  by PRI in a writing  delivered  to Kali on or before the
second  (2nd)  Business  Day  prior  to the  Closing;  and  (ii)  duly  executed
revocations,  effective immediately after the Closing, of the Corporate Accounts
and Powers. Additionally,  each of the Kali Shareholders,  on its own behalf and
on behalf of any of its Affiliates and Associates,  hereby  irrevocably  waives,
and  transfers to PRI,  subject to and effective  upon the Closing,  any and all
claims, rights or interests that such Kali Shareholder has or may have in, to or
in respect of the matters  referred  to in clauses  (i) through  (iv) of Section
3.26 hereof.


            6.9.  CONFIDENTIALITY.  From and after the Closing Date, each of the
Kali Shareholders shall treat and hold as confidential all information  relating
to the assets, operations and condition of Kali. Without limiting the foregoing,
each of the Kali Shareholders  shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates
not to, disclose any such confidential information to any Person (except, as may
be necessary, to such Person's auditors, counsel or other professional advisors)
or make use of or exploit any such confidential information for its own purposes
or for the benefit of any other  Person  (other than Kali or PRI).  In the event
that any of the Kali  Shareholders or their  Affiliates are required (by oral or
written  request  for   information  or  documents  in  any  legal   proceeding,
interrogatory,  subpoena,  civil investigative  demand or similar process, or by
applicable Law) to disclose any such  confidential  information,  then such Kali
Shareholder  shall  promptly  notify PRI of the  requirement so that PRI, at its
expense, may seek an appropriate  protective order or waive compliance with this
Section  6.9.  If, in the absence of a  protective  order or receipt of a waiver
hereunder,  a Kali  Shareholder  or its  Affiliate is, on the advice of counsel,

                                       44
<PAGE>

compelled to disclose such  confidential  information,  the Kali Shareholder (or
such Affiliate) may so disclose the confidential information; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that the Kali  Shareholder or such  Affiliate,  as the case may be, will use all
reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will
be afforded to such confidential information. The provisions of this Section 6.9
shall not be deemed to  prohibit  the  disclosure  by the Kali  Shareholders  of
confidential  information  relating to the  operations or affairs of Kali to the
extent  reasonably and directly required (i) to prepare or complete any required
Tax  Returns or  financial  statements,  (ii) in  connection  with any  reports,
statements,  testimony audits or other  proceedings  before or by a Governmental
Authority,  (iii) to comply with any applicable  Laws,  (iv) to defend any suit,
claim or other litigation,  or in response to any summons or subpoena, or (v) to
provide  services to PRI in accordance  with the terms of this  Agreement or any
other agreement  contemplated  hereby.  The provisions of this Section 6.9 shall
not apply to information that is or becomes (x) publicly available other than as
a result of a disclosure by any of the Kali  Shareholders  (or their  respective
Affiliates) or (y) available to a Kali Shareholder or any of its Affiliates on a
non-confidential  basis  from a  source  that,  to the  knowledge  of such  Kali
Shareholder,  is not prohibited from  disclosing such  information by any legal,
contractual or fiduciary obligation.


            6.10. NON-SOLICITATION. From the Closing Date until the fourth (4th)
anniversary  of the  Closing  Date  (the  "Non-Solicitation  Period"),  the Kali
Shareholders shall not, directly or indirectly,  hire or recruit any employee of
PRI (or any of its  Affiliates)  or solicit or induce,  or attempt to solicit or
induce,  (i) any employee of PRI (or any of its Affiliates) to terminate his/her
employment with, or otherwise cease his/her relationship with PRI (or any of its
Affiliates)  or (ii) any then  current  customer or client of PRI (or any of its
Affiliates) to materially  alter,  terminate or otherwise cease its relationship
with  PRI  (or  any of  its  Affiliates).  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the
Non-Solicitation  Period in respect of Mr.  Subramanian  shall  terminate on the
later  of  (x)  two  (2)  years  after  the  termination  or  expiration  of Mr.
Subramanian's  employment  with  PRI  pursuant  to  the  Subramanian  Employment
Agreement and (y) four (4) years after the Closing Date,  except (A) in the case
of a termination of Mr.  Subramanian's  employment pursuant to Sections 3.2.4 or
3.2.5   of  the   Subramanian   Employment   Agreement,   in   which   case  the
Non-Solicitation  Period in  respect  of Mr.  Subramanian  as to  customers  and
clients of PRI (but not as to  employees  of PRI) shall,  subject to Section 6.4
hereof,  terminate twelve (12) months from the Subramanian  Termination Date and
(B) that Mr.  Subramanian  may employ Ms.  Subramanian  without any violation or
breach of this Section 6.10.


            6.11. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION. Promptly following
the Effective  Date,  and in no event later than five (5) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, Kali and the Kali Shareholders  shall provide to PRI copies of
all financial statements of Kali that would be required to be included in a Form
8-K (and any  amendments  thereto) to be filed  pursuant to the  Exchange Act in
connection with the transactions  contemplated hereby. Such financial statements
shall comply in form and  substance  with the  requirements  of such Act and all
other applicable Federal securities Laws and regulations.


            6.12. USE OF LEASED REAL PROPERTY.
                  ---------------------------

            (a)   Prior  to the Closing,  without the prior  written  consent of
PRI,  neither  Kali nor the Kali  Shareholders  shall enter into any contract or
other  agreement  with respect to any portion of the Leased Real  Property  that


                                       45
<PAGE>

would survive the Closing or otherwise  adversely  affect the use,  operation or
enjoyment  of the Leased Real  Property  after the  Closing,  unless the same is
terminable upon no more than thirty- (30) days' prior written notice and without
any significant Liability.

            (b)   Upon PRI's reasonable request,  Kali and the Kali Shareholders
shall cooperate with PRI,  without their being required to incur any significant
monetary  obligation,  in  obtaining  any and all  Permits  or  Consents  of any
Governmental Authorities,  including variance and site plan approvals, necessary
for PRI's planned  operations at the Leased Real Property following the Closing;
PROVIDED,  that Kali shall not be  obligated  to obtain any  Permit,  Consent or
variance  required to permit PRI to conduct any  business or activity  after the
Closing  other than in respect of the  businesses  of Kali as  conducted  on the
Closing Date.


            6.13. ISRA/ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE.
                  -----------------------------

            (a)   ISRA COMPLIANCE. The Parties acknowledge that the transactions
contemplated  hereby require compliance with ISRA.  Notwithstanding  anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement,  Kali shall assume,  perform,  satisfy
and discharge in full all of its obligations,  responsibilities  and liabilities
under  ISRA  in  connection  with  the  transactions   contemplated  hereby,  as
specifically set forth below.

            (b)   ISRA  CLEARANCE.  Kali shall, as soon as practicable after the
Effective Date, make all filings and submissions  required under ISRA, including
a General  Information  Notice in connection with the transactions  contemplated
hereby  (collectively,  the  "ISRA  Filings"),  and in good  faith  pursue  ISRA
Clearance through a Remediation Agreement (a "Remediation Agreement"),  a Letter
of Non-Applicability, Remediation in Progress Waiver, Expedited Review Approval,
a No Further  Action/Covenant  Not to Sue (an "NFA") or any other  Authorization
Letter, as defined in N.J.A.C. 7:26B-1.4, issued by the New Jersey Department of
Environmental  Protection  ("NJDEP"),  permitting the transactions  contemplated
hereby to be consummated ("ISRA Clearance").

            (c)   REMEDIATION  AGREEMENT.  Kali shall,  as soon as  practicable,
seek to obtain  ISRA  Clearance  via an  Authorization  Letter in respect of the
Facility.  If the Parties shall reasonably determine that, without a Remediation
Agreement,  it is unlikely  that ISRA  Clearance  will be obtained to permit the
Closing to occur within  forty-five  (45) days of the Effective  Date,  then the
Parties shall execute a Remediation Agreement, pursuant to which neither VGS nor
the Kali  Shareholders  shall have any  future  monetary  obligation;  PROVIDED,
HOWEVER,  that if the related  Preliminary  Assessment  Report shall  reasonably
estimate the costs in respect of such remediation to exceed $700,000  (including
the use of Controls), then PRI shall not be obligated to execute the Remediation
Agreement.

            (d)   COST OF ISRA  CLEARANCE.  PRI shall be solely  responsible for
all costs and expenses  required to obtain ISRA Clearance and all  investigatory
and/or  remediation  costs, if any,  relative to ISRA  Clearance,  including any
liability for natural resource damages that (i) are claimed by any Person during
such time following the Closing that Kali shall be the operator  and/or owner of
the  Facility or (ii) that are caused by PRI;  provided,  HOWEVER,  that $6,000,
which amount is the full amount that has been  incurred by Kali relative to ISRA
Clearance prior to the Effective Date, shall remain subject to Section 2.2(d)(v)


                                       46
<PAGE>

hereof.   If,  in  the  course  of  obtaining  ISRA   Clearance,   environmental
investigations  and/or  remediation  shall be required  pursuant  to  applicable
Environmental  Laws, PRI shall, at its sole cost and expense,  diligently pursue
final  environmental  approvals  for  such  investigations  and/ or  remediation
requirements,  as applicable,  including  NJDEP's issuance of an NFA, subject to
the  provisions  of Section  6.13(g)  hereof.  With respect to any NFA issued in
connection  with obtaining ISRA  Clearance,  PRI shall execute a covenant not to
sue.

            (e)   INDEMNITY.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing  provisions of this
Section  6.13,  the Kali  Shareholders  shall,  jointly and  severally,  defend,
indemnify and hold harmless Kali, PRI and their respective directors,  officers,
shareholders,  agents,  Affiliates,  successors and permitted assigns,  from and
against,  and shall pay and  reimburse  the  foregoing  Persons for, any and all
Losses  related to or  resulting  from  Kali's  failure to comply  with,  or any
violations by Kali of the  requirements of, ISRA that may arise as a result of a
cessation of business or activity by Kali at a property  other than the Facility
prior to the Effective Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the aggregate dollar amount
of the Kali Shareholders'  indemnification  obligation  provided in this Section
6.13(e)  shall not exceed  fifty  (50%)  percent of any fines or other  monetary
obligations  imposed under Law or by any  Governmental  Authority as a result of
such failure or violation.

            (f)   STATUS AND ACCESS.  PRI shall keep the Kali Shareholders fully
apprised  of the status of any  post-Closing  investigation  and/or  remediation
actions undertaken at the Facilities, shall provide the Kali Shareholders with a
reasonable  opportunity  to review and comment on and consent to (which  consent
shall not be unreasonably  withheld,  conditioned or delayed)  reports and other
documents  related to such actions prior to their submission to any Governmental
Authority or Person, and shall provide the Kali Shareholders with advance notice
of any meetings with  Governmental  Authorities  regarding  such actions,  as to
which meetings the Kali  Shareholders  or their  representatives  shall have the
right to attend.

            (g)   INSTITUTIONAL  CONTROLS/ENGINEERING  CONTROLS.  PRI  shall not
propose to any Governmental Authority, or implement,  any institutional control,
engineering  control,  or the like,  including a  Classification  Exception Area
and/or  Deed Notice  (collectively,  "Controls")  without  the  express  written
consent  of  the  Kali  Shareholders;  PROVIDED,  however,  that,  if  the  Kali
Shareholders  shall withhold such consent,  then the Kali Shareholders  shall be
solely  responsible  for any and all additional  costs and expenses  required to
obtain  an NFA from  NJDEP  without  the use of  Controls.  Notwithstanding  the
foregoing,  in no event may PRI propose a Control that  materially and adversely
affects the use of the Facility for commercial purposes.

            (h)   EFFECT ON  REPRESENTATIONS,  WARRANTIES,  ETC. Nothing in this
Section 6.13 shall in any way alter or otherwise  diminish the  application,  or
effect, of any of the representations  and warranties  contained in Section 3.14
hereof or the indemnity provisions of Section 11.2(a) hereof.


            6.14. EXCLUSIVE  DEALINGS.  From  the  Effective  Date  through  the
earlier of (x) the Closing Date and (y) the Termination  Date, Kali and the Kali
Shareholders shall not, and shall cause Kali's directors,  officers,  employees,
agents and  Affiliates not to,  directly or indirectly,  solicit or initiate the
submission of proposals from, or solicit, encourage, entertain or enter into any
arrangement, agreement, letter of intent or understanding with, or engage in any
negotiations  with,  or  furnish  any  information  to,  any  Person  (including


                                       47
<PAGE>

Perrigo),  other than PRI or any  representative(s)  or agent(s)  thereof,  with
respect to the direct or indirect  acquisition of all or any material portion of
the business,  operations or assets  (including any of the Leased Real Property)
of Kali or any of its (issued or  unissued)  capital  stock.  If Kali,  the Kali
Shareholders or any of their respective Affiliates,  during such period, receive
any offer or inquiry  relating to any such  acquisition,  or obtain  information
that such an offer or inquiry is likely to be made,  it/he will provide PRI with
immediate written notice thereof.

            6.15. COMMERCIALLY  REASONABLE EFFORTS TO CLOSE. Each of the Parties
shall  use  commercially  reasonable  efforts  to  satisfy,  or to  cause  to be
satisfied,  all conditions to such Party's  obligation to close the transactions
contemplated hereby that are reasonably within the control of such Party. If all
of the  conditions to a Party's  obligation to close  hereunder  shall have been
satisfied, such Party shall diligently proceed to close.


            6.16. FURTHER  ASSURANCES;  PERRIGO CLAIM.  From time to time before
and after the Closing Date, Kali and the Kali Shareholders, as applicable, shall
each execute and deliver all such  documents  and  instruments,  and do all such
acts, as PRI may  reasonably  request in order to convey to PRI the Kali Shares,
free and clear of all Liens,  and otherwise  carry out the intent of the Parties
under this Agreement.  Kali and the Kali Shareholders hereby represent that they
have delivered to PRI true and complete copies of all written correspondence and
provided true and accurate summaries of all oral  communications with Perrigo in
respect of its  purported  first  refusal  right,  the Option  Agreement and the
Perrigo Offer.  The Kali  Shareholders and Kali shall provide PRI, and PRI shall
provide the Kali  Shareholders'  Rep,  with prompt notice of any written or oral
communications  with Perrigo  regarding any claims or other  assertions  made by
Perrigo against any of them or any of their respective Affiliates and shall not,
without  the  prior  written  consent  of PRI  on  the  one  hand,  or the  Kali
Shareholders' Rep, on the other hand, make any communications,  written or oral,
to  Perrigo  regarding  any  matter  relating  to  this  Agreement,  the  Option
Agreement,  the Perrigo Offer or Perrigo's  purported first refusal right.  Kali
and  the  Kali  Shareholders  and  PRI  shall  cooperate,  as and to the  extent
reasonably  requested by the other  Party(ies),  in  connection  with any claim,
litigation or other proceeding asserted by any third parties (including Perrigo)
that seeks to enjoin,  delay or to  recover  monetary  damages in respect of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each Party shall be entitled to
participate  in  any  meetings  with  Perrigo  in  respect  of any  such  claim,
litigation or other  proceeding.  The Kali  Shareholders  shall cooperate in the
defense or  prosecution  of any such  third-party  claims,  litigation  or other
proceeding  and in good faith retain and furnish such records,  information  and
testimony, and attend such conferences,  discovery proceedings, hearings, trials
and appeals, as may be reasonably requested by PRI in connection therewith,  and
assist generally with the  establishment  of any and all reasonable  defenses to
any such third-party claim, litigation or proceeding. Prior to the Closing, each
of the Parties,  subject to the other provisions of this Section 6.16, shall use
commercially  reasonable  efforts to settle or otherwise resolve any claims made
(or that may be made) in connection with Perrigo's purported first refusal right
or the Perrigo Offer or to otherwise  enter into a reasonable  arrangement  with
Perrigo  in  connection  therewith  prior  to the  Closing,  including,  without
limitation,  meeting its  respective  obligations  as set forth in that  certain
letter agreement,  dated as of the Effective Date, executed and delivered by the
Parties;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that PRI shall  control any and all  attempts and
efforts to settle or otherwise address any such claims,  subject to the right of
the Kali  Shareholders'  Rep to fully  participate.  No  settlement  in  respect
thereof shall be entered into without the full participation and express written

                                       48
<PAGE>

consent of PRI. Each of PRI, Kali and the Kali  Shareholders' Rep believes that,
based on the facts and  circumstances,  including  discussions  with their legal
counsel,  that the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the  performance
of the Parties' obligations  contemplated hereunder,  will not violate Perrigo's
purported right of first refusal.


            6.17. SUPPLEMENTAL  DISCLOSURE.  Each of the Parties  hereby  agrees
that, with respect to their respective  representations and warranties contained
in this  Agreement,  each such  Party  shall  have a  continuing  obligation  to
promptly  provide  detailed  disclosure to the other Parties with respect to any
matter  hereafter  arising or  discovered  that,  if existing or known as of the
Effective Date,  would have been required to be set forth on or described in the
schedules  hereto;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that none of such  disclosure  shall be
deemed to modify,  amend or supplement any of the representations and warranties
of the  disclosing  Party or any of the  schedules  hereto  as of the time  such
representations  and warranties  were initially  made,  unless the Party to whom
such  disclosure(s)  are made  shall have  consented  thereto  in  writing;  and
PROVIDED,  FURTHER, that such disclosure shall not, under any circumstances,  be
permitted to cure any breaches existing at the time that such representations or
warranties were initially made.


            6.18. LEASES.  (a) The Kali Shareholders shall cause VGS to, and VGS
shall,  enter into a lease agreement with PRI or Kali in respect of the Facility
(including the proposed  additional terms thereto),  in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit C, at the  Closing,  which  lease shall be for a term of at least two
years and  contain an  immediately  exercisable,  irrevocable  option for PRI to
purchase such Facility.

            (b)   Immediately  prior to  Closing,  VGS and Kali shall  terminate
that certain lease with respect to property  located in Piscataway,  New Jersey,
without further liability to Kali.


            6.19. VGS  LOAN.  At the Closing,  VGS shall execute and deliver the
VGS Note (which shall include the principal  amount of the  Post-Effective  Date
VGS Loan) to PRI on behalf of Kali  (which may be  assigned  to PRI) and execute
and deliver to the holder of the VGS Note a mortgage  on the  Facility to secure
the obligations under such Note.


            6.20. CONDUCT OF KALI BUSINESS  POST-CLOSING.  PRI shall, during the
period after the Closing Date through the  Subramanian  Termination  Date (or if
Mr.  Subramanian's  employment  shall be terminated  pursuant to Section  3.2.1,
3.2.2, 3.2.4 or 3.2.5 of the Subramanian Employment Agreement,  through the date
that is thirty (30) months from the Closing Date), use  commercially  reasonable
efforts to conduct the business of Kali in a manner  consistent  with the manner
in which Kali conducted the Kali Business  immediately  prior to the Closing and
to use  commercially  reasonable  efforts to (i) prevent the  occurrence  of any
Business  Interruption  Event, (ii) conduct  Biostudies with respect to products
and proposed  products as to which the conduct of Biostudies is reasonable under
the  circumstances  (it  being  hereby  acknowledged  by the  Parties  that  the
continued (or  non-continuance  of) employment of Mr.  Subramanian is a relevant
factor in determining what shall be reasonable) and (iii) file with or submit to
the FDA ANDAs with respect to any  products  and  proposed  products as to which
such filing or submissions  are reasonable  under the  circumstances;  PROVIDED,
that in no event shall PRI be deemed to have  breached this Section 6.20 if (and
to the extent) its actions or failure to act  resulted  from any act or omission


                                       49
<PAGE>

of Mr.  Subramanian.  Mr.  Subramanian  shall  reasonably  cooperate with PRI to
facilitate PRI's compliance with this Section 6.20.


            7.    CERTAIN TAX MATTERS.
                  -------------------

            7.1   TAX INDEMNIFICATION. The Kali Shareholders hereby, jointly and
severally,  agree to defend,  indemnify  and hold harmless  Kali,  PRI and their
respective directors, officers, shareholders, agents, Affiliates, successors and
permitted assigns,  from and against,  and shall pay and reimburse the foregoing
Persons for, any and all losses, liabilities,  claims,  obligations,  penalties,
damages, costs and expenses (including all attorneys' fees and disbursements and
other costs  reasonably  incurred or sustained by an  Indemnitee  (as defined in
Section  11.3  hereof)  in  connection  with  the   investigation,   defense  or
prosecution of any such claim or any action or proceeding between the Indemnitee
and the  Indemnifying  Party (as defined in Section  11.3 hereof) or between the
Indemnitee  and any  third  party or  otherwise),  whether  or not  involving  a
third-party claim  (collectively,  "Losses"),  relating to or arising out of (i)
all Taxes of Kali due for all taxable  periods ending on or prior to the Closing
Date and the portion of the taxable  period  through the end of the Closing Date
for any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (the
"Pre-Closing  Tax  Period");  (ii) all  Taxes of any  member  of an  affiliated,
consolidated, combined or unitary group of which Kali (or any predecessor) is or
was a member on or prior to the  Closing  Date,  including  pursuant to Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar Law; and (iii) all Taxes
of any Person (other than Kali) imposed on Kali as a transferee or successor, by
contract or pursuant to Law. The Kali Shareholders shall, jointly and severally,
reimburse  PRI for any  Taxes of Kali  that are the  responsibility  of the Kali
Shareholders pursuant to this Section 7.1 within fifteen (15) days after payment
of such Taxes by PRI or Kali.

            7.2   STRADDLE  PERIOD.  In the  case  of any  taxable  period  that
includes,  but does not end on, the  Closing  Date (a  "Straddle  Period"),  the
amount  of any  Taxes  based on or  measured  by  income  or  receipts  of Kali,
including  sales  and use  Taxes  for  the  Pre-Closing  Tax  Period,  shall  be
determined  based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of business
on the Closing Date and the amount of other Taxes of Kali, including real estate
Taxes,  for a Straddle Period that relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by
a fraction,  the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable  period
ending on the Closing Date and the  denominator  of which is the total number of
days in such Straddle Period.


            7.3   SECTION  338(H)(10)  ELECTION.  Each of the Kali  Shareholders
will join with PRI in taking or causing to be taken,  and shall take or cause to
be taken,  all actions  necessary and  appropriate to effect a timely and proper
election under Code Section 338(h)(10) and the Treasury Regulations  promulgated
thereunder (and any  corresponding  election under state,  local and foreign Tax
Laws) with respect to the purchase  and sale of the Kali Shares  hereunder  (the
"Section 338(h)(10) Election"). In particular, and without limitation, each Kali
Shareholder will execute and deliver to PRI a Form 8023, countersigned by a duly
authorized  officer of PRI (and any similar form required under state, local and
foreign  Tax laws) on or prior to the Closing  with  respect to Kali in order to
make the  Section  338(h)(10)  Election,  which  Form  8023 will be filed by PRI
promptly  after the Closing.  The Kali  Shareholders  and Kali shall include all
income,  gain, loss,  deduction or other Tax item(s)  resulting from the Section
338(h)(10)  Election on their  respective Tax Returns to the extent  required by


                                       50
<PAGE>

applicable  Law and in  accordance  with the  allocations  of Purchase  Price as
determined pursuant to Section 7.4 hereof.  Subject to reimbursement pursuant to
Section 2.5 hereof, the Kali Shareholders shall also pay any Tax imposed on Kali
attributable to the making of the Section 338(h)(10) Election, including (a) any
Tax  imposed  under Code  Section  1374 and (b) any state,  local or foreign Tax
imposed on Kali's income or gains, and the Kali Shareholders shall indemnify PRI
and Kali against,  and pay or reimburse  them for, all Losses arising out of any
failure timely to pay any such Taxes.  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary
contained in the immediately  preceding  sentence,  PRI shall pay, in accordance
with  Section  2.5  hereof,  to the Kali  Shareholders'  Rep (a) the New  Jersey
Corporate  Tax  Reimbursement  so as to enable the Kali  Shareholders  to pay on
behalf of Kali the amount of any New Jersey  Business  Corporation  Tax  imposed
upon Kali  resulting  from the deemed sales of its assets upon the making of the
Section 338(h)(10) Election, (b) the Transfer Tax Reimbursement, so as to enable
the  Kali  Shareholders  to pay  either  on  behalf  of Kali,  or on  their  own
collective behalf, the amount of such Taxes as are covered by such Reimbursement
and (c) the amount of the Second Level Gross-Up as that is  attributable  to the
New Jersey  Corporate  Tax  Reimbursement  and the Transfer  Tax  Reimbursement,
subject,  however,  to the right (as set forth in Section  2.5 hereof) of PRI to
pay the amounts described in clauses (a), (b) and (c) by offsetting against such
amounts  when  otherwise  due  an  equivalent  amount  of the  then  outstanding
principal amount of and/or accrued interest the VGS Note.


            7.4.  ALLOCATIONS  OF PURCHASE PRICE.  The Parties hereby agree that
the Purchase Price shall be allocated first among the assets of Kali as follows:
(i) first,  to equipment in an amount equal to  $2,650,000,  (ii) second,  in an
amount equal to, and in accordance  with, the tax adjusted bases  (determined as
of the Closing Date) of Kali's  remaining  tangible assets and (iii) third,  the
balance of the Purchase  Price shall be treated as having been paid and shall be
allocated  to assets that  qualify as  "amortizable  section  197  intangibles,"
including  "goodwill" and "going concern value," under Code Section 197 and that
are treated as capital  assets under Code Section 1221; it being intended by the
Parties that,  subject to  confirmation  with the independent  certified  public
accountant  of PRI, the  allocation of the Purchase  Price among the  respective
assets of Kali, as set forth in this Section 7.4, shall reflect the current fair
market  values of Kali's  assets as of the Closing  Date.  The  Gross-Up and the
Second Level  Gross-Up,  as calculated  under Section 2.5 hereof with respect to
Kali,  shall be  allocated  to such  assets of Kali as qualify  as  "amortizable
section 197 intangibles,"  including "goodwill" and "going concern value," under
Code Section 197 and that are treated as capital assets under Code Section 1221.
At such time as the Closing  Certificate  shall become final in accordance  with
Section 2.4(c) hereof, the independent  certified public accountant of PRI shall
provide  to PRI and  Kali a  completed  IRS Form  8883  (the  "Asset  Allocation
Statement Under Section 338"),  reflecting the allocation of the Purchase Price,
including the Gross-Up and the Second Level Gross-Up,  among the various Classes
of  Assets  (as set  forth in such  Form  8883) of Kali in  accordance  with the
principles  set forth in this Section 7.4. In addition to receiving its own Form
8883 from the independent public accountant of PRI, Kali shall receive from such
accountant  copies  of the Form 8883 to be filed by PRI,  and PRI shall  receive
from such accountant copies of the Form 8883 to be filed by Kali. The allocation
of the  Purchase  Price among the assets of Kali,  as set forth in the Form 8883
prepared by such  accountant,  shall be binding on the Parties  hereto,  and the
Parties  shall  not  take a  position  inconsistent  therewith  for  income  tax
purposes.  For purposes of determining  the  "aggregate  deemed sales price" and
"adjusted  grossed-up  basis" for  purposes of Code Section 338 and the Treasury
Regulations,  the Purchase Price allocated to, and treated as the  consideration

                                       51
<PAGE>

paid under,  this Section 7.4 for the Kali Shares shall be grossed up to include
the respective  Liabilities (as determined  under Federal income tax principles)
of Kali as of the Closing Date; however,  for purposes of allocation of Purchase
Price,  the value of the Warrants shall be zero. PRI shall attach such Form 8883
to a timely-filed consolidated Federal income Tax Return (and, where applicable,
its state and local  income tax  returns) for its taxable year in which the sale
occurs,  and Kali shall attach its respective Form 8883 to its respective timely
filed final  Federal  income tax return  (I.E.,  IRS Forms  1120-S)  and,  where
applicable,  its state and local income tax returns, for its taxable year ending
on the Closing Date. Any  adjustments to the Purchase Price required  hereunder,
including any  adjustments  under Sections 2.2(d) and 2.4 hereof with respect to
the Reduction  Amount,  shall be applied,  on a  "dollar-for-dollar"  basis,  to
decrease the amount of the Purchase  Price  allocated to and treated as paid for
Kali's  "amortizable  section 197 intangibles" that constitute capital assets as
described above.  Any Initial ANDA Payment,  Second ANDA payment or Market Price
Payment(s)  shall be  allocated  to and treated as paid for Kali's  "amortizable
section 197  intangibles"  that  constitute  capital assets as described  above,
except to the  extent  that any such  Payments  are  required  to be  treated as
imputed  interest  under  the  Code,  includible  in  the  income  of  the  Kali
Shareholders  as interest  income and  deductible by PRI as interest  expense in
accordance with the Code. If and to the extent that any amount  allocated to any
asset is increased or decreased after the taxable year in which the sale occurs,
any affected Party shall file a supplemental  Form 8883 to report such change in
accordance  with  the  Treasury  Regulations  under  Code  Section  338  and the
instructions  to such Form and shall  attach  such  supplemental  Form 8883 to a
timely filed Federal income tax return (and, where  applicable,  state and local
income tax returns)  for which the  increase or decrease is taken into  account.
Prior to filing any such  supplemental  Form 8883,  each Party shall provide the
other  Parties  hereto with a draft of such Form 8883 for their review and, upon
the filing of such  supplemental  Form 8883,  each Party shall provide the other
Parties hereto with a copy of such Form, as filed.

            7.5   S CORPORATION STATUS. Kali and the Kali Shareholders shall not
revoke  Kali's  election to be taxed as an S  corporation  within the meaning of
Code Sections 1361 and 1362.  Kali and the Kali  Shareholders  shall not take or
allow any action to be taken (or fail to take any action)  that would  result in
the termination of Kali's status as a validly electing S corporation  within the
meaning of Code Sections 1361 and 1362.


            7.6   TAX  PERIODS  ENDING ON OR BEFORE THE CLOSING DATE.  PRI shall
prepare or cause to be prepared  and file all Straddle  Period Tax Returns.  PRI
shall  obtain the prior  written  consent of the Kali  Shareholders'  Rep (which
consent shall not be  unreasonably  withheld or delayed) to each such Tax Return
described in the immediately preceding sentence prior to its filing.


            7.7   COOPERATION ON TAX MATTERS.
                  ---------------------------

            (a)   PRI,  Kali and the Kali Shareholders shall cooperate fully, as
and to the extent requested by any other Party, in connection with the filing of
Tax  Returns  pursuant  to this  Section 7 and any  audit,  litigation  or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes.  Such cooperation  shall include the retention
and (upon the other Party's  request) the  provision of records and  information
that are reasonably  relevant to any such audit,  litigation or other proceeding
and making employees or representatives available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide  additional  information  and  explanation of any materials  provided

with  respect to Tax matters  pertinent to Kali  relating to any taxable  period
beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the applicable statute
of  limitations  of the  respective  taxable  periods and comply with all record
retention  agreements  entered into with any Taxing  Authority and (ii) give the
Kali   Shareholders'  Rep  reasonable  written  notice  prior  to  transferring,
destroying  or  discarding   any  such  books  and  records  and,  if  the  Kali
Shareholders'  Rep so  requests  in  writing,  PRI or Kali shall  allow the Kali
Shareholders' Rep to take possession of such books and records.

            (b)   PRI and the Kali  Shareholders  further agree, upon request of
the other  Party(ies),  to use  their  reasonable  best  efforts  to obtain  any
certificate or other document from any  Governmental  Authority or Person as may
be  reasonably  necessary to mitigate,  reduce,  defer or eliminate any Tax that
could  otherwise  be  imposed   (including  with  respect  to  the  transactions
contemplated hereby).


            7.8   CERTAIN  TAXES.  Subject to Section 2.5 hereof,  all transfer,
documentary,  real property  transfer,  sales,  stamp,  registration and similar
Taxes and fees  (including  any penalties  and interest)  incurred in connection
with this  Agreement  shall be paid by the Kali  Shareholders  when due, and the
Kali  Shareholders  will,  at their own  expense,  timely  prepare  and file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such transfer,
documentary,  sales, use, stamp,  registration and other similar Taxes and fees.

maturity,  and with a provision  for the payment of such  obligation  by Kali in
cash  or  through  its  rendering  of  services  to PRI as may be  mutually  and
reasonably  agreed to by PRI and Kali.  In  addition,  PRI  shall,  upon  Kali's
written request,  within two (2) months of such termination,  loan to Kali up to
an additional $7,500,000,  bearing interest at the same rate as the PRI Loan and
with a maturity  date five (5) years from the date that such loan is made,  with
interest  accruing but not payable  until  maturity and with a provision for the
payment of such  obligation by Kali in cash or through its rendering of services
to  PRI as may be  mutually  and  reasonably  agreed  to by PRI  and  Kali  (the
"Additional  Loan").   Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if  Kali  or  the  Kali
Shareholders shall close a transaction of a type contemplated by subsection (iv)
below with Perrigo (or any of its  Affiliates)  within twelve (12) months of the
effective date of termination pursuant to this subsection (iii), then the unpaid
balance of each of the PRI Loan and any  Additional  Loan  shall  become due and
payable  (including all accrued and unpaid interest thereon) in full immediately
upon such closing.  PRI, Kali and the Kali Shareholders  hereby acknowledge that
the forgiveness of $5,000,000 of the principal of the PRI Loan, the extension of
$5,000,000  of the  principal  of the PRI Loan and the making of the  Additional
Loan are the sole remedy and are  reasonable and shall not constitute a penalty.
Such  amount  shall not,  except as provided in this  Section  10.3(a)(iii),  be
subject to offset or reduction by PRI.

                  (iv)  If,  within  six  (6)  months  following  a  termination
pursuant  to Section  10.1(b)(i)  hereof or within  nine (9) months  following a
termination   pursuant  to  Section   10.3(a)(ii)   hereof,  Kali  or  the  Kali
Shareholders  shall enter into any  agreement  involving  the sale (or series of
related sales) of Kali (whether  through a sale of all or  substantially  all of
the assets or capital  stock of Kali,  including by a merger,  consolidation  or
otherwise)  to or with a Person that is not an Affiliate or Associate of Kali or
any Kali  Shareholder as of the Effective  Date,  then,  subject to Section 11.7
hereof,  Kali and the Kali  Shareholders  shall,  upon the  consummation of such
transaction, jointly and severally, be required to pay to PRI in accordance with

                                       57
<PAGE>

Section 10.3(b)  hereof,  in cash, the sum equal to 100% of the amount by which,
if any,  the  aggregate  consideration  amount  received  by Kali  and the  Kali
Shareholders  (and their  Affiliates  and  Associates)  in connection  with such
transaction  (subject to subsequent  modification  to reflect any purchase price
adjustments and indemnification payments or any other provision that reduces the
consideration  retained by Kali or the Kali Shareholders  without any offsetting
benefit to them)  exceeds the Cash  Purchase  Price (the  "Percentage  Amount"),
less,  in respect of a  termination  pursuant  to  Section  10.3(a)(ii)  hereof,
$4,000,000 (if, but only if, the Percentage Amount shall exceed $4,000,000). The
Kali Shareholders and Kali shall, in any definitive  agreement setting forth the
terms of a  transaction  that  would give rise to the  payment  of a  Percentage
Amount,  negotiate and provide for terms so that the Person acquiring Kali shall
be required to pay the Percentage Amount if the Kali  Shareholders  breach their
obligations pursuant to this Section 10.3(b)(iv) or Section 10.3(b) hereof.

                  (v)  Upon the payment of a liquidated  damages amount (and, if
applicable,  the Percentage  Amount) due under this Section 10.3(a) hereof,  all
indemnification  obligations  of  such  payor  under  Section  11  hereof  shall
immediately terminate.

            (b)   PAYMENT.  Any liquidated  damage payments  required to be made
pursuant  to  Sections  10.3(a)  or 6.5  hereof  shall  be made as  promptly  as
practicable,  but not later than ten (10)  Business  Days after the event giving
rise to the applicable liquidated damages. The Percentage Amount, if applicable,
shall  be paid on the  closing  date of any  transaction(s)  giving  rise to the
payment of the Percentage Amount. The liquidated damages and, if applicable, the
Percentage Amount, shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account  designated by the  Party(ies) to which it is owed (the  "Payee").
The  Percentage  Amount  shall be paid in cash,  and if there  shall be non-cash
consideration  paid in any transaction  giving rise to the obligation to pay the
Percentage  Amount,  then such  consideration  shall be  calculated  at its fair
value.

            (c)   COLLECTION  EXPENSES AND INTEREST.  In the event that the Kali
Shareholders  or PRI,  as the case may be (the  "Payor")  shall  fail to pay the
applicable  liquidated damages or the Percentage Amount (if applicable) when due
in accordance with Section 10.3(b) hereof, then the Payor shall additionally pay
all costs  and  expenses  actually  incurred  by the  Payee  and its  Affiliates
(including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with the collection
of such liquidated damages and the Percentage Amount (if applicable),  and shall
pay interest on such unpaid  liquidated  damages and the  Percentage  Amount (if
applicable), commencing on the date that such damages or Amount became due until
payment  in full  thereof,  at a rate  equal  to the rate of  interest  publicly
announced by the Chase  Manhattan  Bank, from time to time, in New York City, at
such Bank's base rate plus two (2%) percent.


            11.   SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION.
                  -------------------------


            11.1. SURVIVAL   OF   REPRESENTATIONS,   WARRANTIES  AND  COVENANTS.
Notwithstanding  any right of PRI to  investigate  the business and condition of
Kali,  PRI  shall be  entitled  to rely  upon the  representations,  warranties,
covenants and agreements of Kali and the Kali Shareholders.  All representations
and warranties  contained in this Agreement (including the Schedules hereto) and
in all  certificates  (including  the Estimated  Closing  Certificate)  required
hereby to be  delivered  shall be deemed to be  representations  and  warranties
hereunder and shall survive the Closing (or, if no Closing,  the Effective Date)


                                       58
<PAGE>

for a period ending nineteen (19) months from the Closing Date,  except that the
representations and warranties  contained in (i) Sections 3.13 (Tax Matters) and
Section 4.7  (Eligible S  Corporation  Shareholder)  hereof shall  survive until
thirty (30) days after expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, (ii)
Section 3.14  (Environmental  Matters)  hereof shall  survive  until thirty (30)
months from the Closing Date and (iii)  Sections 3.3  (Capitalization;  Options;
Shareholder   Rights),   4.1  (Authority  to  Execute  and  Perform  Agreements;
Enforceability)  and 4.2 (Title to Kali Shares) hereof shall survive the Closing
indefinitely. As of the respective expiration dates applicable thereto set forth
above,  such  representations  and warranties  shall expire and be of no further
force and effect, except that any representation or warranty that is the subject
of a claim or dispute that was properly  asserted in writing in accordance  with
this Section 11 prior to the  applicable  expiration  date provided  above shall
survive  with  respect  to such  claim or  dispute  until the  final  resolution
thereof.  The covenants  and  agreements  made by the Parties in this  Agreement
shall survive the Closing Date, without limitation, unless otherwise provided in
such covenant or agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the covenants and agreements
contained  in Section 6.1 hereof shall  survive the Closing for a period  ending
nineteen (19) months from the Closing Date and the covenants and  agreements set
forth in Sections 6.2, 6.8, 6.14,  6.15, 6.17 and 6.18 hereof shall terminate on
the  Closing  Date.  Any  limitation  or  qualification  set  forth  in any  one
representation  and  warranty  contained in Sections 3, 4 and 5 hereof shall not
limit or  qualify  any  other  representation  and  warranty  contained  in such
Sections.  Each  representation  and warranty included in Sections 3, 4 and 5 is
independent and shall be interpreted without regard to any other  representation
or  warranty  contained  in Sections 3, 4 and 5  (including  any more  inclusive
representation or warranty).


            11.2. INDEMNIFICATION.
                  ---------------

            (a)   KALI'S AND KALI SHAREHOLDERS' AGREEMENTS TO INDEMNIFY. Subject
to the other  provisions  of this  Section  11, Kali (but only if there is not a
Closing) and the Kali  Shareholders  (but,  subject to Sections  10.3(a)(ii) and
(iv) and  10.3(b)  hereof,  only if  there  is a  Closing)  shall,  jointly  and
severally,  indemnify,  defend and hold harmless PRI, its Affiliates  (including
Kali  if  there  is  a  Closing)  and  their  respective  directors,   officers,
shareholders,  agents,  successors and permitted  assigns from and against,  and
shall pay and  reimburse  the  foregoing  Persons  for,  (x) any and all  Losses
relating  to or arising  out of the breach (or  alleged  breach if asserted by a
third  party)  of (i) any  representation  or  warranty  of any such  Party(ies)
contained  in this  Agreement  or (ii) any  covenant or agreement of any of such
Party(ies)  contained in this  Agreement  and (y) fifty (50%) percent of any and
all Losses relating to Environmental Claims at the Facility  attributable to the
time(s) prior to its occupancy by Kali (the "Pre-Occupancy  Losses");  PROVIDED,
that, if the  representations  and  warranties  contained in Section 3.14 hereof
relating to  Environmental  Claims at the Facility  attributable  to the time(s)
prior to its  occupancy  by Kali are not correct in any  material  respect,  one
hundred  (100%)  percent  of any and all of the  Pre-Occupancy  Losses  shall be
subject to  indemnification;  and  PROVIDED,  FURTHER,  that one hundred  (100%)
percent of all Losses,  including the Pre-Occupancy  Losses, shall be applied to
determine  whether the  Deductible  (as defined  hereafter) has been met. If the
aggregate of Losses for all indemnification  claims would exceed the Deductible,
all Losses  (other  than the  Pre-Occupancy  Losses),  on the one hand,  and the
Pre-Occupancy  Losses  alone,  on  the  other  hand,  shall  be  applied  to the
Deductible on a PRO RATA basis, based on the amounts of such respective Losses.

                                       59
<PAGE>

            (b)   PRI'S  GENERAL  AGREEMENT TO  INDEMNIFY.  Subject to the other
provisions  of this Section 11, PRI shall  indemnify,  defend and hold  harmless
Kali  (but  only  if  there  is  not  a  Closing)  and  the  Kali   Shareholders
(irrespective  of whether  there is a Closing) and their  respective  directors,
officers,  shareholders,  agents,  successors,  heirs,  legal  beneficiaries and
permitted  assigns from and against,  and shall pay and  reimburse the foregoing
Persons  for,  any and all Losses  relating  to or arising out of the breach (or
alleged  breach  if  asserted  by a third  party) of (i) any  representation  or
warranty of PRI contained in this  Agreement,  (ii) any covenant or agreement of
PRI  contained in this  Agreement  or (iii)  subject to the  correctness  of the
representations  and  warranties  of Kali  and the Kali  Shareholders  contained
herein, the operation of the business of Kali after the Closing Date.

            (c)   PERRIGO MATTER. Prior to the Closing, subject to Sections 6.16
and  10.3(a)(v)  hereof,  PRI  shall  pay to or  reimburse  Kali and  each  Kali
Shareholder  for all legal costs and expenses  reasonably  incurred by them, and
any settlement  amounts  effected by PRI,  arising out of any claims or lawsuits
asserted by Perrigo  relating to its purported first refusal right,  the Perrigo
Offer or any  purported  violation  thereof.  If (but only if) the Closing shall
occur,  PRI shall,  subject to Section 6.16 hereof,  indemnify,  defend and hold
harmless the Kali Shareholders from and against, and pay and reimburse them for,
all Losses incurred by them in connection  with any claims or lawsuits  asserted
by Perrigo  relating to its purported first refusal right,  the Perrigo Offer or
any purported violation thereof.

            (d)   TAX TREATMENT OF CERTAIN PAYMENTS. Kali, the Kali Shareholders
and PRI agree to treat any payments made under this Section 11 and Sections 6.5,
6.13(e) and 7 hereof as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Federal, state and
local income tax purposes.


            11.3. PROCEDURES FOR INDEMNIFICATION.
                  ------------------------------

            (a)   If any Party(ies) (the "Indemnitee") shall receive notice of a
claim or the  commencement of any action or proceeding with respect to which the
other  Party(ies)  is obligated to provide  indemnification  (the  "Indemnifying
Party") pursuant to Sections 11.2(a),  11.2(b) or 11.2(c) hereof, the Indemnitee
shall give the  Indemnifying  Party written  notice  thereof within a reasonable
period of time following the  Indemnitee's  receipt of such notice.  Such notice
shall  describe  the claim in  reasonable  detail and shall  indicate the amount
(estimated,  if appropriate) of the Losses that have been or may be sustained by
the  Indemnitee.  The  failure to so provide  such  notice  shall not affect the
Indemnifying  Party's  obligations  hereunder,  unless such Party is  materially
prejudiced as a result thereof. The Indemnifying Party may, subject to the other
provisions  of  this  Section  11.3,  settle,  compromise  or  defend,  at  such
Indemnifying  Party's own expense and by such Indemnifying  Party's own counsel,
any such matter involving the asserted liability of the Indemnitee in respect of
a third-party claim. If the Indemnifying Party shall elect to settle, compromise
or defend such asserted liability, it shall, within thirty (30) days (or sooner,
if the nature of the asserted  liability so requires),  notify the Indemnitee of
its intention to do so and the Indemnitee  shall  reasonably  cooperate,  at the
request and reasonable  expense of the Indemnifying  Party, in the compromise or
settlement of, or defense against,  such asserted  liability.  In respect of any
Environmental  Claims,  the  Indemnifying  Party  shall  conduct and control any
investigation and remediation of such Environmental Claims subject to reasonable
consultation  with and the participation of the Indemnitee;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,
that the  Indemnitee  shall have the right to  reasonably  approve  the  defense
counsel  representing  the  Indemnifying  Party  in  any  Environmental  Matter;


                                       60
<PAGE>

PROVIDED,  FURTHER,  that, if the Kali  Shareholders'  Rep shall (or PRI, if the
Kali  Shareholders'  Rep shall not)  conduct or control  the  investigation  and
remediation in response to an indemnifiable  claim relating to any Environmental
Matter,  such  investigation  and remediation shall be without prejudice to such
Party's  rights to  indemnification  or  contribution  from third  parties.  The
Indemnifying  Party shall not be released  from any  obligation to indemnify the
Indemnitee  hereunder  with  respect to such  asserted  claim  without the prior
written consent of the Indemnitee,  unless the Indemnifying  Party shall deliver
to the Indemnitee a duly executed  agreement settling or compromising such claim
with no monetary liability to, or injunctive relief against,  the Indemnitee and
a complete release of the Indemnitee with respect thereto, which agreement shall
not limit or impair  the  Indemnitee's  ability  to conduct  its  business.  The
Indemnifying  Party  shall  have the  right,  except as  provided  below in this
Section  11.3,  to conduct and control the defense of any  third-party  claim or
action made for which it has been provided notice hereunder.  All costs and fees
incurred  with  respect  to any such  claim  shall be borne by the  Indemnifying
Party.  The Indemnitee  shall have the right to participate in, but not control,
at its own expense,  the defense,  compromise  or  settlement of any such claim;
PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that if the Indemnitee and the Indemnifying Party shall have
conflicting or different claims or defenses,  then the Indemnifying  Party shall
not have control of such  conflicting  or  different  claims or defenses and the
Indemnitee  shall be  entitled to appoint a separate  counsel  (but only one (1)
counsel for such  Indemnitee  and any related  Indemnitees)  for such claims and
defenses, at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party; PROVIDED,  FURTHER,
that if the  Indemnifying  Party  shall not  assume  and  pursue in a timely and
diligent  manner  the  settlement  or  defense  of any  third-party  claim,  the
Indemnifying  Party shall cede control of such claim and the Indemnitee shall be
entitled to appoint a counsel of its choice for such  defense,  at the sole cost
and expense of the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party shall choose to
defend any claim, the Indemnitee shall make available to the Indemnifying  Party
any books,  records or other  documents  within its control that are  reasonably
required for such defense.  If one or more of the Kali  Shareholders  shall seek
indemnification   hereunder,  then  such  Indemnitee(s)  shall,  unless  clearly
impracticable,  consolidate  any claims or matters  relating to  indemnification
into one proceeding, which, in accordance with Section 12.11(a) hereof, shall be
controlled by the Kali Shareholders' Rep.


            11.4. LIMITATIONS.
                  -----------

            (a)   Notwithstanding  any provision contained in this Section 11 to
the  contrary,  no  Indemnitee  shall  be  entitled  to  assert  any  claim  for
indemnification  in  respect  of  breach(es)  of  representations,   warranties,
covenants and  agreements  under  Sections  11.2(a) or 11.2(b) hereof until such
time as all claims for indemnification  hereunder (including those under Section
7 hereof) by such Person (and all related  Indemnitees)  shall exceed $4,000,000
(the  "Deductible"),  after  which  the  amount  of all  claims in excess of the
Deductible  (excluding the Deductible)  shall be recoverable in full;  PROVIDED,
HOWEVER,  that the  aggregate  dollar  amount of PRI's  individual  and the Kali
Shareholders' aggregate  indemnification  obligations hereunder shall not exceed
$32,500,000  (the "Claims  Limitation"),  except (i) if the  Indemnifying  Party
shall  have  made any  representation  or  warranty  contained  herein  that was
fraudulent  or (ii) for breaches of Sections 3.3,  3.13(l),  4.2, 4.7, 6.4, 6.5,
6.9 and 6.10  hereof,  in either of which case and  subject to the terms of such
Sections,  the Claims  Limitation shall not apply and (in respect of clause (ii)
above) any Losses in connection therewith shall not be included or calculated in
determining whether the Claims Limitation has been exceeded. Notwithstanding any
of the  foregoing,  (A) the  Deductible  shall  not  apply to or  cover  (x) any

                                       61
<PAGE>

breach(es)  of the  representations  and  warranties  contained  in Sections 3.1
(other than the last two sentences thereof),  3.2, 3.3, 3.9(d) and (e), 3.13(l),
3.26,  3.27,  4.2,  4.7,  5.1,  5.5 or 5.6  hereof or in the  Estimated  Closing
Certificate or of the covenants and  agreements  contained in Sections 6.4, 6.5,
6.9,  6.10,  6.12,  6.16 and 6.19  hereof or (y)  subject to  Sections  10.2 and
10.3(a) hereof, any breach(es) of the representations,  warranties, covenants or
agreements  contained  herein  if  the  Closing  does  not  occur  and  (B)  the
Deductible,  in respect of any breach(es) of Section 6.1 hereof, shall be deemed
to be $100,000.

            (b)   Notwithstanding  anything set forth in this Agreement,  except
(x) for the right to seek to  specifically  enforce the  covenants  contained in
Sections 6.4, 6.9, 6.10, 6.14 and 6.16 under this Agreement, (y) as specifically
provided in Sections 6.5, 6.13(e), 7 and 10 hereof and (z) for remedies that may
not be waived as a matter of law, the sole and  exclusive  remedy of the Parties
for  breaches  of the  representations,  warranties,  covenants  and  agreements
contained in this Agreement (and any certificate  delivered pursuant hereto), or
otherwise in connection  with the  transactions  contemplated  hereby,  shall be
limited to the indemnification rights set forth in this Section 11.


            11.5. RELATIONSHIP WITH CASH PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS.
                  -------------------------------------------------

            (a)   Notwithstanding  any payment  that may be due to PRI under the
Cash Purchase Price  adjustment  provisions set forth in Sections 2.2(d) and 2.4
hereof, the indemnity  provisions of Section 11.2(a) hereof shall remain in full
force and effect, without any modification or diminution thereof.

            (b)   Notwithstanding  any  payment  that  may be  due  to any  Kali
Shareholder under the Gross-Up  provisions set forth in Section 2.5 hereof,  the
indemnity provisions of Sections 11.2(b) and 11.2(c) hereof shall remain in full
force and effect, without any modification or diminution thereof.


            11.6. INDEMNIFICATION  WAIVER.  Effective upon the Closing,  each of
the  Kali  Shareholders   hereby  irrevocably  waives  any  and  all  rights  to
indemnification  or  contribution  from  Kali,  including  any  under  the  Kali
Organizational  Documents,  in his or her  capacity as a  director,  employee or
officer of Kali,  or as a trustee of any Kali Benefit  Plan,  to which he or she
would  otherwise  have been  entitled for all periods  through the Closing Date,
including in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby.


            11.7. ORDER  OF  INDEMNIFICATION.   PRI  agrees  that  if  the  Kali
Shareholders  are required to make any liquidated  damage  payments  pursuant to
Section 6.5 hereof or make any  indemnification  payments pursuant to Sections 7
or  11.2(a)  hereof,  then such  payments  shall be  sought  first  against  Mr.
Subramanian,  then,  only to the  extent of any  deficiency  or  failure to pay,
against  Ms.  Subramanian  and then,  only to the  extent of any  deficiency  or
failure to pay,  against the IS Trust  and/or the AS Trust,  equally;  PROVIDED,
HOWEVER,  that with respect to Section 10.3  hereof,  any payment of  liquidated
damages (or the Percentage  Amount)  required  thereunder  shall be sought first
against Kali and then,  only to the extent there is any deficiency or failure to
pay, the Kali Shareholders.

                                       62
<PAGE>


            11.8. RESTRICTION   ON   TRANSFER.    In   order   to   secure   any
indemnification  obligations that they have hereunder,  Mr.  Subramanian and Ms.
Subramanian shall not, directly or indirectly, transfer more than $20,000,000 of
the aggregate  Cash Purchase  Price  received by them to their  children (or any
trust or similar vehicle formed for their benefit) or to any  irrevocable  trust
or similar vehicle during the nineteen- (19) month period  following the Closing
Date.


            12.   MISCELLANEOUS.
                  --------------


            12.1. FEES  AND  EXPENSES.  Each of the Kali  Shareholders  (and not
Kali, other than as provided below) and PRI shall  respectively pay all fees and
expenses  incurred  by him/it,  or on his/its  behalf,  in  connection  with the
negotiation,  execution  and  delivery  of this  Agreement  (and the  agreements

so requesting, each Party agrees to execute and deliver to such requesting Party

requested by either Party, including with respect to the prosecution and defense
of any  third-party  claims.  The Party  requesting  assistance  hereunder shall

or to such  other  Person or  address  as any Party  shall  specify by notice in
writing to the other Party(ies).  All such notices,  requests,  demands, waivers
and other  communications  shall be deemed to have been  received on the date on
which so hand-delivered or telecommunicated or delivered by overnight courier or
on the fifth  Business Day following  the date on which so mailed,  except for a
notice of change of address  (which  shall be effected in  accordance  with this
Section 12.3), which shall be effective only upon receipt thereof.


            12.4. ENTIRE  AGREEMENT.   This  Agreement,   the  other  agreements
contemplated  hereby and the  Schedules  hereto and  thereto  contain the entire
understanding  of the Parties hereto with respect to the subject matter thereof.
This Agreement  supersedes all prior  agreements  and  understandings,  oral and
written, with respect to its subject matter.


            12.5. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement shall for any
reason be declared invalid or unenforceable,  such decision shall not affect the
validity or  enforceability  of any of the other  provisions of this  Agreement,


                                       64

which other  provisions shall remain in full force and effect and be enforced to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law.


            12.6. BINDING  EFFECT;  ASSIGNMENT.  This  Agreement  and all of the
provisions  hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties
hereto  and their  respective  successors  (including  any  purchaser  of all or
substantially  all of the assets of a Party),  heirs,  legal  beneficiaries  and
permitted  assigns.  Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,  interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned or delegated, directly or indirectly, by
any Party  hereto  without the prior  written  consent of the other  Party(ies);
PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that PRI may assign and delegate this  Agreement and any or
all of its rights,  interests and obligations hereunder to an Affiliate thereof.
Upon any such  permitted  assignment,  the  references in this  Agreement to the
assigning  party shall also apply to any assignee  unless the context  otherwise
requires,  but such  assignment  will neither relieve the assigning party of its
obligations hereunder nor reduce the economic benefit hereunder to the Party not
assigning  this  Agreement in the event that such assignee fails to perform such
obligations in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.


            12.7. NO THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES.  This Agreement is not intended,
and shall not be deemed, to confer upon or afford any Person (including any past
or current  employee of Kali),  except the Parties hereto (and,  with respect to
Section 11 hereof,  any related  Indemnitees) and their  respective  successors,
heirs, legal  beneficiaries and permitted assigns,  any remedy,  claim, cause of
action or other right under or by reason of this Agreement.


            12.8. COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
each of which  shall be  deemed an  original,  and all of which  together  shall
constitute one and the same instrument.


            12.9. GOVERNING  LAW. This Agreement and any claim related  directly
or indirectly to this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the Laws of the State of New York.


            12.10.  AMENDMENTS;  WAIVERS.  This  Agreement  may not be  amended,
modified or  supplemented  except pursuant to an instrument in writing signed by
PRI  and  the  Kali  Shareholder's  Rep.  Any  failure  of  Kali  and  the  Kali
Shareholders  to comply  with any term or  provision  of this  Agreement  may be
waived by PRI at any time by an  instrument  in writing  signed on behalf of PRI
and any failure of PRI to comply with any term or  provision  of this  Agreement
may be  waived by the Kali  Shareholders'  Rep at any time by an  instrument  in
writing  signed by the Kali  Shareholders'  Rep.  Any such  waiver or failure to
insist upon strict compliance with such term or provision shall not operate as a
waiver of, or estoppel  with  respect  to, any  subsequent  or other  failure to
comply.
