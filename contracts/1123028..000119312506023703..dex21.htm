Subsidiary_ ")) agrees to purchase from each Seller and each of
its Subsidiaries, and each Seller agrees to sell, transfer, convey, assign
and deliver to Buyer (or, in the case of any Acquired Asset designated by
Buyer pursuant to this Section 2.1 to be purchased by a Buyer Subsidiary, to
such Buyer Subsidiary), and to cause each of its Subsidiaries to sell,
transfer, convey, assign and deliver to Buyer (or, in the case of any Acquired

this Agreement, Buyer agrees to assume and become responsible for (or, in the

Subsidiary, to cause such Buyer Subsidiary to assume and become responsible
for) all of the Assumed Liabilities at the Closing. Neither Buyer nor any
Buyer Subsidiary will assume or have any responsibility, however, and Sellers
and their Subsidiaries shall remain entirely liable, for any Excluded
Liabilities.



 

12 2.3 _Purchase Price_.



(a) Not less than five (5) Business Days nor more than ten (10) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to Buyer an estimated pro
forma balance sheet as of the Closing Date, prepared on a basis consistent
with, and not including any line items other than those included in, the Pro
Forma Most Recent Balance Sheet and calculated in accordance with the Agreed
Procedures (the " _Estimated Pro Forma Closing Balance Sheet_ "), accompanied
by a good faith estimate of the Net Assets as of the Closing Date (the "
_Preliminary Statement of Net Assets_ "). 



(b) On or prior to the first Business Day following the date hereof, Buyer
shall deposit the Deposit with the Escrow Agent to be held pursuant to the
terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement.



(c) At the Closing, Buyer shall (i) deposit the Net Asset Escrow Amount with
the Escrow Agent, to be held in an account separate from the Deposit (such
account, the " _Net Asset Escrow Fund_ ") and to be administered pursuant to
Section 2.3(f) and the Escrow Agreement, (ii) pay the Purchase Price, less the
Net Asset Escrow Amount and less the amount of the Deposit (including all
interest accrued thereon), to Parent, in cash by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, and (iii) irrevocably instruct the Escrow Agent to release
the full amount of the Deposit (including all interest accrued thereon)
to Parent. The " _Purchase Price_ " means $170,000,000 less the amount of the
Purchase Price Deduction, provided that the Purchase Price payable at Closing
shall be (i) increased to the extent Net Assets as reflected on

decreased to the extent Net Assets as reflected on the Preliminary Statement
of Net Assets are less than $21,404,207; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A)
there shall be no adjustment if the amount of the adjustment would be less
than $1,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ ") and any adjustment paid shall only be
for amounts by which such adjustment exceeds the Deductible and (B) the
adjustment payable at Closing shall be reduced to the extent that Buyer in
good faith disagrees with the determination of Net Assets reflected on the
Preliminary Statement of Net Assets (and, for purposes of Section 2.3(e), the
Preliminary Statement of Net Assets shall be adjusted to reflect such
disagreement), which disagreement shall be set forth in a written notice to
Parent delivered prior to the Closing that sets forth in reasonably specific
detail the basis for the disagreement, including an explanation of which
items are at issue, the amount of each item at issue and why the item is at
issue. The Purchase Price will be subject to adjustment as set forth in
Section 2.3(e).



(d) As promptly as practicable, but in any event not later than ninety (90)
days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause to be prepared and delivered to
Parent a pro forma balance sheet as of the Closing Date, prepared on a basis
consistent with the Pro Forma Most Recent Balance Sheet and calculated
in accordance with the Agreed Procedures (the " _Actual Pro Forma Closing
Balance Sheet_ "). The Actual Pro Forma Closing Balance Sheet shall be
accompanied by a statement (the " _Closing Statement of Net Assets_ ")
prepared by Buyer and setting forth the Net Assets as of the Closing Date.



(e) The Purchase Price shall be (x) increased to the extent Net Assets
reflected on the Closing Statement of Net Assets are greater than $21,404,207,
or (y) decreased to the extent Net Assets reflected on the Closing Statement
of Net Assets are less than $21,404,207; _provided_ , _however_ , that there
shall be no adjustment if the amount of the adjustment would be  



 

13  less than the Deductible and any adjustment paid shall only be for amounts
by which such adjustment exceeds the Deductible. To the extent that the
Purchase Price as initially determined pursuant to Section 2.3(c) is greater
than the Purchase Price determined pursuant to this Section 2.3(e), Parent
shall pay such difference to Buyer, and to the extent that the Purchase Price
as initially determined pursuant to Section 2.3(c) is less than the Purchase
Price determined pursuant to this Section 2.3(e), Buyer shall pay such
difference to Parent. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 2.3(e)
shall be referred to as the " _Purchase Price Adjustment_ " and (i) if to be
paid by Buyer shall be paid within two Business Days of the determination of
the Closing Statement of Net Assets and (ii) if to be paid by Parent shall be
made in accordance with Section 2.3(f). The parties shall treat any
adjustment made pursuant to this Section 2.3(e) as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for all purposes. This Section 2.3(e) shall be subject in all
cases to Sections 2.3(f) and 2.3(h). 



(f) If Parent is required to make any Purchase Price Adjustment pursuant to
Section 2.3(e), Buyer may submit to Parent and the Escrow Agent a notice (the
" _Escrow Adjustment Notice_ "), identifying such Purchase Price Adjustment.
If Parent does not submit a Notice of Disagreement pursuant to Section 2.3(h)
within 20 days after Buyer gives notice of such Escrow Adjustment Notice to
Parent and the Escrow Agent, Buyer may withdraw from the Net Asset Escrow Fund
the Purchase Price Adjustment. If Parent does submit a Notice of Disagreement
pursuant to Section 2.3(h) within 20 days after Buyer gives notice of such
Escrow Adjustment Notice to Parent and the Escrow Agent, then following
resolution of such dispute, Buyer may withdraw from the Net Asset Escrow Fund
the Purchase Price Adjustment as so determined in writing by Buyer and
Parent. Following the 90th day following the Closing Date, the Net Asset
Escrow Amount shall be distributed to Parent pursuant to the terms of, and
subject to the conditions of, the Escrow Agreement.



(g) As used herein, " _Net Assets_ " means (i) the sum of assets minus (ii)
the sum of liabilities as set forth on the Estimated Pro Forma Closing
Balance Sheet or the Actual Pro Forma Closing Balance Sheet, as the case may
be.



(h) If Parent in good faith disagrees with the Actual Pro Forma Closing
Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement of Net Assets or the Escrow
Adjustment Notice, then Parent shall notify Buyer in writing (the " _Notice
of Disagreement_ ") of such disagreement within twenty (20) days after the
delivery of the Actual Pro Forma Closing Balance Sheet, Closing Statement of
Net Assets or Escrow Adjustment Notice to Parent, as the case may be. The
Notice of Disagreement shall set forth in reasonably specific, detail the
basis for the disagreement, including an explanation of which items are at
issue, the amount of each item at issue and why the item is at issue.
Thereafter, Buyer and Parent shall attempt in good faith to resolve and
finally determine the Actual Pro Forma Closing Balance Sheet or Closing
Statement of Net Assets, as the case may be. If Buyer and Parent are
unable to resolve the disagreement within twenty (20) days after delivery of
the Notice of Disagreement, then (i) if the amount of the dispute is less than
$1,000,000, Buyer and Parent shall submit the dispute over the disputed items
to non binding mediation before a mutually agreed mediator, with the
mediation to be conducted in Wilmington, Delaware, and if the disputed items
cannot be resolved through such mediation within 60 days after delivery of the
Notice of Disagreement, any Party may file a motion in Parents Chapter 11
Case to resolve such dispute in accordance with Section 9.9 and (ii) if the
amount of the dispute is $1,000,000 or greater, any Party may immediately file
a motion in Parents Chapter 11 Case to resolve such dispute in accordance
with Section 9.9.



 

14 (i) Buyer shall seek to satisfy any claims for any Purchase Price Adjustment
from the Net Asset Escrow Fund before proceeding against any Seller;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer claims for any Purchase Price Adjustment
shall not be limited to the Net Asset Escrow Fund.



2.4 _The Closing_. The closing of the Transactions (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of WilmerHale, 399 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10022
commencing at 10:00 a.m. local time as promptly as practicable (and in no
event later than the second Business Day) following the satisfaction or waiver
of all conditions to the obligations of the Parties to consummate the
Transactions (other than conditions with respect to actions the respective
Parties will take at the Closing itself, it being understood that the
occurrence of the Closing shall remain subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions) or such other date as the Parties may mutually
determine. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ".



2.5 _Allocation_. After the Closing, the Parties shall each use commercially
reasonable efforts to promptly agree on an allocation of the Purchase Price
among Sellers and their Subsidiaries, and the Acquired Assets, in accordance
with Code Section 1060 and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (and any
similar provision of Law, as appropriate), which allocation shall be binding
upon Sellers (and their Subsidiaries) and Buyer. Buyer, Sellers and their
Affiliates shall report, act and file Tax Returns (including Internal Revenue
Service Form 8594) in all respects and for all purposes consistent with
such allocation. Neither Buyer nor Sellers shall, nor shall any Seller permit
any of its Subsidiaries to, take any position (whether in audits, Tax Returns
or otherwise) that is inconsistent with such allocation unless required to do
so by applicable Law. Parent shall be responsible for distributing the
Purchase Price among the Sellers and their Subsidiaries in a manner consistent
with such allocation.

or commenced against any of them alleging any failure so to comply. None of

a violation by any Seller or any of its Subsidiaries of any applicable Law or
any judgment, order or decree of any Governmental Entity. Each of Sellers and
each of their Subsidiaries have in effect all material Federal, state and
local, domestic and foreign, governmental consents, approvals, orders,
authorizations, certificates, filings, notices, permits, concessions,
franchises, licenses and rights (collectively " _Permits_ ") necessary for
them to own, lease or operate their properties and assets and to carry on the
Business as currently conducted and there has occurred no violation of, or
default (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) under, or event
giving to any other person any right of termination, amendment or cancellation
of, any such Permit. Neither the Transactions, in and of themselves, nor the
commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, will cause the revocation or
cancellation of any such Permit.



3.10 _Tax Matters_.



(a) Sellers and each of their Subsidiaries have properly filed on a timely
basis all material Tax Returns relating to the Acquired Assets that they
were required to file, and all such Tax Returns were true, correct and
complete in all material respects. Sellers and each of their Subsidiaries have
paid on a timely basis all Taxes relating to the Acquired Assets that were due
and payable. The unpaid Taxes of Sellers and their Subsidiaries relating to
the Acquired Assets for Tax periods through the date of the Most Recent
Balance Sheet do not exceed the accruals and reserves for such Taxes
(excluding accruals and reserves for deferred Taxes established to reflect
timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the Most Recent
Balance Sheet and all unpaid Taxes of Sellers and their Subsidiaries relating
to the Acquired Assets for all Tax periods commencing after the date of the
Most Recent Balance Sheet arose in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice and are of a type and amount commensurate with such Taxes
attributable to prior similar periods. All material Taxes relating to the
Acquired Assets that any Seller or any of its Subsidiaries was required by
Law to withhold or collect have been duly withheld or collected and, to the
extent required, have been properly paid to the appropriate Governmental
Entity.

physical access to Buyer during an on-site visit by Buyer and its
representatives (i) complete and correct copies of all Tax Returns of Sellers

yet  



 

20  expired, and (ii) complete and correct copies of all private letter rulings,
revenue agent reports, information document requests, notices of
proposed deficiencies, deficiency notices, protests, petitions, closing
agreements, settlement agreements, pending ruling requests and any similar
documents submitted by, received by, or agreed to by or on behalf of any
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries relating to such Taxes for all taxable
periods for which the statute of limitations has not yet expired. No
examination or audit of any Tax Return of any Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to the Acquired Assets by any Governmental Entity
is currently in progress or, to the Knowledge of Sellers, threatened or
contemplated. None of Sellers or any of their Subsidiaries has been informed
by any jurisdiction that the jurisdiction believes that such Seller or
Subsidiary of Seller was required to file any Tax Return relating to the
Acquired Assets that was not filed. None of Sellers or their Subsidiaries has
(i) waived any statute of limitations with respect to Taxes relating to the
Acquired Assets or agreed to extend the period for assessment or collection
of any such Taxes, (ii) requested any extension of time within which to file
any Tax Return relating to the Acquired Assets, which Tax Return has not yet
been filed, or (iii) executed or filed any power of attorney with any taxing
authority.



(c) _Schedule 3.10(c)_ sets forth each jurisdiction (other than United States
federal) in which each Seller and each of its Subsidiaries files, is required
to file or has been required to file a Tax Return relating to the Acquired
Assets or is or has been liable for any Taxes relating to the Acquired Assets
on a "nexus" basis.



(d) There are no liens or other encumbrances with respect to Taxes upon any
Acquired Assets, other than with respect to Taxes not yet due and payable or
being contested in good faith through appropriate proceedings and for which
adequate reserves have been recorded.



(e) The representations and warranties set forth in this Section 3.10 are not
applicable to the extent that the Acquired Assets cannot be made subject to
Tax liens and the Buyer cannot be made liable for Taxes relating to the
matters constituting breaches of such representations and warranties.



3.11  _Leased Real Property_.



(a) _Schedule 3.11(a)_ sets forth the address of each parcel of Leased Real
Property, and a list of all Leases for each such Leased Real Property. Each
Seller has delivered or Made Available to Buyer a true and complete copy of
each such Lease document (including any related documents or agreements,
including license agreement and service or executive suite arrangements), and
in the case of any oral Lease, a written summary of the material terms of such
Lease. With respect to each of the Leases:



(i) Each Seller that is party to such Lease either (A) has paid all rent due

(ii) such Lease is valid, binding, enforceable and in full force and effect;



 

21 (iii) subject to Bankruptcy Court approval, the consummation of the
Transactions (including the assignment of the Lease to Buyer (or to a Buyer
Subsidiary, if applicable)) does not require the consent of any other party to
such Lease (or, in the case of any Lease that is a sublease, the consent of
any other party to the underlying lease), and will not result in a breach of
or default under such Lease (or, in the case of any Lease that is a sublease,
the underlying lease), and will not otherwise cause such Lease (or, in the
case of any Lease that is a sublease, the underlying lease) to cease to be
valid, binding, enforceable and in full force and effect on identical terms
following the Closing;



(iv) to the Knowledge of Seller, there are no material disputes (including
with any contractors or subcontractors), oral agreements, or
forbearance programs in effect, in each case involving any Seller or any
other party to any Lease, with respect to such Lease;



(v) except with respect to Bankruptcy Ipso Facto Provisions, no Seller, and to
the Knowledge of Sellers none of the other parties thereto (and, in the case
of any Lease that is a sublease, to the Knowledge of Sellers none of the
parties thereto) are, in breach of or default under such Lease, and to the
Knowledge of Sellers, no event has occurred or circumstance exists that, with
the delivery of notice, the passage of time or both, would constitute such a
breach or default by Seller (or, in the case of any Lease that is a sublease,
by any party to the underlying lease), or permit the termination, modification
or acceleration by the other party thereto (or, in the case of any Lease that
is a sublease, any party to the underlying lease) of rent or any other
obligation under such Lease (or, in the case of any Lease that is a sublease,
under the underlying lease);

such Lease has been applied in respect of a breach of or default under such
Lease;

and other services necessary for the operation of said facilities; 



(x) no Seller has subleased, licensed or otherwise granted any Person the
right to use or occupy the Leased Real Property or any portion thereof;



(xi) no Seller has collaterally assigned or granted any other Lien in such
Lease or any interest therein; and



(xii) _Schedule 3.11(a)(xii)_ sets forth the expiration date under such Lease,
the current monthly rental payment and the amount of the security deposit
currently held by or for the landlord on behalf of any Seller with respect to
such Lease.



 

22 (b) The Leased Real Property comprises all of the real property used in the
business of Sellers; and no Seller is a party to any agreement or option to
purchase any real property or interest therein. No Seller owns any real
property or any interest therein.



3.12 _Intellectual Property_.



(a) Sellers have Made Available to Buyer a list of all Intellectual Property
Registrations that are registered or filed in the name of any Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries, alone or jointly with others (the " _Seller
Registrations_ ") in each case, enumerating specifically the applicable filing
or registration number, title, jurisdiction in which filing was made or from
which registration issued, date of filing or issuance, names of all current
applicant(s) and registered owners(s), as applicable. All assignments of
Seller Registrations to any Seller or any of its Subsidiaries have been
properly executed and recorded. To the Knowledge of Sellers, all Seller
Registrations are valid and enforceable and all issuance, renewal, maintenance
and other payments that are or have become due with respect thereto have been
timely paid by or on behalf of Sellers and their Subsidiaries.



(b) There are no inventorship challenges, opposition or nullity proceedings
or interferences pending with respect to any Patent Rights included in the
Seller Registrations, or to the Knowledge of Sellers, threatened. Sellers and
each of their Subsidiaries have complied with their duty of candor and
disclosure to the United States Patent and Trademark Office and any relevant
foreign patent office with respect to all patent and trademark applications
filed by or on behalf of any Seller or any of its Subsidiaries and have made
no material misrepresentation in such applications. To the Knowledge of
Sellers, there are no facts or circumstances that would preclude any Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries from having clear title to the Seller Registrations or
affecting the patentability or enforceability of any Seller Registrations.



(c) Each item of Seller Intellectual Property will be owned or available for
use by Buyer (or to a Buyer Subsidiary, if applicable) immediately following
the Closing on substantially identical terms and conditions as it was owned
or available for use by Sellers or any of their Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Closing (excluding the effect of actions taken by Buyer or any
Buyer Subsidiary). Parent or one of its Subsidiaries is the sole and exclusive
owner of all Seller Owned Intellectual Property, free and clear of Liens. The
Seller Intellectual Property includes all Intellectual Property owned by or
licensed to any Seller or any of its Subsidiaries and used (i) to Exploit the
Customer Offerings in the manner so done currently, (ii) to use the material
Internal Systems as they are currently used by Sellers or any of their
Subsidiaries, and (iii) otherwise to conduct the Business in all material
respects in the manner currently conducted. 



(d) Each Seller and each of its Subsidiaries has taken reasonable measures in
accordance with normal industry practice to protect the proprietary nature of
each material item of Seller Owned Intellectual Property, and to maintain in
confidence all material trade secrets and confidential information comprising
a part thereof. No complaint alleging improper use or disclosure of any
personal information is pending or, to the Knowledge of Sellers, has been
threatened in writing against any Seller or any of its Subsidiaries. To the
Knowledge of Sellers, there has been no: (i) unauthorized disclosure of any
material third party proprietary or confidential information in the
possession, custody or control of any Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, or
(ii) material breach of the security procedures of any Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries wherein confidential information has been disclosed to a third
person.



 

23 (e) To the Knowledge of Sellers, none of the Customer Offerings, or the
Exploitation thereof specified by any Seller or any of their Subsidiaries in
their user Documentation, infringe or constitute a misappropriation of, any
Intellectual Property rights of any third party. None of the Internal Systems
(excluding those portions of the Internal Systems licensed from third
parties), or the Sellers or any of their Subsidiaries past or current
Exploitation thereof, infringes or constitutes a misappropriation of, any
Intellectual Property rights of any third party. No legal proceedings
are pending or threatened in writing against any Seller or any of its
Subsidiary alleging any such infringement or misappropriation and no request
or demand for indemnification or defense has been received by any Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries from any reseller, distributor, customer or user or
any other third party.



(f) To the Knowledge of Sellers, no Person (including any current or former

or misappropriating any of the Seller Owned Intellectual Property. Sellers
have delivered or Made Available to Buyer copies of all complaints, claims,
notices or threats concerning the infringement or misappropriation of any
Seller Owned Intellectual Property.



(g) Sellers have Made Available to Buyer a list identifying each license,
covenant or other agreement (other than agreements between Seller or any of

consistent with past practice) pursuant to which any Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries has assigned, transferred, licensed or distributed, or covenanted
not to assert any right, with respect to any past, existing or future Seller
Intellectual Property. None of Sellers or any of their Subsidiaries has agreed
to indemnify any Person, outside the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice, with respect to any current product of any Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries against any infringement, violation or misappropriation of
any Intellectual Property rights with respect to any Customer Offerings or
any third partys Intellectual Property rights. None of Sellers or any of
their Subsidiaries is a member of or party to any patent pool, industry
standards body or trade association pursuant to the rules of which it is
obligated to license any existing or future Intellectual Property to any
Person.



(h) Sellers have Made Available to Buyer a list identifying (i) each item of
Seller Licensed Intellectual Property and the agreements pursuant to which
any Seller or any of its Subsidiaries are licensed such Seller Licensed

for which the total royalties or other license fees do not exceed $50,000 per

Property, to the Knowledge of Sellers, no third party inventions, methods,
services, materials, processes or Software are included in or required to

Subsidiaries from third parties other than pursuant to the license agreements
identified on a list Made Available by Sellers to Buyer.



(i) None of the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements by any Seller, the performance by such Seller of
its obligations hereunder and thereunder, including any obligations in
respect of any Chapter 11 Case, nor the consummation of the Transactions will:
(i) constitute a material breach of or default under any instrument, license
or other agreement governing any Seller Intellectual Property (collectively,
the " _Seller Intellectual Property Agreements_ "); (ii) cause the forfeiture
or termination of, or give rise to a right of forfeiture or termination of,
any Seller Intellectual Property; (iii) result in the grant of any rights to
any Seller Intellectual Property to any third party; or (iv) materially impair
the right of Buyer (or of a Buyer Subsidiary, if applicable) to use, develop,
make, have made, offer for sale, sell, import, copy, modify, create
derivative works of, distribute, license, or dispose of any Seller
Intellectual Property or portion thereof. There are no royalties, honoraria,
fees or other payments payable by any Seller or any of their Subsidiaries to
any third person (other than salaries payable to employees and independent
contractors not contingent on or related to use of their work product) as a
result of the use, license-in, manufacture, sale, offering for sale, copying,
distribution, or disposition of any Seller Intellectual Property by any Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries and none shall become payable as a result of the
consummation of the Transactions. Immediately after the Closing, all Seller

restriction and without payment of any kind to any third party.

or disclosed, the source code for any Software included in the Customer
Offerings (" _Seller Source Code_ ") to any Person, and Sellers and each of
their Subsidiaries have taken reasonable physical and electronic security
measures to prevent disclosure of such Seller Source Code. No event has
occurred, and no circumstance or condition exists, that (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) will, or could reasonably be expected to,
nor will the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, result in
the disclosure or release of such Seller Source Code by any Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries, its escrow agent(s), or any other person to any third party.



(k) All of the Software and Documentation comprising, incorporated in
or bundled with the Customer Offerings or Internal Systems (excluding those
portions of the Internal Systems licensed from third parties) has been
designed, authored, tested and debugged by employees of any Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries within the scope of their employment or by independent
contractors of any Seller or any of its Subsidiaries who have executed valid
and binding agreements expressly assigning all right, title and interest in
such copyrightable materials to such Seller or such Subsidiary of Seller,
waiving their non-assignable rights (including moral rights) to the extent
legally permissible in favor of such Seller or such Subsidiary of Seller and
its permitted assigns and licensees.



(l) None of Sellers or any of their Subsidiaries has used Open
Source Materials that (i) create obligations for any Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to the Customer Offerings or require that Customer
Offerings be (A) disclosed or distributed in source code form, (B) licensed
for the purpose of making derivative works, or (C) redistributable at no
charge or minimal charge); or (ii) provide for the grant of a patent license
in consideration of the licenses granted to the Open Source Materials.



 

25 (m) Each employee of each Seller and each of its Subsidiaires, and each
independent contractor of each Seller and each of its Subsidiaries involved
in the development of any Customer Offerings, has executed a valid and binding
written agreement expressly assigning to Sellers or one of their Subsidiaries
all right, title and interest in any inventions and works of authorship,

employment or such independent contractors work for Sellers or their
Subsidiaries, and all Intellectual Property rights therein, and has waived all
moral rights therein to the extent legally permissible.

obsolete, damaged, or defective, subject in each case only to the reserve for

this Agreement and the Transactions, and, assuming the accuracy of Buyers
representation in Section 4.7, such approval constitutes approval of the

the generality of the foregoing in this Section 5.4, each Seller shall give
Buyer the opportunity to participate in the defense of any litigation against
such Seller and/or its Board of Directors relating to the Transactions, it
being understood and agreed that this Section 5.4 shall not give Buyer the
right to direct such defense or restrict any Chapter 11 Seller from complying
with its obligations as debtor-in-possession in its Chapter 11 Case.



 

39 5.5 _Regulatory Matters_.



(a) Each of the Parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, that are necessary, proper or advisable for
(i) obtaining all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents,
approvals, orders and authorizations from, and the giving of any necessary
notices to, Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary
registrations, declarations and filings (including filings under the HSR Act
and other registrations, declarations and filings with, or notices to,
Governmental Entities, if any), and (ii) the taking of all reasonable steps as
may be necessary to avoid any suit, claim, action, investigation or
proceeding by any Governmental Entity (other than the commencement of the
Chapter 11 Cases pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement). Sellers
and Buyer shall, and shall cause each of their Subsidiaries to, provide such
assistance, information and cooperation to the other as is reasonably required
to obtain any such nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and
authorizations and, in connection therewith, will notify the other promptly
following the receipt of any comments from any Governmental Entity and of any
request by any Governmental Entity for amendments, supplements or additional
information in respect of any registration, declaration or filing with,
or notice to, such Governmental Entity and shall supply the other person with
copies of all correspondence between such person or any of its
representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity, on the other
hand; provided, however, that the Parties will promptly comply with a request
for additional information and documents issued by the FTC or DOJ (so-called
"Second Request") and any similar request under the competition or antitrust
laws of any other jurisdiction. 



(b) Notwithstanding Sections 5.4 or 5.5, or any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall any Party be obligated to agree
or proffer to divest or hold separate, or enter into any licensing or similar
arrangement with respect to, (x) any assets (whether tangible or intangible)
or any portion of any business of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, (y) any
material portion of the Acquired Assets (whether tangible or intangible) or
(z) any material portion of the Business.



5.6 _Full Access_. Between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing, Sellers will permit Buyer and any representatives of Buyer
(including legal counsel and accountants) to have full access at all
reasonable times, and in a manner so as not to interfere with the normal
business operations of Sellers or due diligence being conducted by other
Persons in accordance with the Bidding Procedures Order, to all premises,
properties, personnel, books, records, contracts and documents of or
pertaining to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries. Between the date of
this Agreement and the Closing, Sellers shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to permit Buyer and any representatives of Buyer (including legal
counsel and accountants) to have full access to Sellers and their
Subsidiaries auditors (and, to the extent reasonably practicable, former
auditors) (subject to a customary confidentiality undertaking). Any
confidential or proprietary information disclosed by Sellers to Buyer in the
course of the reviews contemplated by this Section 5.6 shall be "Confidential
Information" (whether or not marked "Confidential") and shall be subject to
the Confidentiality Agreement dated August 9, 2005 (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), between Buyer and Parent.



 

40 5.7 _Notice of Developments_.



(a) Parent shall give prompt written notice to Buyer if, at any time, (i) any
Effect exists or has occurred that would make any of Sellers representations
or warranties untrue or incorrect in any material respect if made as of such
time or (ii) Seller shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or
failure to perform would give rise to a failure of the condition set forth in
Section 6.2(b).



(b) Buyer shall give prompt written notice to Parent if, at any time, (i) any
Effect exists or has occurred that would make any of Buyers representations
or warranties untrue or incorrect in any material respect if made as of such
time or (ii) Buyer shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach
or failure to perform would give rise to a failure of the condition set forth
in Section 6.3(b).



5.8 _No Solicitation_.



(a) From the date of this Agreement until the commencement of the Chapter 11
Cases, no Seller shall, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries
to, authorize or permit any director or officer of any Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries or any investment banker, attorney, accountant or other advisor
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") of any Seller or any of its Subsidiaries
to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or
take any other action knowingly to facilitate, any Takeover Proposal (as
defined below), (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person (other than
Buyer or its Subsidiaries, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other
advisors, or any of Sellers or their Subsidiaries Representatives, in each
case in their capacity as such) any information with respect to, any Takeover
Proposal, or (iii) waive or release any provision of, or consent to any matter
with respect to which its consent is required under, any standstill agreement
to which any Seller or any of its Subsidiaries is a party. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any director, officer or
employee of any Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.8(a) by
Sellers.



(b) From the date of this Agreement until the commencement of the Chapter 11
Cases, neither the Board of Directors of Parent nor any committee
thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Buyer, or propose
publicly to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Buyer, the resolution
authorizing this Agreement and the Transactions, or recommend, or propose
publicly to recommend, the approval or adoption of any Takeover Proposal, or
resolve or agree to take any such action (any such action or any such
resolution or agreement to take such action being referred to herein as an "
_Adverse Recommendation Change_ "); (ii) adopt or approve any Takeover
Proposal or propose publicly to adopt or approve any Takeover Proposal or
resolve or agree to take any such action or (iii) cause or permit any Seller
or any of their Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum
of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, asset
purchase agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement (each, an "
_Acquisition Agreement_ ") constituting or related to, or which is intended
to or is reasonably likely to lead to, any Takeover Proposal, or resolve or
agree to take any such action.



 

41 (c) From the date of this Agreement until the commencement of the Chapter 11
Cases, Parent shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours after any

has been received) advise Buyer in writing of any Takeover Proposal, or any
material amendment to any Takeover Proposal, indicating the identity, the
terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal and the identity of the Person
making such Takeover Proposal. Parent shall thereafter keep Buyer reasonably
informed of all material developments affecting the status and terms of any
such Takeover Proposal, and Parent shall promptly (and in any event within 24
hours) provide to Buyer copies of any additional written materials received
that relate to such Takeover Proposal and the status of any discussions
or negotiations with the Person making such Takeover Proposal and any of its
representatives. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Listed Officer_ " means
the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Strategy Officer
and General Counsel of Parent.



(d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.8 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit Parent from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to Parents stockholders if, in
the good faith judgment of Parents Board of Directors, failure so to disclose
would be inconsistent with applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall Parent or its Board of Directors or any committee thereof take,
agree or resolve to take any action prohibited by Section 5.8(b).



(e) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any person other than Buyer relating to, or
that is reasonably likely to lead to, any direct or indirect acquisition, in
one transaction or a series of transactions, including by way of any merger,
consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer, stock acquisition,
asset acquisition, binding share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture or similar
transaction, of (i) assets or businesses that constitute or represent 10% or
more of (x) the total revenue, operating income or assets of Sellers and
their Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (y) the book value of the total
assets of Sellers and their Subsidiaires, taken as a whole or (ii) 10% or more
of the outstanding shares of Parents common stock, in each case other than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



5.9 _Taxes_.



(a) Sellers shall prepare and timely file or shall cause to be prepared and
timely filed all Tax Returns for Sellers and their Subsidiaries for all
periods. Sellers shall be liable for any Taxes of Sellers and their
Subsidiaries for all periods.



(b) Sellers shall be responsible for the payment of any federal, state,
local or foreign transfer, sales, use, stamp, conveyance, value added,
recording, registration, documentary, filing and other non-income Taxes and
administrative fees (including, without limitation, notary fees) arising in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions, whether imposed by Law
on any Seller, any Subsidiary of Seller, Buyer or any Buyer Subsidiary.



 

42 (c) All real property Taxes, personal property Taxes and similar _ad valorem_
obligations levied with respect to the Acquired Assets for a taxable period
that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date shall be apportioned
between the appropriate Seller and Buyer as of the Closing Date based on the
number of days of such taxable period included in the period ending with and
including the Closing Date (with respect to any such taxable period, the "
_Pre-Closing Tax Period_ "), and the number of days of such taxable period
beginning after the Closing Date (with respect to any such taxable period,
the " _Post-Closing Tax Period_ "). Sellers shall be liable for the
proportionate amount of such Taxes that is attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period, and Buyer shall be liable for the proportionate amount of such Taxes
that is attributable to the Post-Closing Tax Period. If bills for such Taxes
have not been issued as of the Closing Date, and, if the amount of such Taxes
for the period including the Closing Date is not then known,
the apportionment of such Taxes shall be made at Closing on the basis of the
prior periods Taxes. After Closing, upon receipt of bills for the period
including the Closing Date, adjustments to the apportionment shall be made by
the Parties, so that if either Party paid more than its proper share at the
Closing, the other Party shall promptly reimburse such Party for the excess
amount paid by it.



(d) Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to obligate
Buyer or Sellers to pay any tax on any transaction that is exempt
from taxation pursuant to Section 1146 of the Bankruptcy Code.



5.10 _Bulk Sales Laws_. Buyer and each Seller (including on behalf of its
Subsidiaries) that is not a Chapter 11 Seller hereby waive compliance by Buyer
and such Seller and its Subsidiaries with the "bulk sales" or "bulk transfer"
Laws and any other similar Laws in any applicable jurisdiction in respect of
the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that this Section 5.10 shall not
apply to any Law requiring notice to any Tax authority, and all such notices
shall be provided by Sellers and their Subsidiaries.



5.11 _Use of Parent s Name_. From and after the Closing, none of Sellers or
any of their Subsidiaries shall use the name "Riverstone" or any trade names,
trademarks, identifying logos or service marks included in the Acquired
Assets or any part or variation of any of the foregoing or any confusingly
similar trade names, trademarks or logos; provided, however, that during the
90-day period following the Closing Date, the Sellers and their Subsidiaries
may use the words "(formerly Riverstone Networks, Inc.)" after its use of its
new corporate name. Within two Business Days following the Closing Date,
Parent shall amend its certificate of incorporation and bylaws as necessary to
comply with this Section 5.11 and shall cause each other Seller and each of
its Subsidiaries to amend its governing documents promptly thereafter. The
Chapter 11 Sellers shall seek to modify any official caption in the Chapter 11
Cases to reflect the name changes contemplated herein.



5.12 _Non-Compete_. Sellers shall not, and shall not permit their
Subsidiaries to, at any time during the five-year period immediately following
the Closing Date, directly or indirectly, own, manage, control, engage in or
participate in the ownership, management or control of, or be otherwise
affiliated in any manner with, or provide any services or advice of a
competitive nature to, any business similar to the Business; _provided,
however,_ that the foregoing shall not prohibit any Seller from individually
or collectively owning as a passive investment 5% or less of the equity
securities of any publicly traded entity.



 

43 5.13 _Employees_.



(a) Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall offer, or shall cause a Subsidiary of
Buyer to offer, employment to those employees of Sellers and their
Subsidiaries named on the list (which Buyer has provided to Parent) titled
"Employees to Receive Offers" (excluding those absent on the Closing Date due
to illness, short-term disability or other approved leave of absence) (those
who accept such offers, the " _Continuing Employees_ ") and shall not offer
employment to any employees not named on such. Such employment shall commence
immediately after the Closing Date, under wage terms comparable in the
aggregate to those enjoyed by the Continuing Employees immediately prior to
the Closing Date and under employee benefit plans that provide substantially
the same level of coverage and benefits as those provided to similarly
situated employees of Buyer (and in no event materially less than those
provided by Sellers and their Subsidiaries in the aggregate). Such offers of
employment shall be in writing and delivered prior to the Closing Date and
shall require each Continuing Employee accepting such offer, no later than
three Business Days before the Closing Date, to: (i) deliver to Buyer such
Continuing Employees written acceptance of such offer, and (ii) deliver to
Sellers and their Subsidiaries (as applicable) such Continuing Employees
written resignation of employment with the applicable Seller or Subsidiary of
one of Sellers that employed such Continuing Employee, which resignation shall
be effective immediately prior to the Closing. Employment of any transferring
employee will be subject to, among other things: (1) the transferring employee
providing Buyer with documentation of eligibility to work in their particular
location, if required, (2) the transferring employee completing any paperwork
necessary to process paychecks (e.g., Form W-4), (3) the transferring employee
signing Buyers standard form of intellectual property agreement, (4) Buyers
verification that there are no agreements in place that would prohibit
employing the individual (e.g., employment agreements), (5) the transferring
employee certifying that he/she has received and reviewed the Buyers Business
Guideposts (code of conduct), (6) the transferring employee taking and
successfully completing any mandatory training programs ( _e.g._ , Buyers
ethics and FCPA on-line training courses), (7) the Continuing Employee
complying with other requests and/or satisfying other requirements of Buyer (
_e.g._ , drug screen, background check, _etc._ ). In addition, Buyer shall
make offers of employment on similar terms to each employee of Seller and its
Subsidiaries named on the list (which Buyer has provided to Parent)
titled "Employees to Receive Offers" who, on the Closing Date, is absent due
to illness, short-term disability or other approved leave of absence and is
able and willing to return to work within ninety (90) days after the Closing
Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to those employees named on
the list (which Buyer has provided to Parent) titled "Employees to Receive
Offers" and who are identified therein as foreign employees, Buyers offer
of employment and the subsequent transfer of employment shall be deferred for
such period of time as is advisable in the reasonable judgment of Buyer to
comply with the requirements of local law, and Seller shall cooperate with and
assist Buyer in connection with the making of such offers and the
transitioning of such employees.



(b) Any employee employed in, or assigned to, any business of any Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries within the European Union (any such employee, a ("
_E.U. Continuing Employee_ "), will, upon Closing, transfer automatically to
the employment of Buyer (or a Buyer Subsidiary), pursuant to local laws giving
effect to the EU Acquired Rights Directive. To the extent permitted by local
laws; however, Buyer (or a Buyer Subsidiary, if applicable) may, in its  



 

44  discretion, negotiate with such employees to reach agreement to changed
terms of employment with such employees, and if such changes are agreed and
lawfully implemented prior to Closing, the employee shall transfer to the
employment of the Buyer (or a Buyer Subsidiary, if applicable) on such changed
terms.



(c) Buyer shall, upon request by Parent, furnish to Parent any information
concerning any measures (within the meaning of the Regulations and
the Directive) that Buyer intends to take with respect to the Transactions in
relation to any E.U. Continuing Employee. " _Regulations_ " means the Transfer
of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981, (as amended, re-
enacted or extended from time to time). " _Directive_ " means Acquired Rights
Directive 77/187, (as amended, re-enacted or extended from time to time).



(d) All health care benefit plans of Buyer or its Subsidiaries that are
subject to U.S. law in which the Continuing Employees participate after the
Closing Date (the " _Successor Plans_ ") shall provide coverage for pre-
existing health conditions to the same extent those conditions were covered
under the applicable plans or programs in effect for such Continuing
Employees under Parents comparable Employee Benefit Plans immediately prior
to the Closing Date (collectively, the " _Sellers  Health Care Plan_"), and
all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods
shall accordingly be waived with respect to their participation and coverage
under those Successor Plans, other than limitations or waiting periods that
one or more Continuing Employees had not yet satisfied under the Sellers
Health Care Plan as of the Closing Date, and the Continuing Employees shall
also be given credit for amounts paid by them under the Sellers Health Care
Plan, for the portion of the plan year preceding their transfer to
the Successor Plans, for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and
out-of-pocket maximums under the Successor Plan, as though such amounts had in
fact been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Successor
Plan.



(e) Parent agrees to terminate its savings/401(k) plan for U.S.
employees within 60 days after the Closing Date, and shall promptly take all
steps necessary to provide for the orderly windup and distribution of assets
of such plan to the plans participants as soon as practicable.



5.14 _Limitation on Distributions to Stockholders_. Parent shall not make
distributions of any kind to its stockholders until all Liabilities of each
Seller and each of its Subsidiaries that would be required by GAAP to be set
forth on a balance sheet or in the notes thereto (other than Assumed
Liabilities) have been satisfied, or provided or reserved for, in full in
accordance with applicable Law.



5.15 _Investigation_. Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to conclude the allegations against Sellers and its
Subsidiaries set forth in the "Wells Notices" dated October 28, 2005 (the "
_SEC Investigation_ ") either by (a) receipt of a written notice from the
Staff of the SEC that it will not recommend that charges be brought against
any Seller or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to the SEC Investigation
or (b) entry of a final court or administrative order as to Sellers and their
Subsidiaries on terms reasonably satisfactory to Buyer (it being understood
that the entry of the draft administrative order previously Made Available to
Buyer and there being no other SEC enforcement action as to Sellers or any of
their Subsidiaries (consistent with the correspondence between Parent and the
SEC Staff previously  



 

45  Made Available to Buyer) is reasonably satisfactory to Buyer). Sellers shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to confer and consult on a regular
basis with Buyer with respect to the SEC Investigation, to keep Buyer
apprised of the status of the SEC Investigation and to promptly advise Buyer
of any material event, change, circumstance or development relating to or
arising from the SEC Investigation.



5.16 _Estoppel Certificates_. Prior to Closing, with respect to the Leases
identified on _Schedule 5.16_ , Sellers shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain from the landlord under each such Lease (other than a Lease
that has been assumed and assigned to Buyer under the Bankruptcy Code) a
customary estoppel certificate in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to Buyer.



5.17 _FIRPTA Tax Certificates_. At or prior to the Closing, each Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries that is transferring any United States real property
interest as defined in Section 897(c) of the Code shall deliver or cause to be
delivered to Buyer a certification that it is not a foreign person in
accordance with the Treasury Regulations under Section 1445 of the Code. If
any such transferor has not provided the certification described above to
Buyer on or before the Closing Date, Buyer shall be permitted to withhold from
the Purchase Price an amount equal to any required withholding Tax under
Section 1445 of the Code.



5.18 _Further Assurances_. At any time and from time to time after the
Closing, as and when requested by any Party hereto and at such Partys
expense, the other Party shall promptly execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, all such documents, instruments and certificates and
shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other actions as are
reasonably necessary to evidence and effectuate the Transactions.



5.19 _Escrow Agreement_. Prior to Buyers depositing the Deposit with the
Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 2.3(b), Buyer and Parent shall enter into
the Escrow Agreement with the Escrow Agent.



5.20  _Transition Services_. If appropriate or advisable in order to
facilitate the Closing, Sellers and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith a
transition services agreement, and shall also cooperate in addressing issues
related to the transfer of employment. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing sentence, the Parties agree that Buyer may require the transition
services described on _Schedule 5.20_ , and to the extent that Buyer requests
such services in discussing such transition services agreement, Sellers shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to make such services available to Buyer
(or one or more Buyer Subsidiaries). In the event that a transition services
agreement relating to a delayed transfer of employment is established, the
timing of offers to, and the commencement of employment by, the Continuing
Employees with Buyer will be in accordance with the terms of the transition
services agreement, notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary.



5.21 _Collection of Accounts Receivable_. Each Seller agrees that it shall,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, forward promptly to Buyer any
monies, checks or instruments received by such Seller (or Subsidiary thereof)
after the Closing Date with respect to the accounts receivable purchased by
Buyer pursuant to this Agreement. Sellers hereby grant to Buyer, on their own
behalf and on behalf of each of their Subsidiaries, a power of attorney to  



 

46  endorse and cash any checks or instruments payable or endorsed to any Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries, or to any of their order, which are received
by Buyer and which relate to accounts receivable purchased by Buyer pursuant
to this Agreement.

have breached or failed to perform any of its covenants or other agreements
contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform would give
rise to a failure of the condition set forth in Section 6.2(b), in each of

Liability on the part of any Party hereto or its Affiliates, directors,
officers or stockholders, except as follows:



(a) the provisions of this Section 7.2, Section 7.3 and Article IX shall
survive termination of this Agreement;



(b) if this Agreement is terminated by (x) Buyer or Parent pursuant to Section
7.1(f), (y) Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or (z) Buyer pursuant to
Section 7.1(e), but only if such termination is based upon a breach by any
Seller of Section 5.8, Sellers liability shall be limited to return of the
Deposit and payment of the Termination Fee and Expense Reimbursement;



(c) provided that the Deposit has been deposited with the Escrow Agent
pursuant to Section 2.3(b), under no circumstances shall Buyers liability for
breach of this Agreement exceed the amount of the Deposit, and a claim against
the Deposit Fund (as defined in the Escrow Agreement) shall be Sellers
exclusive remedy for breach of this Agreement; and



 

51 (d) except as provided in Sections 7.2(b) and 7.2(c), termination of this
Agreement shall not relieve any Party of any Liability or damages resulting
from any breach by that Party of this Agreement.



7.3 _Fees and Expenses_.



(a) Whether or not the Transactions are consummated, and except as otherwise
contemplated by this Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the Transactions shall be
paid by the Party incurring such fees and expenses.



(b) The following provisions shall apply upon termination of this Agreement:



(i) Upon termination of this Agreement by (x) Parent pursuant to Section
7.1(b), (y) either Parent or Buyer pursuant to Section 7.1(f), or (z) Buyer
pursuant to Section 7.1(e) or Sections 7.1(g) through 7.1(n), Parent shall
reimburse up to $1,000,000 of the reasonable and actual out-of-pocket fees and
expenses incurred by Buyer in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions (the " _Expense Reimbursement_ "), by wire transfer of same day
funds to an account specified by Buyer not later than two Business Days
following such termination or as soon thereafter as is permitted by the
Bankruptcy Court.



(ii) Upon a termination of this Agreement by (x) Parent pursuant to Section
7.1(b), (y) either Party pursuant to Section 7.1(f) or (z) Buyer pursuant to
Section 7.1(e), but only if such termination is based upon a breach by any
Seller of Section 5.8, Parent shall pay Buyer by wire transfer of same day
funds to an account specified by Buyer not later than two Business Days
following such termination a fee equal to $5,100,000 (the " _Termination Fee_
") (whether or not any Expense Reimbursements have previously been paid
pursuant to Section 7.3(b)). 



(iii) Upon termination of this Agreement by (x) either Parent or Buyer
pursuant to Sections 7.1(a), 7.1(b), 7.1(c) or 7.1(f), or (y) Buyer pursuant
to Sections 7.1(e) or Sections 7.1(g) through 7.1(n), Parent and Buyer shall
irrevocably authorize the immediate release of the Deposit to Buyer by
the Escrow Agent.



(iv) Upon termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(d),
Parent and Buyer shall irrevocably authorize the immediate release of the
Deposit to Parent by the Escrow Agent.



(c) Sellers and Buyer acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in
Section 7.3(b) are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without
these agreements, Buyer would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if
Parent fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to Section 7.3(b) and, in
order to obtain such payment, Buyer commences a suit against Parent that
results in a judgment against Parent for the Termination Fee or the Expense
Reimbursement, Parent shall pay to Buyer its costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amount of the Termination Fee and the Expense Reimbursement
from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment
at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made.



 

52 (d) Sellers acknowledge and agree that (i) sale of the Acquired Assets at the
highest and best price pursuant to the Bidding Procedures is in the best
interests of the Chapter 11 Sellers and their estates; (ii) by conducting due
diligence, negotiating this Agreement, and agreeing to acquire the Acquired
Assets at the Purchase Price, Buyer is facilitating a sale of the Acquired
Assets at the highest and best price pursuant to the Bidding Procedures, and
is establishing a floor for competing bids; and (iii) in so doing, Buyer is
making a substantial contribution to the Chapter 11 Cases and, accordingly,
the Expense Reimbursement and Termination Fee are entitled to be treated as
administrative expenses of the Chapter 11 Cases.



7.4 _Auction Procedures_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the following terms and conditions shall govern:



(a) The sale of the Acquired Assets, the approval of this Agreement and
the consummation of the Transactions are expressly subject to (i) higher or
better offers that may be received and accepted by Sellers at the auction and
(ii) entry of the Sale Order by the Bankruptcy Court.



(b) Buyer shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to raise the
price for the Acquired Assets (or to otherwise improve its offer contained in
this Agreement) at any time until the conclusion of the auction. Each such
improvement by Buyer in its bid at the auction shall constitute an irrevocable
and binding amendment to this Agreement.



(c) Buyers bid shall remain in effect as a "back-up" bid for a period of 30
days following the conclusion of the auction if Sellers accept a competing
bid.



(d) Buyer shall be entitled to "credit bid" the Termination Fee and Expense
Reimbursement such that no competing bid shall be deemed higher in amount
unless such competing bid exceeds the Purchase Price herein by the amount of
the Termination Fee, plus the Expense Reimbursement, plus the "Bidding
Increment". The Bidding Increment for the initial overbid shall be $1,000,000
and all subsequent Bidding Increments shall be $250,000.



(e) Only competing bids that are " _Qualified Bids_ " shall be considered at
the auction. To be a Qualified Bid, a competing bid must (i) exceed the
Purchase Price by the sum of the Termination Fee, plus the Expense
Reimbursement, plus the Bidding Increment, (ii) be accompanied by a Deposit
and by proof of such bidders financial ability to pay the balance of the
purchase price, and (iii) be accompanied by a signed, irrevocable asset
purchase agreement substantially in the form of this Agreement and shall not
be subject to any diligence or financing conditions.



(f) Sellers shall not solicit or accept any bids for individual assets but
shall instead offer the Sellers assets solely as a single "package bid" at
the auction.



(g) Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate in resolving or contesting
any objections (including testimony or argument in Court) to this Agreement,
the Bidding Procedures Order or the Sale Order, and Buyer and Sellers shall
bear their own costs relating thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyers
costs relating thereto shall be considered part of the Expense Reimbursement
up to the maximum cap of such Expense Reimbursement.



 

53 ARTICLE VIII



INDEMNIFICATION



8.1 _Indemnification of Buyer_. From and after the Closing, Sellers shall
indemnify Buyer and its Subsidiaries, and each of their
respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, stockholders,
partners, members or other equity holders, agents and representatives (each, a
" _Buyer Indemnified Party_ ") for any Excluded Liability suffered or incurred
by such Buyer Indemnified Party.



8.2 _Indemnification of Seller_. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall
indemnify Sellers, and each of their respective Affiliates, officers,
directors, employees, stockholders, partners, members or other equity holders,
agents and representatives (each, a " _Seller Indemnified Party_ ") for any
Assumed Liability suffered or incurred by such Seller Indemnified Party.



8.3 _Indemnification Claims_.



(a) In order for an Indemnified Party to be entitled to any indemnification
provided for under Section 8.1 or 8.2 in respect of, arising out of
or involving a Third Party Claim, such Indemnified Party must notify the
Indemnifying Party in writing of the Third Party Claim within 20 Business Days
after receipt by such Indemnified Party of notice of the Third Party Claim;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that failure to give such notification shall not
affect the indemnification provided under Section 8.1 or 8.2 except to the
extent the Indemnifying Party has been actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying
Party, within 10 Business Days after the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof,
copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the
Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Party
alone shall conduct and control the defense of such Third Party Claim. The
Indemnified Party shall have the right to consent to the entry of any judgment
or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim on such
terms as it may deem appropriate; provided, however, that the amount of any
settlement made or entry of any judgment consented to by the Indemnified Party
without the consent of the Indemnifying Party shall not be determinative of
the validity or amount of the claim against the Indemnifying Party under
Section 8.1 or 8.2 unless the Indemnifying Party shall have consented to such
entry or judgment or settlement.



(b) In order for an Indemnified Party to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this Agreement other than in respect of,
arising out of or involving a Third Party Claim, such Indemnified Party shall
deliver written notice of such claim with reasonable promptness to the
Indemnifying Party; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that failure to give such
notification shall not affect the indemnification provided under Section 8.1
or 8.2 except to the extent the Indemnifying Party has been actually
prejudiced as a result of such failure. If the Indemnifying Party does not
notify the Indemnified Party, in writing, within 20 Business Days following
its receipt of such notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes the liability
claimed by the Indemnified Party under Section 8.1 or 8.2, such claim
specified by the Indemnified Party in such notice shall be conclusively deemed
a liability for which the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
under Section 8.1 or 8.2 and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
recover the amount of the Losses suffered by the Indemnified Party.



 

54 (c) Any amount for which an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Article VIII shall be reduced by any actual recoveries that
such Indemnified Party receives under insurance policies on account of the
matter resulting in such indemnifiable amount.



ARTICLE IX
