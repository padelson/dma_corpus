(a) Subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, possession of

Time_ "), as described below.

 

(b) Purchaser shall be entitled to all production of Hydrocarbons from or
attributable to the Leases, the Units or the Wells at and after the Effective
Time (and all products and proceeds attributable thereto, including funds held
in suspense accounts), and to all other income, proceeds, receipts and credits
earned with respect to the Assets at or after the Effective Time, and
shall be responsible for (and entitled to any refunds with respect to) all
Property Costs incurred at and after the Effective Time.

 

(c) Seller shall be entitled to all production of Hydrocarbons from or
attributable to the Leases, the Units or the Wells prior to the Effective
Time (and all products and proceeds attributable thereto, including funds held
in suspense accounts), and to all other income, proceeds, receipts and credits
earned with respect to the Assets prior to the Effective Time, and shall
be responsible for (and entitled to any refunds with respect to) all Property
Costs incurred prior to the Effective Time.

(d) Should Purchaser receive after Closing any proceeds or other income to
which Seller is entitled under Section 2.6(c), Purchaser shall fully disclose,
account for and remit the same to Seller as part of the final calculation of
the Adjusted Purchase Price under Section

 



-4-   9.4(b). If, after Closing, Seller receives any proceeds or other income with
respect to the Assets to which Seller is not entitled pursuant to Section
2.6(c), Seller shall fully disclose, account for and remit the same to
Purchaser as part of the final calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price
under Section 9.4(b).

(e) Should Purchaser pay after Closing any Property Costs for which Seller is
responsible under Section 2.6(c), Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for such
Property Costs as part of the final calculation of the Adjusted Purchase
Price pursuant to Section 9.4(b), accompanied by copies of the relevant vendor
or other invoice and proof of payment. Should Seller pay after Closing any
Property Costs for which Purchaser is responsible under Section 2.6(b),
Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for such Property Costs as part of the final
calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section 9.4(b),
accompanied by copies of the relevant vendor or other invoice and proof of
payment.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.6, Seller shall
have no further entitlement to amounts earned from the sale of Hydrocarbons
produced from or attributable to the Assets and other income earned with
respect to the Assets and no further responsibility for Property Costs
incurred with respect to the Assets following the final determination and
payment of the Adjusted Purchase Price in accordance with Section 9.4(b).

(g) Asset Taxes, right-of-way fees, insurance premiums and other Property
Costs that are paid periodically shall be prorated based on the number of days
in the applicable period falling before and the number of days in the
applicable period falling at or after the Effective Time, except that ad
valorem, property, severance, production and similar Taxes measured by the
quantity of or the value of production shall be prorated based on the number
of units or value of production actually produced and sold, as applicable,
before, and at or after, the Effective Time. In each case, Purchaser shall be
responsible for the portion allocated to the period at and after the Effective
Time and Seller shall be responsible for the portion allocated to the
period before the Effective Time.

(h) The Parties acknowledge that Sellers ownership interest in the Wells
identified on  _Exhibit A-2A_ was not discovered until after the Parties
agreed on the Unadjusted Purchase Price. Accordingly, notwithstanding their
actual value, such Wells have been given an Allocated Value of "$0.00" on
_Schedule 3.3_. At Closing, Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for drilling and
completion costs paid by Seller on the Wells identified on _Exhibit A-2A_
(regardless of whether such costs were paid by Seller prior to, on or
following the Effective Date). 

Section 2.7 _Procedures_.

(a) For purposes of allocating production (and all products and proceeds
attributable thereto, including funds held in suspense accounts) under Section
2.6, (i) liquid Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or attributable to"
the Leases, the Units or the Wells when they pass through the inlet flange of
the pipeline connecting into the storage facilities into which they are run
or, if there are no such storage facilities, when they pass through the LACT
meters or similar meters at the point of entry into the pipelines through
which they are transported from the field and (ii) gaseous Hydrocarbons shall
be deemed to be "from or attributable to" the Leases, the Units or the Wells
when they pass through the delivery point sales

 



-5-   meters on the pipelines through which they are transported. Purchaser shall
utilize reasonable interpolative procedures to arrive at an allocation of
production when exact meter readings or gauging and strapping data is not
available. Purchaser shall provide to Seller evidence of all meter readings
and all gauging and strapping procedures conducted on or about the Effective
Time in connection with the Assets, together with all data necessary to
support any estimated allocation, for purposes of establishing the adjustment
to the Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section 3.2. The terms "earned"
and "incurred" shall be interpreted in accordance with GAAP and Council of
Petroleum Accountants Society (" _COPAS_ ") standards.

(b) After Closing, Purchaser shall handle all joint interest audits and other

Common Stock shall be rounded to the nearest whole number (with a 0.5 share of

being herein referred to as the " _Adjusted Purchase Price_ ":

amounts (without duplication):

Time but paid by Seller (as is consistent with Section 2.6(b) and Section
2.6(c));

(iv) an amount equal to the sum of, (A) with respect to Assets operated by

gaseous Hydrocarbons, $5.23 per mcf and, (2) in the case of liquid
Hydrocarbons, $78.82 per bbl, such price determined after consideration of
Asset Taxes, and (B) with respect to Assets not operated by Purchaser, the
Non-Op Volume Amount;

of the Imbalances _multiplied_ by a price of $5.23 per mcf, such price
determined after consideration of Asset Taxes;

to Section 7.9(g);

(vii) an amount equal to all drilling and completion costs paid by Seller
with respect to which it is entitled to reimbursement by Purchaser pursuant to
Section 2.6(h); and

(viii) any other amount provided for elsewhere in this Agreement or otherwise
agreed upon in writing by the Parties as an upward adjustment to the
Unadjusted Purchase Price.

 

(b) The Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by the following
amounts (without duplication):

ownership and operation of the Assets which are incurred prior to the

applicable, that are part of any portion of the Assets excluded from the
Transactions pursuant to Section 2.2(c), Section 7.5 or Section 7.6;

production, or similar arrangement in existence at any time from and after the
Effective Time until the Closing Time; and

(adjusted as necessary based on the adjustments hereunder to the Unadjusted
Purchase Price) of its Purchaser Common Stock to complete the Transactions.

ARTICLE 7.

COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES

Section 7.1 _Access_. Between the Execution Date and the Closing Date, Seller
will give (and, for Properties that are not operated by Seller, if Purchaser
so requests, will use its Reasonable Best Efforts to obtain permission from
the operator with respect to such Properties to grant) Purchaser and its
Representatives access to the Assets and access to and the right to copy, at
Purchasers sole cost, risk and expense, the Records in Sellers possession,
for the purpose of conducting a reasonable due diligence review of the Assets.
Purchaser shall be entitled to conduct a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment
with respect to any of the Assets that are not operated by Purchaser and may
conduct visual inspections and record reviews relating to such Assets,
including their condition and compliance with Environmental Laws. In the event
that the Phase I Environmental Site Assessment identifies any
potential Environmental Defects, Purchaser will have the right to perform a
Phase II Environmental Site Assessment of such Assets with respect to such
Environmental Defects. Purchaser shall abide by Sellers, and any Third Party
operators, safety rules, regulations, and operating policies while
conducting its due diligence evaluation of the Assets ( _provided_ that, upon
request by Purchaser, Seller shall provide Purchaser with the content of such
rules, regulations and policies prior to Purchasers due diligence
evaluation). Any conclusions made from any examination done by Purchaser shall
result from Purchasers own independent review and judgment. Purchaser
acknowledges that, pursuant to its right of access to the Assets, Purchaser
will become privy to confidential and other information of Seller and that
such confidential information shall be held confidential by Purchaser in
accordance with the terms of Section 7.3(b).

 



-17-  Section 7.2 _Government Reviews_. In a timely manner, Seller and Purchaser
shall (a) make all required filings, prepare all required applications and
conduct negotiations with each Governmental Body as to which such filings,
applications or negotiations are necessary or appropriate in the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and (b) provide such information as
each may reasonably request to make such filings, prepare such applications
and conduct such negotiations.

Section 7.3 _Public Announcements; Confidentiality_.

(a) Seller shall not make any press release or other public announcement
regarding the existence of this Agreement, the contents hereof or the
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of
Purchaser (collectively, the "Public Announcement Restrictions"). Purchaser
may make a press release or public announcement and will provide Seller a
draft of any such release or announcement and permit Seller to comment. The
Public Announcement Restrictions shall not restrict disclosures to the extent
(i) necessary for Seller to perform this Agreement (including disclosures to
Governmental Bodies or Third Parties holding rights of consent or other rights
that may be applicable to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, as
reasonably necessary to provide notices, seek waivers, amendments or
termination of such rights, or seek such consents), (ii) required (upon advice
of counsel) by applicable securities or other Laws or regulations or
the applicable rules of any stock exchange having jurisdiction over the
Parties or their respective Affiliates or (iii) that Seller has given the
Purchaser a reasonable opportunity to review such disclosure prior to its
release and no objection is raised. In the case of the disclosures described
under subsections (i) and (ii) of this Section 7.3(a), Seller shall use its
Reasonable Best Efforts to consult with Purchaser regarding the contents of
any such release or announcement prior to making such release or
announcement.

(b) Subject to Section 7.3(a), the Parties shall keep all information
and data relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
strictly confidential except for disclosures to Representatives of the Parties
(in which event, the disclosing Party will be responsible for making sure that
the Representatives keep such information and data confidential) and any
disclosures required to perform this Agreement (collectively, the
"Confidentiality Restrictions"). The Confidentiality Restrictions shall not
restrict disclosures required (upon advice of counsel) by applicable
securities or other Laws or regulations or the applicable rules of any stock
exchange having jurisdiction over the Parties or their respective Affiliates.

 

Section 7.4 _Operation of Business_. Except (i) as to the matters set forth on
_Schedule 7.4_, (ii) with respect to any actions that both Purchaser and
Seller commit to undertake, or (iii) as otherwise approved by Purchaser, from
the Execution Date until the Closing Date, Seller:

 

(a) will keep Purchaser informed of all material developments relating to the
Assets;

 

(b) will conduct its business related to the Assets in the ordinary course
consistent with Sellers recent exploration and drilling program and other
recent practices and in compliance with all applicable Laws;

 



-18-  (c) will not commit to any new operation (or incur any liabilities) with
respect to the Assets in excess of $100,000 (individually) (net to Sellers
interest);

(d) will not terminate, amend or extend any Contracts or enter into any
contracts which would have constituted a Contract if in effect on the date
hereof;

(e) will not terminate, amend or modify any of the Leases;

(f) will maintain insurance coverage on the Assets presently furnished by
Third Parties in the amounts and of the types presently in force;

(g) will use its Reasonable Best Efforts to maintain in full force and effect

(h) will maintain all Permits, approvals, bonds and guaranties affecting the
Assets, and make all filings that Seller is required to make under applicable
Law with respect to the Assets;

(i) will not transfer, sell, hypothecate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any

Time; and

 

(k) will not enter into an agreement with respect to any of the foregoing.

Requests for approval of any action restricted by this Section 7.4 shall be
delivered to the following individual, which such individual shall have full
authority to grant or deny such requests for approval on behalf of Purchaser:

Continental Resources, Inc.

 

8800 Calera Drive

Austin, Texas 78735

Attn: Mark Monroe, Chairman of the Special Committee 

Purchasers approval of any action restricted by this Section 7.4 shall be
considered granted within ten (10) days (unless a shorter time is reasonably
required by the circumstances and such shorter time is specified in Sellers
notice) after Sellers notice to Purchaser requesting such consent unless
Purchaser notifies Seller to the contrary during that period. In the event of
an emergency, Seller may take such action as a prudent operator would take and
shall notify Purchaser of such action promptly thereafter.

 



-19-  Purchaser acknowledges Seller is not the operator of the Properties and,
therefore, agrees to the extent the actions contemplated by the provisions of
this Section 7.4 may only be taken by (or are the primary responsibility of)
the operator of the Properties, the provisions of this Section 7.4 shall be
construed to require only that Seller use its Reasonable Best Efforts to
cause the operator(s) of the Properties to take such actions or render such
performance within the constraints of the applicable operating agreements and
other applicable agreements. In addition, for purposes of this Section 7.4,
actions taken (or not taken) by Purchaser as the operator of any of the Assets
shall be deemed to have been "approved by Purchaser".

 

Section 7.5 _Consents to Assignment and Preferential Rights to Purchase_.

 

(a) Purchaser shall prepare and Seller shall send (i) notices to the holders
of any required consents to assignment requesting consents to the Conveyances
and (ii) notices to the holders of any applicable preferential rights to
purchase or similar rights in compliance with the terms of such rights and
requesting waivers of such rights. Any preferential purchase right must be
exercised subject to all terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
including the successful closing of this Agreement pursuant to Article 9 as to
those Assets for which preferential purchase rights have not been exercised.
The consideration payable under this Agreement for any particular Asset for
purposes of preferential purchase right notices shall be the Allocated Value
for such Asset. Seller shall use its Reasonable Best Efforts to cause such
consents to assignment and waivers of preferential rights to purchase or
similar rights (or the exercise thereof) to be obtained and delivered prior to
Closing, _provided_ that neither Seller nor Purchaser shall be required to
make payments or undertake obligations to or for the benefit of the holders
of such rights in order to obtain the required consents and waivers. Purchaser
shall cooperate with Seller in seeking to obtain such consents to assignment
and waivers of preferential rights.

 

(b) In no event shall there be included in the Conveyances any Asset for which
a Specified Consent Requirement has not been satisfied. In cases in which the
Asset subject to such a requirement is a Contract and Purchaser is assigned
the Property or Properties to which the Contract relates, but the Contract is
not transferred to Purchaser due to the unwaived Specified
Consent Requirement, (i) Seller shall continue after Closing to use its
Reasonable Best Efforts to obtain the consent so such Contract can be
transferred to Purchaser upon receipt of the consent, (ii) the Contract shall
be held by Seller for the benefit of Purchaser until the consent is obtained
or the Contract has terminated and (iii) Purchaser shall pay all amounts due
thereunder, perform all obligations thereunder and indemnify Seller against
any Damages incurred or suffered by Seller as a consequence of remaining a
party to such Contract until the consent is obtained or the Contract has
terminated. In cases in which the Asset subject to a Specified Consent
Requirement is a Property and the Third Party consent to the transfer of the
Property is not obtained by Closing, the affected Property and the Assets
related to that Property shall not be transferred at Closing and the
Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of the
Property and related Assets. If an unsatisfied Specified Consent Requirement
with respect to which an adjustment is made under Section 3.2 is subsequently
satisfied prior to the date that is 90 days after the Closing Date, a separate
closing shall be held within five (5) Business Days thereof at which (A)
Seller shall convey the affected Property and related Assets to Purchaser (or
Purchasers designee) in accordance with this Agreement and (B) Purchaser (or
Purchasers designee) shall pay to Seller the Transfer Consideration for such

 



-20-   Property and related Assets. If such Specified Consent Requirement is not
satisfied within 90 days of the Closing Date, Seller shall have no further
obligation to sell and convey such Property and related Assets and Purchaser
shall have no further obligation to purchase, accept and pay for such Property
and related Assets, and the affected Property and related Assets shall be
deemed to be deleted from _Exhibit A-1_ and _Exhibit A-2_ (and the other
applicable Exhibits and Schedules) to this Agreement for all purposes.

(c) If any preferential right to purchase any Assets is exercised prior to
Closing, the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be decreased by the Allocated
Value for such Assets, and the affected Assets shall be deemed to be deleted
from _Exhibit A-1_ and _Exhibit A-2_ (and the other applicable Exhibits and
Schedules) to this Agreement for all purposes. Seller shall retain the
consideration paid by the Third Party, and shall have no further obligation
with respect to such affected Assets under this Agreement. Should a Third
Party fail to exercise or waive its preferential right to purchase as to any
portion of the Assets prior to Closing and the time for exercise or waiver has
not yet expired, the affected Assets shall not be transferred at Closing and
the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Values of
such Assets. If the applicable preferential purchase rights are waived or
expire prior to the date that is 90 days after the Closing Date, a separate
closing shall be held within five (5) Business Days thereof at which (i)
Seller shall convey the affected Assets to Purchaser (or Purchasers designee)
in accordance with this Agreement and (ii) Purchaser (or Purchasers designee)
shall pay to Seller the Transfer Consideration for such Assets. If the
applicable preferential purchase rights are not waived or have not expired
within 90 days of the Closing Date, Seller shall have no further obligation to
sell and convey such Assets and Purchaser shall have no further obligation to
purchase, accept and pay for such Assets, and such Assets shall be deemed to
be deleted from _Exhibit A-1_ and _Exhibit A-2_ (and the other applicable
Exhibits and Schedules) to this Agreement for all purposes.

Section 7.6 _Casualty or Condemnation Loss_. If, after the Execution Date, but
prior to the Closing Date, any portion of the Assets is damaged, destroyed or
made unavailable or unusable for the intended purpose by fire or other
casualty or is taken in condemnation or under right of eminent domain (each a
" _Casualty Loss_ "), Purchaser shall have, without prejudice to Section
8.2(e), the right, at its option, to (a) remove such portion of the Assets
from the transactions contemplated hereunder and adjust the Unadjusted
Purchase Price accordingly, or (b) proceed with the Closing, in which event,
Seller shall cause the Assets adversely affected by any such individual
Casualty Loss to be repaired or restored to at least their condition prior to
such Casualty Loss, at Sellers sole cost and expense, as promptly as
reasonably practicable.

Section 7.7 _Closing Efforts; Further Assurances_.

 

(a) Each of Purchaser and Seller shall use their respective Reasonable Best
Efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary or
appropriate to consummate the Transactions and (ii) cause the fulfillment at
the earliest practicable date of all of the conditions to their respective
obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
In that regard, it is understood that the Assets are intended to include,
subject to the reservations and conditions herein contained, all of Sellers
right, title, and interest, effective from and after the Effective Time, in
and to the Assets, regardless of the omission of any lease, well or other
property, errors in description, any correct or misspelled names or any
transcribed or incorrect recording references, and that the Parties will take
all such actions as are reasonably necessary to effect such sale, transfer
and conveyance.

 



-21-  (b) After Closing, each Party agrees to take such further actions and to
execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further documents as are reasonably
requested by the other Party for carrying out the purposes of this Agreement
or of any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement.

 

Section 7.8 _Notification of Breaches_. Between the Execution Date and the
Closing Date:

 

(a) Purchaser shall provide prompt written notice to Seller of: (i) the
occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event of which Purchaser has Actual
Knowledge that causes or would be reasonably likely to cause any
representation or warranty of Purchaser contained in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect as of the Closing Date, and (ii)
the failure of Purchaser to comply with or satisfy in any material respect
any covenant or agreement to be complied with by it hereunder prior to or on
the Closing Date, but in each case without prejudice to Sellers rights under
Article 11. 

(b) Seller and each Seller Shareholder, as applicable, shall provide prompt
written notice to Purchaser of: (i) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of
any event of which Seller or such Seller Shareholder has Actual Knowledge that
causes or would be reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty
of Seller or such Seller Shareholder, as applicable, contained in this
Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect as of the Closing
Date, (ii) the failure of Seller to comply with or satisfy in any material
respect any covenant or agreement to be complied with by it hereunder prior
to or on the Closing Date, and (iii) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of
any event of which Seller has Actual Knowledge that would be reasonably likely
to cause a Material Adverse Effect, but in each case without prejudice
to Purchasers rights under Article 11.

(c) If any of Purchasers, Sellers or either Seller
Shareholders representations or warranties is untrue or shall become untrue
in any material respect between the Execution Date and the Closing Date, or if
any of Purchasers or Sellers covenants or agreements to be performed or
satisfied prior to or on the Closing Date shall not have been so performed or
satisfied in any material respect, but if such breach of representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement shall (if curable) be cured by the Closing,
then such breach shall be considered not to have occurred for all purposes of
this Agreement.

Section 7.9 _Title Defects; Environmental Defects_.

 

(a) To assert a claim of a Title Defect, Purchaser must deliver a claim notice
to Seller (each a "Title Defect Notice") promptly after the discovery
thereof, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the
Closing (such cut-off date being the "Title Claim Date"). Each Title Defect
Notice shall be in writing and shall include (i) a description of the alleged
Title Defect, (ii) the Lease or Well, as applicable, adversely affected by the
Title Defect (each a " _Title Defect Property_ "), (iii) the Allocated Value
of each Title Defect Property, (iv) the documents upon which Purchaser relies
for its assertion of a Title Defect and (v) the amount by which Purchaser
believes the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property is reduced by the
alleged Title Defect (the " _Title Defect Amount_ ").

 



-22-  (b) Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its
sole cost, to cure on or before the third (3rd) Business Day prior to the
Closing (the "Cure Deadline") any Title Defects for which Seller has received
a Title Defect Notice from Purchaser prior to the Title Claim Date. If any
Title Defect is not cured or disputed by Seller prior to the Closing, subject
to Section 7.9(g), there shall be a downward adjustment to the Unadjusted
Purchase Price equal to the Title Defect Amount for such Title Defect and the
affected Title Defect Property shall be transferred to Purchaser at Closing.
If, prior to the Closing, the Parties cannot agree on (i) the proper and
adequate cure for any such Title Defect, (ii) the Title Defect Amount or (iii)
whether the alleged Title Defect constitutes a Title Defect, then the affected
Title Defect Property shall be transferred to Purchaser at Closing and such
dispute(s) (each a " _Disputed Defect_ ") shall be finally and exclusively
resolved in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.9(e). For purposes of
determining the Initial Adjusted Purchase Price, subject to Section 7.9(g),
the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by an amount equal to
the Title Defect Amount alleged by Purchaser in the applicable Title Defect
Notice for each such Disputed Defect; and any Disputed Defects that have not
been cured, waived or otherwise resolved by the Parties prior to the Closing
shall be exclusively and finally resolved in accordance with the provisions of
Section 7.9(e).

 

(c) The Title Defect Amount resulting from a Title Defect shall be the amount
by which the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property adversely affected
by such Title Defect is reduced as a result of the existence of such Title
Defect and shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology,
terms and conditions:

 

(i) if Purchaser and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, that amount
shall be the Title Defect Amount;

 

(ii) if the Title Defect is a lien, encumbrance or other charge which is
undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be
the amount necessary to be paid to remove the Title Defect from Sellers
interest in the affected Title Defect Property;

(iii) if the Title Defect reflects a discrepancy between (A) the Net Revenue
Interest for the affected Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Revenue
Interest stated in _Exhibit A-2_ , then the Title Defect Amount shall be the
product of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property _multiplied_ by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the Net Revenue Interest
decrease and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest stated in
_Exhibit A-2_ ;

(iv) if the Title Defect reflects a discrepancy between (A) the Net Mineral
Acres for the affected Lease and (B) the Net Mineral Acres stated in _Exhibit
A-1_ , the Title Defect Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of
such Title Defect Property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which
is the Net Mineral Acre decrease for such Title Defect Property and the
denominator of which is the Net Mineral Acres of such Title Defect Property
stated in _Exhibit A-1_ ;

 



-23-  (v) if the Title Defect is an Environmental Defect, the Title Defect
Amount shall be the amount of the estimated reasonable, cost-effective
response to correct or remediate the Environmental Defect (as of the Closing
Date) in such a manner that is consistent with applicable Environmental Laws;
and

 

(vi) if the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or
charge upon or other defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type
not described in subsections (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) above, the Title Defect
Amount shall be determined by taking into account all relevant factors,
including the following: (i) the Allocated Value of the Title Defect
Property, (ii) the portion of the Title Defect Property adversely affected by
the Title Defect (and if the Title Defect affects less than all of the Net
Mineral Acres covered by the affected Lease, the acres that are
actually affected by such Title Defect), (iii) the legal effect of the Title
Defect, (iv) the potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the life
of the Title Defect Property, (v) the values placed upon the Title Defect by
Purchaser and Seller, (vi) as to a gap in the chain of title, the effect of
the passage of time since the date of the occurrence, fact or circumstance
forming the basis of the Title Defect, and (vii) such other factors as are
necessary to make a proper evaluation.

(d) Without prejudice to Purchasers rights under Article 11, it is understood
and agreed that Environmental Defects shall constitute Title Defects for
purposes of this Agreement (as is provided in the definition of the term
"Title Defects" set forth Appendix A) and, as such, will be handled in
accordance with, and in all instances will be subject to, the provisions of
this Section 7.9(d) and the other applicable provisions of this Section 7.9.

(e) (i) Seller and Purchaser shall attempt to agree on all Title Defects and
Title Defect Amounts prior to Closing. If Seller and Purchaser are unable to
agree on Title Defects and Title Defect Amounts by the scheduled Closing,
then Purchasers estimate of the Title Defect Amount associated therewith
shall be used to determine the Initial Adjusted Purchase Price. If, prior to
the Closing, Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree on an alleged Title
Defect or Title Defect Amount (the " _Disputed Title Matters_ "), the affected
Title Defect Property shall be transferred to Purchaser at Closing and such
dispute(s), and only such dispute(s), shall be exclusively and
finally resolved in accordance with the following provisions of this Section
7.9. Purchaser shall provide to Seller by not later than the tenth (10th) day
following the Closing a written description meeting the requirements of
Section 7.9(a), together with all supporting documentation, of the Disputed
Title Matters. By not later than ten (10) days after Sellers receipt of
Purchasers written description of the Disputed Title Matters, Seller shall
provide to Purchaser a written response setting forth Sellers position with
respect to the Disputed Title Matters together with all supporting
documentation.

(ii) By not later than ten (10) days after Purchasers receipt of Sellers
written response to Purchasers written description of the Disputed Title
Matters, Purchaser may initiate a non-administered arbitration of any such
dispute(s) conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of
the American Arbitration Association, to the extent that such rules do not
conflict with the terms of this Section, by written notice to Seller of any
Disputed Title Matters (" _Final Disputed Title Matters_ ") not otherwise
resolved or waived that are to be resolved by arbitration (the " _Title
Arbitration Notice_ ").

 



-24-  (iii) The arbitration shall be held before a one member arbitration
panel (the " _Title Arbitrator_ "), determined in accordance with this
Section 7.9(e)(iii). The Title Arbitrator shall be an attorney with at least
ten (10) years of experience who has not personally and whose law firm has
not provided services to any Party in the five (5) year period preceding such
dispute and has relevant experience (A) in the case of Title Defects other
than Environmental Defects, examining oil and gas titles in the jurisdictions
in which the Assets are located and (B) in the case of Environmental Defects,
as an environmental attorney practicing in the jurisdictions in which the
Assets are located. Within two (2) days following Sellers receipt of the
Title Arbitration Notice, Seller and Purchaser shall each exchange lists of
three (3) acceptable, qualified arbitrators. Within two (2) days following the
exchange of lists of acceptable arbitrators, Seller and Purchaser shall select
by mutual agreement the Title Arbitrator from their original lists of three
(3) acceptable arbitrators. If no such agreement is reached within seven (7)
days following the delivery of Title Arbitration Notice, the Oklahoma City,
Oklahoma office of the American Arbitration Association shall select an
arbitrator from the original lists provided by Seller and Purchaser to serve
as the Title Arbitrator.

(iv) Within three (3) days following the selection of the Title Arbitrator,
the Parties shall submit one copy to the Title Arbitrator of (A) this
Agreement, with specific reference to this Section 7.9(e) and the other
applicable provisions of this Section 7.9, (B) Purchasers written description
of the Final Disputed Title Matters, together with the supporting documents
that were provided to Seller, (C) Sellers written response to Purchasers
written description of the Final Disputed Title Matters, together with the
supporting documents that were provided to Purchaser, and (D) the Title
Arbitration Notice. Within five (5) days following such submissions, each of
the Parties may submit one written response to the other applicable Partys
submission. The Title Arbitrator shall resolve the Final Disputed Title
Matters based only on the foregoing submissions. Neither Purchaser nor Seller
shall have the right to submit additional documentation to the Title
Arbitrator nor to demand discovery on the other applicable Party.

 

(v) The Title Arbitrator shall make its determination by written decision
within ten (10) days following Sellers receipt of the Title Arbitration
Notice (the " _Arbitration Decision_ "). The Arbitration Decision shall be
final and binding upon the Parties, without right of appeal. In making its
determination, the Title Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in
this Section 7.9. The Title Arbitrator may consult with and engage
disinterested Third Parties to advise the Title Arbitrator, but shall disclose
to the Parties the identities of such consultants. Any such consultant shall
not have worked as an employee or consultant for a Party or its Affiliates
during the five (5) year period preceding the arbitration nor have any
financial interest in the dispute.

 

(vi) The Title Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of
determining the specific disputed Title Defects and Title Defect Amounts and
shall not be empowered to award damages, interest or penalties to a Party with
respect to any matter.

 



-25-  (vii) Each Party shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs
of preparing and presenting its case. Seller shall bear one-half and
Purchaser shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Title
Arbitrator, including any costs incurred by the Title Arbitrator that are
attributable to the consultation of any Third Party.

(viii) If, as a result of the Arbitration Decision, any amounts are determined
to be owed by a Party, such amounts shall be accounted for in the final
determination of the Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section 9.4(b).

(ix) Any dispute over the interpretation or application of this Section 7.9(e)
shall be decided by the Title Arbitrator with reference to the Laws of the
State of Oklahoma.

 

(f) Should Seller discover that its ownership of any Well, as such ownership
interest existed at and as of the Effective Date, entitles Seller to a larger
Net Revenue Interest or a smaller Working Interest (without a corresponding
decrease in Sellers Net Revenue Interest) than that set forth on Exhibit A-2
so that Sellers ownership interest in the Well, as such ownership interest
existed at and as of the Effective Date, is greater than that set forth on
Exhibit A-2 (a " _Title Benefit_ "), then Seller shall have the right to
notify Purchaser thereof on or before the Title Claim Date (and
Purchaser agrees that if any of the persons listed on Schedule 6.1 discovers
a Title Benefit on or before the Claim date, Purchaser agrees to notify Seller
thereof). Any such notice (a " _Title Benefit Notice_ ") must be made to
Purchaser on or before the Title Claim Date and shall be in writing and shall
include (i) a description of the alleged Title Benefit, (ii) the Well affected
by the Title Benefit (each a " _Title Benefit Property_ "), (iii) the
Allocated Value of each Title Benefit Property, (iv) the documents upon which
Seller relies for its assertion of a Title Benefit and (v) the amount by which
Seller believes the Allocated Value of each Title Benefit Property is
increased by the alleged Title Benefit (the " _Title Benefit Amount_ "). For
the avoidance of doubt, the effects of any non-consent elections made after
the Effective Date will not be considered Title Benefits and shall not be
included in the calculation of any Title Benefit Amount. The Title Benefit
Amount resulting from a Title Benefit and any adjustments to the Unadjusted
Purchase Price or any disputes relating thereto shall be determined by and in
a manner consistent with the methodology, terms and conditions set forth in
Sections 7.9(b), 7.9(c) and 7.9(e) for Title Defects and Title Defect Amounts.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall there be any adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price unless the
aggregate amount of all Title Defect Amounts net of all Title Benefit Amounts
(the "Net Defect Amount"), or the aggregate amount of all Title Benefit
Amounts, net of all Title Defect Amounts (the "Net Benefit Amount"), exceeds
one and one half percent (1.5%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price (the
"Aggregate Deductible"), after which point, Seller or Purchaser (as may be the
case) shall be entitled to adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price, but
only with respect to the amount by which the Net Defect Amount or the Net
Benefit Amount exceeds the Aggregate Deductible.

Section 7.10 _Maximum Purchaser Common Stock Issuance_. Purchaser and Seller
agree that the maximum number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued
in connection with the Transactions shall be 4,250,000 (adjusted as necessary
based on the adjustments hereunder to the Unadjusted Purchase Price).

 



-26-  Section 7.11 _Seller Shareholder Voting_. Each Seller Shareholder hereby
agrees that at any meeting of the shareholders of Purchaser, including any
adjournment, recess or postponement thereof, called by Purchaser for the
purpose of approving the issuance of shares pursuant to the Transactions (the
"Issuance Proposal"), it shall vote (or cause to be voted), in person or by
proxy, all of the shares of Purchaser Common Stock held by such Seller
Shareholder and any Affiliate of such Seller Shareholder in favor of the
Issuance Proposal.

shall deliver to Purchaser a written report containing any changes that Seller
proposes be made to such statement. The Parties shall undertake to agree on
the final statement of the Adjusted Purchase Price no later than 180 days

with respect to any matter. Seller and Purchaser shall each bear its own
legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. Seller shall bear one-half

firm. Within ten (10) days after the earlier of (i) the expiration of

Purchase Price exceeds the Initial Adjusted Purchase Price or (B) Seller shall
pay to Purchaser the amount by which the Initial Adjusted Purchase Price
exceeds the final Adjusted Purchase Price, as applicable. Any post-closing

either Party if Closing has not occurred on or before August 15, 2012;

(b) From and after Closing, the Seller Shareholders, jointly and severally,
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Purchaser Group from and
against all Damages incurred, suffered by or asserted against such Persons:

(i) caused by or arising out of or resulting from the Retained Seller
Obligations;

(ii) caused by or arising out of or resulting from Sellers breach of
Sellers covenants or agreements contained in Article 7; or

(iii) caused by or arising out of or resulting from any breach of any

in Article 4 or Article 5, respectively, or in the certificate delivered by
Seller or either Seller Shareholder at Closing pursuant to Section 9.2(c) or
Section 9.2(d), respectively;

EVEN IF SUCH DAMAGES ARE CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE
(WHETHER SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF
THE PURCHASER GROUP.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
this Section 11.1 contains (without prejudice to the Parties respective
rights in connection with

 



-33-   Sections 3.2 and 7.9) the Parties exclusive remedies against each other
with respect to breaches of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of the Parties in Article 4, Article 5, Article 6 and Article 7
and the affirmations of such representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in the certificate delivered by each Party at Closing
pursuant to Section 9.2(c), Section 9.2(d) or Section 9.3(c), as applicable.

(d) The indemnity of each Party provided in this Section 11.1 shall be for
the benefit of and extend to each Person included in the Seller Group and the
Purchaser Group, as applicable; provided, however, that any claim for
indemnity under this Section 11.1 by any such Person must be brought and
administered by a Party to this Agreement. No Indemnified Person (including
any Person within the Seller Group and the Purchaser Group) other than Seller
and Purchaser shall have any rights against either Seller or Purchaser under
the terms of this Section 11.1 except as may be exercised on its behalf by
Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, pursuant to this Section 11.1(d). Seller
and Purchaser may elect to exercise or not exercise indemnification rights
under this Section on behalf of the other Indemnified Persons affiliated with
it in its sole discretion and shall have no liability to any such other
Indemnified Person for any action or inaction under this Section.

Section 11.2 _Indemnification Actions_. All claims for indemnification under
Section 11.1 shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

 

(a) For purposes hereof, (i) the term "Indemnifying Person" when used in
connection with particular Damages shall mean the Person or Persons having an
obligation to indemnify another Person or Persons with respect to such Damages
pursuant to this Article 11 and (ii) the term "Indemnified Person" when used
in connection with particular Damages shall mean the Person or Persons having
the right to be indemnified with respect to such Damages by another Person or
Persons pursuant to this Article 11.

(b) To make a claim for indemnification under Section 11.1, an Indemnified
Person shall notify the Indemnifying Person of its claim under this Section
11.2, including the specific details of and specific basis under this
Agreement for its claim (the "Claim Notice"). In the event that the claim for
indemnification is based upon a claim by a Third Party against the Indemnified
Person (a " _Third Person Claim_ "), the Indemnified Person shall provide its
Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Person has actual knowledge of the
Third Person Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served with
respect to the Third Person Claim; _provided_  that the failure of any
Indemnified Person to give notice of a Third Person Claim as provided in this
Section 11.2 shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of its obligations
under Section 11.1 except to the extent such failure results in insufficient
time being available to permit the Indemnifying Person to effectively defend
against the Third Person Claim or otherwise prejudices the Indemnifying
Persons ability to defend against the Third Person Claim. In the event that
the claim for indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, the Claim Notice shall
specify the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement which was
inaccurate or breached.

 

(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Third Person
Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt
of the Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Person whether it admits or
denies its obligation to defend the

 



-34-   Indemnified Person against such Third Person Claim under this Article 11. If
the Indemnifying Person does not notify the Indemnified Person within such
30-day period whether the Indemnifying Person admits or denies its obligation
to defend the Indemnified Person, it shall be conclusively deemed to have
denied such indemnification obligation hereunder. The Indemnified Person is
authorized, prior to and during such 30-day period, to file any motion,
answer or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to
protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Person and that is not
prejudicial to the Indemnifying Person.

 

(d) If the Indemnifying Person admits its obligation, it shall have the right
and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Third
Person Claim. The Indemnifying Person shall have full control of such defense
and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof; provided,
however that if such Third Person Claim can affect the Taxes or Tax
position of the Indemnified Person, the Indemnified Person shall have the
right to jointly control such defense and proceedings. If requested by the
Indemnifying Person, the Indemnified Person agrees to cooperate in contesting
any Third Person Claim which the Indemnifying Person elects to contest (
_provided, however_ , that the Indemnified Person shall not be required to
bring any counterclaim or cross-complaint against any Person). Except as
provided herein, the Indemnified Person may at its own expense participate
in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any Third Person Claim
controlled by the Indemnifying Person pursuant to this Section 11.2(d). An
Indemnifying Person shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified
Person, settle any Third Person Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment
with respect thereto which (i) does not result in a final resolution of the
Indemnified Persons liability with respect to the Third Person
Claim (including, in the case of a settlement, an unconditional written
release of the Indemnified Person) or (ii) may materially and adversely affect
the Indemnified Person (other than as a result of money damages covered by the
indemnity). 

(e) If the Indemnifying Person does not admit its obligation or admits its
obligation but fails to diligently defend or settle the Third Person Claim,
then the Indemnified Person shall have the right to defend against the Third
Person Claim (at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Person, if the
Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification hereunder), with counsel of
the Indemnified Persons choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying
Person to admit its obligation and assume the defense of the Third Person
Claim at any time prior to settlement or final determination thereof. If
the Indemnifying Person has not yet admitted its obligation to provide
indemnification with respect to a Third Person Claim, the Indemnified Person
shall send written notice to the Indemnifying Person of any proposed
settlement and the Indemnifying Person shall have the option for ten (10)
days following receipt of such notice to (i) admit in writing its obligation
to provide indemnification with respect to the Third Person Claim and (ii) if
its obligation is so admitted, reject, in its reasonable judgment, the
proposed settlement. If the Indemnified Person settles any Third Person Claim
over the objection of the Indemnifying Person after the Indemnifying Person
has timely admitted its obligation in writing and assumed the defense of a
Third Person Claim, the Indemnified Person shall be deemed to have waived any
right to indemnity therefor.

(f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Third Person
Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of
the Claim Notice to (i) cure the Damages complained of, (ii) admit its
obligation to provide indemnification with

 



-35-   respect to such Damages or (iii) dispute the claim for such indemnification.
If the Indemnifying Person does not notify the Indemnified Person within such
30-day period that it has cured the Damages or that it disputes the claim for
such indemnification, the Indemnifying Person shall be conclusively deemed
obligated to provide such indemnification hereunder.

Section 11.3 _Limitation on Actions_.

4, Article 5 and Article 6 and the respective covenants and agreements of the
Parties in Article 7 and the corresponding representations and warranties

thirty (30) days, and (v) the covenants and agreements in Section 7.3 shall
survive indefinitely. The remainder of this Agreement shall survive the
Closing without time limit except (A) as may otherwise be expressly provided
herein and (B) for the provisions of Article 12, which shall survive Closing
until the applicable statute of limitations closes the taxable year to which
the subject Taxes relate. Representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements shall be of no further force and effect after the date of their
expiration, _provided_ that there shall be no termination of any bona fide
claim asserted pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement prior to its expiration date.

(b) The indemnities in Section 11.1(a)(iii), Section 11.1(a)(iv), Section
11.1(b)(ii) and Section 11.1(b)(iii) shall terminate as of the termination
date of each respective representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that
is subject to indemnification thereunder, except in each case as to matters
for which a specific written claim for indemnity has been delivered to the
Indemnifying Person on or before such termination date. The indemnities in
Section 11.1(a)(i), 11.1(a)(ii) and Section 11.1(b)(i) shall continue without
time limit.

(c) In no event shall any Indemnified Person be entitled to duplicate
compensation with respect to the same Damage, liability, loss, cost, expense,
claim, award or judgment under more than one provision of this Agreement and
the various documents delivered in connection with the Closing.

Section 11.4 _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing, the sole and
exclusive remedy for any breach or failure to be true and correct, or alleged
breach or failure to be true and correct, of any representation or warranty or
any covenant or agreement in this Agreement, other than in the event of
fraud, shall be indemnification in accordance with this Article 11.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 11.4 shall not operate to (i)
interfere with or impede the operation of the provisions of  _Section 7.9_
or _Section 9.4_ or (ii) limit the rights of the parties to seek equitable
remedies (including specific performance or injunctive relief).

 



-36-  ARTICLE 12.

Seller shall be responsible for filing with the Tax authorities the applicable
Tax Returns for Asset Taxes that are required to be filed on or before the

following Sellers request, Purchaser shall promptly pay to Seller all such
Taxes allocable to the period or portion thereof beginning on or after the

payment for which it is entitled to reimbursement under this Article 12 or
under Section 2.6(g), the applicable Party shall make such reimbursement
