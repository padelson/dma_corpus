the Effective Time shall be the individuals identified by Parent in its sole
discretion prior to the Effective Time.

the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on
the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any stockholder of the Company:

(a) Each share of Class A Preferred outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive an amount of cash,
without interest, equal to the sum of (i) the Class A Per Share Preference
Amount and (ii) the Common Per Share Amount, rounded to five decimal places
(the " _Class A Per Share Amount_ ").

(b) Each share of Class B Preferred outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive an amount of cash,
without interest, equal to the sum of (i) the Class B Per Share Preference
Amount and (ii) the Common Per Share Amount, rounded to five decimal places
(the " _Class B Per Share Amount_ ").

(c) Each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive an amount of cash,
without interest, equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Aggregate
Merger Consideration, less the Aggregate Preferred Preference Amount, by (ii)
the Fully Diluted Common Number, rounded to five decimal places (the " _Common
Per Share Amount_ ").

 

(d) Each share of Company Capital Stock held by the Company, Merger Sub or
Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company or of
Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof.

(e) Each share of the common stock, par value $0.00001 per share, of Merger
Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into, and exchanged for, one newly and
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation. Each certificate evidencing ownership of shares of
Merger Sub Common Stock shall evidence ownership of such shares of capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.07 Closing of the Companys Transfer Books. At the Effective Time,
holders of certificates representing shares of Company Capital Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights as stockholders of the Company (other than the right to
receive payment due in respect of each of such shares pursuant to _Section
2.06_), and the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with
respect to all shares of such capital stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such shares of Company Capital
Stock shall be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, a valid certificate previously representing 

 



17  any of such shares of Company Capital Stock (a " _Company Stock Certificate_
") is presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock
Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in _Section
2.08_.

Section 2.08 Exchange of Certificates; Escrow Funds. 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint Wilmington Trust,
National Association as agent (the " _Payment Agent_ ") for the purpose of
exchanging the Aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid pursuant to _Section
2.06_ for Company Stock Certificates. Promptly (and in any event within two
(2) Business Days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall
cause the Payment Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company Capital
Stock or Company Warrants at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal (the "
_Letter of Transmittal_ ") and instructions in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit G_ for use in such exchange.

(b) Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate for cancellation to the
Payment Agent, together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, (i) the holder
of such Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
for each share of Company Capital Stock formerly represented by such Company
Stock Certificate an amount in cash that such holder has the right to receive
therefor pursuant to the provisions of _Section 2.06_,  _less_ the portion
of such cash amount to be deposited in the Escrow Funds in respect of such
share of Company Capital Stock pursuant to _Section 2.08(d)_, and (ii) the
Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. The
Payment Agent shall, promptly after receipt of each properly surrendered
Company Stock Certificate, cause the payment described in the preceding
sentence to be sent by check or wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the holder of such Company Stock Certificate to the mailing address or
account designated by such holder in the Letter of Transmittal delivered with
such Company Stock Certificate. Until so surrendered, each outstanding Company
Stock Certificate that prior to the Effective Time represented shares of
Company Capital Stock will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for
all purposes, to evidence only the right to receive upon such surrender the
payment due in respect of each of such shares pursuant to _Section 2.06_
(subject to the provisions hereof relating to the Escrow Funds). If any
Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent
may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance of any
merger consideration, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate and customary affidavit
and indemnity agreement against any claim that may be made against Parent or
the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Company Stock Certificate.

(c) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any
holder or former holder of shares of Company Capital Stock for the payment
attributable to each of such shares or for any other cash amounts, delivered
to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar law.

(d) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver (i) to Wilmington
Trust, National Association (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), as the escrow agent
under the Escrow Agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit H_ (the "
_Escrow Agreement_ "), the Indemnity Escrow Fund to be held by the Escrow
Agent in accordance with the terms of _Section 10.08_ and the Escrow
Agreement and (ii) to the Equityholder Representative, the Equityholder
Representative Expense

 



18  Fund to be held by the Equityholder Representative in accordance with the
terms of _Section 11.01_. The Escrow Funds shall be funded by deducting from
the amount otherwise payable to an Equityholder or MBP Participant such
Persons Pro Rata Escrow Share of the sum of the Escrow Funds.

 

(e) Any portion of the merger consideration that remains undistributed to
Equityholders as of the first (1st) anniversary of this Agreement shall be
delivered to Parent upon demand, and Equityholders who have not theretofore
surrendered their Company Stock Certificates in accordance with this _Section
2.08_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims
for any merger consideration payable with respect to the shares of Company
Capital Stock previously represented by such Company Stock Certificates
without any interest thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by Equityholders
three (3) years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately
prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any Governmental Authority) shall, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any Lien. 

Section 2.09 Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Payment
Agent, the Escrow Agent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable to
any Equityholder or former Equityholder or other Person pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as Parent, Merger Sub, the Payment Agent, the Escrow
Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, is required to deduct
or withhold therefrom under the Code, or any Tax law, with respect to the
making of such payment. To the extent that such amounts are so withheld and
paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made.

 

Section 2.10 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry
out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries or Parent with full right, title and possession of and to all
rights and property of Merger Sub and the Acquired Companies, the officers
and directors of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries and Parent
shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in the name of the
Acquired Companies and otherwise) to take such action.

 

Section 2.11 Dissenting Shares.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, to
the extent that the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL are or prior to the
Effective Time may become applicable to the Merger, then any share of Company
Capital Stock that, as of the Effective Time, does or may carry appraisal
rights under Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not
be converted into or represent the right to receive the consideration due in
respect of such share pursuant to _Section 2.06_, and the holder or holders
of such share shall be entitled only to such rights as may be granted to such
holder or holders in Section 262 of the DGCL;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
if the status of any such share carrying appraisal rights shall not be
perfected, or if any such share shall lose its status as a share carrying
appraisal rights, then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the time of
the failure to perfect

 



19  such status or the loss of such status, such share shall automatically be
converted into and shall represent only the right to receive (upon the
surrender of the certificate representing such share) the payment due in
respect of such share in accordance with _Section 2.06_.

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demand
received by the Company prior to the Effective Time to require the Company to
purchase shares of Company Capital Stock pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL,
and (ii) the reasonable opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument. The Company
shall not make any payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time
with respect to any such demand unless Parent shall have consented in writing
to such payment or settlement offer.

Section 2.12 Closing Working Capital Adjustment.

(a) _Pre-Closing Estimate_. No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent the Companys good-faith
estimate of each of (i) the Closing Working Capital, (ii) the Closing
Indebtedness and (iii) the Closing Cash, such estimates to be prepared in
accordance with (A) the same accounting principles and methods the Company
has used to operate its business and to produce the Companys most recent
audited Financial Statements and (B) the illustration set forth on _Schedule
2.12(a)_ (clauses (A) and (B), collectively, the " _Specified Accounting
Principles_ "). The Company shall deliver all relevant backup materials,
schedules and the illustration prepared as set forth above, in detail
reasonably acceptable to Parent, concurrently with the delivery of such
estimate. Based on such estimate and prior to the Closing Date, Parent and the
Company shall in good faith calculate an estimate of the Closing Working
Capital (the " _Estimated Closing Working Capital_ "), the Closing
Indebtedness (the " _Estimated Closing Indebtedness_ ") and the Closing Cash
(the " _Estimated Closing Cash_ "), which estimates shall be used to calculate
the Aggregate Merger Consideration at Closing.

(b) Post-Closing Adjustment.

 

(i) As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than sixty (60) calendar
days following the Closing Date, Parent shall cause to be prepared in
accordance with the Specified Accounting Principles, and delivered to the
Equityholder Representative an unaudited balance sheet of the Company as of
immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "), together
with a statement (the " _Parent Closing Statement_ ") setting forth in
reasonable detail Parents calculation of each of (i) the Closing Working
Capital, (ii) the Closing Indebtedness and (iii) the Closing Cash and
attaching all relevant backup materials, schedules and the illustration
prepared as set forth above, in detail reasonably acceptable to the
Equityholder Representative.

 

(ii) From and after the delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Parent
Closing Statement, Parent, and, as necessary, any Affiliate of Parent, shall
provide the Equityholder Representative and any accountants or advisors
retained by the Equityholder Representative with reasonable access to the
books and records of the Surviving Corporation (or any successor thereto) for
the purposes of: (A) enabling the Equityholder Representative and its
accountants and advisors to calculate, and to review

 



20  Parents calculation of each of the Closing Working Capital, the Closing
Indebtedness and the Closing Cash; and (B) identifying any dispute related to
the calculation of each of the Closing Working Capital, the Closing
Indebtedness and the Closing Cash set forth in the Parent Closing Statement.

(iii) If the Equityholder Representative disputes the calculation of any of
the Closing Working Capital, the Closing Indebtedness or the Closing Cash set
forth in the Parent Closing Statement, then the Equityholder Representative
shall deliver a written notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") to Parent and the
Escrow Agent during the 30-day period commencing upon receipt by the
Equityholder Representative of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Parent
Closing Statement (the " _Review Period_ "). The Dispute Notice shall set
forth, in reasonable detail, the principal basis for the dispute of such
calculation.

 

(iv) If the Equityholder Representative does not deliver a Dispute Notice to
Parent prior to the expiration of the Review Period, Parents calculation of
each of the Closing Working Capital, the Closing Indebtedness and the Closing
Cash set forth in the Parent Closing Statement shall be deemed final and
binding on Parent, the Equityholder Representative and the Company
Stockholders for all purposes of this Agreement.

(v) If the Equityholder Representative delivers a Dispute Notice to Parent
prior to the expiration of the Review Period, then the Equityholder
Representative and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to reach
agreement on the calculation of each of the Closing Working Capital,
the Closing Indebtedness and the Closing Cash, as applicable. If the
Equityholder Representative and Parent are unable to reach agreement on the
calculation of each of the Closing Working Capital, the Closing Indebtedness
and the Closing Cash within 20 calendar days after the end of the Review
Period, the Equityholder Representative, on the one hand, or Parent, on the
other hand, shall have the right to refer such dispute to a nationally
recognized accounting firm chosen by Parent and the Equityholder
Representative (such firm, or any successor thereto, being referred to herein
as the " _Designated Accounting Firm_ ") after such 20th day. In connection
with the resolution of any such dispute by the Designated Accounting Firm:
(i) each of Parent and the Equityholder Representative shall have a reasonable
opportunity to meet with the Designated Accounting Firm to provide their
respective views as to any disputed issues with respect to the calculation of
each of the Closing Working Capital, the Closing Indebtedness and the Closing
Cash; (ii) the Designated Accounting Firm shall determine the Closing Working
Capital in accordance with the Specified Accounting Principles within 30
calendar days of such referral and, upon reaching such determination, shall
deliver a copy of its calculations (the " _Expert Calculations_ ") to the
Equityholder Representative, Parent and the Escrow Agent; and (iii) the
determination of each of the Closing Working Capital, the Closing
Indebtedness and the Closing Cash made by the Designated Accounting Firm shall
be final and binding on Parent, the Equityholder Representative and the
Company Stockholders for all purposes of this Agreement, absent manifest
error. In calculating each of the Closing Working Capital, the Closing
Indebtedness and the Closing Cash, the Designated Accounting Firm shall be
limited to addressing any particular disputes referred to in the Dispute
Notice. The Expert Calculations (i) shall reflect in detail the differences,
if any, between the Closing Working Capital, the Closing Indebtedness and the
Closing Cash, as applicable, reflected

 



21  therein and the Closing Working Capital, the Closing Indebtedness and the
Closing Cash, respectively, set forth in the Parent Closing Statement, and
(ii) with respect to any specific discrepancy or disagreement, shall be no
greater than the higher amount calculated by Parent or the Equityholder
Representative, as the case may be, and no lower than the lower amount
calculated by Parent or the Equityholder Representative as the case may be.
The fees and expenses of the Designated Accounting Firm shall be paid by
Parent and the Equityholder Representative (on behalf of the Equityholders)
from the Equityholder Representative Expense Fund in inverse proportion as
they may prevail (based on the disputed items as resolved by the Designated
Accounting Firm as compared to the disputed items proposed by Parent and the
Equityholder Representative, respectively), as determined by the Designated
Accounting Firm.

 

(c) _Procedure for Payment Following Post-Closing Adjustment_. Within three
(3) Business Days following the final determination of each of the Closing
Working Capital, the Closing Indebtedness and the Closing Cash:

(i) If the Closing Working Capital, as finally determined in accordance with
this _Section 2.12_, is less than the Estimated Closing Working Capital (such
deficiency, a " _Working Capital Shortfall_ "), then Parent and the
Equityholder Representative shall promptly direct the Escrow Agent to
disburse to the Surviving Corporation the amount of such Working Capital
Shortfall from the Indemnity Escrow Fund in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement; or if the Estimated Closing Working Capital is less than the
Closing Working Capital, as finally determined in accordance with this
_Section 2.12_, Parent shall deposit the amount of such excess of the Closing
Working Capital over the Estimated Closing Working Capital with the Payment
Agent for distribution to the Equityholders (in accordance with _Section
2.08_ and the written instructions provided by the Equityholder Representative
to the Payment Agent). If the Estimated Closing Working Capital equals the
Closing Working Capital, as finally determined in accordance with this
_Section 2.12_, no disbursement or deposit will be required.

(ii) If the Closing Indebtedness, as finally determined in accordance with
this _Section 2.12_, is greater than the Estimated Closing Indebtedness (such
excess, a " _Indebtedness Overage_ "), then Parent and the Equityholder
Representative shall promptly direct the Escrow Agent to disburse to the
Surviving Corporation the amount of such Indebtedness Overage from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund in accordance with the Escrow Agreement; or if the
Estimated Closing Indebtedness is greater than the Closing Indebtedness, as
finally determined in accordance with this _Section 2.12_, Parent shall
deposit the amount of such excess of the Estimated Closing Indebtedness over
the Closing Indebtedness with the Payment Agent for distribution to the
Equityholders (in accordance with _Section 2.08_ and the written instructions
provided by the Equityholder Representative to the Payment Agent). If the
Estimated Closing Indebtedness equals the Closing Indebtedness, as finally
determined in accordance with this _Section 2.12_, no disbursement or deposit
will be required.

 

(iii) If the Closing Cash, as finally determined in accordance with this
_Section 2.12_, is less than the Estimated Closing Cash (such deficiency, a
" _Cash Shortfall_ "), then Parent and the Equityholder Representative shall
promptly direct the

 



22  Escrow Agent to disburse to the Surviving Corporation the amount of such
Cash Shortfall from the Indemnity Escrow Fund in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement; or if the Estimated Closing Cash is less than the Closing Cash, as
finally determined in accordance with this _Section 2.12_, Parent shall
deposit the amount of such excess of the Closing Cash over the Estimated
Closing Cash with the Payment Agent for distribution to the Equityholders (in
accordance with _Section 2.08_ and the written instructions provided by the
Equityholder Representative to the Payment Agent). If the Estimated Closing
Cash equals the Closing Cash, as finally determined in accordance with this
_Section 2.12_, no disbursement or deposit will be required.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the payments required to be made
pursuant to this _Section 2.12(c)_ may be made on a cumulative basis and
netted against one another.

Section 2.13 Treatment of Company Options.

(a) At the Effective Time, each In-the-Money Company Option that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled
immediately prior to the Effective Time and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i)
the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if any, of
the Common Per Share Amount less the exercise price per share of such Company
Option (the " _Option Consideration_ "). Each holder of an outstanding In-the-
Money Company Option shall be entitled to receive in exchange for the
cancellation thereof the Option Consideration with respect to each share
of Company Capital Stock subject to such outstanding In-the-Money Company
Option, minus the portion of such cash amount to be deposited in the Escrow
Funds pursuant to _Section 2.08(d)_, and the Company shall cause such payment
to be made to the holder of such Company Option, if a current or former
employee of the Company, through the payroll system of the Company or, if not
a current or former employee of the Company, through the Payment Agent, in
each case, payable as soon as practicable following the Closing Date (and, in
the case of current or former employees of the Company, in no event later than
the next regularly scheduled payroll run of the Company following the Closing
Date).

 

(b) All Company Options which are not In-the-Money Company Options shall be
cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time in exchange for no
consideration.

(c) Not less than 15 days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall send
a written notice in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent to each holder of
an outstanding Company Option that shall inform such holder of the treatment
of the Company Options provided in this _Section 2.13_.

 

Section 2.14 Treatment of Warrants. Promptly following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall deliver notice of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement in accordance with the terms of each outstanding Company
Warrant. To the extent that any Company Warrant will not expire or be
cancelled by its terms by virtue of the Merger, the Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Company Warrant (including
pursuant to an amendment thereto), as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent or Merger Sub, to be
cancelled and extinguished to

 



23  the extent such Company Warrant is not exercised prior to the Closing (each,
a " _Cancelled Warrant_ "), and as a result

thereof, to cause each holder of a Cancelled Warrant to cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive in respect thereof at
the Closing, with respect to any Company Series B-1 Warrant, an amount equal
to: (x) the product of (1) the number of shares of Company Preferred Stock
that would be issued immediately prior to the Effective Time assuming the
exercise of the applicable Company Warrant for cash,  _multiplied_ by (2) the
Class B Per Share Amount, _less_ (y) the aggregate cash exercise price per
share of Company Preferred Stock underlying such Company Warrant that would
otherwise be payable with respect to such Cancelled Warrant, _less_ (z) the
portion of such cash amount to be deposited in the Escrow Funds pursuant to
_Section 2.08(d)_ (such amount, the " _Cancelled Warrant Consideration_ ").
The Payment Agent shall pay (and Purchaser shall cause the Payment Agent to
pay) the applicable Cancelled Warrant Consideration, if any, to each holder of
Cancelled Warrants in respect thereof at the Closing as set forth in this
_Section 2.14_ upon receipt of a warrant agreement for each such Cancelled
Warrant, together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto.

and no Company IP is subject to, any Company IP Contract containing any
covenant or other provision that in any way limits or restricts the ability of
any Acquired Company to use, assert, enforce, or otherwise exploit any
Company IP anywhere in the world. No Acquired Company has transferred

3.16(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule). None of the Acquired Companies
has received any written notice or claims challenging any of the Acquired
Companys exclusive ownership of any Company IP or the validity or
enforceability of any Company IP. Each Person who is or was an employee,
officer, director or contractor of any Acquired Company and who is or was
involved in the creation or development of any Company IP has signed an
enforceable agreement containing an assignment to the applicable Acquired
Company of all Intellectual Property Rights in such Persons contribution to
the Company IP. No current or former shareholder, officer, director, or
employee of any of the Acquired Companies has any claim, right (whether or not

all Applicable Laws. No interference, opposition, reissue, reexamination, or
other Proceeding is or since January 1, 2010, has been pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened, in which the scope, validity, or
enforceability of any Company IP that is Registered IP is being or has been

any of the Acquired Companies at any time since January 1, 2010, has been
abandoned, allowed to lapse, or rejected, except for such registrations that
the Company has permitted to expire or has cancelled or abandoned in its
reasonable business judgment. To the Knowledge of the Company, no trademark or
trade name owned, used, or applied for by any of the Acquired Companies
conflicts or interferes with any trademark or trade name owned, used, and
applied for by any other Person. To the Knowledge of the Company, no event or
state of facts (including a failure to exercise adequate quality controls
and an assignment in gross without the accompanying goodwill) has occurred or
exists that has resulted in the abandonment of any material trademark (whether
registered or unregistered) owned by any of the Acquired Companies. None of
the Acquired Companies has engaged in Patent or copyright misuse or any fraud
or inequitable conduct in connection with any Registered IP. Each of the

applicable Governmental Authorities with respect to all Patents included in
the Company IP. _Section 3.16(h)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets

modification of any right or obligation under any Contract listed or required

the invalidity of any of the Company IP, or (ii) any actual, alleged, or
suspected infringement, misappropriation, or violation of any Intellectual
Property Right of another Person by any of the Acquired Companies relating to
the conduct of the businesses of the Acquired Companies. The representations
and warranties in this _Section 3.16(k)_ are the Companys sole
representations and warranties with respect to infringement, misappropriation
or violation of third party Intellectual Property Rights.

(l) Each of the Acquired Companies has taken commercially reasonable steps
(including entering into written confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements
with officers, directors, subcontractors, employees, licensors, licensees,
suppliers, distributors, agents and customers where necessary and
appropriate) to safeguard, maintain the confidentiality of, and otherwise
protect and enforce its rights in all proprietary information that the
Acquired Companies hold or purport to hold as a trade secret included in the
Company IP or related to the conduct of the business of the Acquired
Companies. Without limiting the foregoing, to the Knowledge of the Company (i)

the following functions: (i) disrupting, disabling, harming, or otherwise
impeding in any manner the operation of, or providing unauthorized access to,
a computer system or network or other device on which such code is stored or
installed, or (ii) compromising the privacy or data security of a user or
damaging or destroying any data or file without the users consent
(collectively, " _Malicious Code_ "). Each Acquired Company implements
industry standard measures designed to prevent the introduction of Malicious
Code into Company Products, including firewall protections and regular
virus scans.

(o) No source code for any Company Product has been delivered, licensed, or

(g) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not (either alone or together with any other event, including a subsequent
termination of employment or service) entitle any employee or independent
contractor of any Acquired Company to severance pay or accelerate the time of
payment or vesting or trigger any payment of funding (through a grantor trust
or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable
or trigger any other material obligation pursuant to, any Employee Plan
(including any acceleration of vesting with respect to a Company Option held
by employees of an Acquired Company as a result of the Merger or any
termination of employment in connection therewith). There is no Contract
covering any employee or other service provider of any Acquired Company that,
considered individually or considered collectively with any other such

There is no Contract by which any Acquired Company is bound to compensate any
employee for excise taxes paid pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code.

Acquired Company or any ERISA Affiliate, except as required to avoid excise
tax under Section 4980B of the Code or as required by similar state law
or except for the continuation of coverage through the end of the calendar
month in which termination from employment occurs. No condition exists that
would prevent any Acquired Company or any ERISA Affiliate from amending or
terminating any Employee Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" as
defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA and neither any Acquired

 



48  Company nor such Employee Plan will be subject to any surrender fees or
service fees upon termination except for any reasonable administrative fees
associated with the termination of such plan. 

(i) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement
(whether or not written) by any Acquired Company or any of its Affiliates
relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage under, an
Employee Plan which would increase materially the expense of maintaining such
Employee Plan above the level of the expense incurred in respect thereof for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012.

(j) No Acquired Company or any ERISA Affiliate has ever

(k) All contributions and payments accrued under each Employee Plan,
determined in accordance with prior funding and accrual practices, as
adjusted to include proportional accruals for the period ending as of the date
of this Agreement, have been discharged and paid on or prior to the date of
this Agreement except to the extent reflected as a liability on the
Balance Sheet. All contributions due from any Acquired Company with respect
to any Employee Plan qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and containing
a Code Section 401(k) cash or deferred arrangement (each, a " _401(k) Plan_ ")
have been timely made.

(l) There is no Proceeding pending against or involving or, to the Knowledge
of the Company, threatened against or involving, any Employee Plan (other
than routine claims for benefits).

(m) No Acquired Company or any ERISA Affiliate (nor any predecessor thereof)
sponsors, maintains or contributes to any Employee Plan which is maintained
for the benefit of any employee or service provider (or former employee or
service provider) who performs services outside the United States.

(n) Each person providing services to any Acquired Company that has been
characterized as a consultant or independent contractor and not an employee
has been properly characterized as such and no Acquired Company or any ERISA
Affiliate has any liability or obligations, including under or on account of
any Employee Plan, arising out of the hiring or retention of persons to
provide services to any Acquired Company or any ERISA Affiliate and treating
such persons as consultants or independent contractors and not as employees of
any Acquired Company or any ERISA Affiliate.

 

(o) With respect to any "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined
in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) maintained or sponsored by an Acquired
Company, (i) such plan has been operated in good faith compliance with Section
409A of the Code and the guidance issued thereunder, (ii) such plan complies
in all material respects in form with Section 409A of the Code and the
guidance issued thereunder as of December 31, 2008 and (iii) the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement will not result in Section 409A of the Code
imposing any adverse tax consequences to the participants in such plan
(including the inclusion in income of deferred amounts, or any additional tax
pursuant to Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code).

 



49 (p) All Company Options have been appropriately authorized by the Company
Board of Directors or an appropriate committee thereof, including approval of
the option exercise price or the methodology for determining the option
exercise price and the substantive option terms. All of such options granted
to employees in the United States reflect the fair market value of the
Company Common Stock as determined in good faith by the Company Board of
Directors and to the extent applicable, in consideration of Section 409A of
the Code on the date the option was granted (within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.421-1(c)). No Company Options have been retroactively
granted, or the exercise price of any such option determined retroactively in
contravention of any Applicable Law.

 

(q) No Acquired Company is a party to or subject to, or is currently
negotiating in connection with entering into, any collective bargaining
agreement or other contract or understanding with a labor union, works council

practices, terms and conditions of employment, employee safety and health,
immigration status and wages and hours, and in each case, with respect to

Taxes or any penalty for failure to comply with any of the foregoing, and
(ii) are not liable for any payment to any trust or other fund governed by or
maintained by or on behalf of any governmental authority, with respect to
unemployment compensation benefits, social security or other benefits or
obligations for employees (in each case, other than routine payments to be
made in the normal course of business and consistent with past practice).
There are no controversies pending, or to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened between any Acquired Company and any of its respective current or
former employees that would reasonably be expected to result in a Proceeding.

(r) To the Knowledge of the Company, no employee of any Acquired Company is in
violation of any term of any employment agreement, noncompetition agreement,
or any restrictive covenant to a former employer relating to the right of any
such employee to be employed by any Acquired Company because of the nature of
the business conducted or presently proposed to be conducted by any Acquired
Company or to the use of trade secrets or proprietary information of others.

(s) Each Acquired Company is in compliance in all material respects with the
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, as amended ("
_WARN Act_ "), or any similar Applicable Law. Since January 1, 2010, (i) no
Acquired Company has effectuated a "plant closing" (as defined in the WARN
Act) affecting any site of employment or one or more facilities or operating
units within any site of employment or facility of its business; (ii) there
has not occurred a "mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act) affecting any
site of employment or facility of any Acquired Company; and (iii) no Acquired

similar Applicable Law. No Acquired Company has caused any of its employees
to suffer an "employment loss" (as defined in the WARN Act) during the 90 day
period prior to the date of this Agreement.

 



50 (t) There has not been since January 1, 2010, nor are there currently, any

Company, the Company Board of Directors or any committee thereof (or any
Person at the request of any of the foregoing) concerning any financial,
accounting, Tax, conflict of interest, illegal activity, fraudulent or
deceptive conduct, discrimination/sexual harassment, whistleblowing or other
misfeasance or malfeasance issues with respect to any current or former
director, officer, advisor, consultant or employee of any Acquired Company.

related thereto to the vote of the stockholders of the Company. The Company
shall, and shall cause each of its Representatives and each of the other
Acquired Companies (and each of their respective Representatives) to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted prior to or on the date
of this Agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and shall promptly

oral and a written description of any expression of interest, inquiry,
proposal or offer relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal, or any request
for information that would reasonably be expected to be used for the purposes

59 Section 5.04 Access to Information. From the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, subject to Applicable Laws, the Company shall and
shall cause each other Acquired Company to, upon reasonable advance written
notice from Parent, (i) give Parent and its Representatives reasonable access
to the offices, properties, books and records of the Acquired Companies during
normal business hours of the Acquired Companies, (ii) furnish to Parent and
its Representatives such financial and operating data and other information
relating to the Acquired Companies as such Persons may reasonably request and
(iii) instruct the employees, counsel and financial advisors of the Acquired
Companies to cooperate with Parent in its investigation of the Acquired
Companies. Any investigation pursuant to this _Section 5.04_ shall be
conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of
the business of the Acquired Companies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i)
Parent shall not have access to personnel records of the Acquired Companies
relating to individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories or
other information which in the Companys good-faith opinion is sensitive or
the disclosure of which could subject the Company to risk of liability, and
(ii) Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives shall not contact
customers, suppliers or employees of the Company regarding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the Company.

Section 5.05 280G Matters. 

(a) The Company shall obtain and deliver to Parent, prior to the mailing or
delivery to the Company Stockholders of the Information Statement, (i) the
calculations made to determine whether payments to any individual would be
characterized as a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(2) of the Code and (ii) a Parachute Payment Waiver in a form
acceptable to Parent (a " _Parachute Payment Waiver_ ") from each Person who
is or reasonably could be, with respect to the Company and/or any ERISA
Affiliate, a "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G of
the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder), as determined
immediately prior to the initiation of the stockholder solicitation, and who
reasonably might otherwise receive, have received, or have the right
or entitlement to receive a parachute payment under Section 280G of the Code
(such Persons being set forth on _Schedule 5.05(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter).

(b) The Company shall include in the Information Statement and the stockholder
solicitation a proposal to be voted on by the Company Stockholders in
accordance with the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code (the " _280G
Proposal_ ") so as to render the parachute payment provisions of Section 280G
of the Code inapplicable to any and all payments and/or benefits provided
pursuant to Contracts or arrangements that, in the absence of the executed
Parachute Payment Waivers by the affected Persons under _Section 5.05(a)_,
might otherwise reasonably result, separately or in the aggregate, in the
payment of any amount and/or the provision of any benefit that would not be
deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code, with such stockholder
approval to be solicited in a manner which satisfies all applicable
requirements of such Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder, including Q-7 of Section 1.280G-1 of such Treasury
Regulations.

Section 5.06 Termination of Employee Plans. Unless Parent directs the Company
otherwise in writing no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the
Effective Time, the

 



60  Company Board of Directors (or the board of directors of the applicable
Acquired Company) shall adopt resolutions terminating, effective at least one
day prior to the Effective Time, any 401(k) Plan. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall provide Parent with executed resolutions of its Board
of Directors (or the board of directors of the applicable Acquired Company)
authorizing such termination and amending any such 401(k) Plan commensurate
with its termination to the extent necessary to comply with all Applicable
Laws. The Company shall also take (and shall cause each applicable Acquired
Company to take) such other actions in furtherance of the termination of each
401(k) Plan as Parent may reasonably require.

Section 5.07 Notices of Certain Events. From the date of this Agreement
until the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with its terms, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of:

(a) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

(b) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority (i)
delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or (ii) indicating that a Permit is revoked or about to be revoked or that a
Permit is required in any jurisdiction in which such Permit has not been

its Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting any Acquired Company, that, if pending on the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to
_Sections 3.11_ or _3.16_ , as the case may be, or that relate to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(d) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement that would cause a failure of a condition set
forth in _Article 8_ ; and

(e) any event, condition, or fact that would prevent the satisfaction of any
of the conditions set forth in _Article 8_ prior to the End Date or Outside
End Date, as the case may be.

 

No such notice shall be deemed to supplement or amend the Company Disclosure
Schedule for the purpose of (i) determining the accuracy of any of
the representations and warranties made by the Company in this Agreement, or
(ii) determining whether any of the conditions set forth in _Article 8_ has
been satisfied.

Section 5.08 Consideration Spreadsheet. Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall prepare and deliver to Parent a spreadsheet in the form of _Exhibit J_

updated as of the Effective Time. 

Section 5.09 Payoff Letters and Invoices. The Company shall exercise
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent no later than
three Business Days prior to the

 



61  Closing Date, an accurate and complete copy of: (a) a payoff letter, dated
no more than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, with respect to all
Indebtedness, if any, of any Acquired Company owed to such lender and the
amounts payable to the lender thereof to (i) satisfy such Indebtedness as of
the Closing and (ii) terminate and release any Encumbrances related thereto
(each, a " _Payoff Letter_ "); and (b) an invoice from each advisor or other
service provider to any Acquired Company, dated no more than three Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, with respect to all Company Transaction
Expenses estimated to be due and payable to such advisor or other service

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES

 

Section 6.01 Reasonable Best Efforts.

(a) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the conditions set
forth in _Sections 8.01_ and _8.02_ to be satisfied on a timely basis, and

basis.

party to this Agreement (i) shall make all filings and give all notices
reasonably required to be made and given by such party in connection with the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii)
shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain all Consents required to be
obtained (pursuant to any Applicable Law or Contract, or otherwise) by such
party in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Each party shall, upon request of another party and to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law or applicable Contracts, promptly deliver

and _(b)_ , as promptly as possible after the execution of this Agreement and
in any event within one (1) Business Day of the date of this Agreement (except
as extended by mutual consent confirmed in writing), the parties to this
Agreement shall prepare and prefile with CFIUS a draft joint voluntary notice
pursuant to the Exon-Florio Amendment to the Defense Production Act of 1950,
50 U.S.C. app. § 2170, as amended (" _Exon-Florio_ ") with respect to the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Promptly upon receiving feedback
from CFIUS with respect to the draft joint voluntary notice, the parties to
this Agreement shall file with CFIUS a formal joint voluntary notice with
respect to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. The parties shall
provide CFIUS with any additional or supplemental information requested by
CFIUS or its member agencies during the Exon-Florio review process as
promptly as practicable, and in all cases within the amount of time allowed by
CFIUS. The parties, in cooperation with each other, shall use reasonable best
efforts to finally and successfully complete the Exon-Florio review process
as promptly as practicable. Parent, and to the extent reasonable necessary,
Ultimate Parent, shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions that are
customarily undertaken to obtain CFIUS approval so as to enable the Closing,
including, but not limited to, (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by mitigation agreement, letter of assurance, national security
agreement, security control agreement, special security arrangement, voting
trust 

 



62  agreement or proxy agreement, restrictions or actions that after the Closing
would limit Parents freedom of action, ownership, control, influence,
management or access over the Acquired Companies, and (ii) the transfer or
sale of contracts or associated interests. The Company shall cooperate and
take reasonable best efforts to assist Parent in obtaining CFIUS approval. To
the extent CFIUS approval is a condition to Parents obligations hereunder,
and such approval is granted subject to any of the conditions or actions
described above, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the relevant Closing condition shall be deemed satisfied for purposes
of _Section 8.02(e)_.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing _Sections 6.01(a)_
and _(b)_ , each of Parent and the Company shall file or cause to be filed
within one (1) Business Day of the date of this Agreement (except as extended
by mutual consent confirmed in writing) an appropriate filing of an
HSR Notification and Report Form with the U.S. Department of Justice and
Federal Trade Commission (each an " _Antitrust Authority_ ") pursuant to the
HSR Act. The Company and Parent shall as promptly as practicable respond to
and, if relevant under Applicable Law, certify substantial compliance with
any inquiries or requests received from any Antitrust Authority for additional

promptly inform the other party of any communication to or from any Antitrust
Authority regarding the Merger, and if such communication is in writing,
provide a copy to the other party, (2) give the other party prompt notice of
the commencement or threat of commencement of any Proceeding by or before any
Antitrust Authority with respect to the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (3) keep the other party
informed as to the status of any such Proceeding or threat. Except as may be
prohibited by any Antitrust Authority or by any Applicable Law, (a) the
Company and Parent will consult and cooperate with one another, and will
consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any
analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or
proposal made or submitted in connection with any Proceeding under or relating
to any Antitrust Laws, and (b) in connection with any such Proceeding, each of
the Company and Parent will permit authorized Representatives of the other
party to be present at each meeting or conference relating to any such
Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any
document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Antitrust Authority in
connection with any such Proceeding.

(e) For purposes of the undertakings set forth in _Section 6.01(d)_, the
parties hereto understand and agree that the reasonable best efforts of any
party hereto shall not be deemed to include (i) entering into any settlement,
undertaking, consent decree, stipulation or agreement with any Antitrust
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or (ii)
divesting or otherwise holding separate (including by establishing a trust or
otherwise), or taking any other action (or otherwise agreeing to do any of
the foregoing) with respect to any of its or the Surviving Corporations
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates businesses, assets or
properties. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, at the request of Parent,
the Company shall agree to divest, sell, dispose of, hold separate or
otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its freedom of action
with respect to its ability to operate or retain any of the businesses,
product lines or assets of Acquired Companies, _provided_ , that any such
action is conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, Parent shall not be required to litigate any
objections or oppositions raised by any Antitrust Authority relating to the
matters contemplated by this _Section 6.01_, although it may, at its sole
discretion, elect to do so.

 



63 (f) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing _Sections 6.01(a)_
and  _(b)_ , pursuant to ITAR Section 122.4, as promptly as possible after
the execution of this Agreement and in any event no later than one (1)
Business Day after the date of this Agreement (except by mutual consent
confirmed in writing), the Company shall notify the U.S. Department of
States Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (" _DDTC_ ") of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and thereafter provide as promptly as
practicable any supplemental information requested by DDTC in connection
therewith. The Company and Parent shall cooperate prior to the Closing to
promptly submit all required notices to DDTC.

Section 6.02 Confidentiality; Public Announcements.

(a) Ultimate Parent, Parent and the Company hereby acknowledge and agree to
continue to be bound by that certain nondisclosure agreement dated as of
November 21, 2012, by and between Parent (or an Affiliate of Parent) and the
Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

(b) The parties shall not, and the parties shall cause each of their
respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, issue any press
release or other public statement relating to the terms of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby or use any other partys name or refer to
any other party directly or indirectly in connection with such partys
relationship with the other parties in any media interview, advertisement,
news release, press release or professional or trade publication, or in any
print media, whether or not in response to an inquiry, without the prior
written approval of Parent, on the one hand, and the Equityholder
Representative, on the other hand, unless (i) required by Applicable Law,
including to the extent disclosure is required by the Equityholders to their
respective Tax, legal or financial advisors for purposes of complying with
such Equityholders Tax obligations or other reporting obligations under
Applicable Law arising out of the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) to
the extent disclosure is made by an Equityholder that is a venture capital or
private equity fund to its partners and limited partners, subject to a duty of
confidentiality, and is limited to the results of such Equityholders
investment in the Company. In addition, (i) an Equityholder will be permitted
to communicate, without any consent of Parent, with its current and
prospective investors after the Effective Time regarding the existence of the
Merger, the return on an Equityholders investment in the Company and other
summary terms of the Merger, including the name of Parent, and (ii) an
Equityholder will be permitted to communicate, without such consent,
information regarding the subject matter of this Agreement to the extent that
such information is or becomes generally known to the public without
violation of this Agreement or any other agreement or obligation restricting
the disclosure of such information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, following
Closing and the public announcement of the Merger, the Equityholder
Representative shall be permitted to publicly announce that it has been
engaged to serve as the Equityholder Representative in connection with the
Merger as long as such announcement does not disclose any of the other terms
of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated herein.

 



64 Section 6.03 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification for acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time existing as of the date of
this Agreement, including, without limitation, any indemnification agreements
in effect as of the date hereof and made available to Parent prior to the date
hereof, in favor of the current and former directors and officers of
each Acquired Company (each, a " _D andO Indemnified Party_" and collectively,
the " _D andO Indemnified Parties_") shall survive the Merger and shall continue
in full force and effect in accordance with their terms following the
Effective Time, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill
and honor such obligations to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law.

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall obtain and fully pay for "tail"
insurance policies with a claims period of at least six years from the Closing
Date from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers
liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the
Companys existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the Closing Date (such policies, the " _D andO Tail Policy_"). The
cost of the DandO Tail Policy will be treated as a Company Transaction Expense
hereunder. During the term of the DandO Tail Policy (as defined below), Parent
shall not (and shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to) take any action
following the Closing to cause the DandO Tail Policy to be cancelled or any
provision therein to be amended or waived;  _provided_ , that neither Parent,
the Surviving Corporation nor any Affiliate thereof shall be obligated to pay
any premiums or other amounts in respect of such DandO Tail Policy.

 

(c) The provisions of this _Section 6.03_ shall survive the Closing and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, each DandO Indemnified
Party and his or her heirs and personal representatives, and nothing in this
Agreement shall affect any indemnification rights that any such DandO
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and personal representatives may have
under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any
contract or Applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the obligations under this _Section 6.03_ shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any DandO Indemnified Party
to whom this _Section 6.03_ applies without the consent of such affected DandO
Indemnified Party.

 

Section 6.04 Employee Matters. On and after the Closing Date, Parent or an
affiliate of Parent shall provide employees of each Acquired Company who
continue to be employed by an Acquired Company or by Parent or an Affiliate of
Parent on and after the Closing (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") with base
salary, bonus opportunity, severance and benefits which are, in the
aggregate, no less favorable in the aggregate as provided by Parent and its
Affiliates to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Affiliates (but
that are no worse than such Continuing Employees existing compensation and
benefits and Employee Plans each such employee is entitled or eligible to
receive from any Acquired Company as of the Closing Date). Parent further
agrees that, from and after the Closing Date, Parent shall and shall cause
each Acquired Company and each of its Affiliates to grant all of the
Continuing Employees credit for any service with such Acquired Company earned
prior to the Closing Date (i) for eligibility and vesting purposes and (ii)
for purposes of vacation accrual and severance benefit determinations under
any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement that may
be established or that is maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation or
any of its 

 



65  Subsidiaries on or after the Closing Date (the " _Parent Plans_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that such service shall not be recognized or credited
(i) for any purpose under any equity or quasi-equity compensation plan or
defined benefit pension maintained by Parent or Parents Affiliates, or (ii)
to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits
provided to the Continuing Employee or to the extent that such service was
not recognized under any similar Employee Plan of the Company. In addition,
for purposes of each Parent Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical,
vision and/or other health benefits to any Continuing Employee, Parent shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) cause to be waived all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements and similar
limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements to the extent waived or satisfied by a Continuing Employee and
his or her covered dependents under any Employee Plan as of the Closing Date
and (B) cause any deductible, co-insurance and covered out-of-pocket
expenses paid by any Continuing Employee (or covered dependent thereof)
during the portion of the plan year in which such Continuing Employee
participated in an Employee Plan to be taken into account for purposes of
satisfying the corresponding deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket provisions after the Closing Date under any applicable Parent Plan in
the applicable plan year. The provisions of this _Section 6.04_ are for the
sole benefit of Parent and the Company and nothing contained herein, express
or implied, is intended to confer upon any employee or former employee of any
Acquired Company any right to continued or resumed employment for any period
or continued receipt of any specific employee benefit, or shall constitute an
amendment to or any other modification of any Parent Plan or Employee Plan (or
an undertaking to amend any such plan) or other compensation and benefits plan
maintained for or provided to Company employees, including
Continuing Employees, prior to, on or following the Closing. No provision of
this _Section 6.04_ shall create any rights in any such persons in respect of
any benefits that may be provided under any plan or arrangement which may be
established by Parent, or any of Parents Affiliates. Nothing contained
herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Company, Parent and their
Affiliates shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring, the
Company, Parent or their Affiliates to continue any specific Employee Plan.

Section 6.05 Management Bonus Plan Payments.

 

(a) The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation (or any successor thereto) to, make the payments required
(subject to the satisfaction of any conditions thereto) to be made under the
Management Bonus Plan at the times and on the terms set forth therein and in
the Offer Letters.

 

(b) Within thirty (30) days following the end of the fiscal quarter of
Ultimate Parent in which the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date
occurs, Parent shall deliver the MBP Tax Benefit Payment to the Payment Agent
for further distribution to the Equityholders in proportion to their
respective Pro Rata Shares. For the avoidance of doubt, the amount of the MBP
Tax Benefit Payment shall not be subject to any reductions, set-offs or
similar adjustments.

 



66 ARTICLE 7.

TAX MATTERS

Section 7.01 Tax Periods Ending on or before the Closing Date. The
Equityholder Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax
Returns for the Acquired Companies for all periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date that are filed after the Closing Date and all such Tax Returns
shall be prepared consistent with past practice except as otherwise required
by Applicable Law. The Equityholder Representative shall provide all Tax
Returns described in the preceding sentence to Parent for its review and
approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) at least
fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the due date (taking into account any
extension) for the filing of such Tax Returns. The Equityholder Representative
shall make all changes reasonably requested by Parent that Parent submits to
the Equityholder Representative no less than five (5) Business Days prior to
the due date of such Tax Returns and shall provide Parent with such Tax
Returns reasonably in advance of such due date to enable timely filing of
such Tax Returns. Parent shall file or cause to be filed such Tax Returns,
_provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to _Article 10_ ,
Parent may recover from the Indemnity Escrow Fund an amount equal to such
Taxes of the Acquired Companies required to be remitted with such Tax Returns
for such periods.

Section 7.02 Straddle Periods. Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared
and file or cause to be filed any Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies for
all Straddle Periods and all such Tax Returns (to the extent relating to Pre-
Closing Tax Periods) shall be prepared consistent with past practice except
as otherwise required by Applicable Law. Parent shall provide all Tax Returns
described in the preceding sentence to the Equityholder Representative for its
review and approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) at least fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the due date (taking
into account any extension) for the filing of such Tax Returns. Parent shall
make all changes reasonably requested by the Equityholder Representative no
less than five (5) Business Days prior to the due date of such Tax Returns.
For the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to _Article 10_ , Parent may recover from
the Indemnity Escrow Fund an amount equal to the portion of such Taxes
required to be remitted with such Tax Returns which relates to the portion of
such Taxable period ending on the Closing Date. For purposes of this _Section
7.02_ and _Section 10.02(f)_, the portion of any Tax that relates to the
portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall (a) in the
case of real property, personal property and similar _ad valorem_ Taxes, be
deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period
_multiplied_ by a fraction (i) the numerator of which is the number of days
of such Straddle Period in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and (ii) the denominator
of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period, and (b) in the
case of any other Tax, be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable
if the taxable year of the relevant Acquired Company terminated at the close
of business on the Closing Date.

Section 7.03 Cooperation on Tax Matters. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
the Equityholder Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the preparation
and filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Agreement and any Tax Contest. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other partys request)
the provision of records and information which may be reasonably relevant to
any such Tax Return or Tax Contest and making appropriate persons available on
a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder. Parent, the Acquired Companies and the
Equityholder Representative shall retain all books and records of the Acquired
Companies with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Acquired Companies
relating to any Taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the 

 



67  expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified, any
extensions thereof) of the respective Taxable periods, and abide by all record
retention agreements entered into with any Taxing authority.

Section 7.04 Contest Provisions. If, subsequent to the Closing, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation receives notice of a Tax Contest with respect to any
Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period with respect to which Indemnitees
claim a right to indemnification under this Agreement, then within fifteen
(15) days after receipt of such notice, Parent shall notify the Equityholder
Representative of such notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that any failure on
the part of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to so notify the Equityholder
Representative shall not limit any of the obligations of the Indemnitors
under _Article 10_ (except to the extent such failure materially prejudices
the defense of such Tax Contest). Parent shall have the right to control the
conduct of all Tax Contests, including any settlement or compromise thereof,
it being understood that reasonable costs and expenses relating to the conduct
of such Tax Contest constitute indemnifiable Damages pursuant to _Section
10.02_; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Parent shall keep the Equityholder
Representative reasonably informed regarding the progress of any Tax Contest,
(ii) the Equityholder Representative shall have the right to participate in
any such Tax Contest to the extent relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period,
including having a reasonable opportunity to comment on any written materials
prepared in connection with any Tax Contest to the extent relating to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period and attending any conferences relating to any Tax Contest
to the extent relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, and (iii) Parent shall
not resolve such Tax Contest in a manner that would reasonably be expected to
have an adverse impact on the Indemnitors indemnification obligations under
this Agreement without the Equityholder Representatives prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed; _provided_ , _further_ , that if Parent receives a binding written
offer from the relevant Governmental Authority to settle or compromise any
such Tax Contest in full which proposed settlement or compromise would not
materially and adversely affect Parent (taking into account Parents
indemnification rights pursuant to this Agreement) but which offer Parent
does not accept and, within twenty (20) Business Days of receiving
notification of the terms of such settlement or compromise or, if earlier, ten
(10) Business Days prior to the deadline for responding to such proposed
settlement or compromise, the Equityholder Representative provides written
notice that (1) it would approve such settlement or compromise in full without
modification and (2) the Indemnitors would be fully liable for the Damages
owed to the Indemnitees as a result of the proposed settlement or compromise
of such Tax Contest, then the indemnification obligation of the Indemnitors
with respect to such Tax Contest shall not exceed the amount of
indemnification to which the Indemnitees would have been entitled if such
settlement or compromise had been accepted. Each party shall bear its own
costs for participating in such Tax Contest, except that Indemnitees may be
entitled to indemnification for their reasonable third-party costs and
expenses pursuant to this Agreement. " _Tax Contest_ " means any audit, other
administrative proceeding or inquiry or judicial proceeding involving Taxes.
In the event of any conflict or overlap between the provisions of this
_Section 7.04_ and _Section 10.06_, the provisions of this _Section 7.04_
shall control.

Section 7.05 Amendment of Tax Returns. Except as otherwise required by
Applicable Law (or by a Governmental Authority in connection with the
disposition of a Tax Contest), Parent (and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates)
shall not amend any Tax Return with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of any
Acquired Company without the prior written consent of the Equityholder
Representative, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

 



68 Section 7.06 Elections and Actions Relating to Pre-Closing Taxes. Except as
required by Applicable Law, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of
their Affiliates shall make a Tax election (including an election to change an
accounting method) that would reasonably be expected to have an adverse impact
on the Indemnitors indemnification obligations under this Agreement
(including, to the extent applicable, an election under Section 338 of the
Code with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) without
the prior written consent of the Equityholder Representative. After the
Closing, Parent and its Affiliates shall not voluntarily request any
examination, audit or other proceeding with Tax authorities regarding Taxes of
the Acquired Companies with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods (it being
understood that, for the avoidance of doubt, actions that would not breach
this covenant include the restructuring, dissolution or change in the
operations of any Acquired Company after the Closing Date, the filing of any
Tax Return relating to a Tax period or portion thereof other than a Pre-
Closing Tax Period, the initiation of any discussions with a Tax authority
with respect to Taxes relating to a Tax period or portion thereof beginning
after the Closing Date and any action or transaction undertaken with a
principal business purpose unrelated to Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period)
or, make any voluntary disclosures with Tax authorities with respect to Taxes
for Pre-Closing Tax Periods, in each case, without the prior written consent
of the Equityholder Representative, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

 

Section 7.07 Tax Refunds. Any refunds of Taxes or credits against Tax in lieu
of refunds (including any interest in respect thereof) actually received by
Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates,
(including by way of any amended Tax Return), with respect to any Acquired
Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be for the benefit of
the Equityholders, except to the extent such refund or credit arises as the
result of a carryback of a loss or other tax benefit from a Tax period (or
portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date or such refund or credit was
reflected in the calculation of Closing Working Capital, net of all
reasonable out of pocket costs and expenses and, except with respect to any
such refund or credit attributable to MBP Payments deducted on a Tax Return
for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, any Tax costs of Parent or its Affiliates (
_provided,_ that the reduction of a Tax attribute described in _Section
10.03(g)(A)_ or _(B)_ shall not be considered such a Tax cost) imposed on or
with respect to the receipt or payment of such refund or credit. Parent shall
pay to the Payment Agent (for further distribution to the Equityholders) any
amount to which the Equityholders are entitled pursuant to the preceding
sentence within five (5) Business Days after receipt to be distributed among
the Equityholders by the Payment Agent in accordance with each Equityholders
Pro Rata Share of such refund or credit; _provided_ , that with respect to any
amounts distributed to a Company Optionholder, Parent shall cooperate in
processing such payment. Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and
their Affiliates shall, if the Equityholder Representative so requests, cause
the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, at the
expense of the Equityholders, to use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any Tax refund or credit to which the Company Stockholders would be
entitled under this _Section 7.07_. To the extent such refund or credit is
subsequently disallowed or required to be returned to the applicable Tax
authority, the Equityholders shall promptly repay the amount of such refund or
credit, together with any interest, penalties or other additional amounts
imposed by such Tax authority, to Parent. 

 



69 Section 7.08 Transfer Taxes. Parent on the one hand, and the Equityholders on
the other hand, shall each be liable for fifty percent (50%) of any transfer,
value added, excise, stock transfer, stamp, recording, registration and any
similar Taxes (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") that become payable in connection with
the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby. The applicable parties
shall cooperate in filing such forms and documents as may be necessary to
permit any such Transfer Tax to be assessed and paid on or prior to the
Closing Date in accordance with any available pre sale filing procedure, and
to obtain any exemption or refund of any such Transfer Tax.

Section 7.09 Characterization of Payments. Any payments made pursuant to
_Section 6.05(b_), _Article 7_ or _Article 10_ shall constitute an adjustment
of the Aggregate Merger Consideration paid by Parent pursuant to _Article 2_
of this Agreement for Tax purposes and shall be treated as such by all
parties on their Tax Returns to the extent permitted by law.

the existence of an inaccuracy in or a breach of any of such representation

resolved. It is the express intent of the parties that, if the applicable
survival period for an item as contemplated by this _Section 10.01_ is

furnished to, or any investigation made by or knowledge of, any of the
Indemnitees or any of their Representatives.

information set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be
a representation and warranty made by the Company in this Agreement to the
extent such statement or other item of information is required to be set forth
in the Company Disclosure Schedule by the corresponding representation and
warranty.

 

(e) The parties acknowledge and agree that if the Surviving Corporation
suffers, incurs or otherwise becomes subject to any Damages as a result of or
in connection with any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or obligation, then (without limiting any of the rights of
the Surviving Corporation as an Indemnitee) Parent shall also be deemed, by
virtue of its ownership of the stock of the Surviving Corporation, to have
incurred Damages as a result of and in connection with such inaccuracy or
breach.

(f) Notwithstanding the Intermediate Expiration Date and the General
Expiration Date set forth in _Section 10.01(a)_, each representation or
warranty made by the Company in this Agreement shall survive until the SOL

from or relate to: (a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or
warranty set forth in Article 3 as of the date of this Agreement (without

qualification contained or incorporated directly or indirectly in such
representation or warranty, except with effect with respect to the
representations set forth in _Section 3.06(b)_, _Section 3.07(a)_ and
_Section 3.24_ for the sole purpose of calculating Damages, and not any

warranty set forth in _Article 3_ ); (b) any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty set forth in Article 3 as if such representation

(f) (i) any Taxes of the Acquired Companies with respect to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period, other than any Taxes arising out of a transaction effected by (or
at the direction of) Parent outside the ordinary course of business on the
Closing Date after the Closing, other than any transaction expressly
contemplated by this Agreement or the other agreements to be entered pursuant
thereto; (ii) any Taxes of the Acquired Companies imposed by Italian tax

contemplated hereby shall not, in the aggregate, exceed the amount of
Aggregate Merger Consideration actually received by such Indemnitor.

 

(d) The amount of any Damages subject to indemnification under _Section
10.02_ shall be calculated (i) net of any insurance proceeds actually
received by any Indemnitee from any third-party insurer in connection with
such Damages (net of any applicable deductibles, co-payments, "retro premium"
adjustments and similar costs or payments) or indemnity or contribution
amounts received from any third parties in connection with such Damages (net
of any applicable costs of recovery or collection thereof); and (ii) net of
any Loss Tax Benefit actually realized by any Indemnitee on account of
the incurrence of such Damages. For purposes hereof, "Loss Tax Benefit" shall
mean any refund of Taxes paid or reduction in the amount of Taxes which
otherwise would have been paid, determined on a with and without basis, to the
extent actually realized in the same Tax year as such Damages are realized or
in the subsequent Tax year. If any Indemnitee recovers amounts from any third
party with respect to such Damages after indemnification is made to it by the
Indemnitors, the Indemnitee shall promptly pay to the Indemnitors that made
such indemnification payment the amount of such third party recovery at such
time or times as and to the extent that such amount is actually received by
the Indemnitee.

 

(e) No Indemnitee shall be entitled to double recovery for any adjustments to
consideration provided for hereunder or for any indemnifiable Damages even
though such Damages, or any other incident, may have resulted from the breach
of more than one of the representations, warranties and covenants, or any
other indemnity, in this Agreement. No Indemnitee shall be entitled
to indemnification hereunder for any Damages (including any Damages arising
from a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth
herein) (and the amount of any such Damages incurred shall not be included in
the calculation of any limitations on indemnification set forth herein) to
the extent that the amount of such Damages was accrued as a current liability
(but only to the extent so accrued) and included in the calculation of Closing
Working Capital or Closing Indebtedness.

 



78 (f) The indemnification provisions contained in this _Article 10_ shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy following the Closing as to all Damages any
Indemnitee may incur arising from or relating to this Agreement, the Merger or
the transactions contemplated hereby (it being understood that nothing in this
_Section 10.03(f)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall affect the parties
rights to (x) specific performance with respect to the covenants referred to
in this Agreement or to be performed after the Closing or any rights arising
out of claims Parent or the Surviving Corporation may have under the Letters
of Transmittal delivered pursuant to _Section 2.08_) or (y) to pursue claims
for fraud (without duplication for any Damages recovered pursuant to the
indemnification provisions of this  _Article 10_ ).

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company
does not make any representation or warranty as to the existence, amount or
availability of (A) any net operating loss carryovers of the Acquired
Companies arising in a Pre-Closing Tax Period or (B) amortization deductions
arising as a result of the liquidation of PGT Phototonics S.p.A. and related
transactions, in each case to the extent such carryovers or deductions would
affect the Tax liability of any of the Acquired Companies for any taxable
period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date.

Section 10.04 Claims and Procedures.

 

(a) If at any time prior to the SOL Expiration Date, Intermediate Expiration
Date or General Expiration Date, as applicable, Parent determines in good
faith that any Indemnitee has a bona fide claim for indemnification pursuant
to this _Article 10_ , Parent may deliver to the Equityholder Representative a
certificate signed by any officer of Parent (any certificate delivered in
accordance with the provisions of this _Section 10.04(a) _an " _Officer s
Claim Certificate_"):

(i) stating that an Indemnitee has a claim for indemnification pursuant to
this _Article 10_ ;

(ii) to the extent possible, containing a good faith non-binding, preliminary
estimate of the amount to which such Indemnitee claims to be entitled to
receive, which shall be the amount of Damages such Indemnitee claims to have
so incurred or suffered or would reasonably be expected to incur or suffer;
and

 

(iii) specifying in reasonable detail (based upon the information then
possessed by Parent) the material facts known to the Indemnitee giving rise
to such claim.

No delay in providing such Officers Claim Certificate prior to the SOL
Expiration Date, Intermediate Expiration Date or General Expiration Date, as
applicable, shall affect an Indemnitees rights hereunder, unless (and then
only to the extent that) the Indemnitors are prejudiced thereby. From and
after the delivery of any Officers Claim Certificate, Parent shall provide
the Equityholder Representative and its Representatives with reasonable access
to the books and records of the Surviving Corporation (or any successor
thereto) for the purpose of enabling the Equityholder Representative and its
Representatives to review the Officers Claim Certificate and identify any
dispute related thereto.

 



79 (b) At the time of delivery of any Officers Claim Certificate to the
Equityholder Representative, a duplicate copy of such Officers Claim
Certificate shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent by or on behalf of Parent
(on behalf of itself or any other Indemnitee).

 

(c) If the Equityholder Representative in good faith objects to any claim made
by Parent in any Officers Claim Certificate, then the Equityholder
Representative shall deliver a written notice (a " _Claim Dispute Notice_ ")
to Parent during the 30-day period commencing upon receipt by the Equityholder
Representative of the Officers Claim Certificate. The Claim Dispute Notice
shall set forth in reasonable detail the principal basis for the dispute of
any claim made by Parent in the Officers Claim Certificate. If the
Equityholder Representative does not deliver a Claim Dispute Notice to
Parent prior to the expiration of such 30-day period, then (i) each claim for
indemnification set forth in such Officers Claim Certificate shall be deemed
to have been conclusively determined in Parents favor for purposes of this 
_Article 10_ on the terms set forth in the Officers Claim Certificate and
(ii) if cash remains in the Indemnity Escrow Fund, then Parent may direct in
writing, with a copy of such instruction delivered to the
Equityholder Representative, the Escrow Agent to deliver cash from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund to Parent in accordance with this _Section 10.04_.

(d) If the Equityholder Representative delivers a Claim Dispute Notice, then
Parent and the Equityholder Representative shall attempt in good faith to
resolve any such objections raised by the Equityholder Representative in such
Claim Dispute Notice. If Parent and the Equityholder Representative agree to a
resolution of such objection, then a written settlement agreement setting
forth the matters conclusively determined by Parent and the Equityholder
Representative shall be prepared and signed by both parties and, if cash
remains in the Indemnity Escrow Fund, promptly delivered to the Escrow Agent
directing the Escrow Agent to distribute cash from the Indemnity Escrow Fund
in accordance with the terms of such written settlement agreement.

(e) If no such resolution can be reached during the 45-day period following
Parents receipt of a given Claim Dispute Notice, then upon the expiration of
such 45-day period, either Parent or the Equityholder Representative may bring
suit to resolve the objection in accordance with _Sections 11.09_ , _11.10_
and _11.11_.

(f) The Indemnitors and Indemnitees acknowledge and agree that all Damages
shall be recovered (i) first, from the Indemnity Escrow Fund and (ii) second,
if the aggregate of all unsatisfied claims in any Officers Claims
Certificates exceeds the then-existing Indemnity Escrow Fund, directly from
the Indemnitors in accordance with _Section 10.03(b)_.

Section 10.05 No Contribution. No Indemnitor shall have, or be entitled to
exercise or assert (or attempt to exercise or assert) any right of
contribution, right of indemnity or other right or remedy against the
Surviving Corporation in connection with any indemnification obligation or any
other liability to which he may become subject under or in connection with
this Agreement; _provided_ , that the foregoing is not meant to limit or
prevent the exercise of any rights of indemnification referred to in _Section
6.04_ and that has accrued to such Indemnitor in his or her capacity as a
director or officer of any Acquired Company.

 



80 Section 10.06 Defense of Third-Party Claims. Except as otherwise provided in
Article 7, in the event of the assertion of any claim or the commencement by
any Person of any Proceeding (whether against the Surviving Corporation,
against Parent or against any other Person) with respect to which any of the
Indemnitors may become obligated to hold harmless, indemnify, compensate or
reimburse any Indemnitee pursuant to this _Article 10_ (each, a " _Claim_ "),
Parent shall have the right, at its election, to proceed with the defense of
any such Claim on its own. If Parent so proceeds with the defense of any such
Claim:

(a) the Equityholder Representative and each Indemnitor shall make available
to Parent any documents and materials in its respective possession or control
that may be necessary to the defense of such Claim;

(b) Parent shall have the right to settle, adjust or compromise such
Proceeding without the consent of the Equityholder Representative; _provided_
, _however_ , that except with the consent of the Equityholder
Representative, no settlement of any such Proceeding shall be determinative of
either the fact that liability may be recovered by the applicable Indemnitee
in respect of such Proceeding pursuant to the indemnification provisions of
this  _Article 10_ or the amount of such liability that may be recovered by
the applicable Indemnitee in respect of such Third-Party Claim pursuant to the
indemnification provisions of this _Article 10_ ; and

 

(c) Parent shall (A) allow the Equityholder Representative to participate in
the defense of such claim (at the sole cost and expense of the Equityholders)
and (B) undertake the defense of and use all reasonable efforts to defend such
claim and shall consult with the Equityholder Representative regarding the
strategy for defense of such claim, including with respect to Parents choice
of legal counsel.

Parent shall give the Equityholder Representative prompt notice (and, in any
event, within three (3) Business Days thereof) of the commencement of any
such Claim (a " _Claim Notice_ ") against any Indemnitee; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any failure on the part of Parent to so notify the
Equityholder Representative shall not limit any of the obligations of the
Indemnitors under this _Article 10_ (except to the extent such failure
prejudices the defense of such Proceeding). The parties agree to cooperate
fully with each other in connection with the defense, negotiation or
settlement of any claim for indemnification pursuant to this _Article 10_. In
addition, in connection with such claim for indemnification, Parent and its
Affiliates shall provide the Equityholder Representative and its
Representatives the same access to information of the Company that the Parent
is afforded pursuant to _Section 5.04_ and reasonable access to legal counsel
to Parent with respect to any such claim for indemnification.

 

The Equityholder Representative shall have fifteen (15) days after receipt of
the Claim Notice to notify Parent that it desires to defend Parent against
such Claim; _provided_ , that the Equityholder Representative may only assume
the defense of a Claim if (a) it acknowledges to Parent in writing that there
exists an indemnification obligation relating to such Claim, (b) the amount
claimed in such Claim is less than or equal to the current balance of the
Indemnity Escrow Fund, (c) such Claim does not primarily seek as a remedy the
imposition of an equitable remedy that is binding upon Parent or any of its
Affiliates (including any of the Acquired Companies), (d) such Claim does not
relate to or arise in connection with any criminal Claim brought by a
Governmental Authority, (e) such Claim does not involve a Significant Customer
or 

 



81  a Significant Supplier, and (f) an adverse resolution of such third-party
claim would not reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect
on the business or operations Parent. If the Equityholder Representative
assumes the defense of Parent against such Claim in accordance with the
foregoing provisions, the Equityholder Representative shall have the right to
settle, adjust or compromise such Claim without the consent of Parent;
_provided_ , that the sole remedy in any such settlement, adjustment or
compromise must be an amount of cash (that, for the avoidance of doubt, does
not include any equitable remedy or injunctive relief) that is less than or
equal to the current balance of the Indemnity Escrow Fund and that is
accompanied by an irrevocable release of all related claims against the
Acquired Companies in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent.

 

Section 10.07 Exercise of Remedies by Indemnitees Other Than Parent. No
Indemnitee (other than Parent or any successor thereto or assign thereof)
shall be permitted to assert any indemnification claim or exercise any other
remedy under this Agreement unless Parent (or any successor thereto or assign
thereof) shall have consented to the assertion of such indemnification
claim or the exercise of such other remedy.

Section 10.08 Escrow Arrangements.

 

(a) _Indemnity Escrow Fund_. By virtue of this Agreement and as security for
the Indemnitees under _Section 10.02_, at the Effective Time, pursuant to
_Section 2.08(d)_, Parent shall deposit with the Escrow Agent the Indemnity
Escrow Fund to be governed by the terms set forth herein and in the Escrow
Agreement. The Indemnity Escrow Fund shall be available to pay the
Indemnitees for any claims by such parties for any Damages suffered or
incurred by them and for which they are determined to be entitled to recovery
under _Section 10.02_. The Escrow Agent may execute this Agreement following
the date hereof and prior to the Closing, and such later execution, if so
executed after the date hereof, shall not affect the binding nature of this
Agreement as of the date hereof between the other signatories hereto.

 

(b) _Initial Distribution of Indemnity Escrow Fund_. Within four (4) Business
Days following the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _First
Distribution Date_ "), an amount equal to one-half (1/2) of the Indemnity
Escrow Fund shall be distributed by the Escrow Agent to the Payment Agent or
Parent (or one of its Affiliates) for further distribution to
the Equityholders and the MBP Participants in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that all or any portion of the then-
existing Indemnity Escrow Fund that is reasonably necessary (based on the
facts, circumstances and merits existing at the time) to serve as security in
respect of any remaining unsatisfied claims under any Officers Claims
Certificate delivered in accordance with _Article 10_ of this Agreement prior
to the First Distribution Date shall remain in the Indemnity Escrow Fund at
and after the First Distribution Date until the disposition of such amounts is
finally determined in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

 

(c) _Final Distribution of Indemnity Escrow Fund_. Within four (4) Business
Days after the General Expiration Date, any then-remaining portion of the
Indemnity Escrow Fund shall be distributed by the Escrow Agent to the Payment
Agent or Parent (or one of its Affiliates) for further distribution to the
Equityholders and the MBP Participants in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that all or any portion of the then-
existing Indemnity

 



82  Escrow Fund that is reasonably necessary (based on the facts, circumstances
and merits existing at the time) to serve as security in respect of all
remaining unsatisfied claims under any Officers Claims Certificate delivered
in accordance with _Article 10_ of this Agreement prior to the General
Expiration Date shall remain in the Indemnity Escrow Fund at and after the
General Expiration Date until the disposition of such amounts is finally
determined in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

ARTICLE 11.

 

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 11.01 Equityholder Representative.

(a) By virtue of the adoption of this Agreement by the Company Stockholder
Approval, each of the Company Stockholders shall have irrevocably constituted
and appointed, upon the Effective Time, Shareholder Representative Services
LLC (and by his execution of this Agreement as Equityholder Representative,
Shareholder Representative Services LLC hereby accepts its appointment) as the
true, exclusive and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact (the " _Equityholder
Representative_ ") of the Equityholders to act in the name, place and stead
of the Equityholders in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement, and
to act on behalf of the Equityholders in any Proceeding involving
this Agreement, to do or refrain from doing all such further acts and things,
and to execute all such documents as the Equityholder Representative shall
deem necessary or appropriate in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the power, in each case, without having to seek
or obtain the consent of any Person under any circumstance:

(i) to act for the Equityholders with regard to matters pertaining to
indemnification referred to in this Agreement, including the power to
compromise any indemnity claim on behalf of the Equityholders and to transact
matters of litigation or other Proceedings;

(ii) to execute and deliver all amendments, waivers, ancillary agreements,
stock powers, certificates and documents that the Equityholder Representative
deems necessary or appropriate in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

(iii) to execute and deliver all amendments and waivers to this Agreement that
the Equityholder Representative deems necessary or appropriate, whether prior
to, at or after the Closing;

(iv) to receive funds for the payment of expenses of the Equityholders and
apply such funds in payment for such expenses;

(v) to do or refrain from doing any further act or deed on behalf of the
Equityholders that the Equityholder Representative deems necessary or
appropriate in its sole discretion relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement as fully and completely as the Equityholders could do if personally
present; and

 



83 (vi) to receive service of process in connection with any claims under
this Agreement.

(b) The Equityholder Representative may resign at any time, and may be removed
or replaced only upon delivery of written notice to the Surviving Corporation
by the Company Stockholders holding at least a majority of outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent,
the Surviving Corporation and any other Person may conclusively and
absolutely rely, without inquiry, upon any action of the Equityholder
Representative in all matters referred to herein. The Equityholder
Representative shall act for the Equityholders on all of the matters set forth
in this Agreement in the manner the Equityholder Representative believes to
be in the best interest of the Equityholders and consistent with the
obligations under this Agreement, but the Equityholder Representative shall
incur no liability of any kind with respect to any action or omission by it
and will not be responsible to the Equityholders for any Damages the
Equityholders may suffer in connection with its services pursuant to this
Agreement, other than any liability or Damage arising from gross negligence,
willful misconduct or bad faith in the performance of its duties under this
Agreement.

(c) The Equityholder Representative shall not be liable for, and shall be
indemnified, severally in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Shares and
not jointly, by the Equityholders for, and to the extent available shall be
entitled to draw against the Equityholder Representative Expense Fund at any
time and from time to time for, any and all loss, liability, Damage, claim,
penalty, fine, forfeiture, action, fee, cost and expense (including the fees
and expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense of
document location, duplication and shipment) (" _Representative Losses_ ")
arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its
duties under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, in each case as such
Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; _provided_ , that in the event
any such Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been primarily
caused by the gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith of the
Equityholder Representative, the Equityholder Representative will reimburse
the Equityholders the amount of such indemnified Representative Losses
attributable to such gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith. If not
paid directly to the Equityholder Representative by the Equityholders or
satisfied by the funds in the Equityholder Representative Expense Fund, any
such Representative Losses may be recovered by the Equityholder Representative
from the amounts in the Indemnity Escrow Fund otherwise distributable to the
Equityholders pursuant to the terms hereof and the Escrow Agreement at the
time of distribution in accordance with written instructions delivered by the
Equityholder Representative to the Escrow Agent; _provided_ , that while this
_Section 11.01(c)_ allows the Equityholder Representative to be paid from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund, this _Section 11.01(c)_ shall not relieve the
Equityholders from their obligation to promptly pay such
Representative Losses as such Representative Losses are suffered or incurred,
nor shall it prevent the Equityholder Representative from seeking any remedies
available to it at law or otherwise. The Equityholder Representative shall be
the administrator of the Equityholder Representative Expense Fund and shall
have authority to draw against the Equityholder Representative Expense Fund
(which shall be deposited with the Equityholder Representative at Closing) in
accordance with the preceding sentences of this _Section 11.01(c)_. The
Equityholders shall not receive interest or other earnings on amounts in the
Equityholder Representative Expense Fund and the Equityholders irrevocably
transfer and assign to the Equityholder Representative any ownership right
that they may have in any interest that may accrue on amounts in the
Equityholder Representative Expense Fund. The

 



84  Equityholder Representative will not be liable for any loss of principal of
the Equityholder Representative Expense Fund other than as a result of its
gross negligence or willful misconduct. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the later to occur of (x) the date on which all indemnification
claims of Indemnitees outstanding as of the Indemnity Expiration Date have
been discharged in full and (y) the date on which all unsatisfied claims
specified in any valid Officers Claims Certificate pursuant to this Agreement
have been resolved, the Equityholder Representative will deliver the balance
of the Equityholder Representative Expense Fund to the Payment Agent for
further distribution to the Equityholders in proportion to their respective
Pro Rata Escrow Shares. For tax purposes, the Equityholder Representative
Expense Fund will be treated as having been received and voluntarily set aside
by the Equityholders at the time of Closing.

Section 11.02 Guaranty.

 

(a) Parent Guarantor hereby absolutely and unconditionally guarantees the
timely performance and observance by Parent of all its obligations to be
performed or observed under this Agreement, including (a) all of Parents
payment obligations pursuant to this Agreement, which include payment of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration; and (b) any Damages arising from any breach
by Parent of its obligations under this Agreement (such obligations, the "
_Guaranteed Obligations_ ").

 

(b) This guarantee is a continuing and irrevocable guaranty by Parent
Guarantor of all Guaranteed Obligations now or hereafter existing and shall
remain in full force and effect until all Guaranteed Obligations are
indefeasibly performed in full and paid in cash. Parent Guarantor hereby
waives presentment, protest, notice, dishonor or default, demand for payment
and any other notices to which Parent Guarantor might otherwise be entitled.

(c) Parent Guarantor hereby agrees that Parent may, at any time and from time
to time, and without notice to the Parent Guarantor, make any agreement with
the Company or the Equityholder Representative for the extension, renewal,
payment, compromise, discharge or release of the Guaranteed Obligations,
or for any modification or amendment of the terms thereof, all without in any
way impairing, releasing, discharging or otherwise affecting the obligations
of Parent Guarantor. Parent Guarantor waives any defense arising by reason of
any disability or other defense of Parent (other than defense of payment or
performance), or the cessation from any cause whatsoever of the liability of
Parent, or any claim that Parent Guarantors obligations exceed or are more
burdensome than Parents and waives the benefit of any statute of limitations
affecting the liability of Parent Guarantor hereunder. The obligations of
Parent Guarantor hereunder are those of primary obligor, and not merely as
surety, and are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations.

Section 11.04 No Survival of Ultimate Parent, Parent Guarantor, Parent and
Merger Sub Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties
of Ultimate Parent, Parent Guarantor, Parent and Merger Sub contained herein
and in any certificate or other writing delivered at the Closing pursuant
hereto shall not survive the Effective Time.

Section 11.05 Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance. Subject to _Section
10.03(d)_, the rights and remedies of the parties hereto shall be cumulative
(and not alternative) and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by
Applicable Law. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur
if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the
terms hereof (including Parents or Merger Subs obligation to effect the
Closing), that money damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate
remedy for any such damages and that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled to at law or in
equity, in each case without the requirement of posting any bond or
other type of security. It is accordingly agreed that the right of specific
enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and without that right, none of the parties would have entered into
this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is
explicitly agreed that the Company shall be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance or other equitable remedy to specifically enforce
Parents or Merger Subs obligation to effect the Closing on the terms and
conditions set forth herein in the event that all conditions in _Section
8.01_ and _Section 8.02_ have been satisfied (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing,
each of which is then capable of being satisfied at a Closing on such date) at
the time when the Closing would have occurred but for the failure of Parent or
Merger Sub to comply with its obligations to effect the Closing pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and
Merger Sub, on the other hand hereby agree not to raise any objections to the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or
restrain breaches or anticipatory breaches of this Agreement by such party
(or parties), and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or anticipatory breaches, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such party (or parties)
under this Agreement.

 



87 Section 11.06 Amendments and Waivers.

 

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the
Effective Time if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is
signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in
the case of a waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be
effective.

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

Section 11.07 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, including all third-party
legal, accounting, financial advisory, consulting or other fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated
thereby, shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense.

Section 11.08 Disclosure Schedule References. The parties hereto agree that
any reference in a particular Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall
only be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for
purposes of) (i) the representations and warranties (or covenants, as
applicable) of the relevant party that are contained in the corresponding
Section of this Agreement and (ii) any other representations and warranties of
such party that is contained in this Agreement, but only if the relevance of
that reference as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such
representations and warranties would be reasonably apparent to an individual
who has read that reference and such representations and warranties.

 

Section 11.09 Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment.

(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.
Except with respect to (i) _Section 6.04_ and _Article 10_ , (ii) the
rights of the holders of Company Capital Stock under this Agreement and
Applicable Law to receive a portion of the Merger Consideration, and (iii)
prior to the Effective Time, the right of such holders of Company Capital
Stock to pursue derivatively solely through the Company and recover Damages
(including Damages based on loss of the economic benefits of the transaction
to the holders of Company Capital Stock based on the consideration that would
have otherwise been payable to holders of Company Capital Stock, the loss of
value or decline in stock price of such Company Capital Stock or otherwise)
and other relief (including equitable relief) for any breach of this
Agreement by Parent, no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any
rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any
Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns. 

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party
hereto, except that Parent or Merger Sub may transfer or assign its rights and
obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part, to
(i) one or more of their Affiliates at any time and (ii) after the Effective
Time, to any Person; _provided_ , that such transfer or assignment shall not
relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder or enlarge, alter or
change any obligation of any other party hereto or due to Parent or Merger
Sub.

 



88 Section 11.10 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect
to principles of conflicts of laws that would require the application of the
laws of any other jurisdiction.
