Sub&#146;s obligation to effect the Closing), that money damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages and that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled to at law or in equity, in each case without the requirement of posting any bond or other

limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the Company shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedy to specifically enforce Parent&#146;s or Merger Sub&#146;s obligation to effect the
Closing on the terms and conditions set forth herein in the event that all conditions in <U>Section&nbsp;8.01</U> and <U>Section&nbsp;8.02</U> have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken
at the Closing, each of which is then capable of being satisfied at a Closing on such date) at the time when the Closing would have occurred but for the failure of Parent or Merger Sub to comply with its obligations to effect the Closing pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand hereby agree not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or
anticipatory breaches of this Agreement by such party (or parties), and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or anticipatory breaches, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of
such party (or parties) under this Agreement. </FONT></P>
