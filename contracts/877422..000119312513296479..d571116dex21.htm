endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting
such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
transfer or establish, to the reasonable satisfaction of Spartan Stores, that
such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 3.3(b)_, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration, any cash in
lieu of fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 3.7_ and any dividends
or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 3.4_.

 

SECTION 3.4 _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends
or other distributions with respect to Spartan Stores Common Stock with a
record date on or after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any

Spartan Stores Common Stock that the holder thereof has the right to receive
upon the surrender thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares
of Spartan Stores Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to
_Section 3.7_, until the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall have surrendered such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance
with this _Article III_. Subject to escheat or other applicable Law, following
the surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share, there shall be paid to
the record holder of whole shares of Spartan Stores Common Stock issued in

amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Spartan Stores
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to  _Section 3.7_ and

Common Stock formerly represented thereby, subject to the obligations of
Spartan Stores to pay or cause to be paid any dividends or make any other
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have
been declared and not paid by Nash-Finch prior to the Effective Time. At 5:00
pm, New York City time, on the Closing Date, the share transfer books of Nash-
Finch shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the share transfer books of Nash-Finch of shares of Nash-Finch
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

fractional shares of Spartan Stores Common Stock shall be issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, no dividends or
other distributions of Spartan Stores shall be paid with respect to such
fractional share interests, and such fractional share interests will not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a holder of shares
of Spartan Stores Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Spartan
Stores Common Stock (determined after taking into account all Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof,
cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the product of (a) such
fractional part of a share of Spartan Stores Common Stock multiplied by (b)
the closing price for a share of Spartan Stores Common Stock as reported on
NASDAQ on the trading day immediately before the date on which the Effective
Time occurs. As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of
cash to be paid to such former holders of Nash-Finch Common Stock in lieu of
any fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall notify Spartan
Stores, and Spartan Stores shall ensure that there is deposited with the
Exchange Agent, and shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay, such amounts to
such former holders of Nash-Finch Common Stock in accordance with this
Agreement.

 

SECTION 3.8 _No Liability_. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
none of Spartan Stores, Nash-Finch, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent will be liable to any Nash-Finch Stockholder or any other
Person in respect of any cash properly delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any portion of
the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by Nash-Finch Stockholders as of a date
that is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat
to or become property of any Governmental Entity will, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of Spartan Stores free and clear of
any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

other distributions payable pursuant to  _Section 3.4_, require the owner of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to deliver a bond in such sum as
Spartan Stores or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Spartan Stores

treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Spartan Stores.

SECTION 3.11 _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest
any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Spartan Stores from time
to time _provided_ that no gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts
payable or the timing of the amounts payable to Nash-Finch Stockholders

Superior Proposal and (3) following the end of such notice period, the Nash-
Finch Board of Directors shall have considered in good faith any changes to
this Agreement proposed in writing by Spartan Stores, and shall have
determined that the Nash-Finch Superior Proposal would continue to constitute
a Nash-Finch Superior Proposal if such revisions were to be given effect. In
the event of any material revisions to a Nash-Finch Takeover Proposal that
could have an impact, influence or other effect on the Nash-Finch Board of
Directors decision or discussion with respect to whether such proposal is a

and-listen" communications to Nash-Finch Stockholders pursuant to Section
14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to
the Nash-Finch Stockholders), or (C) making any disclosure to the Nash-Finch
Stockholders if the Nash-Finch Board of Directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Nash-Finch Board
of Directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the taking of any action pursuant to any of the preceding clauses (A),
