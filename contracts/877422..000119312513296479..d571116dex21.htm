STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><U>Release of Directors from Personal Liability</U>: No director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty by
such director as a director; provided, however, that this Article VIII shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director to the extent provided by applicable law (i)&nbsp;for any breach of the director&#146;s duty of loyalty to the
Corporation or its stockholders, (ii)&nbsp;for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii)&nbsp;under Section&nbsp;174 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, or (iv)&nbsp;for
any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. If the Delaware General Corporation Law hereafter is amended to authorize the further elimination or limitation of the liability of directors, then the liability of a
director of the Corporation, in addition to the limitation on personal liability provided herein, shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by any such amendment. Any amendment to or repeal of this Article VIII shall not adversely affect any
limitation on the personal liability of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of such amendment or repeal. </FONT></P>
