ARTICLE 3 
  CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

 

 Section 3.01. _Conversion  of Shares in the First Merger._ At the Effective  Time, (a) except as otherwise provided in Section 3.01(b) and Section 3.03,  each share of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective  Time shall be converted into the right to receive (i) $15.15 in cash, without  interest (the "Cash Consideration")  and (ii) 0.48 shares of Parent Stock (the "Stock  Consideration"; and together with the  Cash Consideration and the cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent  Stock as specified in Section 3.07 below, the "Merger  Consideration"); 

 

 (b) each  share of Company Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by  Parent or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time  shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto; and 

 

 (c) each  share of common stock of Merger Sub I outstanding immediately prior to the  Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of common stock  of the Initial Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges  as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares  of capital stock of the Initial Surviving Corporation. 

 

 Section 3.02 _.  Conversion of Shares in the Second Merger._ At  the Second Effective Time, (i) each share of common stock of the Initial  Surviving Corporation outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective  Time shall be converted into and become one share of common stock of the  Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the  shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of  capital stock of the Surviving Corporation and (ii) each share of common  stock of Merger Sub II outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective  Time shall be cancelled.

 

 Section 3.03 _.  Dissenting Shares._ Notwithstanding Section  3.01, shares of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective  Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the First Merger  or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such  shares in accordance with the 

 

9   
  

DGCL shall not be converted into a right to receive  the Merger
Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws  or otherwise
loses such holders right to appraisal. If, after the Effective  Time, such
holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses its right to appraisal,  such
shares of Company Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted  as of
the Effective Time into a right to receive the Merger Consideration.  The
Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the 
Company for appraisal of shares of Company Stock, and Parent shall have the 
right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to 
such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, or to the 
extent required by applicable law, the Company shall not make any payment 
with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

 

 Section 3.04 _.  Certain Adjustments._ If, between the date  of this Agreement and the Effective Time, there is a reclassification,  recapitalization, stock split, split-up, stock dividend, combination or  exchange of shares with respect to, or rights issued in respect of, Parent  Stock or Company Stock, the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted accordingly  to provide to the holders of Company Stock the same economic effect as  contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. 

 

 Section 3.05 _.  Company Stock Options._ (a) At the Effective  Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Stock under  any employee stock option or compensation plan, employment, severance,  change in control agreement or other arrangement of the Company (a "Company  Stock Option") outstanding immediately  prior to the Effective Time, whether or not exercisable or vested, shall  be converted into an option to purchase Parent Stock (a "Parent  Stock Option") in accordance with this  Section 3.05. Each Parent Stock Option resulting from such conversion shall  continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions as set  forth in the applicable Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective  Time, except that, as of the Effective Time, (i) each Parent Stock Option  shall be exercisable (or shall become exercisable in accordance with its  terms) for that number of whole shares of Parent Stock equal to the product  of (A) the number of shares of Company Stock that were issuable upon exercise  of the related Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied  by (B) 0.8 (the "Option Exchange Ratio"),  rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Stock and  (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Stock issuable  upon exercise of such Parent Stock Option shall be equal to the quotient  determined by dividing (A) the exercise price per share of Company Stock  at which the related Company Stock Option was exercisable immediately prior  to the Effective Time by (B) the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded to the  nearest whole cent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the methodology  for conversion of Company Stock Options shall be adjusted if possible (and  only to the extent possible) to avoid the occurrence of a new measurement  date, under US GAAP, for the options, and otherwise to avoid any charge  to earnings in connection with such conversion (it being understood that  the total aggregate intrinsic value of the Company Stock Options may not  be 

 

10   
  

diminished in other than a _de  minimis_ amount), (ii) the conversion of
any  Company Stock Options which are "incentive stock options," within  the
meaning of Section 422 of the Code, into Parent Stock Options shall  be made
so as not to constitute a "modification" of such Company  Stock Options
within the meaning of Section 424 of the Code and (iii) with  regard to the
conversion of a Company Stock Option by or on behalf of a  holder thereof who
is Canadian, Parent will use commercially reasonable  efforts to cause the
conversion of such Company Stock Option to be made  in such manner as to not
result in Canadian tax. Each Parent Stock Option  issued pursuant to this
Section 3.05 also shall give effect to any other  applicable contractual
rights (including, without limitation, rights under  change-in-control or
other similar agreements) that the grantee of the  Parent Stock Option has in
respect of the Company Stock Option.

 

 (b) The  Companys board of directors shall take such actions in respect of the  Company Stock Options as may be required to give effect to the provisions  of Section 3.05(a). 

 

 (c) Parent  shall take such actions as may be required to ensure that the offers and  sales of the shares of Parent Common Stock underlying the Parent Stock Options  are registered under the Securities Act of 1933 under a Registration Statement  on Form S-8. Parent shall use reasonable commercial efforts to ensure that  any holder of a Parent Stock Option resulting from the conversion described  in Section 3.05(a) whose employment is involuntarily terminated by Parent  following the Effective Time shall have a reasonable opportunity, during  the period following the Effective Time and prior to the expiration of such  Parent Stock Option, to exercise such Parent Stock Option and immediately  thereafter sell the shares of Parent Stock acquired thereby. 

 

 Section 3.06 _.  Surrender and Payment._ (a) Prior to the Effective  Time, Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to the Company  (the "Exchange Agent")  for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i) certificates  representing shares of Company Stock (the "Certificates")  and (ii) uncertificated shares of Company Stock (the "Uncertificated  Shares"). Parent and the Exchange Agent  shall enter into an exchange agent agreement in form and substance reasonably  satisfactory to Parent and the Company. Parent shall make available to  the Exchange Agent, as needed, the Stock Consideration to be paid in respect  of the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares. Parent shall deposit  or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent cash in an amount equal  to the Cash Consideration to be paid in respect of the Certificates and  the Uncertificated Shares, which amount shall represent the maximum Cash  Consideration payable in connection with the First Merger assuming no holder  of Company Stock shall perfect its appraisal rights. Any cash deposited  with the Exchange Agent to pay the Cash Consideration shall be deposited  in a separate fund established for the benefit of the holders of Company  Stock and shall not be used for any purpose other than as set forth in  this Article 3. Such cash shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed  by Parent in: (A) direct obligations of, or obligations the principal of  and interest on which are unconditionally guaranteed by, the 

 

11   
  

United States of America with a remaining term  at the time of acquisition
thereof not in excess of 90 days, (B) money market  accounts or certificates
of deposit maturing within 90 days of the acquisition  thereof and issued by
a bank or trust company organized under the laws of  the United States of
America or a State thereof having a combined capital  surplus in excess of
$500,000,000 (a "United States  Bank"), (C) commercial paper issued by a
domestic corporation and  given a rating of no lower than A1 by Standard and
Poors Corporation  and P1 by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. with a
remaining term at the  time of acquisition thereof not in excess of 90 days
or (D) demand deposits  with any United States Bank. Promptly after the
Effective Time, Parent shall  send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to
send, to each holder of shares  of Company Stock at the Effective Time a
letter of transmittal and instructions  in form reasonably satisfactory to
Parent and the Company (which shall specify  that the delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass,  only upon proper delivery
of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated  Shares to the Exchange
Agent) for use in such exchange; _provided_ ,  that any such letter of
transmittal and instructions shall be sent to holders  of Uncertificated
Shares only to the extent determined necessary by Parent,  the Company and
the Exchange Agent to effect the transactions contemplated  hereby.

 

 (b) Each  holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into the right  to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon (i)  surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly  completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents  message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer  as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry  transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of  the Company Stock represented by such Certificate or such Uncertificated  Share. The shares of Parent Stock constituting part of such Merger Consideration,  at Parents option, shall be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless  a physical certificate is requested by a holder of shares of Company Stock  or is otherwise required under applicable law. Until so surrendered or transferred,  as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent  after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such  Merger Consideration. 

 

 (c) If  any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than  the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated  Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either  such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper  form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred  and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent  any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person  other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share  or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such taxes have  been paid or are not payable. 

 

12   
  

 (d) After  the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of  shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated  Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled  and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance  with the procedures set forth, in this Article 3.

 

 (e) Any  portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent  pursuant to Section 3.06(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares  of Company Stock six months after the Effective Time shall be returned to  Parent upon demand by Parent (together with any interest or other income  thereon), and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Stock  for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 3.06 prior to  that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger  Consideration, and any dividends and distributions with respect thereto,  in respect of such shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the  foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company  Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned  property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders  of shares of Company Stock two years after the Effective Time (or such earlier  date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat  to or become property of any Governmental Entity) shall become, to the extent  permitted by applicable law, the property of Parent free and clear of any  claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

 

 (f) No  dividends or other distributions with respect to securities of Parent constituting  part of the Merger Consideration, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional  shares as provided in Section 3.07, shall be paid to the holder of any Certificates  not surrendered or of any Uncertificated Shares not transferred until such  Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are surrendered or transferred, as  the case may be, as provided in this Section 3.06. Following such surrender  or transfer, there shall be paid, without interest, to the Person in whose  name the securities of Parent have been registered, (i) at the time of such  surrender or transfer, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional  shares to which such Person is entitled pursuant to Section 3.07 and the  amount of all dividends or other distributions with a record date after the  Effective Time previously paid or payable on the date of such surrender with  respect to such securities, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the  amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective  Time and prior to the surrender or transfer and with a payment date subsequent  to the surrender or transfer payable with respect to such securities. 

 

 (g) Any  portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent  pursuant to Section 3.06(a) or Section 3.07 to pay for shares of Company  Stock for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to  Parent, upon demand by Parent. 

 

13   
  

 Section 3.07 _.  No Fractional Shares of Parent Stock_. No  fractional shares of Parent Stock shall be issued in the First Merger.  All fractional shares of Parent Stock that a holder of shares of Company  Stock would otherwise be entitled to receive as a result of the First Merger  shall be aggregated, and if a fractional share results from such aggregation,  such holder shall be entitled to receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in  cash, without interest, determined by multiplying the closing sale price  of a share of Parent Stock on the NYSE on the trading day immediately following  the date on which the Effective Time occurs by the fraction of a share  of Parent Stock to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled.  As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash to  be paid to such former holders of Company Stock in lieu of any fractional  interests, the Exchange Agent shall notify Parent, and Parent shall ensure  that there is deposited with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange  Agent to make available in accordance with this Agreement such amounts  to such former holders of Company Stock. 

 

 Section 3.08 _.  Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall  have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of  that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or  destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond,  in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any  claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the  Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed  Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares  of Company Stock represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this  Article 3. 

 

 Section 3.09 _.  Withholding Rights._ Parent shall be entitled  to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant  to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold  with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision  of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld  or paid over to or deposited with the relevant Governmental Entity by or  on behalf of Parent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes  of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which  such deduction and withholding was made by or on behalf of Parent. 

 

 Section 3.10 _.  Further Assurances._ At and after the Effective  Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be  authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company,  Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II, the Initial Surviving Corporation or the Surviving  Corporation, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to  take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company, Merger Sub I, Merger  Sub II, the Initial Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Corporation,  any other actions and things necessary to vest, perfect or confirm of record  or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and  interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired  or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection  with, the Mergers.

Parent or the Company, or any of their  respective Affiliates, officers or
directors, is discovered by Parent or  the Company that should be set forth
in an amendment or supplement to any  of the Registration Statement or the

waiver or release under any standstill or similar  agreement with respect to

Subsidiaries or (iv) enter into any agreement with respect  to an Acquisition
Proposal.

 

 (b) Notwithstanding  the foregoing, the Board of Directors of an Applicable Party, directly or  indirectly through advisors, agents or other intermediaries, may (i) engage  in negotiations or discussions with any Third Party that, subject to such  Applicable Partys compliance with Section 8.03(a), submits a bona fide  Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Applicable Party  determines in good faith after consultation with its legal counsel and financial  advisor reasonably could be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal (a "Potential  Superior Proposal"), (ii) furnish to such Third Party nonpublic information  relating to such Applicable Party or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to  a confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to such Applicable  Party than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement dated as of June  3, 2004 between the Company and Parent (the "Confidentiality Agreement")  (a copy of which shall be provided for informational purposes only to the  other party) ( _provided_ that such confidentiality agreement with such  Third Party shall not be required to include any standstill or similar provision),  (iii) following receipt of such Potential Superior Proposal, (A) make a Change  in Recommendation or (B) terminate this Agreement pursuant to and subject  to the terms and conditions of Section 10.01(c) or Section 10.01(d), as applicable,  and/or (iv) take any action that any court of competent jurisdiction orders  such Applicable Party to take, but in each case referred to in the foregoing  clauses (i) through (iii) only if the Board of Directors of such Applicable  Party determines in good faith by a majority vote, after consultation with  its outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent  with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. Nothing contained herein  shall prevent the Board of Directors of the Company or Parent from complying  with Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 under the 1934 Act with regard to an Acquisition  Proposal; _provided_ that neither such Board of Directors shall recommend  that their stockholders tender shares of capital stock in connection with  any tender or exchange offer unless such Board of Directors shall have determined  in accordance with the terms of this Agreement that such tender or exchange  offer is a Superior Proposal. 

 

 (c) The  Board of Directors of an Applicable Party shall not take any of the actions  referred to in clauses (i) through (iv) of the preceding subsection unless  such Applicable Party shall have delivered to the other party a prior written  notice advising such other party that it intends to take such action, and  such Applicable Party shall continue to advise the other party after taking  such action. In addition, such Applicable Party shall notify the other party  promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt by the Applicable  Party (or any of its advisors) of any Acquisition Proposal, any indication  that a Third Party is considering making an Acquisition Proposal or any request  for information

reasonable best  efforts to cause any such Third Party (or its agents or
advisors) in possession  of confidential information about the Applicable
Party that was furnished  by or on behalf of the Applicable Party to return
or destroy all such information.

"Parent Average Price" in  respect of a given Measurement Period means the quotient of (x) the sum of  the closing sale prices per share of 

 

58   
  

Parent Stock as reported on the NYSE for each  day within the Measurement
Period divided by (y) 20. For the purposes hereof, "closing  sale price"
means, with respect of any  security, the closing sale price of such security
(x) as quoted on the Nasdaq  or (y) as reported on the NYSE, as the case may
be. In addition, "trading  day" means each day that both (x) the NYSE is open
for business  and (y) trades may be made on Nasdaq. Computations pursuant to
this Section  10.01(i) shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock
dividends,  subdivisions, splits, combinations, extraordinary dividends or
other similar  events relating to Parent Stock or to a security listed on
Schedule 10.01(i),  as applicable.

termination to the other party.

The provisions of this Section 10.02 and  Sections 11.04, 11.06, 11.07 and 11.08, and of the Confidentiality Agreement,  shall survive any termination hereof pursuant to Section 10.01.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 

 Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.,  a Delaware corporation ("Parent"),  Inveresk Research Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Indigo"),  Indigo Merger I Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary  of Parent ("Merger Sub I") and Indigo Merger II Corp.,  a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger  Sub II"), have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated  as of June 30, 2004 (the "Merger Agreement") pursuant  to which (i) Merger Sub I will be merged with and into Indigo (the "Merger"),  with Indigo to be the surviving corporation (the "Initial Surviving  Corporation") and (ii) the Initial Surviving Corporation will  then be merged with and into Merger Sub II, with Merger Sub II to be the  surviving corporation. As a result of the Merger, the undersigned will  receive shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent (the "Parent  Stock") in exchange for shares of common stock, par value $0.01  per share, of Indigo. Capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein  shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Merger Agreement. 

 

 The undersigned  has been advised that as of the date the Mergers are submitted to stockholders  of Indigo for approval, the undersigned may be an "affiliate" of  Indigo, as the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs  (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the Rules and Regulations (the "Rules  and Regulations") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission")  under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"). 

 

 The undersigned  represents, warrants and covenants to Parent that in the event the undersigned  receives any Parent Stock as a result of the Merger: 

 

 A. At the  time the Merger is submitted to stockholders of Indigo for approval, (a)  the undersigned may be deemed to have been an affiliate of Indigo and (b)  since the distribution by the undersigned of the Parent Stock has not been  registered under the Act, the undersigned may not sell, transfer or otherwise  dispose of Parent Stock issued to the undersigned in the Merger unless  (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered under  the Act, (ii) such sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity  with the provisions of Rule 

 

A - 1   
  

145 promulgated by the Commission under the Act  (as such rule may
hereinafter from time to time be amended), or (iii) in  the opinion of
counsel reasonably acceptable to Parent, or in accordance  with a "no action"
letter obtained by the undersigned from the  staff of the Commission, such
sale, transfer or other disposition will not  violate or is otherwise exempt
from registration under the Act.

 

 B. The undersigned  understands that Parent is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer  or other disposition of the Parent Stock by the undersigned or on the undersigneds  behalf under the Act. 

 

 C. The undersigned  also understands that stop transfer instructions will be given to Parents  transfer agents with respect to the Parent Stock issued to the undersigned  and that there will be placed on the certificates for the Parent Stock  issued to the undersigned, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating  in substance: 

 

>  
>
> "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE  WERE ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION
> TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES  ACT OF 1933 APPLIES.
> THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY ONLY  BE TRANSFERRED IN
> ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF AN AGREEMENT DATED , 2004  BETWEEN THE
> REGISTERED HOLDER HEREOF AND CHARLES RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, 
> INC., A COPY OF WHICH AGREEMENT IS ON FILE AT THE PRINCIPAL OFFICES OF
> CHARLES  RIVER LABORATORIES INTERNATIONAL, INC."
>
>  

 

 D. The undersigned  also understands that unless the transfer by the undersigned of the undersigneds  Parent Stock has been registered under the Act or is a sale made in conformity  with the provisions of Rule 145 under the Act, Parent reserves the right  to put the following legend on the certificates issued to any transferee  of such Parent Stock from the undersigned: 

 

>  
>
> "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE  HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
> THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND WERE ACQUIRED  FROM A PERSON WHO RECEIVED
> SUCH SHARES IN A TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145  PROMULGATED UNDER THE
> SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 APPLIES. THE SHARES HAVE BEEN  ACQUIRED BY THE
> HOLDER NOT WITH A VIEW TO, OR FOR RESALE IN CONNECTION WITH,  ANY
> DISTRIBUTION THEREOF WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933  AND
> MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT IN
> ACCORDANCE WITH AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT  OR AN EXEMPTION FROM
> THE REGISTRATION  REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933."
>
>  

 

A - 2   
  

 E. Parent  agrees that the stop transfer instructions and legends referred to above  shall be terminated or removed if (A) one year shall have elapsed from  the date of the effective time of the Merger and the provisions of Rule  145(d)(2) under the Act are then available to the undersigned, (B) two  years shall have elapsed from the date of the effective time of the Merger  and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(3) under the Act are then available to  the undersigned or (C) the undersigned shall have delivered to Parent a  copy of a letter from the staff of the SEC or an opinion of counsel with  recognized expertise in securities law matters, in form and substance reasonably  satisfactory to Parent, to the effect that such instructions and legends  are not required for the purposes of the Act. 

 

 F. The undersigned  has carefully read this letter and the Agreement and discussed its requirements  and other applicable limitations upon the undersigneds ability to  sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Parent Stock, to the extent the  undersigned felt necessary, with counsel of the undersigned or counsel  for Indigo, as applicable. 

 

 By its acceptance  hereof, Parent agrees, for a period of two years after the Effective Time  (as defined in the Agreement), that it will file on a timely basis all  reports required to be filed by it pursuant to Section 13 of the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, so that the public information provisions  of Rule 144(c) under the Act are satisfied and the resale provisions of  Rules 145(d)(1) and (2) under the Act are therefore available to the undersigned  in the event the undersigned desires to transfer any Parent Stock issued  to the undersigned in the Merger.
