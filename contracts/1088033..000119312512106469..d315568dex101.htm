Exhibit 10.1

EXECUTION VERSION

LIMITED GUARANTY 

Limited Guaranty, dated as of March 8, 2012 (this " _Limited Guaranty_ "), by
Insight Venture Partners VII, L.P., a Cayman Islands limited partnership,
Insight Venture Partners (Cayman) VII, L.P., a Cayman Islands limited
partnership, Insight Venture Partners VII (Co-Investors), L.P., a Cayman
Islands limited partnership, Insight Venture Partners (Delaware) VII, L.P., a
Delaware limited partnership and Insight Venture Partners Coinvestment Fund
II, L.P. (collectively, the " _Insight Guarantors_ ") and Vincent C. Smith,
Vincent C. Smith Annuity Trust 2010-1, Vincent C. Smith Annuity Trust 2010-2
and Vincent C. Smith Annuity Trust 2011-1 (collectively, the " _VS Party
Guarantors_ ", and together with the Insight Guarantors, the " _Guarantors_ "
and each a " _Guarantor_ ") in favor of Quest Software, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Guaranteed Party_ ").

1\. _Guaranty_. To induce the Guaranteed Party to enter into an Agreement and
Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (as amended, amended and restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the " _Merger Agreement_
"; capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings
given to such terms in the Merger Agreement) among Expedition Holding Company,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), Expedition Merger Sub, Inc., a
Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_
"), and the Guaranteed Party, pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and
into the Guaranteed Party (the " _Merger_ "), each Guarantor, intending to be
legally bound, hereby absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally, severally
but not jointly, guarantees to the Guaranteed Party up to such Guarantors
respective percentage as set forth opposite its name in _Annex 1_ (for each
such Guarantor, its " _Guaranteed Percentage_ ") the due and punctual
performance and discharge of the obligation of Parent to pay to the Guaranteed
Party the Parent Termination Fee and/or the Damages Remedy (following, with
respect to the Damages Remedy, a final, non-appealable order or settlement),
as the case may be, and/or any amounts under Section 5.5(b) and Section 7.3(d)
of the Merger Agreement, if, as and when such obligations become payable under
the Merger Agreement (the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ "). In no event shall a
Guarantors liability in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations exceed such
Guarantors Guaranteed Percentage of the Guaranteed Obligations (such
limitation on the liability each Guarantor may have for its Guaranteed
Percentage of the Guaranteed Obligations being herein referred to as such
Guarantors " _Cap_ "), it being understood that this Limited Guaranty may not
be enforced against any Guarantor without giving effect to such Guarantors
Cap (and to the provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof). This Limited Guaranty
may be enforced for the payment of money only. All payments hereunder shall be
made in lawful money of the United States, in immediately available funds.
Each Guarantor promises and undertakes to make all payments hereunder free and
clear of any deduction, offset, defense, claim or counterclaim of any kind,
except as expressly provided in this Limited Guaranty. Each Guarantor
acknowledges that the Guaranteed Party entered into the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement in reliance upon the execution of this
Limited Guaranty.

If Parent fails to discharge its Guaranteed Obligations when due, then each
Guarantors liabilities to the Guaranteed Party hereunder in respect of such
Guaranteed Obligations shall, upon the Guaranteed Partys demand, become
immediately due and payable (up to each Guarantors Cap), and the Guaranteed
Party may at any time and from time to time, at the Guaranteed Partys option,
and so long as Parent has failed to discharge any of its Guaranteed
Obligations, take any and all actions available hereunder to collect any
Guarantors liabilities hereunder in respect of such Guaranteed Obligations,
subject to such Guarantors Cap. 2\. _Nature of Guaranty_. Each Guarantors liability hereunder is
absolute, unconditional, irrevocable and continuing irrespective of any
modification, amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from the
Merger Agreement or Financing Letters that may be agreed to by Parent or
Merger Sub. Without limiting the foregoing, the Guaranteed Party shall not be
obligated to file any claim relating to the Guaranteed Obligations in the
event that Parent or Merger Sub becomes subject to a bankruptcy,
reorganization or similar proceeding, and the failure of the Guaranteed Party
to so file shall not affect the Guarantors respective obligations hereunder.
In the event that any payment hereunder is rescinded or must otherwise be, and
is, returned to a Guarantor for any reason whatsoever, each Guarantor shall
remain liable hereunder as if such payment had not been made. This Limited
Guaranty is a guarantee of payment and not of collection. Guarantor
acknowledges that the Guaranteed Party may bring and prosecute a separate
action or actions against such Guarantor for the full amount of such
Guarantors Guaranteed Percentage of the Guaranteed Obligations (subject to
such Guarantors Cap), regardless of whether any such action is brought
against Parent, Merger Sub or any other Guarantor or whether Parent, Merger
Sub or any other Guarantor is joined in any such action or actions.

3\. _Certain Waivers_. Each Guarantor agrees that the obligations of such
Guarantor hereunder shall not be released or discharged, in whole or in part,
or otherwise affected by: (a) the failure or delay on the part of the
Guaranteed Party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or
remedy against Parent or Merger Sub or any other Guarantor; (b) any change in
the time, place or manner of payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or
any waiver, compromise, consolidation or other amendment or modification of
any of the terms or provisions of the Merger Agreement or Financing Letters
made in accordance with the terms thereof or any agreement evidencing,
securing or otherwise executed in connection with any of the Guaranteed
Obligations; (c) the addition, substitution or release of any entity or other
Person now or hereafter liable with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or
otherwise interested in the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement (including any other Guarantor); (d) any change in the corporate
existence, structure or ownership of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person
now or hereafter liable with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or
otherwise interested in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement
(including any other Guarantor); (e) any insolvency, bankruptcy,
reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting Parent, Merger Sub or any
other Person now or hereafter liable with respect to the Guaranteed
Obligations or otherwise interested in the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement (including any other Guarantors); (f) the adequacy of any
means the Guaranteed Party may have of obtaining payment related to
the Guaranteed Obligations; (g) the value, genuineness, validity, regularity,
illegality or enforceability of the Financing Letters, in each case in
accordance with the terms and provisions thereof; or (h) any discharge of a
Guarantor as a matter of applicable Law or equity (other than a discharge of
a Guarantor with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations as a result of
indefeasible payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations in accordance with
their terms or as a result of defenses to the payment of the Guaranteed
Obligations that would be available to Parent under the Merger Agreement). To
the fullest extent permitted by Law, the Guarantors hereby expressly waive any
and all rights or defenses arising by reason of any Law which would otherwise
require any election of remedies by the Guaranteed Party. Each

 



2  Guarantor waives promptness, diligence, notice of the acceptance of this
Limited Guaranty and of the Guaranteed Obligations, presentment, demand for
payment, notice of non-performance, default, dishonor and protest, notice of
any Guaranteed Obligations incurred and all other notices of any kind (other
than notices required to be made to Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to the
Merger Agreement), all defenses which may be available by virtue of any
valuation, stay, moratorium Law or other similar Law now or hereafter in
effect or any right to require the marshalling of assets of Parent or Merger
Sub or any other Person now or hereafter liable with respect to the Guaranteed
Obligations or otherwise interested in the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement (including any other Guarantor). Each Guarantor acknowledges
that it will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and that the waivers set
forth in this Limited Guaranty are knowingly made in contemplation of such
benefits.

Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally waives any rights that it may now have
or hereafter acquire against Parent or Merger Sub that arise from the
existence, payment, performance, or enforcement of such Guarantors
obligations under or in respect of this Limited Guaranty, including, without
limitation, any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution
or indemnification and any right to participate in any claim or remedy of the
Guaranteed Party against Parent or Merger Sub, whether or not such claim,
remedy or right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common Law,
including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from Parent or
Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off
or in any other manner, payment or security on account of such claim, remedy
or right, and no Guarantor shall exercise any such rights unless and until all
amounts payable by such Guarantor under this Limited Guaranty (which shall be
subject to such Guarantors Cap) shall have been indefeasibly paid in full in
immediately available funds. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor in
violation of the immediately preceding sentence at any time prior to the
payment in full in immediately available funds of all amounts payable by such
Guarantor under this Limited Guaranty (which shall be subject to such
Guarantors Cap), such amount shall be received and held in trust for the
benefit of the Guaranteed Party, shall be segregated from other property and
funds of such Guarantor and shall forthwith be promptly paid or delivered to
the Guaranteed Party in the same form as so received (with any necessary
endorsement or assignment) to be credited and applied to all amounts payable
by such Guarantor under this Limited Guaranty. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Limited Guaranty or otherwise, the Guaranteed Party
hereby agrees that each Guarantor shall have all defenses to the payment
of its obligations under this Limited Guaranty (which in any event shall be
subject to such Guarantors Cap) that would be available to Parent and/or
Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement with respect to the Guaranteed
Obligations, as well as any defenses in respect of any fraud or willful
misconduct of the Guaranteed Party.

4\. _Representations and Warranties_. 

(a) Each Guarantor hereby represents and warrants, severally but not jointly,
that:

 

(i) with respect to each Guarantor which is not a natural person, such
Guarantor has all requisite limited partnership, trust authorization or other

the execution,

 



3  delivery and performance of this Limited Guaranty have been duly authorized

assets;

Guaranty constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Guaranteed
Party enforceable against the Guaranteed Party in accordance with its terms,

reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors rights
generally, and (B) general equitable principles (whether considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law).

5\. _No Assignment_. None of the Guarantors or the Guaranteed Party may assign
or delegate its rights, interests or obligations hereunder to any other Person
(except by operation of Law) without the prior written consent of the
Guaranteed Party (in the case of an assignment or delegation by one or more
Guarantors) or the Guarantors (in the case of an assignment or delegation by
the Guaranteed Party); _provided_ , _however_ , that each Guarantor may
assign or delegate all or part of its rights, interests and obligations
hereunder, without the prior written consent of the Guaranteed Party, to any
other Guarantor, or other Person to which it has allocated 

 



4  all or a portion of its investment commitment to Parent pursuant to the
Equity Funding Letter; _provided_ , _further_ , that no such assignment or
delegation shall relieve such Guarantor of its obligations hereunder.

7.  _Continuing Guaranty_. This Limited Guaranty may not be revoked or
terminated and shall remain in full force and effect until all of the
Guaranteed Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, or anything express or implied in this

 



5  Limited Guaranty or otherwise, this Limited Guaranty shall terminate and the
Guarantors shall have no further obligations under or in connection with this
Limited Guaranty as of the earliest of: (i) the Effective Time, if the
Closing occurs; (ii) termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with
its terms by mutual consent of the parties thereto or in circumstances where
the Parent Termination Fee is not payable, the Damages Remedy is not
available and there are no unpaid expense reimbursement or indemnification
obligations pursuant to Section 5.5(b) of the Merger Agreement; (iii) the
receipt by the Guaranteed Party of the payment in full of all of
the Guaranteed Obligations payable under this Limited Guaranty; and (iv) the
termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i) thereof
(unless the Guaranteed Party shall have previously commenced litigation
against the Guarantors under this Limited Guaranty, in which case this
Limited Guaranty shall terminate upon the final, non-appealable resolution of
such action and satisfaction by the Guarantors of any obligations finally
determined or agreed to be owed by the Guarantors, consistent with the terms
hereof). Upon such termination of this Limited Guaranty, no Guarantor shall
have any further liability hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, or
anything express or implied in this Limited Guaranty or otherwise, in the
event that the Guaranteed Party or any of its Affiliates asserts in any
litigation or other proceeding that the provisions of Section 1 hereof
limiting each Guarantors liability to its respective Cap or the provisions
of this Section 7 or Section 8 hereof are illegal, invalid or unenforceable
in whole or in part, asserts that any Guarantor is liable in respect of
Guaranteed Obligations in excess of or to a greater extent than its Cap, or
asserts any theory of liability against any Non-Recourse Party (as defined in
Section 8 hereof) with respect to this Limited Guaranty, the Equity Funding
Letters, the Rollover Letter, the Merger Agreement, any other agreement or
instrument delivered in connection with this Limited Guaranty or the Merger
Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, other than
Retained Claims (as defined in Section 8 hereof) asserted by the Guaranteed
Party against the Non-Recourse Party(ies) against which such Retained Claims
may be asserted pursuant to Section 8, then: (i) the obligations of the
Guarantors under or in connection with this Limited Guaranty shall terminate
ab initio and be null and void; (ii) if any Guarantor has previously made any
payments under or in connection with this Limited Guaranty, it shall be
entitled to recover and retain such payments; and (iii) neither the Guarantors
nor any other Non-Recourse Parties shall have any liability
whatsoever (whether at law or in equity, whether sounding in contract, tort,
statute or otherwise) to the Guaranteed Party or any other Person in any way
under or in connection with this Limited Guaranty, the Merger Agreement, any
other agreement or instrument delivered in connection with this Limited
Guaranty or the Merger Agreement (including, without limitation, the Equity
Funding Letters and the Rollover Letter), or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby.

 

8\. _No Recourse_. The Guaranteed Party acknowledges and agrees that the sole
asset of Parent and Merger Sub (other than contract rights) is cash in a _de
minimis_ amount (less than $1,000) and that no additional funds are expected
to be contributed to Parent or Merger Sub unless and until the Closing occurs
under the Merger Agreement. By its acceptance of the benefits of this Limited
Guaranty, the Guaranteed Party acknowledges and agrees that: (a) no Person
other than the Guarantors (and the legal successors and assigns of their
obligations hereunder) shall have any obligations under or in connection with
this Limited Guaranty notwithstanding the fact that the Guarantors may be
partnerships, (b) the Guarantors shall have no obligations under or in
connection with this Limited Guaranty except as expressly provided by this
Limited Guaranty, and (c) no personal liability shall attach to, and no
recourse shall be had by the Guaranteed Party, any of its Affiliates or any
Person purporting to claim by or

 



6  through any of them or for the benefit of any of them under any theory of
liability (including without limitation by attempting to pierce a corporate,
limited liability company or partnership veil, by attempting to compel Parent
or Merger Sub to enforce any rights that they may have against any Person, by
attempting to enforce any assessment, or by attempting to enforce any
purported right at law or in equity, whether sounding in contract, tort,
statute or otherwise) against, any Non-Recourse Party (as hereinafter defined)
in any way under or in connection with this Limited Guaranty, the Merger
Agreement, any other agreement or instrument delivered in connection with
this Limited Guaranty or the Merger Agreement (including, without limitation,
the Equity Funding Letters and the Rollover Letter), or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby (whether at law or in equity, whether sounding
in contract, tort, statute or otherwise), except that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Guaranteed Party may assert claims: (i) against certain Non-
Recourse Parties related to the Guarantors (including Insight Venture
Management, LLC) under, and pursuant to the terms of, the Confidentiality
Agreement; (ii) against the Guarantors (and their successors by operation of
law and any assignees of their obligations hereunder) under, and pursuant to
the terms of, this Limited Guaranty (subject in each case to each such
Guarantors Cap); (iii) against Parent, to cause Parent to seek specific
performance of a Guarantors obligation under the Equity Funding Letter to
fund its commitment thereunder in accordance with and pursuant to Section 4
thereof; (iv) against a Guarantor for specific performance of such Guarantors
obligation under the Equity Funding Letter to fund its commitment thereunder
in accordance with and pursuant to Section 4 thereof; (v) against any
Rollover Investor for specific performance of such Rollover Investors
obligations under the Rollover Letter; (vi) against any Rollover Investor
under, and pursuant to the terms of, the Voting Agreement between
the Rollover Investors and the Company; and (vii) against Parent or Merger
Sub in accordance with and pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement (the
claims described in clauses (i) through (vii) collectively, the "
_Retained Claims_ "). As used herein, the term " _Non-Recourse Parties_ "
shall mean, collectively, Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantors, the Equity
Providers (as defined in the Rollover Letter), the Financing Sources and any
of their respective former, current or future equity holders, controlling
persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, general or limited partners,
managers, management companies, members, stockholders, Affiliates or assignees
and any and all former, current or future equity holders, controlling
persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, general or limited partners,
managers, management companies, members, stockholders, Affiliates or assignees
of any of the foregoing, and any and all former, current or future estates,
heirs, executors, administrators, trustees, successors or assigns of any of
the foregoing, and the providers of debt financing for the Transactions. The
Guaranteed Party hereby covenants and agrees that it shall not, and it shall
cause its Affiliates not to, institute any proceeding or bring any claim in
any way under or in connection with this Limited Guaranty, the Merger
Agreement, any other agreement or instrument delivered in connection with
this Limited Guaranty or the Merger Agreement (including, without limitation,
the Equity Funding Letters and the Rollover Letter), or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby (whether at law or in equity, whether sounding
in contract, tort, statute or otherwise), against the Guarantors or any other
Non-Recourse Parties, except for Retained Claims asserted by the Guaranteed
Party against the Non-Recourse Party(ies) against which such Retained Claims
may be asserted pursuant to and in accordance with this Section 8\. Other
than the Guaranteed Party, the Guarantors and the other Non-Recourse Parties,
no Person shall have any rights or remedies under or in connection with this
Limited Guaranty or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



7 9\. _GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION_. THIS LIMITED GUARANTY, THE RIGHTS OF THE
PARTIES UNDER OR IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY, AND ALL ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO ANY OF THE

WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF
CONFLICTS OF LAW. Each party hereto agrees that it shall bring, maintain and
defend any such action or proceeding exclusively in the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware, or if but only if such Court does not have subject
matter jurisdiction, the state or federal courts of the State of Delaware (as
just described, the " _Chosen Courts_ "), and solely in connection with such
actions or proceedings: (i) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction
of the Chosen Courts; (ii) waives any objection to laying venue in any such
action or proceeding in the Chosen Courts; (iii) waives any objection that the
Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any
party hereto; (iv) waives any objection that the venue of the action, suit or
proceeding is improper or that this Limited Guaranty may not be enforced in or
by the Chosen Courts; and (v) agrees that service of process upon such party
in any such action or proceeding shall be effective if effected pursuant to
the Laws of the State of Delaware or in accordance with Section 6 of this
Limited Guaranty (other than by facsimile transmission).

 

10\. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
ACTION OR PROCEEDING CONTEMPLATED BY SECTION 9 HEREOF IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE

IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER; (ii) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THIS WAIVER; (iii) IT MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (iv) IT HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS LIMITED GUARANTY BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.

been executed and delivered by all parties hereto. This Limited Guaranty may
be executed by facsimile or electronic transmission in pdf format, and in one
or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 

12\. _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Limited Guaranty shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, and nothing express or implied in this
Limited Guaranty is intended to, or shall, confer upon any other Person any
benefits, rights or remedies under or by reason of, or any rights to enforce
or cause the Guaranteed Party to enforce, the obligations set forth herein;
except that as a material aspect of this Limited Guaranty the parties intend
that all Non-Recourse Parties other than the Guarantors shall be, and such
Non-Recourse Parties are, intended third party beneficiaries of this Limited
Guaranty who may rely on and enforce the provisions of this Limited Guaranty
that bar the liability, or otherwise protect the interests, of such Non-
Recourse Parties.

 



8 13\. _Confidentiality_. This Limited Guaranty shall be treated as confidential
and is being provided to the Guaranteed Party solely in connection with the
Merger. This Limited Guaranty may not be used, circulated, quoted or otherwise
referred to in any document, except with the written consent of each of the
Guarantors; provided that no such written consent is required for any
disclosure of the existence or content of this Limited Guaranty by the
Guaranteed Party: (i) to its Affiliates and its representatives; (ii) to the
extent that the information is already publicly available other than as a
result of a breach of this Limited Guaranty by the Guaranteed Party or any
other Person; (iii) pursuant to any litigation relating to the Merger
Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby; or (iv) to the extent
required by Law or the rules of any self-regulatory organization or securities

14\. _Miscellaneous_. 

(a) This Limited Guaranty constitutes the entire agreement with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersedes any and all prior discussions,
negotiations, proposals, undertakings, understandings and agreements, whether
written or oral, among the Guarantors or any of their Affiliates, on the one
hand, and the Guaranteed Party or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand.
No amendment, supplementation, modification or waiver of this Limited Guaranty
or any provision hereof shall be enforceable unless approved by the Guaranteed
Party (acting through the Special Committee, if such committee still exists)
and each of the Guarantors in writing. The Guaranteed Party and its
Affiliates are not relying upon any prior or contemporaneous statement,
undertaking, understanding, agreement, representation or warranty, whether
written or oral, made by or on behalf of the Guarantors or any other Non-
Recourse Party in connection with this Limited Guaranty except as expressly
set forth herein or in the Merger Agreement, the Equity Funding Letter, the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Voting Agreement or the Rollover Letter. The
Guarantors and their respective Affiliates are not relying upon any prior or
contemporaneous statement, undertaking, understanding, agreement,
representation or warranty, whether written or oral, made by or on behalf of
the Guaranteed Party in connection with this Limited Guaranty except as
expressly set forth herein or in the Merger Agreement, the Equity Funding
Letter, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Voting Agreement or the Rollover
Letter.

 

(b) Any term or provision of this Limited Guaranty that is invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction (as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction) shall be, as to such jurisdiction, ineffective solely to the
extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the
remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in
any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision
in any other jurisdiction; _provided_ , however, that this Limited Guaranty
may not be enforced without giving effect to the limitation of the amount
payable by any Guarantor hereunder to its Cap provided in Section 1 hereof
and to the provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof. Each party hereto covenants
and agrees that it shall not assert, and shall cause its respective Affiliates
and representatives not to assert, that this Limited Guaranty or any part
hereof is invalid, illegal or unenforceable in accordance with its terms.

 



9 (c) The descriptive headings herein are inserted for convenience of reference
only and are not intended to be part of or to affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Limited Guaranty.

this Limited Guaranty and that any rule of construction to the effect that any
ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be
employed in the interpretation of this Limited Guaranty.

(e) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage may occur
in the event that any of the provisions of this Limited Guaranty were not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached and
further agree that each party hereto shall be entitled to seek an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief against any other party to
prevent breaches of this Limited Guaranty and to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which it is
entitled at law or in equity (subject, in all cases, to the terms
and provisions hereof), and shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction. Each party
hereto further agrees that it will not oppose the granting of any such
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
(x) any other party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.
