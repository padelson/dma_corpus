Assets as herein contemplated (the " _Purchase Price_ ") shall be an amount
equal to (i) $108,974,481, _plus_ (or _minus_ ), (ii) an amount equal to the
difference between the Final Net Working Capital and a deficit of
$954,698.71, _minus_ (iii) the Indebtedness Adjustment Amount. The adjustments
described in clauses (ii) and (iii) above collectively are referred to as the
" _Purchase Price Adjustments_."

(b) The amount of cash to be delivered at the Closing in accordance with 
_Section 3.3(a)_ (the " _Initial Purchase Price_ ") shall be an amount equal
to (i) $108,974,481 _plus_ (or _minus_ ), (ii) an amount equal to the
difference between the Interim Net Working Capital and a deficit of
$954,698.71, _minus_ (iii) the Initial Indebtedness Adjustment Amount. The
adjustments described in clauses (ii) and (iii) above collectively are
referred to as the " _Initial Purchase Price Adjustments_."

(c) At the Closing, Buyers shall pay the HRA Minority Interest Purchase Price

Houston Rehabilitation Associates shall not be a part of the Contemplated
Transactions and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to
$3,356,622.

 



16 2.6 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The Purchase Price shall be allocated
among the Facilities and the Purchased Assets at each Facility in accordance
with Code §1060 and treasury regulations thereunder (and any similar provision
of state, local or foreign law, as appropriate) (the " _Asset Allocation_
"). Within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Buyers shall deliver a
copy of their initial determination of the Asset Allocation to Sellers.
Sellers shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt of the initial
determination of the Asset Allocation by Buyers, notify Buyers if they
disagree with such initial determination, and if Sellers do not so notify
Buyers within such thirty (30) days, the initial Asset Allocation shall be
final and binding on the parties. If Sellers disagree with such initial Asset
Allocation, Buyers and Sellers shall make a good faith effort to resolve the
dispute. If Buyers and Sellers have been unable to resolve their differences
within fifteen (15) days after Buyers have been notified of Sellers
disagreement with the initial Asset Allocation, then any remaining disputed
issues shall be submitted to an independent auditor to be mutually agreed upon
in writing by the parties, who shall resolve the disagreement in a
final binding manner. The cost of such independent auditor shall be borne
equally by Sellers and Buyers. Sellers and Buyers and their Affiliates shall
report, act, and file Tax Returns (including, but not limited to Internal
Revenue Service Form 8594) in all respects and for all purposes consistent
with such allocation. Neither Sellers nor Buyers shall take any position
(whether in audits, tax returns, or otherwise) that is inconsistent with such
allocation unless required to do so by applicable law.

2.7 _Initial Purchase Price Adjustment_. The Purchase Price shall be adjusted
on or prior to the Closing Date as follows:

(a) Sellers shall prepare and deliver to Buyers not less than five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, (i) Sellers most recent month-end
balance sheets in respect of the Facilities (which balance sheets shall be
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the
Reference Balance Sheets) (the " _Interim Balance Sheets_ "); (ii) a copy of
Sellers trial balances in respect of the Facilities as of the date of the
Interim Balance Sheets; and (iii) schedules setting forth in reasonable detail
Sellers calculation of (A) each of the Initial Purchase Price Adjustments
determined as of the date of the Interim Balance Sheets and (B) the Initial
Purchase Price (collectively, the " _Initial Closing Statement_ ").

 

(b) Sellers shall (i) consult with Buyers and its representatives with respect
to the Initial Closing Statement and (ii) permit Buyers and their
representatives to review Sellers work papers relating thereto. Buyers may
object to any of the information contained in the Initial Closing Statement
that could affect the Initial Purchase Price by delivering written notice of
such objections to Sellers not less than two (2) Business Days after receipt
of the Initial Closing Statement. If Buyers timely raise any such objections
prior to the Closing, Buyers and Sellers will attempt to resolve such
objections in good faith prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that to the extent Buyers and Sellers are unable to resolve such issues prior
to the Closing, then, for purposes of determining the Initial Purchase Price,
the parties will use Sellers proposed calculations of such amounts as
reflected in the Initial Closing Statement.

 

2.8 _Final Purchase Price Adjustment_. Following the Closing, the parties
shall adjust the Purchase Price as follows (the " _Final Purchase Price
Adjustment_ "):

(a) Not more than 75 days after the Closing Date, Sellers shall deliver to
Buyers the following: (i) balance sheets of Sellers in respect of the
Facilities as of the Closing Date (the " _Closing Balance Sheets_ "); (ii) a
copy of Sellers trial balances in respect of the Facilities as of the
Closing Date; and (iii) schedules setting forth in reasonable detail Buyers
calculation of (A) each of the Purchase Price Adjustments and (B) the Purchase
Price (collectively, the " _Closing Statement_ "); and

 



17 (b) Sellers covenant and agree that the Closing Balance Sheets shall be
prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied on a basis consistent with the
Reference Balance Sheets, except as modified in the last sentence of this
_Section 2.8(b)_. The Closing Balance Sheets shall set forth the calculation
of Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date. For purposes of the Final
Purchase Price Adjustment, the Final Net Working Capital shall be determined
based on the Closing Balance Sheet, except that (i) Paid Time Off will be
adjusted to eliminate any such obligations in respect of Sellers employees
who are not offered employment or who do not accept offers of employment by
Buyers as of the Closing and (ii) the Value of Pharmacy Inventory will reflect
the physical inventory conducted pursuant to _Section 2.11_.

2.9 _Dispute of Adjustments/Reconciliations of the Purchase Price_. Within 15
days after Sellers delivery of the Closing Statement to Buyers, Buyers shall,
in a written notice to Sellers, either accept or describe in reasonable detail
any proposed adjustments to the Closing Balance Sheets or the Closing
Statement and the reasons therefor, and shall include pertinent calculations.
If Buyers fail to deliver notice of acceptance or objection to the Closing
Balance Sheets or the Closing Statement within such 15-day period, Buyers
shall be deemed to have accepted the Closing Balance Sheets and the Closing
Statement. In the event that Sellers and Buyers are not able to agree on the
adjustment to be made pursuant to _Section 2.8_ within 15 days from and after
the receipt by Sellers of any objections timely raised by Buyers, Sellers and
Buyers shall each have the right to require that such disputed determination
be submitted to an independent auditor to be mutually agreed upon in writing
by the parties for computation or verification in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement. The results of such independent auditors report
shall be binding upon Sellers and Buyers, and such independent auditors fees
and expenses for each such disputed determination shall be borne by the party
whose determination has been modified or by both parties in proportion to the
relative amount each partys determination has been modified.

Appropriate payment shall be made by Buyers or Sellers, as applicable, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds promptly upon (and in all events
within three (3) Business Days after) agreement of Buyers and Sellers with
respect to the determination of the Final Purchase Price Adjustment or
determination of the Final Purchase Price Adjustment in accordance with this
_Section 2.9_ as follows: either (i) Buyers shall pay Sellers the amount by
which the Purchase Price exceeds the Initial Purchase Price or (ii) Sellers
shall pay Buyers the amount by which the Initial Purchase Price exceeds the
Purchase Price. At all reasonable times following delivery by Sellers to
Buyers of the proposed Closing Balance Sheets and the Closing Statement, as
provided in _Section 2.8_, Sellers shall make available to Buyers and its
agents all books and records of Sellers included in, or related to, the
determination of the Purchase Price Adjustments, including all of Sellers
and its agents accounting work papers and journal entries underlying such
determination or the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheets and the Closing
Statement.

 



18 2.10 _Proration_. Within seventy-five (75) days after the Closing
Date, Sellers and Buyers shall prorate as of the Closing Date (a) any amounts
that were paid by Sellers prior to the Closing and relate, in whole or in
part, to periods ending after the Closing Date and (b) any amounts that become
due and payable after the Closing Date, in each case, with respect to (i) the
Assumed Contracts (including the Tenant Leases and the Third Party Leases),
(ii) personal property and ad valorem Taxes on the Purchased Assets (based
upon taxes paid in respect of same for calendar year 2010), and (iii) all
utilities servicing any of the Purchased Assets, including water, sewer,
telephone, electricity and gas service, in each case to the extent not
prorated as of Closing, reflected in the Final Net Working Capital or
otherwise covered by _Section 2.8_. Any such amounts that are not available
within seventy-five (75) days after the Closing Date shall be similarly
prorated as of the Closing Date as soon as practicable thereafter.

2.11 _Physical Pharmacy Inventory_. Not more than fifteen (15) days prior to
the Closing Date, Sellers will perform a physical inventory at the Facilities
to verify the levels and amounts of the Pharmacy Inventory. Sellers will give
Buyers not less than two (2) days notice of such physical inventory.
Representatives of Buyers will be permitted to observe such physical
inventory and will be permitted to make test counts of Pharmacy Inventory and
receive copies of the records of the physical inventory conducted pursuant to
this _Section 2.11_. In connection with such inventory, Sellers and Buyers
shall jointly determine if any pharmacy supplies or inventory are unusable or
obsolete, which unusable and obsolete supplies shall be excluded from the
calculation of the Value of Pharmacy Inventory. Prior to Closing, Sellers
may, at their option, remove pharmacy supplies or inventory that, based upon
such physical inventory, have been determined by the parties to be unusable or
obsolete. Based on such inventory, the value of the Pharmacy Inventory shall
be determined by applying the most current Vendor price to each item of
Pharmacy Inventory as of the date of such inventory and Sellers shall prepare
a schedule thereof (the " _Value of Pharmacy Inventory_ "). The Value of
Pharmacy Inventory shall be used for purposes of preparing the Final Net
Working Capital. The amount of the Value of Pharmacy Inventory shall be
increased or decreased, as appropriate, to reflect the value of any additions
to, or deletions from the value (as determined by the physical inventory) of
the Pharmacy Inventory of the Facilities between the date of the physical
inventory and the Closing Date.

Seller of its obligations under this Agreement and documents described herein

22 (c) assuming the Approvals set forth on _Schedule 4.2(b)_ are obtained, will
not conflict with, or result in any violation of or default under (with or
without notice or lapse of time or both), or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation, acceleration or augmentation of any obligation or
to loss of a material benefit under, or result in the creation of any
Encumbrance (other than Permitted Encumbrances) upon any of the Purchased
Assets under (i) any Contract applicable to any of the Purchased Assets or
(ii) any Order or Law applicable to any of the Purchased Assets or to which
Sellers may be subject.

4.3 _No Outstanding Rights_. Except as set forth in _Schedule 4.3_, there

individually or in the aggregate, materially interfere with the use, occupancy
or operation of the Purchased Assets as currently used, occupied or operated.
The Purchased Assets (together with the Excluded Assets) consist of all assets
necessary to operate and are adequate for the purposes of operating the
Business in the manner in which it has been operated since January 1, 2010.

4.6 _Financial Information_.

(a) _Schedule 4.6_ hereto contains the following financial statements and
financial information of Sellers in respect of the Facilities (collectively,
the " _Historical Financial Information_ "):

the 12-month periods ended December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2010;

 



23 (ii) unaudited balance sheets as of the Balance Sheet Date (the "Reference
Balance Sheets") and as of March 31, 2011; and

March 31, 2011;

(b) The Historical Financial Information is true, correct and complete in all
material respects and fairly presents the financial position of the Sellers
with respect to the Business and the Facilities at the respective dates
thereof and the results of the Sellers operations of the Business and
changes in financial position for the respective periods covered thereby. The
financial statements included in the Historical Financial Information have
been prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods indicated, subject to the absence of footnotes and
year-end audit adjustments (the effect of which is not material with respect
to the Purchased Assets), and are based on the information contained in the
books and records of Sellers; and

(c) Except for (i) liabilities reflected in the Reference Balance Sheets and
(ii) liabilities that were incurred after the Balance Sheet Date in the
ordinary course of business, none of which have had a Material Adverse Change,
Sellers have no liabilities of any nature relating to the Purchased Assets and
the Assumed Liabilities, whether accrued, absolute, fixed, contingent,
liquidated, unliquidated, recorded, unrecorded, known, unknown, or otherwise
of the nature required to be disclosed in a balance sheet prepared in
accordance with GAAP.

 

4.7 _Approvals_. Each Facility is licensed as a hospital or a specialty
hospital to operate the number of beds set forth on  _Schedule 1B_ in
accordance with the applicable Law of the state in which such Facility is
located. The pharmacies, laboratories, and all other ancillary departments
located at the Facilities or operated for the benefit of the Facilities
that are required to be separately licensed are duly licensed by the
appropriate Governmental Authority. Except as disclosed on _Schedule 4.7_ ,
each Facility possesses the Approvals necessary for Sellers to own and operate
the Facilities and the Purchased Assets and to carry on the Business as
currently conducted. Sellers have provided accurate and complete copies to
Buyers of each Approval listed on _Schedule 4.7_. _Schedule 4.7_ lists all
material Approvals owned or held by Sellers applicable to the Purchased
Assets or the Facilities. Sellers and the Facilities, as applicable, are, and
at all times have been, in material compliance with the terms of such
Approvals, and there are no provisions in, or agreements relating to, any
Approval that preclude or limit Sellers from operating the Facilities and the
Purchased Assets and carrying on Business as currently conducted. There is no
pending or, to Sellers knowledge, threatened Proceeding by or before
any Governmental Authority to revoke, cancel, rescind, suspend, restrict,
modify, or refuse to renew such Approvals owned or held by Sellers and listed
on _Schedule 4.7_. To Sellers knowledge, no event has occurred and no facts
exist with respect to any Approval that would allow the suspension,
revocation, or termination of same. Neither Sellers nor the Facilities has
received any written notice or communication from any Governmental Authority
regarding any violation of any Approval owned or held by Sellers and listed
on _Schedule 4.7_ (other than any surveys or deficiency reports for which
Sellers have submitted a plan of correction that has been accepted or approved
by the applicable Governmental Authority). Sellers have delivered to Buyers
accurate and complete copies of all survey reports, deficiency notices, plans
of correction, and related correspondence received by Sellers or the

or held by Sellers.

 



24 4.8 _Certificates of Need_. _Schedule 4.8_ lists all certificate of
need approvals held by Sellers with respect to the Facilities, which
constitute all certificate of need approvals necessary for Sellers to own and
operate the Facilities and the Purchased Assets and to carry on the Business
as currently conducted. Seller and the Facilities, as applicable, are, and at
all times have been, in material compliance with the terms and conditions of
any such certificates of need approvals. Each such certificate of need is
valid and in good standing and not subject to meritorious challenge.

4.9 _Accreditation_. _Schedule 4.9_ sets forth an accurate and complete list
of all Joint Commission accreditations and other accreditations held by
Sellers with respect to the Facilities. All such accreditations are and shall
be current and in full force and effect as of the date hereof and as of the
Closing Date. Except as otherwise disclosed in _Schedule 4.9_ and to Sellers
knowledge, no event has occurred or other fact exists with respect to such
accreditations that allows, or after notice or the lapse of time or both,
would allow, revocation or termination of any such accreditations, or would
result in any other impairment in the rights of any holder thereof. There is
no pending or, to Sellers knowledge, threatened Proceeding by any accrediting
body to revoke, cancel, rescind, suspend, restrict, modify, or non-renew any
such accreditation. Sellers have delivered a copy of each Facilitys most
recent Joint Commission accreditation reports and any reports, documents, or
correspondence relating thereto to Buyers. 

4.10 _Government Program Participation; Reimbursement_. The Facilities are
certified for participation in the Government Programs and have current and
valid provider agreements listed on _Schedule 4.10_ (the " _Program
Agreements_ ") and are excluded from the Medicare prospective payment system.
Sellers have delivered accurate and complete copies of all such Program
Agreements to Buyers. The Facilities are in substantial compliance with the
conditions of participation in the Government Programs and with the terms,
conditions, and provisions of the Program Agreements. Except as otherwise
disclosed on _Schedule 4.10_ and to Sellers knowledge, no events or facts
exist that would cause any Program Agreement to be suspended, terminated,
restricted or withdrawn. There is no Proceeding, survey, or other
action pending, or, to Sellers knowledge, threatened, involving any of the
Government Programs or any other third party payor programs, including the
Facilities participation in and the reimbursement received by Sellers with
respect to the Facilities from the Government Programs or any other third
party payor programs. Neither Sellers nor, to Sellers knowledge, any of their
employees, officers, or directors have committed a violation of any Law
relating to payments and reimbursements under the Government Programs or any
other third party payor program. _Schedule 4.10_ contains a list of all
National Provider Identifiers and all provider numbers of Sellers with respect
to the Facilities under the Government Programs.

4.11 _LTACH Representations_. Except as disclosed on _Schedule 4.11_ , Sellers
are (or will be as of the Closing Date) in compliance with the requirements
to qualify each Facility as a long term acute care hospital in accordance with
all applicable Law, including, without limitation, the requirements set forth
at 42 CFR. § 412.23(e). Each Facility satisfies (or will satisfy as of the
Closing Date) all requirements for exclusion from the Medicare prospective
payment system specified in 42 CFR. § 412.1(a)(1) by complying with the
requirements set forth

 



25  at 42 CFR. § 412.23(e). Except as disclosed on _Schedule 4.11_ , no
Proceedings or surveys are pending or, to Sellers knowledge, threatened that
relate to any Facilitys status as a long term care hospital under 42 CFR. §
412.23(e). Except as disclosed on _Schedule 4.11_ , no Facility is subject to
the special payment provisions for long term care hospitals specified in 42
CFR. §§ 412.534 and 412.536. To the extent any Seller has increased the number
of beds at a Facility since December 29, 2007, each such increase in beds was
implemented consistently with an applicable exception to the moratorium on
the development of new long term acute care hospital facilities established by
Section 114 of the Medicare/Medicaid State Childrens Health Insurance Program
Extension Act and regulations promulgated thereunder.

 

4.12 _Third Party Payor Cost Reports_. Sellers have timely filed all required
Sellers Cost Reports for all fiscal years through and including the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2010, and copies of all Sellers Cost Reports filed by or
on behalf of Sellers since 2008 have been provided to Buyers. All Sellers Cost
Reports accurately reflect the information required to be included therein,
and such Cost Reports do not claim, and neither Sellers nor the Facilities
have received, reimbursement in any amount in excess of the amounts allowed by
Law or any applicable agreement. To Sellers knowledge, there are no facts or
circumstances that would give rise to any material change in allowed costs
under Sellers Cost Reports. _Schedule 4.12_ indicates which Sellers Cost
Reports have not been audited and finally settled and includes a brief
description of any and all notices of program reimbursement, proposed or
pending audit adjustments, disallowances, appeals of disallowances, and any
and all other unresolved claims or disputes in respect of Sellers Cost
Reports. Sellers have established adequate reserves to cover any potential
reimbursement obligations that Sellers may have in respect of Sellers Cost
Reports, and such reserves are accurately set forth in the Historical
Financial Information.

 

4.13 _Regulatory Compliance_.

Sellers thereunder (or the rights of Buyers thereunder following the
Closing), unless such consent is obtained. If such consent is not obtained, or
if an attempted assignment would be ineffective or would materially affect the
rights of Sellers thereunder (or the rights of Buyers thereunder
following the Closing) so that Buyers would not in fact receive all such
rights, Sellers shall upon the request of Buyers cooperate in any reasonable
arrangement designed to provide for Buyers the benefits under any such Assumed
Contract, including enforcement of any and all rights of Sellers against the
other party or parties thereto arising out of the breach or cancellation by

inability to obtain the necessary consent from the counterparty to such
Assumed Contract, then, at Buyers option, such Contract shall be deemed an
Excluded Contract; and

(d) If any party discovers (i) at any time that any agreement of any Seller
that exists as of the date hereof is not listed on _Schedule 2.2(g)_ or

Sellers or any of their Affiliates enters into with respect to any of the
Purchased Assets between the date hereof and the Closing (except for
agreements that meet the requirements set forth in _Section 6.3(a)_, which
Buyers would be obligated to assume), such party shall promptly notify the
other parties of such fact and provide the other parties with an accurate and
complete copy of such agreement. Buyers may, in their sole discretion, elect
to treat such agreement as an Assumed Contract or an Excluded Contract. To the
extent any such agreement has not been assigned to Buyers as of the

Buyers promptly upon demand by Buyers.

and oppose any preliminary injunction sought by any Governmental

or a representative thereof) any offer, inquiry or informational request
referred to above, such Seller will promptly advise such Person, by written
notice, of the terms of this _Section 6.8_ and will promptly advise Buyers of
such offer, inquiry or request and deliver a copy of such notice to Buyers

indirectly hold discussions with any LTAC Provider (other than Sellers)
regarding such an offer; or (iii) directly or indirectly enter into any

cause the Title Company to delete all standard exceptions from the Leasehold
Title Policy and the Owned Real Property Title Policies;

property occurring in connection with the Tests, except to the extent caused
by Sellers, its agents, contractors or employees. For avoidance of doubt,

letters, to advance funds which, in the aggregate, are sufficient for Buyers
to deliver the Purchase Price to Sellers at Closing. Buyers shall satisfy the
conditions specified in the commitment letters and shall complete the
financings contemplated thereby.

6.15 _Managed Care Contracting_. From and after the date hereof and at the
request of Buyers, Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable good faith
efforts to assist Buyers in establishing relationships with managed care

Buyers contained in this Agreement will be true and correct in all material
respects when made and at and as of the Closing (except for any
representations and warranties that are qualified by the concept of
materiality, each of which shall be true and correct in all respects as of
Closing). The representations and warranties of Buyers contained in this
Agreement that expressly speak only as of a specific date or time will be true
and correct as of such specified date or time. In the event that Buyers are in
material breach of any representation or warranty on the Closing Date
(whether by reason of written disclosure of such breach to Sellers or as a
result of Sellers written notice to Buyers of such breach), and if such
breach is of a type which can be cured, Buyers shall have a period of twenty
(20) days after the date on which either Buyers disclosed such breach to
Sellers or Sellers provided notice of such breach to Buyers in which to cure
such breach. If necessary, the Closing Date shall be extended until the
expiration of such twenty (20) day period. If Buyers have not cured any such
breach within such twenty (20) day period, Sellers shall not be required to
consummate the Contemplated Transaction and shall be entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_.

8.2 _Performance_. Buyers shall have performed and complied in all material
respects with all agreements, obligations and covenants contained in this
Agreement that are required to be performed or complied with by Buyers at or
prior to the Closing. In the event that Buyers are in material breach of any
agreement, obligation or covenant on the Closing Date (whether by reason of
written disclosure of such breach to Sellers or as a result of Sellers
written notice to Buyers of such breach), and if such breach is of a type
which can be cured, Buyers shall have a period of twenty (20) days after the
date on which either Buyers disclosed such breach to Sellers or Sellers
provided notice of such breach to Buyers in which to cure such breach. If
necessary, the Closing Date shall be extended until the expiration of such
twenty (20) day period. If Buyers

 



48  have not cured any such breach within such twenty (20) day period, Sellers
shall not be required to consummate the Contemplated Transaction and shall be
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_. Sellers
shall have received payment of the Purchase Price, subject to the adjustments
and prorations herein, in accordance with _Section 2.5_.

 

8.3 _Action/Proceeding_. No court or any other Governmental Authority shall

commence any Proceeding before any court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority that seeks to restrain or prohibit the consummation of
the Contemplated Transactions.

8.4 _HSR Act_. If applicable, the waiting period under the HSR Act shall have
expired or been terminated by the FTC.

     | 9. | TERMINATION 
---|---|--- 

9.1  _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Contemplated
Transactions may be abandoned at any time prior to the Closing as follows:

(a) by mutual written consent of Buyers and Sellers;

 

(b) by Buyers by giving written notice to Sellers at any time prior to the
Closing (i) in the event Sellers have breached any material representation,
warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement, Buyers have notified Sellers
of such breach, and, if of a type which can be cured, such breach has
continued without cure for a period of twenty (20) days after the notice of
breach, or (ii) if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before September
1, 2011 (" _Termination Date_ "), by reason of the failure of any condition
precedent under _Article 7_  (unless the failure results primarily from
Buyers breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement);

(c) by Sellers by giving written notice to Buyers at any time prior to the
Closing (i) in the event Buyers have breached any material representation,
warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement, Sellers have notified
Buyers of such breach, and, if of a type which can be cured, such breach has
continued without cure for a period of twenty (20) days after the notice of
breach, or (ii) if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before the
Termination Date, by reason of the failure of any condition precedent under
_Article 8_ (unless the failure results primarily from Sellers breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement);

 



49 (d) by Buyers by giving written notice to Sellers if there has been
a Material Adverse Change;

(e) by either Buyers or Sellers if a final nonappealable Order
permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the Closing shall
have been issued by a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction; or

(f) by Buyers in accordance with _Section 10.9_ (Casualty).

 

9.2 _Effect of Termination_.

(a) In the event that this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to _Section
9.1_, other than pursuant to _Sections 9.1(b) or (c)_ , all further
obligations of the parties under this Agreement (other than those set forth
in _Section 12.6_ and _Section 12.7)_ shall terminate without further
liability of any party to another; and no party shall have any claim against
the other, whether under this Agreement or applicable Laws.

(b) Sellers understand and acknowledge that in the event that Buyers terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)(i)_ or pursuant to _Section
9.1(b)(ii)_ because of the lack of satisfaction of _Section 7.1_, _Section
7.2_, _Section 7.3_, or _Section 7.8_ by the Termination Date, Buyers will
have incurred substantial monetary damages that are not readily subject to
determination. Therefore, in order to avoid uncertainty and to clearly
establish the damages that Buyers would sustain in the event that
Buyers terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)(i)_ or the lack
of satisfaction of _Section 7.1_, _Section 7.2 Section 7.3_, or _Section
7.8_, Sellers shall pay to Buyers as liquidated damages, and not as a
penalty, the amount of $500,000 (except in the case of Buyers terminating this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(i) as a result of Sellers breach of
Section 6.8(a), in which case the Sellers shall pay Buyers as
liquidated damages, and not as a penalty, the amount of $1,000,000) within
ten (10) days of the notice of termination. For the avoidance of doubt, a
termination of this Agreement arising from Sellers failure to satisfy its
obligations on the Closing Date after all conditions precedent to Sellers
obligations contained herein have been satisfied shall entitle Buyers to
recovery of $500,000 liquidated damages pursuant to this _Section 9.2(b)_
(except in the case of Buyers terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section
9.1(b)(i) as a result of Sellers breach of Section 6.8(a), in which case the
Sellers shall pay Buyers as liquidated damages, and not as a penalty, the
amount of $1,000,000). For the avoidance of doubt, Buyers shall not be
entitled to liquidated damages pursuant to the foregoing for Sellers breach
of any representation or warranty to the extent that such breach is a result
of Sellers failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 7.10 or
Section 7.11 on or before the Closing Date.

(c) Buyers understand and acknowledge that in the event that Sellers
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)(i)_ or pursuant to
_Section 9.1(c)(ii)_ because of the lack of satisfaction of _Section 8.1_, 
_Section 8.2_, or _Section 8.5_ by the

 



50  Termination Date, Sellers will have incurred substantial monetary damages
that are not readily subject to determination. Therefore, in order to avoid
uncertainty and to clearly establish the damages that Sellers would sustain
in the event that Sellers terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
9.1(c)(i)_ or the lack of satisfaction of _Section 8.1_, _Section 8.2_, or
_Section 8.5_ Buyers shall pay to Sellers as liquidated damages, and not as
a penalty, the amount of $2,500,000 within ten (10) days of the notice of
termination. For the avoidance of doubt, a termination of this Agreement
arising from Buyers failure to satisfy its obligations on the Closing Date
after all conditions precedent to Buyers obligations contained herein have
been satisfied shall entitle Sellers to a recovery of $2,500,000 liquidated
damages pursuant to this _Section 9.2(c)_. 

(d) In the event that Sellers are obligated to pay to Buyers $500,000 or
$1,000,000 in liquidated damages as described above, in no event shall Buyers
be entitled to receive any damages in excess of $500,000 or $1,000,000, as
applicable, in the aggregate, inclusive of such liquidated damages provided
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, for all losses and damages arising
from or in connection with breaches of this Agreement by Sellers, or otherwise
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions.

 

(e) In the event that Buyers are obligated to pay to Sellers $2,500,000 in
liquidated damages as described above, in no event shall Sellers and its
Affiliates be entitled to receive any damages in excess of $2,500,000, in the
aggregate, inclusive of such liquidated damages provided pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement, for all losses and damages arising from or in connection
with breaches of this Agreement by Buyers, or otherwise relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions.

(f) The parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in this
_Section 9.2_ are an integral part of the Contemplated Transactions. This
_Section 9.2_ shall survive any termination of this Agreement.



     | 10. | ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS 
---|---|--- 
 

10.1 _Misdirected Payments_. If any party receives any amount from patients,
any Government Program, any other third-party payors, group purchasing

to the other party, the party receiving such amount shall remit within twenty
(20) Business Days said full amount to the other party. 

10.2 _Sellers Cost Reports_. Sellers will timely prepare and file (and will
pay any amounts due pursuant to) all cost reports relating to Sellers and the

result of the consummation of the transactions set forth herein, including

Reports and the Agency Settlements. Upon the written request of Buyers,
Sellers shall provide Buyers with copies of such correspondence, work papers
and other documents, Sellers will furnish copies of filed cost reports to
Buyers within thirty (30) days of filing with the appropriate payor. In the
event that any Government Program offsets, withholds or recoups any amounts
payable or paid to Buyers as a result of any liabilities or obligations of
Sellers in respect of periods prior to and including the Closing Date arising
under the terms of the Government Programs (including, without limitation, as
a consequence of Sellers failure to timely file any terminating cost
report), Sellers shall tender to Buyers an amount equal to the amount offset,
withheld or recouped within ten (10) Business Days after Sellers receipt of
written notice from Buyers of such offset, withholding or recoupment. Upon
the written request of Sellers to Buyers, Buyers personnel at each Facility
shall provide Facility specific information and data pertaining to periods
prior to Closing as requested by Sellers for completion of Sellers Cost
Reports. Buyers make no representations or warranties to Sellers regarding
such information or data and shall have no liability to Sellers in respect
thereof or the delivery thereof to Sellers. Sellers waive and release any
claims Sellers may have against Buyers pertaining to such information or data
or the delivery of any of same to Sellers.

 

10.3 _Employees_.

(a) As of the Closing, Sellers shall terminate or cause its Affiliates to
terminate all of its Employees at the Facilities, and Buyers or its Affiliates
shall offer employment to substantially all active non-physician Employees of
Sellers at the Facilities in accordance with terms and conditions of
employment established by Buyers; _provided_ , _however_ , Buyers reserve the
right not to hire any individual Employee consistent with the applicable
policies and procedures of LifeCare. Buyers shall also hire each of the
Sellers other employees at the Facilities who, on the Closing Date, is on
either military leave or such other leave which, under applicable federal or
state law, entitles such employee to be rehired, once any such employee has
been cleared to return to work prior to the expiration of any such rehire
right, each of whom is identified on _Schedule 4.23_ , which schedule shall be
updated no later than five (5) Business Days after the Closing to accurately
identify those who are on leave of absence as of such date. The initial terms
and conditions of employment of any of Sellers employees will include
offering positions to such Employees at their existing base wage and salary
levels with benefits comparable to those generally offered to similarly-
situated Employees at long term acute care hospitals that are owned and
operated by Affiliates of LifeCare;

 

(b) Except as disclosed on _Schedule 10.3(b)_ , the term " _Employee_ " as
used in this Agreement means an active employee of Sellers who is employed at
and physically located at a Facility and identified on _Schedule 4.23_. The
term " _Hired Employee_ " as used in this Agreement means an Employee who
accepts employment with Buyers as of the Closing Date, and in addition, any
Employee of Sellers who is on leave as of the Closing Date who later accepts
employment with Buyers in accordance with the terms of _Section 10.3(a)_. All
Hired Employees will be retained as employees-at-will. The terms of all such
Hired Employees employment with Buyers shall be in accordance with usual

 



52  and customary practices for employees of LifeCare and its Affiliates. Buyers
shall provide each Hired Employee with employee benefits, including, without
limitation, retirement, welfare and paid time off, consistent with similarly-
situated employees at long term acute care hospitals that are owned and
operated by Affiliates of LifeCare. With respect to such employee benefits, to
the extent lawful and provided for under Buyers policies and contracts,
Buyers shall honor the Hired Employees prior service credit under Sellers
welfare benefit plans for purposes of eligibility and satisfying pre-existing
condition limitations in Buyers welfare benefit plans. Buyers shall also
honor the Hired Employees prior service with Sellers for purposes of
eligibility and vesting in Buyers retirement benefit plans and other service-
based plans such as paid time off, but shall not accrue benefits or
make contributions to such plans with respect to such prior service. Buyers
shall carry over, and give credit for, the unused Paid Time Off days of the
Hired Employees based on the valid records of Sellers, but only to the extent
that (i) the amounts do not exceed the maximum allowed accrual under Buyers
policies and (ii) the value of such Paid Time Off is reflected in the Final
Net Working Capital. Participation in such benefit plans shall begin as soon
as administratively feasible after the Closing Date for participating Hired
Employees (and eligible dependents) and for all other Hired Employees who,
given their service with Sellers, have met the age and service requirements
for participation under the respective Buyers plans. If Buyers terminate the
employment of any Hired Employee at any time after the Closing, Buyers shall
be responsible for costs and consequences of any such termination;

 

(c) Buyers shall employ a sufficient number of Employees at each Facility as
Hired Employees for at least a 90-day period following the Closing so as not
to constitute a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" (as those terms are used in
the WARN Act) with respect to any such Facility;

 

(d) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, no term of this
Agreement shall be deemed to (i) create any contract with any Hired Employee,
(ii) give any Hired Employee the right to be retained in the employment of
Buyers or any of its Affiliates, or (iii) interfere with Buyers right to
terminate employment of any Hired Employee at any time. Nothing in this
Agreement shall diminish Buyers right to change or terminate its policies
regarding salaries, benefits and other employment matters at any time or from
time to time. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained herein are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto, and Hired
Employees are not intended to be and shall not be construed as beneficiaries
hereof;

 

(e) With respect to any current or former employee of Sellers (other than the
Hired Employees) and any eligible spouse or dependent of any such current or
former employee of Sellers, Sellers shall retain the obligation to provide
notices and continuation coverage under COBRA. Sellers shall offer such
current or former employees and any eligible spouse or dependant thereof
continuation coverage under the applicable Sellers group health, dental or
other medical plans to the extent required by COBRA; and

(f) As of the Closing Date, Sellers will, at their expense or at the expense
of the applicable Plan, (i) terminate the participation of all Hired Employees
from all Plans and (ii) take such actions as are necessary to make, or cause
such Plans to make, timely

 



53  appropriate distributions to such Hired Employees to the extent required or
permitted by, and in accordance with, such Plans and applicable Law, as
determined by Sellers and/or their counsel. With respect to the Hired
Employees, Sellers will fully fund all benefits provided under any Plan
intended to be qualified under Sections 401 or 403 of the Code maintained or
contributed to by Sellers or any of their Affiliates within thirty (30) days
after Closing.

10.4 _Post-Closing Access to Information_. Buyers and Sellers acknowledge
that, subsequent to the Closing, Buyers and Sellers may need access to
information, documents or computer data in the control or possession of the
other, and Sellers may need access to the Purchased Assets for purposes of
concluding the Contemplated Transactions and for audits, investigations,
compliance with governmental requirements, regulations and requests, and the
prosecution or defense of third party claims. Accordingly, Buyers agree that,
at the sole cost and expense of Sellers, it will make available to Sellers
and their agents, independent auditors and/or Governmental Authorities such
documents and information as may be available relating to the Purchased Assets
and Facilities in respect of periods prior to the Closing and will permit
Sellers to make copies of such documents and information. Sellers agree that,
at the sole cost and expense of Buyers, Sellers will make available to Buyers
and their agents, independent auditors and/or Governmental Authorities such
documents and information as may be in the possession of Sellers or their
Affiliates relating to the Purchased Assets and Facilities in respect of
periods prior to the Closing and will permit Buyers to make copies of such
documents and information. 

10.5 _Preservation and Access to Records After the Closing_. After the
Closing, Buyers shall keep and preserve in their original form all medical
and other records of the Facilities transferred to Buyers at the Closing,
consistent with Buyers record retention policies and procedures and
applicable relevant Law governing such retention. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "records" includes all documents, electronic data and
other compilations of information in any form. Buyers acknowledge that as a
result of entering into this Agreement and managing the Facilities it and
its Affiliates will gain access to patient and other information which is
subject to rules and regulations regarding confidentiality. Buyers shall abide
by any such rules and regulations relating to the confidential information
that it acquires. Buyers shall maintain the patient records held at each
Facility or delivered to Buyers at the Closing at the Facilities after Closing
in accordance with applicable Law (including, if applicable, Section
1861(v)(i)(I) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. § 1395(V)(1)(i)), all in
a manner consistent with the maintenance of patient records generated at the
Facilities after Closing. Upon reasonable notice, during normal business hours
and upon Buyers receipt of appropriate consents and authorizations, Buyers
shall afford to representatives of Sellers, including their counsel and
accountants, full and complete access to, and the right to make copies of, the
records transferred to Buyers at the Closing (including access to patient
records in respect of patients treated by Sellers at the Facilities).

10.6 _Capital Expenditures_. This Agreement shall not be deemed to be an
acquisition or obligation of a capital expenditure or of funds within the
meaning of the Certificate of Need statute of any state, until the appropriate
Governmental Authorities shall have granted a Certificate of Need or the
appropriate approval or ruled that no Certificate of Need or other approval is
required.

 



54 10.7 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Sellers shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed on a timely basis all Tax Returns relating to the Purchased Assets and
the Business with respect to all taxable periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date. Buyers shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause
to be filed all Tax Returns relating to the Purchased Assets and the Business
with respect to all taxable periods ending after the Closing Date. Sellers
shall be responsible for and shall pay any Taxes arising or resulting from or
in connection with the ownership of the Purchased Assets and operation of
the Business for all taxable periods (or portion thereof) ending on or prior
to the Closing Date. Buyers and Sellers agree to utilize, or cause their
respective Affiliates to utilize, the standard procedure set forth in Revenue
Procedure 2004-53 with respect to wage reporting; and

(b) Following the Closing, Sellers shall cooperate with Buyers and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to make available to Buyers, as reasonably
requested, and to any taxing authority, all information, records or documents
relating to Tax liabilities or potential Tax liabilities with respect to the
Purchased Assets or the Business for all periods, and shall preserve all such
information, records and documents (to the extent not a part of the Purchased
Assets or the Business delivered by Sellers at Closing) in accordance with its
policies.

 

10.8 _Non-Competition_.

(a) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending four (4) years
after the Closing Date, Sellers shall not, and shall cause their Affiliates
not to, directly or indirectly, in any capacity (i) develop, construct,
lease, own, manage, operate or control any Prohibited Business that is located
within the Territory, (ii) manage or provide management or consulting services
to, or participate in the management or control of, any Person with respect
to the development, construction, ownership or operation of any Prohibited
Business that is located within the Territory, or (iii) own a financial
interest in, or lend money to, any Person that engages in any of the
activities described in clauses (i) and (ii), above; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Sellers may (x) acquire a Person that engages in the Prohibited Business,
among other activities of such Person, in the Territory, provided that such
Persons EBITDA from the conduct of such Prohibited Business in the Territory
does not exceed 10% of its total EBITDA for the completed portion of its then
current fiscal year and the full fiscal year immediately prior to
such acquisition, and (y) enter into, at arms length, any bona fide joint
venture (or partnership or other business arrangement) for the development or
operation of a business that is not a Prohibited Business in the Territory
with any Person who is not directly engaged in the Prohibited Business in the
Territory but which is an Affiliate of another Person engaged in the
Prohibited Business in the Territory; _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing
contained in this  _Section 10.8_ shall prohibit or otherwise restrict
Sellers current or future operation of inpatient rehabilitation facilities.
In the event that Sellers or their Affiliates complete a transaction described
in  _Section 10.8(a)(x)_, Sellers or their Affiliates shall offer the
acquired Prohibited Business in the Territory to LifeCare at a purchase price
equal to the greater of fair market value or the purchase price allocated to
the Prohibited Business in

 



55  the overall transaction (unless Sellers notify LifeCare that Sellers intend
to convert such Prohibited Business to a business line other than a Prohibited
Business and thereafter complete such conversion within twelve (12) months
after the completion of such purchase). LifeCare shall have a period of sixty
(60) days from and after the receipt of Sellers written offer to notify
Sellers in writing of its decision to purchase such Prohibited Business.
During such sixty (60) day period, Sellers shall grant LifeCare access to the
plant, properties, equipment, books, records and personnel of such Prohibited
Business for purposes of LifeCares due diligence. If LifeCare timely
notifies Sellers in writing that it intends to purchase such Prohibited
Business, the purchase agreement for such transaction shall be upon terms and
conditions substantially similar to this Agreement. If LifeCare fails to
respond to Sellers offer within sixty (60) days after the receipt of same,
LifeCare shall be deemed to have declined Sellers offer to purchase such
Prohibited Business and Sellers shall not be deemed to be in violation of
this  _Section 10.8_. In the event that HealthSouth or any of its
subsidiaries is acquired by a Person that engages in a Prohibited Business in
the Territory, the continued operation of such Prohibited Business by such
Person after its acquisition of HealthSouth or any of its subsidiaries shall
not constitute a breach by Sellers or is Affiliates of this _Section
10.8(a)_;

(b) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending four (4) years
after the Closing Date, Buyers shall not, and shall cause their Affiliates not
to convert any of the Facilities from a long term acute care hospital to an
inpatient rehabilitation facility;

(c) The parties recognize that the covenants in this _Section 10.8_, and the
territorial, time and other limitations with respect thereto, are reasonable
and properly required for the adequate protection of the acquisition of the
Purchased Assets by Buyers, and agree that such limitations are reasonable
with respect to its activities, business and public purpose. The parties agree
and acknowledge that the violation of the covenants or agreements in this
_Section 10.8_ would cause irreparable injury to the other and that the
remedy at law for any violation or threatened violation thereof would be
inadequate and that, in addition to whatever other remedies may be available
at law or in equity, the parties shall be entitled to temporary and permanent
injunctive or other equitable relief without the necessity of proving actual
damages or posting bond. The parties hereto also waive any requirement of
proving actual damages in connection with the obtaining of any such injunctive
or other equitable relief; and

(d) It is the intention of each party hereto that the provisions of this 
_Section 10.8_ shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the
Law and the public policies of the states in which the Facilities are located
and of any other jurisdiction in which enforcement may be sought, but that
the unenforceability (or the modification to conform with such Laws or public
policies) of any provisions hereof shall not render unenforceable or impair
the remainder of this Agreement. Accordingly, if any term or provision of
this  _Section 10.8_ shall be determined to be illegal, invalid or
unenforceable, either in whole or in part, this Agreement shall be deemed
amended to delete or modify, as necessary, the offending provisions and to
alter the balance of this Agreement in order to render the same valid and
enforceable to the fullest extent permissible as aforesaid.

 



56 10.9 _Casualty_. If any of the Purchased Assets is damaged or destroyed prior
to the Closing, Sellers shall notify Buyers in writing of such fact promptly
after obtaining knowledge thereof. If, in the reasonable opinion of an
architect, general contractor, and/or engineer, to be mutually agreed upon by
Buyers and Sellers, as required to assess the damage or destruction to any of
the Purchased Assets (collectively, the "Independent Professionals"), the
damage or destruction to the Purchased Assets renders the affected Facility
substantially unusable (defined as more than fifty percent (50%) of such
Facilitys licensed beds being inoperable) for a period in excess of one
hundred twenty (120) days following Closing (a " _Casualty_ "), then Buyers
may choose one of the two options below with regard to the affected Facility:

(a) in the event of a Casualty, the Independent Professional will provide a
report providing the estimated time required to repair, replace or restore
such affected Facility from the date of the opinion forward. If said period
will exceed one-hundred twenty (120) days following Closing, Buyers shall
have the right to terminate this Agreement with respect to such affected
Facility. Buyers shall have fifteen (15) days after the Independent
Professionals have delivered their report to Sellers and Buyers to make such
election by delivering to Sellers a written election notice (the " _Election
Notice_ "). The failure by Buyers to deliver the Election Notice within such
fifteen (15)-day period shall be deemed an election not to terminate this
Agreement with respect to such affected Facility; or

(b) in the event of a Casualty, Buyers waive their right to terminate this
Agreement with respect to an affected Facility in accordance with the terms
set forth this Section and proceed with the Closing, Buyers may, at their
option, either (i) require Sellers to transfer the portion of
applicable insurance proceeds for the physical structure, equipment, the
Purchased Assets and business interruption insurance (but, as to business
interruption insurance proceeds, only those applicable to periods after the
Closing Date, if any) to Buyers at Closing, or (ii) reduce the Purchase Price
by the amount as determined in a report provided by the Independent
Professional(s) as being the reasonable cost to repair, replace or restore the
physical structure, equipment and Purchased Assets of such affected Facility
to its condition immediately prior to such Casualty.

In the case of damage or destruction that is not a Casualty, and therefore
does not give rise to Buyers right to terminate this Agreement with respect
to an affected Facility, Buyers may, at their option, either (i) require
Sellers to transfer the portion of applicable insurance proceeds for the
physical structure, equipment, the Purchased Assets and business interruption
insurance (but, as to business interruption insurance proceeds, only those
applicable to periods after the Closing Date, if any)) to Buyers at Closing,
or (ii) reduce the Purchase Price by the amount as determined in a report
provided by the Independent Professional(s) as being the reasonable cost to
repair, replace or restore the physical structure, equipment and Purchased
Assets of such affected Facility to its condition immediately prior to such
damage or destruction.

10.10 _HealthSouth Guaranty_. HealthSouth, the ultimate parent entity of each
Seller, shall execute and deliver a Guaranty, substantially in the form of
_Exhibit A_ hereto (the " _HealthSouth Guaranty_ "), contemporaneously with
the other Sellers execution and delivery of this Agreement, pursuant to
which HealthSouth shall unconditionally guaranty such other Sellers
performance under this Agreement.

 



57 10.11 _LifeCare Guaranty_. LifeCare, the ultimate parent entity of Buyers,
shall execute and deliver a Guaranty, substantially in the form of _Exhibit
B_ hereto (the " _LifeCare Guaranty_ "), contemporaneously with Buyers
execution and delivery of this Agreement, pursuant to which LifeCare
shall unconditionally guaranty each Buyers performance under this Agreement.

10.12 _Transition Services_. As of Closing, Sellers, or one or more
Affiliates of Sellers, and Buyers will enter into such transaction services
agreements, if necessary, in a form mutually acceptable to Buyers and Sellers.

 

10.13 _Transition Patients_. To compensate Sellers for services rendered and
medicine, drugs and supplies provided on or before the Closing Date with
respect to patients admitted to the Facilities on or before the Closing Date
but who are not discharged until after the Closing Date (such patients being
referred to herein as the " _Transition Patients_ "), the parties shall take
the following actions:

(a) _Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and Other DRG Transition Patients_. As soon
as practicable after the Closing Date, Sellers shall deliver to Buyers a
schedule that lists all Transition Patients whose care is reimbursed by the
Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE or other third party payor program upon
a diagnostic related group basis, case rate or similar basis. Buyers shall
pay to Sellers an amount equal to (i) the payments received by Buyers on
behalf of each such Transition Patient, multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which shall be the number of days such Transition Patient was
confined in a Facility through and including the Closing Date, and the
denominator of which shall be the total number of days such Transition Patient
was confined in a Facility _minus_  (ii) any deposits or co-payments made by
or on behalf of such Transition Patient to Sellers. Buyers shall make all
payments to Sellers under this _Section 10.13(a)_ within 30 days after
receipt of each payment accompanied by copies of remittances and other
supporting documentation as reasonably required by Sellers;

(b) _Other Patients_. As of the Closing Date, Sellers shall prepare cutoff
billings for all Transition Patients not covered by _Section 10.13(a)_.
Sellers shall be entitled to receive all amounts collected in respect of such
cut-off billings. Buyers shall remit to Sellers any amounts Buyers receive
after the Closing with respect to medical services rendered to such Transition
Patients on or prior to the Closing Date, including any periodic interim
payments or portions thereof applicable to the period on or prior to the
Closing Date; and

(c) _PIP Payments_. The Facilities are reimbursed on an interim basis under
the Medicare program on a pass through interim payment (" _PIP_ ") basis. If
Buyers receive any PIP payments from the Medicare program associated with the
operations of the Facilities relating solely to periods prior to the Closing,
Buyers shall pay Sellers an amount equal to such PIP payment(s) received by
Buyers. If Buyers receive any PIP payments from the Medicare program
associated with the operations of the Facilities relating to periods both
prior to and after the Closing, Buyers shall pay Sellers an amount equal to
the PIP payment(s) actually received by Buyers for such period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which shall be the total number of days through and
including the Closing Date, and the denominator of which shall be the total
number of days

 



58  attributable to such PIP payment(s). If Sellers receives any PIP payments
from the Medicare program associated with the operations of the Facilities
relating solely to periods after the Closing, Sellers shall pay Buyers an
amount equal to such PIP payment(s) received by Sellers. If Sellers receive
any PIP payments from the Medicare program associated with the operations of
the Facilities relating to periods both prior to and after the Closing,
Sellers shall pay Buyers an amount equal to the PIP payment(s) actually
received by Sellers for such period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which shall be the total number of days through and including the Closing
Date, and the denominator of which shall be the total number of days
attributable to such PIP payment(s). Sellers will take appropriate action
prior to Closing to terminate all existing pass through payments to
accommodate the transfer to new Medicare contractors. It is the intent of the
parties that Buyers and Sellers shall receive all third party payments
applicable to the period of time the Facilities are owned by such party.

 

10.14 _HRA Consent_. As to the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities
associated with Houston Rehabilitation Associates, Sellers shall use their
reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of HNMC to (a) the sale of the
Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities owned by Houston Rehabilitation
Associates, or, if HNMC will not consent to such sale, (b) HealthSouths
Affiliates transfer of their general partnership interests in Houston
Rehabilitation Associates to Buyers (the "HRA Consent"). In the event the HRA
Consent is obtained pursuant to the foregoing sub-section (b) on or prior to
the Closing, HealthSouth shall cause its Affiliates, to transfer their general
partnership interest to Buyers pursuant to an assignment of general
partnership interest in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Buyers and Sellers. In the event the HRA Consent is not received on or before
Closing, the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities associated with Houston
Rehabilitation Associates shall not be a part of the Contemplated Transactions
and the Purchase Price shall be reduced in accordance with Section 2.5(c).



     | 11. | INDEMNIFICATION 
---|---|--- 

11.1  _Indemnification by Sellers_.

(a) Subject to _Article 11_ , Sellers, from and after Closing, shall
indemnify and hold harmless Buyers, their Affiliates, and their respective
equity holders, managers, members, officers, directors, principals, attorneys,
agents, employees or other representatives (collectively, "
_Buyers Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all Indemnifiable
Losses that such Buyers Indemnified Party incurs as a result of, or arising
from, (i) the breach of any of the representations or warranties made by
Sellers in this Agreement, (ii) any breach or non-fulfillment of any
covenants or other agreements made by Sellers in this Agreement, (iii) any of
the Excluded Liabilities, and (iv) any fraud, willful misconduct or criminal
acts of Sellers or its officers, directors, members, shareholders, employees,
agents and independent contractors;

(b) Sellers will have no obligation to indemnify the Buyers Indemnified
Parties pursuant to _Section 11.1(a)(i)_ in respect of Indemnifiable Losses
arising from the breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty
described therein unless the aggregate amount of all such Indemnifiable
Losses incurred or suffered by the Buyers

 



59  Indemnified Parties exceeds $700,000, in which event the Buyers Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to seek indemnification under _Section 11.1(a)(i)_
for all claims over $350,000;  _provided,_ _however_ , that the foregoing
limitation will not apply to claims for indemnification pursuant to _Section
11.1(a)(i)_ in respect of breaches of, or inaccuracies in, representations and
warranties set forth in  _Section 4.1_ (Organization; Capacity), _Section
4.2_ (Authorization; Noncontravention), and _Section 4.4_ (Title)
(collectively, " _Sellers Fundamental Representations_ "). For the avoidance
of doubt, claims for indemnification pursuant to _Sections 11.1(a)(ii), (iii)
and (iv)_ are not subject to the monetary limitation set forth above in this
_Section 11.1(b)_; however, such claims shall be subject to
indemnification only when the amount of such claims in the aggregate exceeds
$20,000 at which point the right to be indemnified shall apply to all claims
from the first dollar; and

 

(c) Sellers aggregate liability in respect of claims for indemnification
pursuant to _Sections 11.1(a)(i)_ and _11.1(a)(ii)_ will not exceed an amount
equal to the product of (x) twenty percent (20%) times (y) the Purchase Price
(the " _20% Cap_ ") for its breach of representations, warranties and
covenants other than the Sellers Fundamental Representations; _provided_ ,
_however_ , if any such breach of representation or warranty is specific to a
Facility or fewer than all Facilities, then the foregoing calculations shall
be applied only to the portion of the Purchase Price allocable to such
Facility or Facilities as set forth in _Schedule 2.6_ for purposes of
determining the 20% Cap. Sellers aggregate liability in respect of claims for
indemnification under this Agreement will not exceed an amount equal to the
Purchase Price (the " _Purchase Price Cap_ "), except that Sellers aggregate
liability in respect of claims pursuant to _Section 11.1(a)(iii)_ shall not
be subject to the 20% Cap or the Purchase Price Cap.

(d) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement
with respect to any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant if any
officer, director or equity holder of Buyer or its affiliates had actual
knowledge, at any time prior to the Closing, of such breach or of the events,
circumstances or conditions constituting or resulting in such breach.

(e) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, obligations of Seller
under Section 10.1, 10.2, 10.7 and Section 10.13 shall not be subject to the
monetary limitation set forth in Section 11.1(b) or the 20% Cap or the
Purchase Price Cap in Section 11.1(c).

11.2 _Indemnification by Buyers_.

(a) Subject to this _Article 11_ , Buyers, from and after Closing, shall
indemnify and hold harmless Sellers, their Affiliates, and their respective
officers, directors, equity holders, managers, members, principals, attorneys,
agents, employees or other representatives (collectively, " _Sellers
Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all Indemnifiable Losses
that such Sellers Indemnified Party incurs as a result of, or with respect to
(i) the breach of any of the representations or warranties made by Buyers in
this Agreement, (ii) any breach or non-fulfillment of any of the covenants or
other

 



60  agreements made by Buyers in this Agreement, (iii) any of the Assumed
Liabilities, and (iv) any fraud, willful misconduct or criminal acts of Buyers
or their officers, directors, members, shareholders, employees, agents and
independent contractors;

(b) Buyers will have no obligation to indemnify Sellers Indemnified Parties
pursuant to _Section 11.2(a)(i)_ in respect of Indemnifiable Losses arising
from the breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty described
therein unless the aggregate amount of all such Indemnifiable Losses incurred
or suffered by Sellers Indemnified Parties exceeds $700,000, in which event
the Sellers Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to seek indemnification
under _Sections 11.2(a)(i)_ for all claims over $350,000; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing limitation will not apply to claims for
indemnification pursuant to _Section 11.2(a)(i)_ in respect of breaches of,
or inaccuracies in, representations and warranties set forth in _Section
5.1_ (Organization; Capacity) or _Section 5.2_ (Authority; Noncontravention)
(collectively, " _Buyers Fundamental Representations_ "). For avoidance of
doubt, claims for indemnification pursuant to _Sections 11.2(a)(ii), (iii)
and (iv)_ are not subject to the monetary limitation set forth in this
_Section 11.2(b)_; and

 

(c) Buyers aggregate liability in respect of claims for indemnification
pursuant to  _Section 11.2(a)(i) and (ii)_ will not exceed an amount equal
to the 20% Cap for its breach of representations, warranties and covenants
other than the Buyers Fundamental Representations. Buyers aggregate liability
in respect of claims for indemnification under this Agreement will not exceed
the Purchase Price Cap, except that Buyers aggregate liability in respect of
claims pursuant to _Section 11.2(a)(iii)_ shall not be subject to the 20% Cap
or the Purchase Price Cap.

(d) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, obligations of Buyer
under  _Section 10.1, 10.2_ and _Section 10.13_ shall not be subject to the
monetary limitation set forth in _Section 11.2(b)_ or the 20% Cap or the
Purchase Price Cap in _Section 11.2(c)_.

 

11.3 _Determination of Losses_.

(a) The amount of any Indemnifiable Losses shall be reduced or reimbursed, as
the case may be, by any amount received by Buyers Indemnified Parties or
Sellers Indemnified Parties, as applicable, with respect thereto under any
insurance coverage or from any other party alleged to be responsible therefor.
Buyers Indemnified Parties and Sellers Indemnified Parties, as applicable,
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available
under such insurance coverage and from such other party alleged to have
responsibility. If a Buyers Indemnified Party or Sellers Indemnified Party, as
applicable, receives an amount under insurance coverage or from such other
party with respect to Indemnifiable Losses at any time subsequent to any
indemnification provided by Sellers pursuant to _Section 11.1_ or by Buyers
pursuant to _Section 11.2_, then such Buyers Indemnified Party or Sellers
Indemnified Party, as applicable, shall promptly reimburse Sellers or Buyers,
as applicable, for any payment made or expense incurred by such Person in
connection with providing such indemnification up to such amount received
(less any costs or expenses incurred in recovering such amounts) by the
Buyers Indemnified Party or Sellers Indemnified Party, as applicable;

 



61 (b) For purposes of calculating the amount of Indemnifiable Losses to which a
Buyers Indemnified Party or Sellers Indemnified Party is entitled under this
_Article 11_ , the terms "material," "materiality," and similar qualifiers,
modifiers or limitations (including monetary values and qualifiers as to
"knowledge") shall be disregarded; and

(c) Any Indemnifiable Losses for which Buyers Indemnified Parties or Sellers
Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification under _Section 11.1_ or
_Section 11.2_, as applicable, shall be determined without duplication of
recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such Indemnifiable
Losses constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty or
covenant. No Buyers Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification
under this Agreement for any Indemnifiable Losses arising from a breach of
any representation, warranty or covenant set forth herein (and the amount of
any Indemnifiable Losses incurred in respect of such breach shall not be
included in the calculation of any limitations on indemnification set
forth herein) to the extent such Indemnifiable Losses were already taken into
account in calculating the Final Net Working Capital and Indebtedness
Adjustment Amount.

11.4 _Notice and Procedure_. All claims for indemnification by any Person
against whom claims of indemnification are being asserted (an " _Indemnifying
Party_ ") under any provision of _Article 11_ hereof shall be asserted and
resolved as follows:

(a) In the event of any claim or demand for which an Indemnifying Party would
be liable for Losses to a Person claiming indemnification (an " _Indemnified
Party_ ") under any provision of _Article 11_ is asserted against or sought to
be collected from such Indemnified Party by a Person other than Buyers or
Sellers or any Affiliate thereof (" _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified
Party shall deliver a Claim Notice with reasonable promptness to the
Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to provide the
Indemnifying Party with the Claim Notice required by the preceding sentence
within a reasonable period after the Indemnified Party receives notice of such
Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be obligated to indemnify
the Indemnified Party to the extent that the Indemnifying Partys ability to
defend has been irreparably prejudiced by such failure of notice by the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party will notify the Indemnified Party
within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt of the Claim Notice (" _Notice
Period_ ") whether the Indemnifying Party desires, at the sole cost and
expense of the Indemnifying Party, to defend the Indemnified Party
against such Third Party Claim;

(b) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the
Notice Period that the Indemnifying Party desires to defend the Indemnified
Party with respect to the Third Party Claim pursuant to this _Section
11.4(b)_, then the Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend, at its
sole cost and expense, such Third Party Claim by all appropriate proceedings,
which proceedings will be diligently prosecuted by the Indemnifying Party to a
final conclusion or will be settled at the discretion of the Indemnifying
Party (with the consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld). Assumption by the Indemnifying Party of the defense of
such Third Party Claim constitutes an admission by the Indemnifying Party that
the litigation is one for which the Indemnifying Party is required to
indemnify the Indemnified Party

 



62  under this _Article 11_. The Indemnifying Party will have full control of
such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof;
provided, however, that the Indemnified Party may, at the sole cost and
expense of the Indemnifying Party, file during the Notice Period any motion,
answer, or other pleadings that the Indemnified Party may deem necessary or
appropriate to protect its interests and that is not irrevocably prejudicial
to the Indemnifying Party (it being understood and agreed that, except as
provided in _Section 11.4(c)_ hereof, if an Indemnified Party takes any such
action that is irrevocably prejudicial and conclusively causes a final
adjudication that is materially adverse to the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnifying Party will be relieved of its obligations hereunder with respect
to the portion of such Third Party Claim prejudiced by the Indemnified Partys
action); and provided further, that if requested by the Indemnifying Party,
the Indemnified Party agrees, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying
Party, to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting
any Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party elects to contest, or, if
appropriate in the judgment of the Indemnified Party and related to the Third
Party Claim in question, in making any counterclaim against the Person
asserting the Third Party Claim or any cross-complaint against any Person
(other than the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates). The Indemnified
Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any
Third Party Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
_Section 11.4(b)_, and except as provided in the preceding sentence, the
Indemnified Party will bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such
participation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Indemnifying Party may
not assume the defense if the named parties to the Third Party Claim
(including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Party and any
Indemnified Party and representation of both such parties by the same counsel
would be inappropriate due to an actual or potential differing interests
between them, in which case any Indemnified Party shall have the right to
defend the Third Party Claim and to employ counsel at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party; (ii) if there is a reasonable probability that a Third
Party claim may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Party and such
damage will either be irreparable, or not compensable by money payments, or if
compensable by money damages, such money damages will be difficult or
impossible to calculate, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, at the
cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to defend, compromise and settle
such claim; and (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written
consent of the Indemnified Party, settle or compromise any Third Party claim
or consent to the entry of any judgment which does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant to the Indemnified Party
of a release from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim;

(c) If the Indemnifying Party fails to notify the Indemnified Party within
the Notice Period that the Indemnifying Party desires to defend the
Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Article 11_ , or if the Indemnifying Party
gives such notice but fails to prosecute diligently or settle the Third Party
Claim, or if the Indemnifying Party fails to give any notice whatsoever within
the Notice Period, then the Indemnified Party will have the right (but not the
obligation) to defend, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying
Party, the Third Party Claim by all appropriate proceedings, which
proceedings will be promptly and vigorously prosecuted by the Indemnified
Party to a final conclusion or will be settled at the discretion of the
Indemnified Party. The 

 



63  Indemnified Party will have full control of such defense and proceedings,
including any compromise or settlement thereof; provided, however, that if
requested by the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party agrees, at the
sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to cooperate with the
Indemnified Party and its counsel in contesting any Third Party Claim which
the Indemnified Party is contesting, or, if appropriate and relating to the
Third Party Claim in question, in making any counterclaim against the Person
asserting the Third Party Claim, or any cross-complaint against any Person
(other than the Indemnifying Party or any of its affiliates). Notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of this _Section 11.4(c)_, if the Indemnifying
Party has notified the Indemnified Party with reasonable promptness that the
Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party with
respect to such Third Party Claim and if such dispute is resolved in favor of
the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party will not be required to bear
the costs and expenses of the Indemnified Partys defense pursuant to this
_Section 11.4(c)_ or of the Indemnifying Partys participation therein at
the Indemnified Partys request, and the Indemnified Party will reimburse the
Indemnifying Party in full for all costs and expenses incurred by the
Indemnifying Party in connection with such litigation. The Indemnifying Party
may participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement controlled by
the Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section 11.4(c)_, but the
Indemnifying Party will bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such
participation;

(d) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim for which
an Indemnifying Party would be liable for Indemnifiable Losses hereunder that
does not involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be
collected from the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall deliver an
Indemnity Notice (as hereinafter defined) with reasonable promptness to the
Indemnifying Party. The failure by any Indemnified Party to give the notice
referred to in the preceding sentence shall not impair such partys rights
hereunder except to the extent that an Indemnifying Party is reasonably
likely to be prejudiced thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein
shall extend the requirement to assert claims within the applicable Survival
Period;

 

(e) If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within
thirty (30) days following its receipt of a Claim Notice or an Indemnity
Notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified
Party hereunder, such claim specified by the Indemnified Party will be
conclusively deemed an indemnification liability of the Indemnifying Party
hereunder and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such liability to
the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days following its receipt of a Claim
Notice or an Indemnity Notice, or on such later date (i) in the case of a
Third Party Claim, as the Indemnified Party suffers Losses in respect of such
Third Party Claim, or (ii) in the case of an Indemnity Notice in which the
amount of the claim is estimated, promptly after the amount of such
claim becomes finally determined. If the Indemnifying Party has timely
disputed its liability with respect to such claim, as provided above, the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party agree to proceed in good faith to
negotiate a resolution of such dispute within sixty (60) days following
receipt of a Claim Notice or an Indemnity Notice. If the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party fail to negotiate a resolution within such sixty
(60) day period, the parties may seek any remedies available at law or in
equity. In the event the Indemnified Party is not paid in full for its claim
in a timely manner after the Indemnifying Partys

 



64  obligation to indemnify has been determined in accordance herewith, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right, notwithstanding any other rights that
it may have against the Indemnifying Party, to set-off the unpaid amount of
any such claim against any amounts owed by it to the Indemnifying Party;

 

(f) The term " _Claim Notice_ " shall mean written notification of a Third
Party Claim by an Indemnified Party to an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
_Article 11_ , enclosing a copy of all papers served, if any, and specifying
the nature of and alleged basis for such Third Party Claim and, to the extent
then feasible, the alleged amount or the estimated amount of such Third Party
Claim;

(g) The term " _Indemnity Notice_ " shall mean written notification of a
claim for indemnity under this _Article 11_ which claim does not involve a
Third Party Claim by an Indemnified Party to an Indemnifying Party, specifying
the nature of and specific basis for such claim and, to the extent then
feasible, the amount or the estimated amount of such claim; and

(h) Any estimated amount of a claim submitted in a Claim Notice or an
Indemnity Notice shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such claim.

11.5 _Survival_.

(a) Except as otherwise provided below, the representations, warranties and
covenants contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement shall survive for a
period of eighteen (18) months from and after the Closing Date, except for (i)
the Sellers Fundamental Representations, (ii) the Buyers Fundamental
Representations (iii) the representations, warranties and covenants set forth
in _Section 3.4_, _Section 4.10_, _Section 4.12_, _Section 4.22_, and 
_Section 4.25_, each of which shall survive until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations, including any applicable tolling period,
and (iv) the covenants set forth in _Article 10_ , which by their terms
require performance beyond 18 months, which shall survive for such required
period (each of the periods described above, a " _Survival Period_ ");

(b) All claims for indemnification by Buyers Indemnified Parties or Sellers
Indemnified Parties under _Section 11.1(a)(i)_ or _Section 11.2(a)(i)_, as
applicable, must be made on or before the end of the applicable Survival
Period. No indemnification shall be payable to Buyers Indemnified Parties or
Sellers Indemnified Parties with respect to any such claims asserted by such
parties after the end of the applicable Survival Period, regardless of when
any such claim accrued or the circumstances that resulted in the claim being
asserted after the applicable Survival Period were discovered by a party. In
the event any such claim has been properly made on or prior to the end of the
applicable Survival Period, and such claim is unresolved as of the end of the
applicable Survival Period, then the right to indemnification with respect to
such claim shall remain in effect until such matter shall have been
finally determined; and

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, neither _Section 11.5(a)_ nor  _Section
11.5(b)_ shall affect any rights to bring claims after the end of a Survival
Period based on (a) the obligations of Sellers under _Sections 11.1(a)(iii)
or (iv)_ or (b) the obligations of Buyers under  _Sections 11.2(a)(iii) or
(iv)_.

 



65 11.6 _Treatment of Payments_. All payments made pursuant to this _Article 11_
shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price.

11.7 _Remedies Exclusive_. From and after the Closing, the rights of the
parties hereto and any other Indemnified Parties to indemnification or
remedies relating to this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions shall be
strictly limited to those contained in this _Article 11_ , and
such indemnification rights shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the
parties hereto and the Indemnified Parties subsequent to the Closing Date with
respect to any matter in any way relating to this Agreement or its subject
matter or arising in connection herewith, excluding fraud and excluding any
injunctive relief provided for herein. To the maximum extent permitted by law
and except as otherwise provided herein, the parties hereto and the
Indemnified Parties hereby waive all other rights and remedies with respect
to any matter arising after Closing in any way relating to this Agreement or
arising in connection herewith, whether under common law, in equity or
otherwise. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained herein shall give rise to any
right on the part of any party after the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby. For avoidance of doubt, none of the foregoing shall
alter or modify the remedies available pursuant to _Section 9.2_ for any
breach of this Agreement that occurs prior to the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions and that results in a termination of this
Agreement.

11.8 _Mitigation_. An Indemnified Party shall take all reasonable steps to
mitigate all liabilities and claims. Each party shall act in a commercially
reasonable manner in addressing any liabilities that may provide the basis for
an indemnifiable claim (that is, each party shall respond to such
liability substantially in the same manner that it would respond to such
liability in the absence of the indemnification provided for in this
Agreement).

12.8_ hereof, be reproduced by Sellers and by Buyers by any photographic,
photostatic, microfilm, micro-card, miniature photographic or other similar
process and Sellers and Buyers may destroy any original documents so
reproduced. Sellers and Buyers agree and stipulate that any such reproduction
shall be admissible in evidence as the original itself in any 

 



67  judicial, arbitral or administrative Proceeding (whether or not the original
is in existence and whether or not such reproduction was made by Sellers or
Buyers in the regular course of business) and that any enlargement, facsimile
or further reproduction of such reproduction shall likewise be admissible in
evidence.

 

12.6 _Cost of Transaction_. Except as otherwise provided herein, the parties
agree as follows:

 

(a) whether or not the Contemplated Transactions shall be consummated, Sellers
will pay the fees, expenses and disbursements of Sellers and their agents,
representatives, accountants, and counsel incurred in connection with the
subject matter hereof and any amendments hereto;

 

(b) whether or not the Contemplated Transactions shall be consummated, Buyers
will pay the fees, expenses and disbursements of Buyers and their agents,
representatives, accountants, and counsel incurred in connection with the
subject matter hereof and any amendments hereto; and

 

(c) the (i) Transfer Taxes, (ii) Environmental Survey Costs, (iii) HSR Costs,
(iv) Title Policy Costs, and (v) Survey Costs shall be borne equally by
Sellers and Buyers; provided, however, that Sellers shall not be required to
pay more than $22,500 for Sellers share of the cost of any endorsements to
the Title Policy.

 

12.7 _Confidentiality_. It is understood by the parties hereto that the
Confidentiality Agreement dated as of November 8, 2010 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between HealthSouth and LifeCare, will survive
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and that the information,
documents and instruments delivered to Buyers by Sellers or Sellers agents
and the information, documents and instruments delivered to Sellers by Buyers
or Buyers agents are "Confidential Information" (as defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement). Each of the parties hereto agrees that both prior
and subsequent to the Closing they will maintain the confidentiality of all
such Confidential Information delivered to it by the other party hereto or its
agents in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or in
compliance with the terms, conditions and covenants of the Confidentiality
Agreement. This _Section 12.8_ shall not prohibit the disclosure by Buyers or
Sellers of any information, instruments or documents that are required to be
filed with Governmental Authorities by Sellers or Buyers under applicable
securities related Laws or in connection with the regulatory filings,
applications and notifications necessary or appropriate in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions. In addition, either party may disclose
Confidential Information received from the other party in an action or
Proceeding brought by a party hereto in pursuit of its rights or in exercise
of its remedies hereunder. Sellers intend to maintain materials disclosed in
the medical staff records as Confidential Information and do not waive the
peer review privilege.

12.8  _Press Release_. Except as required by Law, at all times at or before
Closing, neither Sellers nor Buyers will issue any report, statement or
release to the public with respect to this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions without the prior written approval of the other party hereto of
the text of any such public report, statement or release. A public
announcement, press release or similar publicity with respect to this
Agreement, or the transactions contemplated 

 



68  herein, will be issued within five (5) calendar days of the execution of
this Agreement in such manner as Buyers and Sellers mutually determine.
Sellers and Buyers will consult with each other concerning the means by which
Sellers employees, customers, suppliers and others having dealings with
Sellers will be informed of the transactions contemplated herein, and Buyers
will have the right to be present for any such communication.

12.9 _Waiver of Breach_. The waiver by either party of breach or violation of
any provision of this Agreement shall not operate as, or be construed to
constitute, a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or other provision
hereof.

12.10 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future law, and if the
rights or obligations of Buyers or Sellers under this Agreement will not be
materially and adversely affected thereby, (a) such provision will be fully
severable; (b) this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part
hereof; (c) the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full
force and effect and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision or by its severance here from; and (d) in lieu of
such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there will be added
automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable
provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision as may be possible. 

12.11 _No Inferences_. Inasmuch as this Agreement is the result of
negotiations between sophisticated parties of equal bargaining power
represented by counsel, no inference in favor of, or against, either party
shall be drawn from the fact that any portion of this Agreement has been
drafted by or on behalf of such party.

 

12.12 _Divisions and Headings of this Agreement_. The divisions of this
Agreement into sections and subsections and the use of captions and headings
in connection therewith are solely for convenience and shall have no legal
effect in construing the provisions of this Agreement.

12.13 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. The terms and provisions of this
Agreement are intended solely for the benefit of Buyers, Sellers, Sellers
Indemnified Parties with respect to _Article 11_ , Buyers Indemnified Parties
with respect to _Article 11_ and, in each instance, their respective permitted
successors or assigns, and it is not the intention of the parties to confer,
and this Agreement shall not confer, third-party beneficiary rights upon any
other Person.

12.14 _Tax and Medicare Advice and Reliance_. Except as expressly provided in
this Agreement, none of the parties (nor any of the parties respective
counsel, accountants or other representatives) has made or is making any
representations to any other party (or to any other partys counsel,
accountants or other representatives) concerning the consequences of the
Contemplated Transactions under applicable Tax-related Laws or under the Laws
governing the Medicare program. Each party has relied solely upon the Tax and
Medicare advice of its own employees or of representatives engaged by such
party and not on any such advice provided by any other party hereto.

 



69 12.15 _Entire Agreement; Amendment_. This Agreement supersedes all
previous agreements among the parties (other than the Confidentiality
Agreement and that certain Reimbursement Agreement dated as of April 14, 2011
(the " _Reimbursement Agreement"_ ), by and between HealthSouth and LifeCare)
and constitutes the entire agreement of whatsoever kind or nature existing
between or among the parties representing the within subject matter and no
party shall be entitled to benefits other than those specified herein. As
between or among the parties, no oral statements or prior written material
not specifically incorporated herein shall be of any force and effect. The
parties specifically acknowledge that in entering into and executing this
Agreement, the parties rely solely upon the representations and agreements
contained in this Agreement and no others. All prior agreements, except for
the Confidentiality Agreement and the Reimbursement Agreement, whether written
or verbal, not expressly incorporated herein are superseded. No changes in or
additions to this Agreement shall be recognized unless and until made in
writing and signed by all parties hereto.

12.16 _Multiple Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each and all of which shall be deemed an original and all of
which together shall constitute but one and the same instrument. The
facsimile signature of any party to this Agreement or any agreement or
certificate delivered in connection with the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions or a PDF copy of the signature of any party to this Agreement or
any agreement or certificate delivered in connection with the consummation of
the Contemplated Transactions delivered by electronic mail for purposes of
execution or otherwise, is to be considered to have the same binding effect as
the delivery of an original signature on an original contract.

12.17 _Knowledge_. Whenever any statement herein or in any schedule, exhibit,
certificate or other documents delivered to Buyers pursuant to this Agreement
is made "to Sellers knowledge" (or with words of similar intent or effect),
the applicable portion of such statement, schedule, exhibit, certificate or
other document shall refer to the following: (i) matters actually known to any
of Seller Knowledge Persons and (ii) matters which any of Seller Knowledge
Persons should reasonably be expected to know or discover in the course of a
reasonably comprehensive investigation concerning the existence of such facts
or information and assuming the existence of reasonable internal controls.

12.18 _Owners of Purchased Assets_. Notwithstanding any other provision
herein, Buyers agree that the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of each Seller, other than HealthSouth, contained herein are made
only with respect to the Purchased Assets owned by such Seller.

12.19 _Mutual Drafting_. The parties hereto are sophisticated and have been
represented by attorneys throughout the Contemplated Transactions who have
carefully negotiated the provisions hereof. As a consequence, the parties do
not intend that the presumptions of laws or rules relating to the
interpretation of contracts against the drafter of any particular clause
should be applied to this Agreement or any agreement or instrument executed in
connection herewith, and therefore waive their effects.

 



70 12.20 _Disclosure Schedules_.

 

(a) Any disclosure made in one of the Schedules with respect to any Section of
this Agreement shall be deemed only to qualify (i) such denoted Section and
(ii) any other Section to the extent that it should be reasonably obvious to
the recipient party from such description that the matter so described also
relates to such other Section(s). Disclosure of any matter in the Schedules
shall not constitute an expression of a view that such matter is material or
is required to be disclosed pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(b) To the extent that any representation or warranty set forth in this
Agreement is qualified by the materiality of the matter(s) to which the
representation or warranty relates, the inclusion of any matter in the
Schedules does not constitute a determination by Sellers that any such matter
is material. The disclosure of any matter in the Schedules does not imply
that any other, undisclosed matter that has a greater significance or value is
material.

12.21 _Conveyance of Certain Purchased Assets_. Upon the written request of
Buyers, and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at Closing
Sellers shall transfer and convey title to some or all of the Owned Real
Property designated by Buyers directly to one or more Persons designated by
Buyers.
