 **STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT**

 



 

 **THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT** (this " ** _Agreement_** ") is entered into
as of April 18, 2018 (the " ** _Execution Date_** "), by and among Nova Global
Supply and Services, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the " **
_Purchaser_** "), Cubic Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the " **
_Seller_** "), and Cubic Global Defense, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Seller (the " ** _Company_** ").

 



 

 **RECITALS**

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , as of the Execution Date, the Seller owns all of the issued and
outstanding stock of the Company and Omega Training Group, Inc., a Georgia
corporation (" ** _Omega_** "; with the Company, each a " ** _Company
Entity_** " and collectively the " ** _Company Entities_** ");

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , the Seller desires to sell and convey all of the issued and
outstanding stock of the Company Entities (the " ** _Shares_** ") to the
Purchaser, and the Purchaser desires to purchase all of the Shares from the
Seller, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

 



 

 **AGREEMENT**

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the covenants and agreements set
forth herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as
follows:

 



 

 **1.** **PURCHASE PRICE; CLOSING**

 



 

1.1 _Purchase and Sale of Stock; Payment of Closing Purchase Price_. At the
Closing and upon all of the terms and subject to all of the conditions of this
Agreement, the Seller will sell, transfer, assign and convey to the Purchaser,
and the Purchaser will purchase and accept from the Seller, the Shares. At the
Closing, in full payment for the Shares, the Purchaser will pay to the Seller,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds the sum of One Hundred Thirty-
Five Million Dollars ($135,000,000) (" ** _Base Purchase Price_** "), as
adjusted pursuant to _Section 1.4(a)_ on account of Net Working Capital,
_minus_ :

 



 

(a) the amount of the outstanding Indebtedness, if any, as of 11:59 p.m.
Eastern Time on the day preceding the Closing Date (the " ** _Calculation
Time_** ");

 



 

(b) the amount of the unpaid Company Transaction Expenses as of the
Calculation Time;

 



 

(c) the aggregate amount of the Closing Bonus Payments (and the amount of the
Companys portion of the payroll taxes) as of the Calculation Time; and

 



 

(d) any Working Capital Excess Amount, determined in accordance with _Section
1.3(c)_.

      
 

 



 

The amount so payable to the Seller at the Closing and adjusted pursuant to
_Section 1.4(a)_ is referred to as the " ** _Closing Purchase Price_** " and
the Closing Purchase Price, as further adjusted pursuant to _Section 1.4(b)_
and _Section 1.7_ is referred to as the " ** _Purchase Price_** ".

 



 

1.2 _Closing Payments_. At the Closing, the Purchaser will pay:

 



 

(a) the amount of the outstanding Indebtedness (if any) to the Persons and in
the amounts set forth in the Flow of Funds Memorandum;

 



 

(b) the amount of the unpaid Company Transaction Expenses, if any, to the
Persons and in the amounts set forth in the Flow of Funds Memorandum;

 



 

(c) the aggregate amount of the Closing Bonus Payments (and the amount of the
Companys portion of the payroll taxes as of the Calculation Time with respect
thereto) to the Company which Closing Bonus Payments shall be paid by the
Company to each recipient thereof, no later than the first payroll period
immediately following the Closing Date and which payroll taxes will be paid by
the Company as required by Law; and

 



 

(d) the Closing Purchase Price to the Seller.

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, the Company, the Purchaser and the Seller agree
that to the extent allowed under applicable Law, the Closing Bonus Payments
incurred on the Closing Date will be deemed to have been contributed to the
Company by the Purchaser and made by the Company after the Closing, such that
such payments will be deemed, to the fullest extent allowable by applicable
Laws, to be a Tax deductible expense of the Company for the Tax period
following the Closing Date.

 



 

1.3 _Flow of Funds Memorandum_.

 



 

(a) _Delivery of Flow of Funds Memorandum_. Not later than five (5) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall prepare and deliver to the
Purchaser a flow of funds memorandum containing the Companys good faith
estimate (including all calculations in reasonable detail) of: (a) the
Estimated Net Working Capital in accordance with _Section 1.4(a)_ ; (b) the
amount that Indebtedness will be as of the Calculation Time (the " **
_Estimated Company Indebtedness_** "); (c) the amount of unpaid Company
Transaction Expenses as of the Calculation Time (" ** _Estimated Company
Transaction Expenses_** "); (d) the amount of the Closing Bonus Payments
(including the amount of the Companys portion of the payroll taxes, the " **
_Estimated Closing Bonus Payments_** "); and (e) the amount of the Closing
Purchase Price (such statement as may be adjusted pursuant to _Section 1.3(b)_
, the " ** _Flow of Funds Memorandum_** "). These calculations will be used in
connection with the payments described in _Section 1.1_ and _Section 1.2_. The
Flow of Funds Memorandum also will contain wire instructions for all of the
foregoing payments (or instructions to pay certain amounts by check).

 



 

(b) _Review and Adjustment of Flow of Funds Memorandum_. The Seller and the
Company shall consult the Purchaser in connection with its preparation of the
Flow of Funds Memorandum and the Company shall provide the Purchaser and its
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours upon
reasonable advance notice to all the properties, books, records, contracts,
documents, information, personnel and representatives relevant to the review

 



      
 

 



 

or preparation of the Flow of Funds Memorandum and to the determination of its
components. If the Purchaser objects to any amounts set forth in the Flow of
Funds Memorandum, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Company no later than
12:00 noon Eastern Time on the Business Day that is two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, a written statement in reasonable detail describing
the Purchasers good faith objections thereto, and its own determinations of
the applicable amounts. The Purchaser and the Company shall in good faith
attempt to resolve any of the Purchasers objections as set forth in the
notice from the Purchaser, and the Company shall make such revisions to the
disputed items as may be mutually agreed between the Company and the
Purchaser. In the event that the Company and the Purchaser fail to agree on
the resolution of any of the Purchasers objections by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time
on the Business Day that is one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing Date,
the amounts set forth in the Flow of Funds Memorandum prepared by the Seller
shall be conclusive and binding upon the Purchaser solely for the purposes of
determining the amounts payable at Closing.

 



 

(c) _Adjustment for Excess Estimated Working Capital_. In the event the
Estimated Net Working Capital as set forth in the Flow of Funds Memorandum as
determined in accordance with _Section 1.3(b)_ , exceeds $51,000,000, then any
such excess (the " ** _Working Capital Excess Amount_** ") shall not be paid
to Seller at Closing, but shall become due and payable by the Purchaser to the
Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, upon the earlier of
(i) the time that any amount becomes due and payable to Purchaser or Seller
pursuant to _Section 1.4(b)(ii)_ , and (ii) the date, following the Closing,
that the Company Entities have collected aggregate accounts receivable from
the Closing equal to such Working Capital Excess Amount. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the Working Capital Excess Amount would become payable pursuant
to subclause (i) of the immediately preceding sentence, such Working Capital
Excess Amount shall first be (A) increased by the amount by which the Actual
Net Working Capital exceeds $51,000,000, or (B) reduced by the amount by which
$51,000,000 exceeds the Actual Net Working Capital.

 



 

1.4 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) _Preliminary Purchase Price Adjustment_. Not later than three (3) days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company will deliver to the Purchaser a
statement setting forth the Companys good faith estimate (the " ** _Estimated
Net Working Capital_** ") of the Net Working Capital of the Company Entities
as of the Effective Time, together with an estimated unaudited balance sheet
of the Company Entities as of the Effective Time (the " ** _Estimated Closing
Date Balance Sheet_** "). The Base Purchase Price will be adjusted by the
difference between the Estimated Net Working Capital and the Target Net
Working Capital as follows: (i) if the Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds
the Target Net Working Capital, the Closing Purchase Price will be increased
dollar-for-dollar by the amount of such excess; and (ii) if the Estimated Net
Working Capital is less than the Target Net Working Capital, the Base Purchase
Price will be decreased dollar-for-dollar by the amount of such shortfall. The
Base Purchase Price will thereafter be subject to further adjustment as
provided in _Section 1.4(b)_.

 



 

(b) _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 



 

(i) _Calculation of Adjustment_. The Closing Purchase Price, as adjusted
pursuant to _Section 1.4(a)_ will be: (A) increased dollar-for-dollar by the
amount that the Actual Net Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Net Working
Capital

 



      
 

 



 

or decreased dollar-for-dollar by the amount that the Actual Net Working
Capital is less than the Estimated Net Working Capital, determined in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Section 1.4(b)_ , (B)
increased dollar-for-dollar by the amount that the Estimated Company
Indebtedness exceeds the Actual Indebtedness or decreased dollar-for-dollar by
the amount that the Actual Indebtedness exceeds the Estimated Company
Indebtedness, determined in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
_Section 1.4(b)_ , (C) increased dollar-for-dollar by the amount that the
Estimated Company Transaction Expenses exceeds the Actual Company Transaction
Expenses or decreased dollar-for-dollar by the amount that the Actual Company
Transaction Expenses exceeds the Estimated Company Transaction Expenses
determined in accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Section
1.4(b)_ , and (D) increased dollar-for-dollar by the amount that the Estimated
Closing Bonus Payments exceeds the Actual Closing Bonus Payments or decreased
dollar-for-dollar by the amount that the Actual Closing Bonus Payments exceeds
the Estimated Closing Bonus Payments determined in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this _Section 1.4(b)_. Any payment owed pursuant to
this _Section 1.4(b)(i)_ will be paid within five (5) Business Days after the
Final Closing Statement is agreed to by the Seller and the Purchaser or is
determined by the Neutral Auditor in accordance with _Section 1.4(b)(iv)_ or
is deemed final pursuant to the last sentence of _Section 1.4(b)(ii)_. If such
amount is not timely paid in accordance with this _Section 1.4(b)(i)_ , then
such amount shall bear interest at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum
from the date such amount is due hereunder until paid in full.

 



 

(1) If the sum of the adjustments calculated in accordance with _Section
1.4(b)_ is positive, then the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller an amount
equal to such sum by wire transfer of immediately available funds, no later
than five (5) Business Days following the Purchasers receipt of written wire
instructions from the Seller.

 



 

(2) If the sum of the adjustments calculated in accordance with _Section
1.4(b)_ is negative, then the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser the amount of
such sum, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, no later than five
(5) Business Days following the Sellers receipt of written wire instructions
from the Purchaser.

 



 

(ii) _Preparation of Closing Date Balance Sheet_. As soon as practicable, and
in any event within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser will
prepare and deliver to the Seller a balance sheet of the Company Entities as
of the Effective Time (the " ** _Closing Date Balance Sheet_** ") and a
statement of the Purchasers determination of (a) the Actual Net Working
Capital, (b) the amount of the outstanding Actual Indebtedness (if any), (c)
the amount of the unpaid Actual Company Transaction Expenses, if any, (d) the
aggregate amount of the Actual Closing Bonus Payments (including the amount of
the Companys portion of the payroll taxes), in each case as of the Effective
Time, and (e) the amount of the Closing Purchase Price calculated therefrom
(such statement, the " ** _Closing Statement_** "). The calculation of Actual
Net Working Capital will be prepared applying the definition of Net Working
Capital contained herein. " ** _Actual Net Working Capital_** " means the
final amount of Net Working Capital on the Final Closing Statement determined
pursuant to _Section 1.4(b)(iii)_ or

 



      
 

 



 

 _1.4(b)(iv)_. " ** _Actual Indebtedness_** " means the final amount of
Indebtedness of the Company Entities on the Final Closing Statement determined
pursuant to _Section 1.4(b)(iii)_ or _1.4(b)(iv)_. " ** _Actual Company
Transaction Expenses_** " means the final amount of unpaid Company Transaction
Expenses on the Final Closing Statement determined pursuant to _Section
1.4(b)(iii)_ or _1.4(b)(iv)_. " ** _Actual Closing Bonus Payments_** " means
the final amount of Closing Bonus Payments (including the amount of the
Companys portion of the payroll taxes) on the Final Closing Statement
determined pursuant to _Section 1.4(b)(iii)_ or _1.4(b)(iv)_. If the Purchaser
fails to deliver the Closing Statement to the Seller within the sixty (60) day
period specified in this _Section 1.4(b)(ii)_ , at the Sellers sole election
and discretion, the Purchaser shall be deemed to have accepted the Flow of
Funds Memorandum as final; the Seller shall have the option to otherwise
enforce its rights and remedies under this Agreement with respect to the
Purchasers failure to timely deliver the Closing Statement to the Seller.

 



 

(iii) _Review and Resolution Period_. After receipt of the Closing Statement,
the Seller shall have forty-five (45) days to review it (which period will be
tolled for the Seller due to any lack of access to records caused by the
Purchaser or the Company Entities or any of their respective Representatives).
To the extent reasonably required to complete such review of the Closing
Statement, the Purchaser shall provide the Seller with reasonable access
during normal business hours to all working papers related to the preparation
of the Closing Statement. The Seller will deliver notice to the Purchaser on
or prior to the forty-fifth (45th) day (as tolled) after receipt of the
Closing Statement specifying in reasonable detail all disputed items with
respect to the Closing Statement and the basis therefor. If the Seller fails
to deliver such notice in such forty-five (45) day (as tolled) period, the
Seller will be deemed to have waived its right to contest the Closing
Statement. If the Seller notifies the Purchaser of any objections to the
Closing Statement in such forty-five (45) day (as tolled) period, the parties
shall, within forty-five (45) days following the date of such notice (the " **
_Resolution Period_** "), attempt to resolve their differences and any written
resolution by them as to any disputed amount will be final and binding for all
purposes under this Agreement. If the Seller objects to the calculation of any
component of the Closing Statement in accordance with the foregoing
provisions, the undisputed portion, if any, of the Closing Statement shall be
paid or released in accordance with _Section 1.4(b)(i)_ within five (5)
Business Days of the delivery of the applicable notification by the Seller to
the Purchaser.

 



 

(iv) _Dispute Resolution Procedure_. If at the conclusion of the Resolution
Period the parties have not reached an agreement on any objections with
respect to the Closing Statement, then any party may require the dispute be
resolved by way of the Dispute Resolution Procedure by providing notice to all
parties of such demand. Upon such demand made by a party, the other party
hereto covenants and agrees to jointly submit the matter to the Neutral
Auditor for purposes of the Dispute Resolution Procedure. The term " ** _Final
Closing Statement_** " will mean the definitive Closing Statement agreed to by
the Seller and the Purchaser in accordance with _Section 1.4(b)(iii)_ or the
definitive Closing Statement resulting from the determination made by the
Neutral Auditor in accordance with the Dispute Resolution Procedure.

 



      
 

 



 

1.5 _Form of Payments_. Except as expressly provided herein or mutually agreed
by the Seller and the Purchaser, all payments under this Agreement will be
made by delivery to the recipient by depositing, by wire transfer, the
required amount (in immediately available funds in United States currency) in

in writing at least three (3) Business Days prior to the date of the required
payment.

(a) Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_ ,
the closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " **
_Closing_** ") will take place on the third (3rd) Business Day, or sooner by
mutual agreement of the parties, following the satisfaction of or waiver of
all conditions to, the obligations of the parties to consummate the

original signatures by overnight mail if so requested by either the Seller or
the Purchaser. To the extent permitted by Law and GAAP, for Tax and accounting
purposes, the parties will treat the Closing as being effective at 11:59 p.m.
Eastern Time on the Closing Date (the " ** _Effective Time_** ").

 



 

(b) At the Closing, (i) the Seller or the Company Entities will deliver to the
Purchaser the various certificates, instruments, and documents referred to in
_Section 7.1_ and (ii) the Purchaser will make the payments set forth on the
Flow of Funds Memorandum and deliver to the Company Entities and the Seller
the various certificates, instruments, and documents referred to in _Section
7.2_.

 



 

1.7 _Potential Earnout Payment_.

Periods (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Tax liabilities incurred due
to income inclusions in a Pre-Closing Tax Period, but which are payable in a
post-Closing Tax Period) and shall not apply in any respect to Taxes and

(a) _Schedule 3.17(a)_ contains a true and complete list of all employee
benefit plans, programs, or arrangements (within the meaning of Section 3(3)
of ERISA, whether written or unwritten, formal or informal), and any equity
incentive plans, deferred compensation arrangements, bonus compensation plans
or policies, severance pay, disability, vacation and sick leave benefits and
any similar plans, programs and arrangements that are available to and for the
benefit of employees of the Company Entities (whether written or unwritten,
formal or informal) that are maintained or sponsored by any Company Entity, or
with respect to which any Company Entity has any material liability following
the Closing and that is not a Multiemployer Plan (collectively, the " **
_Benefit Plans_** "). With respect to any Benefit Plan, no Claims (other than
routine claims for benefits in the Ordinary Course of Business) are pending
or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened in writing. With respect to each
Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified within the meaning of Code
Section 401(a), such Benefit Plan has received, or is entitled to rely upon, a
favorable determination or opinion letter as to its qualification. Each
Benefit Plan has been operated in compliance with its terms and with the
requirements of all applicable Laws, except to the extent such non-compliance
would not reasonably be expected to affect the qualified status of any Benefit
Plan or give rise to a material liability to any of the Company Entities.

 



 

(b) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.17(b)_ , at no time during the past six
(6) years has the Company or any member of its "Controlled Group" (defined as
any organization which is a member of a controlled group of organizations

any time) maintained, sponsored or contributed to, or been obligated to
contribute to any Benefit Plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code or to any Multiemployer Plan. No event has occurred
and no condition exists with respect to a Benefit Plan that could result in a
material Tax, Lien, or other liability imposed by ERISA, the Code or other
Laws on the Company Entities. The Company Entities do not maintain and have no
liability with respect to retiree life or retiree health insurance plans that
provide for benefits or coverage for any participant or any beneficiary of a
participant following termination of employment except as may be required
under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended
(" ** _COBRA_** ") or at the sole expense of the participant or any
participants beneficiary. With respect to any Multiemployer Plan, (i) neither
Seller nor any member of its Controlled Group has incurred any withdrawal
liability, which has not been satisfied; (ii) the Seller has timely made all
contributions required by the terms of any Multiemployer Plan; (iii) to the
Companys Knowledge, no such plan is in reorganization, within the meaning of
Section 4241 of ERISA or is in "critical status"; (iv) to the Companys
Knowledge, no such plan is or is reasonably expected to become insolvent,
within the meaning of Section 4245 of ERISA; (v) to the Companys Knowledge,
no such plan is in the process of terminating, or is a party to any pending
merger or transfer of assets or liabilities; (vi) to the Companys Knowledge,
no such plan has incurred any liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation (other than premiums not yet due) that has not been satisfied. The
Sellers purposes for engaging in the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are not for evasion of liability under Section 4069 and/or 4212 of
ERISA.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) All required contributions to, and premium payments on account of, each
Benefit Plan have been made on a timely basis.

 



 

(d) Each Benefit Plan that is subject to Section 409A of the Code has been
administered in compliance in all material respects with its terms and the
operational and documentary requirements of Section 409A of the Code and all
applicable regulatory guidance (including notices, rulings and proposed and
final regulations) thereunder. No Company Entity has any obligation to gross
up, indemnify or otherwise reimburse any individual for any excise taxes,
interest or penalties incurred pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.

 



 

(e) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.17(e)_ , no Company Entity has any
commitment or obligation or has made any representations to any employee,
officer, director, manager, independent contractor, consultant or other
service provider, whether or not legally binding, to adopt, amend, modify or
terminate any Benefit Plan, in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise.

 



 

(f) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.17(f)_ , no Benefit Plan exists that,
as a result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
consummation or of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, would
(either alone or in combination with another event) (i) result in the payment
to any current or former employee, director, or other service provider of any
of the Company Entities of any money or other property; (ii) would result in
the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting, or increase or require the
funding of any obligation or provide for provision of any other rights or
benefits to any current or former employee of any Company Entity, whether or
not such payment, right or benefit would constitute a parachute payment within
the meaning of Code Section 280G; (iii) increase any material benefits
otherwise payable under, or result in any other material obligation pursuant
to, any Benefit Plan; (iv) limit or restrict the right of the Company to
merge, amend or terminate any Benefit Plan; or (v) result in an "excess
parachute payment" or gross-up right or other payment to any "disqualified
individual" within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code.

 



 

(g) No Benefit Plan or other arrangement for the benefit of employees or
individual workers located primarily outside the United States is maintained
or contributed to by, or could result in any liability to, any Company Entity.

of Delaware, and is qualified or registered to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or operations would require

set forth in _Section 5.16(f)(i)_. For purposes hereof, " ** _Measurement
Period_** " means the period from the Closing Date through September 30 2018
and then each 12 month period thereafter. Any amounts owed under this _Section
5.16(f)(iii)_ will be paid by the applicable party within five (5) Business
Days after final determination of the applicable Final WC Statement.

 



 

(iv) For each Measurement Period, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a
reconciliation of the Workers Comp Claims payment obligations, as prepared by
Seller in consultation with its insurance carrier consistent with past
practice for the preparation of such report, within twenty (20) Business Days
following each September 30, accompanied by an annual liability assessment of
Workers Comp Claims computed as of September 30 on a basis consistent with
past practice (the " ** _Annual Liability Assessment_** ") and a calculation
of each partys payment obligations pursuant to _Section 5.16(f)(iii)_
(collectively, the " ** _WC Statement_** "). Purchaser shall have thirty (30)
days to review the WC Statement and, may dispute a WC Statement using the
dispute procedures set forth in Section 5 of the Transition Services Agreement

any WC Statement, during the applicable review period, Seller shall provide
Purchaser with reasonable access during normal business hours to all working
papers related to the preparation of the reconciliation. If the Purchaser does
not provide written notice to Seller of a dispute by the end of the applicable
review period, the WC Statement as delivered by Seller shall be considered
final and binding upon the parties. For purposes hereof, the " ** _Final WC
Statement_** " shall be the statement as mutually agreed to in writing by
Purchaser and Seller, as determined by the dispute procedures set forth in
Section 5 of the Transition Services Agreement or as deemed final by the
preceding sentence.

 



 

(v) With respect to Workers Comp Claims that arise out of work performed

with the right to seek reimbursement of Losses resulting from Workers Comp
Claims (cost reimbursable contracts), Purchaser or the applicable Company
Entity shall use commercially reasonable efforts to recover such Losses under
the applicable Government Contracts; and to the extent the applicable
Governmental Authority reimburses the applicable Company Entity (through its
normal overhead rate claims under cost reimbursable contracts, by direct
payment, credit or otherwise), such amounts shall adjust (i.e., reduce amounts
otherwise payable to Purchaser, or increase the amount otherwise payable to
Seller, as applicable based on the net payment due on account of all other
factors) the amounts otherwise due under the Annual Liability Assessment as
contemplated by _Section 5.16(f)(iv)_. In the event a Workers Comp Claims
arising out of work performed pursuant to Government Contracts that provide
the applicable Company Entity with the right to seek reimbursement of Losses
resulting from Workers Comp Claims (cost reimbursable contracts), and the
events occurring after a Governmental Authority has made such a reimbursement
result in a Governmental Authority being entitled to and actually receiving a
cash reimbursement or bill credit from a Company

 



      
 

 



 

Entity, such amounts shall adjust (i.e., reduce amounts otherwise payable to
Seller, or increase the amount otherwise payable to Purchaser, as applicable
based on the net payment due on account of all other factors) the amounts
otherwise due under the Annual Liability Assessment as contemplated by
_Section 5.16(f)(iv)_.

 



 

(vi) The obligations under this _Section 5.16(f)_ shall terminate upon the
earlier of (A) final resolution and satisfaction of all Workers Comp Claims
and (B) written termination agreement of Seller and Purchaser.

(a) For the period commencing with Closing and ending on the date that is five
(5) years following the Closing, except for the activities contemplated

foregoing prohibition shall not apply to any such Covered Personnel who
responds to a general advertisement or solicitation program conducted by or on
behalf of such employer.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) For purposes of clarity, to the extent a Teaming Agreement, or a purchase
or delivery order, is included as a Current Government Contract but the prime
contract related thereto is not included as a Current Government Contract, the
parties acknowledge that the limitations in _Section 5.17(a)(i)_ and
_(a)(ii)_ , do not relate to the applicable prime Contract but only to the
applicable subcontract, Teaming Agreement, purchase order, etc. included as a

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, including, without
limitation, _Sections 21_ and _22_ , in the event any party believes that any
other party has or may have breached this _Section 5.17_, it shall promptly,
and in any event, within 60 days of becoming aware of such alleged breach,
provide the other party with written notice of such alleged breach, describing
in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances on which it is based, and the
parties shall cooperate in good faith to attempt to resolve the dispute (" **
_Non-Compete Dispute_** ") in accordance with the following informal procedure

Presidents or other highest ranking executives of the parties will engage
directly to resolve the Non-Compete Dispute;

 



 

(iv) only in the event that the parties have been unable to resolve the Non-
Compete Dispute in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section
5.17(e)(i)  (iii)_, including, without limitation, exploring entering into a
lawful teaming arrangement, and not less than seven (7) Business Days after

_Section 5.17(e)(iii)_, may a Non-Compete Dispute be referred by any party to
non-binding mediation and then binding arbitration in accordance with _Section
21_ and _Section 22_; provided, that nothing in this _Section 5.17_ shall
preclude a party from seeking remedies available pursuant to _Section 11_.

 



 

(f) The parties hereto agree that _Section 5.17(a)_ will not be breached in
any respect by reason of any of the following occurring:

 



 

(i) a Person acquires the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries and such Person or
any Subsidiary, division, affiliated entity or line of business (an " **
_Operating Line_** ") of such Person engages in any activities covered by
_Section 5.17(a)_, so long as the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (as of
the date of such acquisition) does not provide assistance to such Operating
Line in respect of such Operating Lines activities that would otherwise be
covered by _Section 5.17(a)_ if performed by the Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries (as of the date of such acquisition);

 



 

(ii) The Seller or its Affiliates acquire another Person and a non-substantial
portion of the revenue derived from such Persons business is from activities
covered by _Section 5.17(a)_ (collectively, " ** _Restricted Work_** "), so
long as none of the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than such Person)
(as of the date of such acquisition of such Person) provides assistance to
such Person that would otherwise be covered by _Section 5.17(a)_ if performed
by the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (as of the date of such acquisition
of such Person); provided that if (x) Restricted Work of such acquired
business generates 5% or more of such Persons consolidated annual revenues in
the last completed fiscal year of such Person and (y) such Person or business
is acquired within 36 months of the Closing Date, then the Seller or such
Affiliate shall be required to divest such Person, business or portion thereof
within twelve (12) months after the consummation of such acquisition so as to
be in compliance with the requirements set forth in _Section 5.17(a)_;

 



 

(iii) The Seller or any of its Affiliates are both subcontractors or awardees
at any tier with the Purchaser and any of its Affiliates under the same prime
Government Contract, and the Purchaser or its Affiliates fail to meet a
contract requirement within the given preference time period offered by the
customer, prime contractor or higher-tier subcontractor with respect to work
that would otherwise qualify as a Current Government Contract or New
Government Contract, the Seller or its Affiliates may fulfill such requirement
if opened up by the customer, prime contractor or higher-tier subcontractor to
the other subcontractors or awardees under the applicable prime Government
Contract; _provided_ that the Seller and any of Affiliates have not encouraged
such customer, prime contractor or higher-tier subcontractor to take the
adverse action against the Purchaser or the Company Entities or open up the
requirement;

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) If any work directly performed under any Current Government Contract or
any Contract resulting from the Government Bids or any Contract for Other
Restricted Activities is merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with work
not currently being performed under such Contracts, such successor Contract
shall not be covered under _Section 5.17(a)_ so long as Seller and its
Affiliates use commercially reasonable efforts to subcontract the portion of
the work that would otherwise constitute "New Government Contracts" or a
Contract for Other Restricted Activities to the Company if permitted by
applicable Law;

 



 

(v) any options are extended under the prime Government Contracts held by the
Seller or its Affiliates under which the Current Government Contracts are
issued, or the Seller or any of its Affiliates solicits or actively bids,
either as a prime contractor or subcontractor, the recompetes or other follow-
on work of any such prime Government Contract so long as Seller and its
Affiliates use commercially reasonable efforts to subcontract the portion of
the work that would otherwise constitute "New Government Contracts" or a
Contract for Other Restricted Activities to the Company if permitted by
applicable Law; or

 



 

(vi) the Seller or its Affiliates provides, competes for, or is awarded any
Contract to provide, operation, maintenance or other similar services with
respect to any product manufactured and sold by the Seller or its Affiliates
(such services, " ** _Operation and Maintenance Services_** ").

 



 

(g) Because of the difficulty of measuring economic damages to the Purchaser
and its Affiliates as a result of a breach of the foregoing covenants in this
_Section 5.17_, and because of the immediate and irreparable damage that
could be caused to the Purchaser and its Affiliates for which it would have no
other adequate remedy, the Seller agrees that the foregoing covenant may be
enforced by the Purchaser in the event of breach or threatened breach by the
Seller or its Affiliates, in addition to, but not in lieu of, any other
available remedies, by injunctions, restraining orders or other equitable
remedies. It is agreed by the parties that the foregoing covenants in this
_Section 5.17_ impose a reasonable restraint on the Seller and its
Affiliates; and

 



 

(h) The Seller and the Purchaser agree that they will allocate $50,000.00 of
the Purchase Price to the covenants set forth in this _Section 5.17_ and
neither the Seller, the Purchaser or any of their Affiliates shall take any
position on any Tax Return or in connection with any action or proceeding
relating to Taxes that is inconsistent with any such allocation.

 



 

5.18 _Purchaser Covenant Not to Compete_. For the period commencing with
Closing and ending on the date that is five (5) years following the Closing,
neither the Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates (including the Company) shall,
directly or indirectly, provide services with respect to or compete for any
Contract to provide, Operation and Maintenance Services in the Restricted
Territory. Because of the difficulty of measuring economic damages to the
Seller and its Affiliates as a result of a breach of the covenants in this
_Section 5.18_, and because of the immediate and irreparable damage that
could be caused to the Seller and its Affiliates for which it would have no
other adequate remedy, the Purchaser agrees that the foregoing covenant may be
enforced by the Seller or its Affiliates in the event of breach or threatened
breach by the

 



      
 

 



 

Purchaser or its Affiliates, in addition to, but not in lieu of, any other
available remedies, by injunctions, restraining orders or other equitable
remedies. It is agreed by the parties that the foregoing covenants in this
_Section 5.18_ impose a reasonable restraint on the Purchaser and its
Affiliates.

 



 

5.19 _Restructuring Transactions_. Prior to or following the execution of this
Agreement, the Seller shall, and shall cause such of its Affiliates as may be
necessary, to transfer assets in and out of the Company Entities as further
described on _Schedule 5.19_ (the " ** _Restructuring Transactions_** "). To
the extent the Restructuring Transactions have not been completed prior to the
Closing Date, the Purchaser and the Company Entities shall cooperate with the
Seller to complete such Restructuring Transactions at Sellers sole cost and
expense (including, without limitation, allocated costs of the time of
employees of Purchaser or its Affiliates), except to the extent such costs are
otherwise allocated in the Transition Services Agreement.

 



 

5.20 _Intercompany Accounts and Contracts_. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Seller shall cause all intercompany accounts between the Seller and any of its
Subsidiaries (other than the Company Entities), on the one hand, and the
Company Entities, on the other hand, to be settled or otherwise eliminated at
no incremental cost to the Company Entities after the Closing. Prior to the
Closing, except as listed on _Schedule 5.20_ , the Seller has caused all
Contracts listed on _Schedule 3.21_ to be terminated at no cost to the Company
Entities following the Closing, without any party to such Contracts having any
continuing obligation to the other parties thereto (other than any customary
confidentiality obligations).

 



 

5.21 _Release of Credit Support Obligations._

 



 

(a) The Purchaser recognizes that the Seller or its Affiliates have provided
credit support to one or more of the Company Entities pursuant to certain
guarantees, letters of credit, bonds, cash deposits or other sureties and
credit assurances of the Seller or its Affiliates for the benefit of the
Company Entities (collectively, the " ** _Credit Support Obligations_** "),
including those obligations listed on _Schedule 5.21(a)_ , and that the Seller
or its Affiliates may incur monthly carrying costs, the fronting fee costs,
and other out-of-pocket third party costs and expenses resulting from such
Credit Support Obligation, including, but not limited to, those set forth
opposite such obligations on such Schedule (the " ** _Carrying Costs_** ").

 



 

(b) Seller, Purchaser and the Company Entities shall cooperate and shall use
their respective Reasonable Best Efforts to, effective as of the Closing Date,
or as promptly as practicable thereafter, cause Purchaser or one or more of
its Affiliates to (A) have surety bonds, performance bonds, guarantees,
letters of credit or other credit or credit support arrangements or similar
instruments (and any necessary collateral, indemnity or other agreements
associated therewith) issued on behalf of Purchaser or one of its Affiliates
in replacement of all Credit Support Obligations (and all collateral,
indemnity or other arrangements) and (B) be substituted in all respects for
Seller and any Affiliate of Seller that is not a Company Entity in respect of
all Losses of Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company Entities)
under each of such Credit Support Obligations (including, under any indemnity
or other agreements associated therewith) or under any Contract set forth on
_Schedule 5.21(a)_

 



      
 

 



 

(c) From the Closing until such time as Seller and its Affiliates have been
fully and unconditionally released from all Credit Support Obligations, the
Purchaser shall (i) indemnify the Seller and its Affiliates for any Losses in
connection with any such Credit Support Obligation, to the extent arising out
of the business of the Company Entities conducted after the Closing Date and
(ii) reimburse the Seller and its Affiliates for all Carrying Costs of such
Credit Support Obligations incurred after the Closing, which such
reimbursement shall be paid within thirty (30) days following the Purchasers
receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it, that such costs have been
paid in full. Until the earlier of (i) such time as such obligations are
replaced in accordance with this _Section 5.21_ and (ii) the date which is
thirty (30) days following the Closing Date, the Seller shall, and shall cause
its applicable Affiliates to, use Reasonable Best Efforts to maintain the
Credit Support Obligations in place to the extent required under the
applicable Contracts to which any Company Entity is a party at the sole
expense of the Purchaser.

(a) The Purchaser shall use its Reasonable Best Efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange, obtain and consummate the Purchaser Financing

Best Efforts to: (i) maintain in full force and effect the Commitment Letters,
(ii) satisfy on a timely basis all of the conditions precedent and covenants

negotiate, execute and deliver definitive documents consistent with the terms
contained in the Commitment Letters and, as necessary, the "flex" provisions
contained therein or in any related fee letters (the " ** _Purchaser Financing

_Section 6.1_ (except those that by their nature are to be satisfied by
actions taken on the Closing Date, provided that such conditions would be so
satisfied as of such date) and in any Commitment Letter or Purchaser Financing
Document have been satisfied, enforce its rights under the Commitment Letters
and, to the extent such documents have been executed and are legal, valid and
binding documents, the Purchaser Financing Documents in order to consummate

circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or default) by any party to
the Commitment Letters, (ii) of the receipt by the Purchaser of any written
notice from any Person with respect to any (A) actual, threatened or alleged
breach, default or termination of any Commitment Letter or Purchaser Financing
Document or repudiation by any party to the Commitment Letters or any

Entities and the Seller shall not be required to take any action that would
materially interfere with the normal operations of the Company Entities or the
Seller, (B) such cooperation by the Company Entities or the Seller shall not
require the entry by the Company Entities or the Seller into any agreement the

penalties asserted, suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
arrangement of the Purchaser Financing and the performance of their respective
obligations under this _Section 5.22_ and any information utilized in
connection therewith in each case other than to the extent any of the
foregoing arises from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct by
the Seller, its Representatives or the Company Entities (as determined by a
final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction). The
Purchaser shall, promptly upon written request by the Seller or the Company
Entities, but in no event later than Closing, or if this Agreement is

(b) by the Seller, if (i) the Closing has not occurred on or before June 30,

any party from liability for Fraud in connection with this Agreement or for
any willful breach of any covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement
prior to such termination, and in the event of such Fraud or such willful

performed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the representations, warranties
and covenants relating to Taxes, including the Tax indemnity set forth in

inaccuracy or breach of any such representation or warranty or covenant or
failure to comply with any such covenant providing with reasonable specificity
the basis for the claim shall have been given in good faith to the party
against whom such indemnity may be sought prior to the expiration date of the
applicable survival period, such representation or warranty or covenant in
respect of which indemnity may

 



       
 

 



 

be sought under this Agreement, and the indemnity with respect thereto, shall
survive the time at which it would otherwise terminate pursuant to this
_Section 9.1(a)_ solely with respect to the claims made in such written
notice and claims reasonably related to the underlying facts until finally
resolved.

 



 

9.2 _Seller Indemnification_. From and after the Closing Date, and except with
respect to Losses indemnified under _Section 10.3_, subject to the provisions

managers, officers, agents and equity owners (collectively, the " **

actually incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties to the extent resulting
from:

 



 

(a) any breach of a Fundamental Representation or Significant Representation
by the Seller or the Company Entities;

 



 

(b) failure of the Seller to (i) cause all intercompany accounts between the
Seller and any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Company Entities), on the
one hand, and the Company Entities on the other hand, to be settled or
otherwise eliminated at no incremental cost to the Company Entities after the
Closing and (ii), to cause all Contracts listed on _Schedule 3.21_ (other than
those Contracts listed on _Schedule 5.20_ ) to be terminated at no cost to the
Company Entities following the Closing, without any party to such Contracts
having any continuing obligation to the other parties thereto (other than any
customary confidentiality obligations);

 



 

(c) the Transferred Assets;

 



 

(d) any breach of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, to be
performed by the Seller following the Closing;

 



 

(e) any breach of the Specified Interim Covenants by the Company Entities or
the Seller; and

 



 

(f) the matters set forth on _Schedule 9.2(f)_.

 



 

9.3 _Indemnification by Purchaser_. From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller and its Affiliates (collectively,
the " ** _Seller Indemnified Parties_** " and together with the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties the " ** _Indemnified Parties_** ") from and against any
and all Losses actually incurred by the Seller Indemnified Parties to the
extent resulting from:

 



 

(a) any breach of a Fundamental Representation by Purchaser;

 



 

(b) any breach of any other representation or warranty of Purchaser contained
in this Agreement;

 



 

(c) any breach of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement to be
performed by Purchaser or, after the Closing, the Company Entities; or

 



 

(d) any failure of Purchaser to comply with the terms of the Collective
Bargaining Agreements following the Closing;

 



      
 

 



 

9.4 _R andW Insurance Policy_

 



 

(a) With respect to any claims made for Losses arising out of a breach in
respect of the representations and warranties that are not Fundamental
Representations or Significant Representations, the RandW Insurance Policy shall
be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties. The
parties shall not be entitled to a rescission of this Agreement, or to any
further indemnification rights or other claims of any nature whatsoever in
respect thereof (whether by contract, common law, statute, Law, regulation or
otherwise, including under the Racketeer Influence and Corrupt Organizations
Act of 1970), all of which the parties hereby waive.

 



 

(b) With respect to any Losses for which a Purchaser Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification under _Section 9.2(a)_ (other than in respect of
Significant Representations) or _Section 10.3_, such Losses shall be
satisfied (subject to the other limitations contained in this _Section 9_ or
in _Section 10.3_) in the following order of priority:

 



 

(i) First, from the Seller up to the lesser of (A) the aggregate amount of all
such claims for Losses under _Section 9.2_ and _Section 10.3_, and (B) the
Retention Amount;

 



 

(ii) Second, from the RandW Insurance Policy, in an amount equal to any recovery
under the RandW Insurance Policy that a Purchaser Indemnified Party obtains
after exercising Reasonable Best Efforts to seek and procure such recoveries
(which shall not require any Purchaser Indemnified Party to commence
litigation or any other proceeding against such insurer if all or any portion
of the claim is not fully paid by the insurer unless Seller agrees to assume
and advance and does advance to the applicable Purchaser Indemnified Party the
full cost and expense of any such litigation or other proceeding), up to the
limits of such RandW Insurance Policy; and

 



 

(iii) Third, subject to _Section 9.6(b)_, if coverage under the RandW Insurance
Policy is exhausted in full or if such Losses are not covered by the RandW
Insurance Policy, then from the Seller.

 



 

(c) With respect to any Losses in respect of Significant Representations for
which a Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under
_Section 9.2(a)_, such Losses shall be satisfied (subject to the other
limitations contained in this _Section 9_) in the following order of
priority:

 



 

(i) First, from the Purchaser up to the lesser of (A) the aggregate amount of
all such claims for Losses under _Section 9.2_ and _Section 10.3_, and (B)
the Retention Amount;

 



 

(ii) Second, from the RandW Insurance Policy, in an amount equal to any recovery
under the RandW Insurance Policy that a Purchaser Indemnified Party obtains
after exercising Reasonable Best Efforts to seek and procure such recoveries
(which shall not require any Purchaser Indemnified Party to commence
litigation or any other proceeding against such insurer if all or any portion
of the claim is not fully paid by the insurer unless Seller agrees to assume
and advance and does advance to the applicable

 



      
 

 



 

Purchaser Indemnified Party the full cost and expense of any such litigation
or other proceeding), up to the limits of such RandW Insurance Policy; and

 



 

(iii) Third, subject to _Section 9.6(c)_, if coverage under the RandW Insurance
Policy is exhausted in full or if such Losses are not covered by the RandW
Insurance Policy, then from the Seller.

 



 

(d) With respect to any Losses for which a Purchaser Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification in respect of breach of the Specified Interim
Covenants pursuant to _Section 9.2(e)_, such Losses shall be satisfied
(subject to the other limitations contained in this _Section 9_ or in
_Section 10.3_) in the following order of priority:

such claims for Losses under _Section 9.2_ and _Section 10.3_, and (B) the

(ii) Second, from the RandW Insurance Policy, in an amount equal to any recovery
under the RandW Insurance Policy that a Purchaser Indemnified Party obtains
after exercising Reasonable Best Efforts to seek and procure such recoveries
(which shall not require any Purchaser Indemnified Party to commence
litigation or any other proceeding against such insurer if all or any portion
of the claim is not fully paid by the insurer unless Seller agrees to assume
and advance and does advance to the applicable Purchaser Indemnified Party the
full cost and expense of any such litigation or other proceeding), up to the
limits of such RandW Insurance Policy; and

 



 

(iii) Third, subject to _Section 9.6(c)_, if coverage under the RandW Insurance
Policy is exhausted in full or if such Losses are not covered by the RandW
Insurance Policy, then from the Seller.

 



 

9.5 _Claims Procedures_.

 



 

(a) _Third Party Claims_

 



 

(i) Upon becoming aware of a claim or a possible claim by a third party
against an Indemnified Party (a " ** _Third Party Claim_** ") in respect of
which such Indemnified Party may seek indemnity from a party hereto with
respect thereto under this _Section 9)_, such Indemnified Party shall
promptly provide the Indemnifying Party with written notice of such claim or
possible claim, describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances on
which such claim is based, the provisions of this Agreement pursuant to which
indemnification is being sought (including the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements alleged to have been breached) and an estimate of the
Indemnified Partys Losses for which indemnification is being sought (if
ascertainable). The failure to promptly provide such notice shall not result
in a waiver of any right to indemnification hereunder except to the extent
that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure. If the RandW
Insurance Policy isnt the sole and exclusive remedy of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties for such Third Party Claim under _Section 9.4(a)_, the
Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice to
provide written notice to the Indemnified Party that it desires to assume the

 



      
 

 



 

conduct and control, through counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified
Party, and at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, of the settlement or
defense thereof; _provided_ , that (i) such notice contains confirmation that
the Indemnifying Party has an obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party
for the Losses actually incurred as a result of such Third Party Claim which
it is assuming the right to conduct and control the defense thereof (subject
to the limitations and other terms and conditions of this _Section 9_) and
(ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume or control the
settlement or defense if (A) based on the facts then known, the Losses
associated with such Third Party Claim are reasonably expected to exceed two
hundred percent (200%) of the maximum amount for which the Indemnifying Party
could then be liable pursuant to this _Section 9_, (B) such claim seeks non-
monetary, equitable or injunctive relief or alleges any violation of criminal
Law, (C) the Third Party Claim is brought by a material customer or
subcontractor of or Governmental Authority with regulatory authority over, any
Company Entity or (D) the Indemnifying Party is also a party and the
Indemnified Party determines in good faith based on the advice of counsel that
there may be one or more legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party
that are different or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Party
and that could result in a conflict of interest between the Indemnified Party
and the Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(ii) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such Third Party Claim,
the Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party
in connection therewith, including by furnishing books and records, personnel
and witnesses, as appropriate for any defense of such claim, and the
Indemnifying Party shall be authorized to consent to any settlement of, or
entry of any judgment arising from, any such Third Party Claim, in its sole
discretion and without the consent of any Indemnified Party; _provided_ , that
such settlement or judgment (i) does not involve any injunctive relief or
finding or admission of any violation of Law or any admission of wrongdoing by
any Indemnified Party, (ii) fully and finally releases the Indemnified Party
completely in connection with such Third Party Claim, and (iii) the
Indemnifying Party shall pay or cause to be paid all amounts in such
settlement or judgment subject to the limitations of this _Section 9_.

 



 

(iii) If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense (whether by
election, or because it is not entitled to do so), or withdraws from the
defense of a Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to defend, contest, settle and compromise the claim but shall not
thereby waive any right to indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement, and
shall cooperate in good faith and keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably
informed of material developments with respect to such Third Party Claim.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall in no event settle
(or consent to the settlement of) any Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

(b) _Non-Third Party Claims_. The Indemnified Party will notify the
Indemnifying Party in writing promptly (and in any event on or before the
applicable survival date for such indemnity claim pursuant to _Section 9.1_)
after becoming aware of any matter for which the Indemnified Party may be
entitled to indemnification hereunder, which notice shall set

 



      
 

 



 

forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances on which such claim is
based, the provisions of this Agreement pursuant to which indemnification is
being sought (including the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements alleged to have been breached) and an estimate of the Indemnified
Partys Losses for which indemnification is being sought (if ascertainable);
provided that any failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party from any indemnification obligations that it
may have to the Indemnified Party hereunder other than to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby. During the 30-day period
immediately following the delivery of any notice pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence of this _Section 9.5(b)_, the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party shall, in good faith, attempt to resolve any dispute related
such claim for indemnity by the Indemnified Party.

 



 

9.6 _Limitations on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement:

 



 

(a) Any claim under _Section 9.2_, _Section 9.3_ or _Section 10.3_ required
to be made on or prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period set
forth in _Section 9.1_ and not made on or prior to such expiration in
accordance with _Section 9.1 _shall be irrevocably and unconditionally
released and waived by the party seeking indemnification with respect thereto.
The parties further acknowledge that the time periods set forth in _Section
9.1_ for the assertion of claims under this Agreement are the result of
arms-length negotiation among the parties and that they intend for the time
periods to be enforced as agreed by the parties.

 



 

(b) The maximum amount of all indemnifiable Losses in the aggregate for which
the Seller may be liable pursuant to _Section 9.2_ (but not including
indemnifiable Losses under _Section 10.3)_ shall be the Base Purchase Price
less the aggregate amount actually recovered pursuant to the RandW Insurance
Policy.

 



 

(c) The maximum amount of all indemnifiable Losses in the aggregate for which
the Seller may be liable pursuant to _Section 9.2_ in respect of the
Significant Representations (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any
recovery against the RandW Insurance Policy) shall be Seven Million Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($7,500,000). The maximum amount of all indemnifiable Losses
in the aggregate for which the Seller may be liable pursuant to _Section 9.2_
in respect of the Specified Interim Covenants (excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, any recovery against the RandW Insurance Policy) shall be Eight Million
Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($8,750,000).

 



 

(d) The Seller shall not be required to indemnify or hold harmless any
Purchaser Indemnified Party against any Losses to the extent the related
liabilities were reflected in, reserved for or taken into account in the
determination of Net Working Capital as of immediately prior to the Closing
and reduced the Purchase Price accordingly.

 



 

(e) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
_Section 9_ and _Section 10.3_ shall be net of any amounts recovered by the
Indemnified Party under insurance policies, including by any Purchaser
Indemnified Party under the RandW Insurance Policy, indemnity or contribution
agreements, Contracts or otherwise with respect to such Losses (in each case,
with a third party), as applicable (it being agreed that if any such amounts
are recovered by the Indemnified Party in respect of any such Losses
subsequent to the Indemnifying

 



      
 

 



 

Partys making of an indemnification payment in satisfaction of its applicable
indemnification obligation, such amounts shall be promptly remitted to the
Indemnifying Party to the extent of the indemnification payment made), and the
Indemnified Parties shall use, and cause their Affiliates to use, Reasonable
Best Efforts to seek recovery under all provisions covering such Losses to the
same extent as it would if such Losses were not subject to indemnification
hereunder. The amount of any indemnification or Losses otherwise recoverable
under this Agreement shall be further reduced by any Tax Benefit actually
realized by any Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates on account of such
Losses, but only to the extent such Tax Benefit is actually realized with
respect to the year such Losses occur or the immediately succeeding year.
Claims for Taxes shall be made solely pursuant to _Section 10.3_, and no
claims therefor shall be made under this _Section 9_. In the event of any
conflict between this _Section 9_ and _Section 10.3_, the provisions of
_Section 10.3_ shall govern.

 



 

(f) Except to the extent of Losses payable by an Indemnified Party to a third
party in respect thereof, no Indemnifying Party shall, in any event, be liable
hereunder to any Indemnified Party for any consequential, incidental,
indirect, special or punitive damages, loss of revenue, income or profits,
diminution of value or loss of business reputation or opportunity. Except to
the extent payable by an Indemnified Party to a third party in respect
thereof, no "multiple of profits" or "multiple of cash flow" or similar
valuation methodology shall be used in calculating the amount of any Losses
payable by an Indemnifying Party hereunder.

 



 

(g) For purposes of determining whether a breach occurred and the amount of
Losses subject to indemnification pursuant to this _Section 9_ for a breach
of representation or warranty, any limitations or qualifications as to
materiality (including the word "material" but excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt the words "material", "materials" and "Materials" where such words are
used as nouns, e.g. the definition of Hazardous Materials), Material Adverse
Effect or other similar limitation or qualification contained in or otherwise
applicable to such representation or warranty shall be disregarded, except,
however, the foregoing shall not apply for purposes of determining whether a
breach occurred or the amount of Losses subject to indemnification from any
such breach of the representations or warranties set forth in the first
sentence of _Section 3.1(a)_, the first sentence of _Section 3.1(b)_, the
determination of the inclusion of a Contract as a "material Contract" or
"Material Contract" under _Section 3.12_ and the definition of "Material
Contracts".

 



 

(h) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to any indemnification hereunder to
the extent that such indemnification would constitute a duplicative payment
for the same Loss.

 



 

(i) Nothing set forth in this _Section 9_ shall be construed to contractually
eliminate any duty that an Indemnified Party may have under the common Law or
the RandW Insurance Policy to mitigate such Indemnified Partys Losses.

 



 

9.7 _Exclusive Remedies_. From and after the Closing, except for Fraud and the
rights of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties under the RandW Insurance Policy,
the rights of the Indemnified Parties to indemnification relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be strictly limited to
those contained in _Section 1.4_, _Section 5.8(d)_, _Section 5.16_,
_Section 5.22(c)_, _Section 9_, _Section 10.3_ and _Section 11_, and such
rights shall be the exclusive remedies of the Indemnified Parties subsequent
to the Closing Date with respect to any matter in any way relating to this
Agreement or arising in connection herewith.

 



      
 

 



 

9.8 _Manner of Payment._

 



 

(a) To the extent that a Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled to any
indemnification payments pursuant to _Section 9.2_, within five (5) Business
Days after the final determination thereof, the Seller shall promptly pay to
Purchaser such amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account or accounts designated by Purchaser.

 



 

(b) To the extent that a Seller Indemnified Party is entitled to any
indemnification payments pursuant to _Section 9.3_, within five (5) Business
Days after the final determination thereof, the Purchaser shall promptly pay

the account or accounts designated by the Seller.

 



 

9.9 _Attorneys  Fees_. The non-prevailing party to any litigation that is
finally determined under this Agreement, or any party that voluntarily
dismisses any action against the other (i.e., non-suit), whether with or
without prejudice, will pay its own expenses and the reasonable expenses,
including attorneys fees and costs, actually incurred by the other party(ies)
to such claim. For purposes of this _Section 9.9_, in any litigation
hereunder in which any claim or the amount thereof is at issue, the party
seeking indemnification will be deemed to be the non-prevailing party unless
the applicable court of competent jurisdiction awards the party seeking
indemnification more than one third (1/3) of the amount in dispute, plus any
amounts not in dispute; in which case, the Person against whom indemnification
is sought shall be deemed to be the non-prevailing party.

 



 

9.10 _Non-Recourse_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or
otherwise, the parties to this Agreement agree on their own behalf and on
behalf of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates that no Non-Recourse
Party of a party to this Agreement shall have any liability relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions set forth herein except (i) to the extent
agreed to in writing by such Non-Recourse Party, or (ii) on account of such
Non-Recourse Partys Fraud.

 



 

9.11 _Tax Treatment_. Unless otherwise required by applicable Laws, all
indemnification payments under this Agreement will constitute adjustments to
the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes, to the extent permissible under
applicable Tax Laws, and no party will take any position inconsistent with
such characterization.

 



 

 **10.** **POST CLOSING MATTERS**. Following the Closing Date, the parties
agree as follows:

 



 

10.1 _Cooperation_.

 



 

(a) _General_. In case at any time after the Closing any further action is
necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each of the parties
will take such further action (including the execution and delivery of such
further instruments and documents) as any other party reasonably may request,
all at the sole cost and expense of the requesting party (unless the
requesting party is entitled to indemnification therefor under _Section 9_
hereof).

 



 

(b) _Misdirected Payments_. Without limiting the foregoing, following the
Closing, the Seller undertakes and agrees to remit promptly to the Purchaser
or the Company

 



      
 

 



 

Entities any amount received by the Seller after the Closing Date and which
arises out of the operation of the business of the Company Entities. The
Purchaser undertakes and agrees to remit promptly to the Seller any amount
received by the Purchaser after the Closing Date and which arises out of any
assets or business of the Seller, including the Excluded Assets.

 



 

10.2 _Litigation Support_.

 



 

(a) _General_. In the event and for so long as any party is actively
contesting or defending against any Claim in connection with (a) any
transaction contemplated under this Agreement or (b) any fact, situation,
circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event,
incident, action, failure to act or transaction that existed on or prior to
the Closing Date involving the Company Entities, each of the other parties
will cooperate with such party and such partys counsel in the contest or
defense, make available their personnel, and provide such testimony and access
to their books and records as will be reasonably necessary in connection with
the contest or defense, all at the sole cost and expense of the contesting or
defending party (unless the contesting or defending party is entitled to
indemnification therefor under _Section 9_ hereof).

 



 

(b) _Access_. In furtherance of the foregoing, after the Closing Date, upon
the Purchasers or Purchasers Representatives reasonable prior written
request, the Seller will and will cause its Affiliates to cooperate reasonably
with the Purchaser, its Representatives and their respective Affiliates for
purposes of permitting the Purchaser to manage, address and respond to any
matters that arise as a result of or are otherwise related to (i) the
Purchasers ownership of the Company Entities and (ii) litigation matters,
audits, investigations or inquiries arising after the Closing but related to
the operation of the Company Entities prior to Closing. Such cooperation shall
include providing the Purchaser, its Representatives and their respective
Affiliates with (i) reasonable access during normal business hours to the
Sellers personnel and, subject to any customary access or reliance letters
they reasonably require, auditors and other Representatives of the Seller,
(ii) reasonable access during normal business hours to the properties and
books and records relating to the Company Entities (including books and
records of the Seller and its Affiliates, to the extent relevant to the
Company Entities) and (iii) the right to review, make and retain copies of
pertinent documentation to the extent relevant to the Company Entities, in
each case, at the Purchasers sole cost and expense and solely to the extent
such cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the normal day-to-day
operations of the Sellers and its Affiliates businesses.

 



 

10.3 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Tax Indemnification._ From and after the Closing Date, Seller shall
indemnify the Company Entities, Purchaser, and each Affiliate of the Purchaser
and the Company Entities and hold them harmless from and against any loss,
claim, liability, expense, or other damage attributable to (i) all Taxes (or
the non-payment thereof) of the Company Entities for all Pre-Closing Tax
Periods, such Tax liabilities to include any installment payments of Taxes
that arose in the Pre-Closing Tax Period (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, all Taxes imposed, at any time, on the Company Entities pursuant to
Section 965 of the Code as in effect on the date hereof); provided, however,
that this clause (i) shall not include any Taxes arising as a result of
transactions outside the Ordinary Course of Business undertaken by the
Purchaser or any of the Company Entities after the Closing on the Closing Date
or arising as a result of any election under

 



      
 

 



 

Section 338 of the Code, (ii) all Taxes imposed on the Company Entities as a
result of being a member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary
group prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulation
§1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state, local, or non-U.S. law or
regulation, and (iii) any and all Taxes of any Person (other than the Company
Entities) imposed on the Company Entities as a transferee or successor, by
Contract (other than a Commercial Non-Tax Contract) or pursuant to any Law,
rule, or regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring
before the Closing. The provisions of _Sections 9.1, 9.4_ , and _9.6_ through
_9.11_ shall apply to the indemnification in this _Section 10.3(a)_, provided
however that in the event of any conflict between this _Section 10.3_ and the
provisions of _Sections 9.1, 9.4_ , and _9.6_ through _9.11_ , the provisions
of this _Section 10.3_ shall prevail.

 



 

(b) _Straddle Tax Periods_. For purposes of this Agreement, Tax liabilities
with respect to a Tax period which begins on or before and ends after the
Closing Date (" ** _Straddle Tax Periods_** ") shall be apportioned between
the portion of such period ending on the Closing Date and the portion
beginning on the day after the Closing Date. The portion of any Taxes for any
Straddle Tax Period allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
determined as follows: (a) in the case of any real and personal property Taxes
and franchise Taxes not based on gross or net income, based on the total
amount of such Taxes for the relevant Straddle Tax Period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of days in such Straddle
Tax Period through the Closing Date and the denominator of which shall be the
total number of days in such Straddle Tax Period, and (b) in the case of any
Taxes other than those described in clause (a), as if such taxable period
ended at the close of the Closing Date; _provided_ , however, that for
purposes of this clause (b), (i) any Transaction Tax Deductions shall be
allocated in accordance with the provisions of _Section 10.3(f)_, (ii) any
transactions outside the Ordinary Course of Business of the Company Entities
following the Closing on the Closing Date shall be allocable to the portion of
the Straddle Tax Period following the Closing Date and (iii) any item
determined on an annual or periodic basis (including amortization and
depreciation deductions) shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Tax
Period ending on the Closing Date based on the relative number of days in such
portion of the Straddle Tax Period as compared to the number of days in the
entire Straddle Tax Period.

 



 

(c) _Tax Returns_. The Seller shall timely file or cause to be timely filed
when due (taking into account all extensions properly obtained) (i) all income
Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to any Company
Entity on a combined, consolidated or unitary basis with the Seller or any
Affiliate thereof (other than any Tax Return that includes only Company
Entities) and (ii) all other income Tax Returns that are required to be filed
by or with respect to the Company Entities for any taxable periods ending on
or prior to the Closing Date. In each case, the Seller shall remit or cause to
be remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns (to the extent such
Taxes were not taken into account as a liability reducing Actual Net Working
Capital). The Purchaser shall timely file or cause to be timely filed when due
(taking into account all extensions properly obtained) all other Tax Returns
that are required to be filed by or with respect to any Company Entities after
the Closing Date and shall remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes due in
respect of such Tax Returns. Any Tax Returns relating to a Straddle Tax Period
will be prepared in a manner consistent with the prior practice of the Company
Entities unless otherwise required by applicable Laws. No later than thirty
(30) days prior to filing, the Purchaser will deliver to the Seller a copy of
any Tax Return relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Tax Period for
the Sellers review and the Purchaser shall incorporate any

 



      
 

 



 

reasonable comments received from the Seller within fifteen (15) days
thereafter into such Tax Returns prior to filing. Within ten (10) Business
Days after the filing of any Tax Return relating to a Straddle Tax Period, the
Seller shall pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to the excess, if any, of
(x) the amount of Taxes relating to the portion of such Straddle Tax Period
ending on the Closing Date (as determined, under _Section 10.3(b))_ shown on
any such Tax Return over (y) the amount of such Taxes paid by the Company on
or before the Closing Date in respect of such Tax period (whether as payments
of estimated Tax or credits of prior years Refunds or taken into account as a
liability reducing Actual Net Working Capital). Alternatively, an amount
equal to the excess, if any, of the amount in clause (y) of the preceding
sentence over the amount described in clause (x) of the preceding sentence
will be paid in cash by the Company to the Seller within ten (10) Business
Days following the filing of any Tax Returns for any such Straddle Tax Period.

 



 

(d) _Cooperation_. In connection with the preparation of Tax Returns and audit
examinations relating to the Company Entities by any Governmental Authority or
administrative or judicial proceedings resulting therefrom, the Seller and the
Purchaser will cooperate fully with one another, including, but not limited
to, the furnishing or making available on a timely basis of records, personnel
(as reasonably required), books of account, powers of attorney or other
materials necessary or helpful for the preparation of Tax Returns, the conduct
of audit examinations or the defense of claims by Taxing Authorities as to the
imposition of Taxes. Seller agrees to retain all books and records with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company Entities relating to any
taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the
statute of limitations for the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority with
respect thereto.

 



 

(e) _Purchaser Tax Actions_. Except as otherwise required under applicable
Law, following the Closing, neither the Purchaser nor any Company Entity will
(and neither the Purchaser nor any Company Entity will allow any of its
Affiliates to): (i) amend or modify any Tax Return of any Company Entity that
was filed before the Closing Date, (ii) surrender or waive any right to a
Refund described in _Section 10.3(h)_ or (iii) make a voluntary disclosure to
a Governmental Authority with respect to any Company Entity for a taxable
period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, in each case without the prior
written consent of the Seller, but, only to the extent that such action
described in (i), (ii), or (iii) above would result in a liability to the
Seller (or any Affiliate thereof), including any indemnification obligation
under this Agreement. The Purchaser agrees that no election shall be made
pursuant to Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (or any similar provision of any
applicable Law) with respect to the purchase of the Shares.

 



 

(f) _Tax Treatment_. The Purchaser and its Affiliates, the Company, the Seller
and the Seller agree with respect to certain Tax matters as follows:

 



 

(i) To treat any Tax deductions relating to Closing Bonus Payments paid or
accrued on the Closing Date as deductible in the Tax period following the
Closing Date to the fullest extent allowable under applicable Laws, including
by filing any necessary elections or statements required for the application
of the "next day rule" under Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) to any
such Tax deductions and to treat any other Transaction Tax Deductions as
deductible in a Pre-Closing Tax Period to the fullest extent allowable under
applicable Laws, and no party will apply the "next day rule" under Regulation
Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) to any such Tax.

 



       
 

 



 

(ii) To make an election under Revenue Procedure 2011-29 to deduct 70 percent
of any Transaction Tax Deductions that are "success-based fees" under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.263(a)-5(a).

 



 

(iii) Except as provided in clause (i) above, to treat any gains, income,
deductions, losses, or other items realized by the Company for income Tax
purposes with respect to any transaction outside the Ordinary Course of
Business of the Company Entities following the Closing on the Closing Date as
occurring on the day immediately following the Closing Date and apply the
"next day rule" under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(iv)(B) to
such items.

 



 

(iv) That no election shall be made by any party (or any Company Entity) under
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(2) (or any similar provision of
state, local, or non-U.S. Laws) to ratably allocate items incurred by any
Company Entity in the year that contains the Closing Date.

 



 

Unless otherwise required by a final determination of a Governmental
Authority, the Purchaser shall cause the Company and all of its other
Affiliates to file all Tax Returns consistently with the agreements set forth
in this _Section 10.3(e)_ and not take any position inconsistent with the
agreement in this _Section 10.3(e)_ during an audit or other proceeding with
any Governmental Authority.

 



 

(g) _Transfer Taxes_. The Purchaser and Seller shall each be liable for, and
shall each pay (or cause to be paid) one half of any and all transfer,
documentary, sales, use, registration and real property transfer or gains tax,
stamp tax, excise tax, stock transfer tax, or other similar Tax imposed as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, " **
_Transfer Taxes_** ") and any penalties or interest with respect to the
Transfer Taxes. The Purchaser and the Seller agree to cooperate to establish
any available exemption from (or otherwise reduce) any such Transfer Taxes,
and also agree to cooperate in the filing of any returns with respect to the
Transfer Taxes, including by promptly supplying any information in their
possession that is reasonably necessary to complete such returns.

 



 

(h) _Tax Refunds._ Any refund of Taxes that were imposed on the Company
Entities for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and any interest paid or credited in
respect thereto (collectively, a " ** _Refund_** "), shall be the property of
the Seller. If any Refund is received by the Purchaser, the Company or any of
their Affiliates, including by way of credit or allowance against Taxes
otherwise payable, an amount equal to such Refund (other than any Refund to
the extent it results from the carry-back to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of any
deductions, losses or other Tax attributes arising in Tax periods or portions
thereof beginning after the Closing Date), shall be paid to the Seller
promptly upon receipt from the applicable Governmental Authority. The
Purchaser shall, if the Seller so requests and at the Sellers expense, cause
the relevant entity to file for and obtain any Refund to which the Seller is
entitled under this _Section 10.3(h)_. The principles of _Section 10.3(b)_
shall apply in determining the portion of any Refund with respect to a
Straddle Tax Period that is attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period.

 



      
 

 



 

(i) _Tax Contests_.

 



 

(i) After the Closing, the Purchaser and the Seller shall promptly notify one
another in writing of any Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding
relating to Taxes of the Company which, if determined adversely to the
taxpayer would, or after the lapse of time, could, result in Tax liability to
the Seller or be grounds for indemnification under this _Agreement;_ provided,
however, that a failure or delay to give such notice will not affect the
Purchasers right to indemnification hereunder except to the extent, if any,
that Seller is prejudiced thereby.

 



 

(ii) In the case of a Tax audit, administrative or judicial proceeding (a " **
_Tax Contest_** ") that relates to solely to taxable periods ending on or
before the Closing Date, the Seller shall have the right at the Sellers
expense to participate in and control the conduct of such Tax Contest. In
addition, the Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow
the Seller, at the Sellers expense, to control any portion of any Tax Contest
that relates to taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date. The
Seller shall keep the Purchaser informed of the progress of any such Tax
Contest (including the prompt provision to the Purchaser of all material
correspondence, pleadings, protests, briefs and other documents pertaining to
such Tax Contest), and the Purchaser also may participate in any such Tax
Contest at its expense. The Seller shall not settle any such Tax Contest
without the advance written consent of the Purchaser, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the Seller does not
assume the defense of any Tax Contest hereunder, the provisions of _Section
10.3(i)(iii)_ shall apply with respect thereto.

 



 

(iii) With respect to any other Tax Contest not controlled by the Seller, such
Tax Contest shall be controlled by the Purchaser. If, however, the Seller
could be subject to any liability for such Taxes, including as a result of any
indemnification obligation under this Agreement, in connection with any such
Tax Contest, the Purchaser shall keep the Seller informed of the progress of
any such Tax Contest (including the prompt provision to the Seller of all
material correspondence, pleadings, protests, briefs and other documents
pertaining to such Tax Contest), the Seller may also participate in any such
Tax Contest at the Sellers expense and the Purchaser shall not settle any
such Tax Contest without the advance written consent of the Seller, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

(iv) For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this _Section 10.3(i)_,
and not those of _Section 9.5_, shall apply in the case of any Tax Contest.

 



 

10.4 _Misdirected Payments_. The Seller and the Purchaser acknowledge that it
is possible that (i) the Seller may hereinafter inadvertently pay account
payables which relate to the Company Entities business and should be for the
account of the Purchaser, or may inadvertently receive payments of account
receivables which relate to the post-Closing operations of the Company
Entities, and (ii) the Purchaser or the Company Entities may inadvertently pay
account payables, which relate to Transferred Assets or the pre-Closing
Company Entities business conducted by the Seller and should be for the
account of the Seller, and may inadvertently receive payments of account
receivables which relate to the business of the Seller or its Affiliates. Each
party agrees, promptly following receipt of any accounts receivable payments
which should have been paid to the other party, to hold such payment in trust
for the other party, and to remit such amounts to the other party. Each party
further agrees that promptly following

 



      
 

 



 

receipt of notice from the other party requesting reimbursement for the
payment of account payables, which payables should have been paid by the party
receiving such notice or its Affiliates, then such party will promptly make a
reimbursement payment to the party making the request for reimbursement. For
the avoidance of doubt, each party agrees to treat any items of income, gain,
loss, credit, or deduction associated with the account receivables and account
payables described by this _Section 10.4_ as actually belonging to the party
who, in the first instance, should have paid such account payables or received
such account receivables.

 



 

10.5 _License to Certain Intellectual Property_. Seller hereby grants, and
from time to time as requested by Purchaser, shall cause its applicable
Affiliates to grant, to Purchaser and the Company Entities, effective upon the
Closing and ending on of three (3) year anniversary of the Closing Date, a
non-exclusive, royalty free, fully paid up right to use, copy, and modify the
software manuals, policies, procedures, instructions, and other documents set
forth on _Schedule 3.26(o)_ in the form in existence as of the Closing Date,
to the extent not owned by or otherwise licensed to the Company Entities
immediately after Closing for use in connection with Company Entities
business (however to the extent any such materials contain an Excluded Name,
such Excluded Name shall be promptly removed or covered up from all Licensed
IP, but no later than twelve (12) months from the date hereof) (the " **
_Licensed IP_** "). Purchaser acknowledges that neither Seller nor any of its
Affiliate has any obligation to update such Licensed IP and neither Purchaser
nor the Company Entities as any right to transfer or sublicense any such
Licensed IP or any derivative works developed which contain any portion of the
Licensed IP. Except as expressly set forth in _Section 3.26(o)_ with respect
to periods on or prior to Closing, the Licensed IP ARE BEING LICENSED ON AN
"AS IS" BASIS AS OF THE CLOSING AND IN THEIR CONDITION AS OF CLOSING WITH "ALL
FAULTS" AND, NONE OF SELLER, SELLERS AFFILIATES OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE
REPRESENTATIVES MAKE OR HAVE MADE ANY OTHER REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, IN RESPECT OF THE LICENSED IP,
INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO (I) MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, (II) CONTINUED USE OF THE LICENSED IP BY PURCHASER OR THE COMPANY
ENTITIES AFTER THE CLOSING IN ANY MANNER OR (III) NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD
PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

 



 

10.6 _Project 61289 AR Covenant_. After Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall
cause the Company Entities to, use commercially reasonable efforts to bill and
collect all Project 61289 AR, consistent with the historical billing and
collection practices of the Company Entities. Upon collection of any Project
61289 AR by Purchaser, the Company Entities or any other Affiliate of
Purchaser, Purchaser shall pay such sums to Seller within five (5) Business
Days of receipt thereof.

 



 

 **11.** **SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE**.

 



 

(a) Each of the Purchaser, the Seller and the Company acknowledge that the
other parties may be irreparably harmed and that there may be no adequate
remedy at law for any violation by any of them of any of the covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement. It is accordingly agreed that, in
addition to, but not in lieu of, any other remedies that may be available upon
the breach of any such covenants or agreements (including monetary damages and
remedies under _Section 9_), each party shall have the right to seek
injunctive relief to restrain a breach or threatened breach of, or otherwise
to seek specific performance of, the other parties covenants

 



      
 

 



 

and agreements contained in this Agreement. Each party agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
relief on the basis that the party seeking such injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief has an adequate remedy at law or that
any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason
at law or equity. In the event that any party seeks an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, such party shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such injunction
or other order, decree, ruling or judgment. Without limiting the foregoing or
the right of the Seller (or any of its Representatives on its behalf) or the
Company to cause Purchaser to comply with this Agreement, in no event, (i)
shall the Seller (or any of its Representatives on its behalf) or the Company
be entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance of the Debt Commitment
Letter against the Debt Financing Sources; and (ii) other than as set forth in
_Section 11(b)_, shall the Seller (or any of its Representatives on its
behalf) or the Company be entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance
of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 11(a)_, it is explicitly agreed that the right
of the Seller or the Company to seek specific performance to consummate the
Closing or to cause Purchaser to draw any funds under the Equity Commitment
Letters to consummate the Closing shall be subject to the requirements that:

 



 

(i) Purchaser has failed to consummate (or indicated an intention to fail to
consummate) the Closing in accordance with _Section 1.6_;

 



 

(ii) the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ would have been satisfied or
waived, if the Closing were to have occurred in accordance with _Section 1.6_
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but which are capable of being satisfied); and

 



 

(iii) (A) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Closing
if the cash under the Equity Commitment Letters is funded at the Closing; and

 



 

(iv) the Seller has confirmed in writing to Purchaser that if specific
performance is granted and the Debt Financing is funded, then the Seller will
effect the Closing pursuant to _Section 1.6_.

 



 

 **12.** **PUBLIC STATEMENTS**. The initial press release regarding the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be a joint press release by the Seller
and the Purchaser. None of the Purchaser, the Seller or the Company Entities,
without the prior written approval of the other parties will make any other
press release or other public announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except to the extent required by Law, in which
case the other party will be so advised as far in advance as possible and will
be given an opportunity to comment on such release or announcement, if
permitted by Law. Without limiting the forgoing, none of the Purchaser, the
Company Entities or the Seller, without the prior written approval of the
other parties (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), shall disclose the Purchase Price, the approximate amount of the
Purchase Price, any other financial information from which the approximate
amount of the Purchase Price may be determined, or disclose any of the other
essential terms of this Agreement except as required by Law or required for
financial reporting purposes and except that the parties

 



      
 

 



 

(or their respective Affiliates) may disclose such terms to their respective
employees, accountants, advisors and other Representatives or their respective
financing sources as necessary in connection with the ordinary conduct of
their respective businesses (so long as such Persons agree to or are bound by
contract to keep the terms of this Agreement confidential on terms
substantially similar to those set forth in this Agreement that are applicable
to the disclosing party hereunder). Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
_Section 12_ shall not (i) apply to any press release or other public
statement (a) that contains information that has been previously announced or
made public in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or (b) is made in
the Ordinary Course of Business and does not relate specifically to the
signing of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or (ii)
prohibit Purchaser or its Affiliates from providing ordinary course
communications regarding this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby to existing or prospective general and limited partners, equity owners,
members, managers and investors of any Affiliates of such Person who are
subject to customary confidentiality restrictions prohibiting further
communications thereof.

 



 

 **13.** **EXPENSES**.

 



 

13.1 _General_. Except as expressly set forth herein, each party shall bear
its own legal and other fees and expenses incurred in connection with its
negotiating, executing and performing this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents, including any related investment banking broker or finders fees
with which any of them have contracted, for periods on or before the Closing
Date.

_Section 14_, _Section 24_, _Section 26_, and the definitions of Debt
Commitment Letters, Debt Financing Sources, Debt Financing, and Purchaser
Financing Document shall not be amended in a manner that is adverse in any
material respect to any Debt Financing Source without the prior written
consent of such Debt Financing Source. This Agreement may not be assigned by
any party without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, which
may be granted or denied in their sole discretion; provided that (i) Purchaser
may assign any or all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to
one or more of its Affiliates so long as it remains liable for its obligations

right thereafter to enforce the same; (b) no waiver by any party of any

Disclosure Schedules hereto, which are incorporated by reference herein and
deemed a part of this Agreement) and the Transaction Documents constitute the

 **19.** **SEVERABILITY**. In case any one or more of the provisions contained
in this Agreement should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining
provisions will not in any way be affected or impaired. Any illegal or

to the minimum extent necessary to bring such term within the provisions of
applicable Law and such term, as so modified, and the balance of this

 **20.** **CHOICE OF LAW**. This Agreement is to be construed and governed by
the Laws of the State of Delaware (without giving effect to principles of
conflicts of laws).

 



 

 **21.** **MEDIATION**. Each party hereto irrevocably agrees that any dispute,
controversy or claim between or among the parties hereto arising out of, in
connection with, or related to this Agreement (other than with respect to
claims under _Section 1.4 _or _Section 11_) shall be determined in
accordance with the mediation, and, if necessary, arbitration provisions of
_Section 21_ and _Section 22_ of this Agreement. Prior to initiating any
arbitration proceeding arising out of, in connection with, or related to this
Agreement, a party hereto shall first initiate good faith non-binding
mediation by serving written notice (the " ** _Dispute Notice_** ") on the
other parties pursuant to the Notice provision in _Section 15_. The parties
may select any mediator mutually agreeable to them. If the parties cannot
agree on a mediator within fifteen (15) days of issuance of the Dispute
Notice, they shall, within five (5) days thereafter submit a joint request for
mediation to JAMS and have JAMS select an appropriate mediator with experience
in resolving financial and commercial disputes, with each of the Purchaser and
the Seller splitting the costs and any administrative fees of JAMS in
connection with the selection of a mediator. The mediation session shall occur
within thirty (30) days of the selection of the mediator unless the parties
mutually agree to extend this time, and shall be scheduled for not less than
one (1) day. Each party agrees to send a representative with full settlement
authority to the mediation. The mediation shall be conducted exclusively in
Delaware unless otherwise agreed by the parties. The parties agree to hold the
content of the mediation in confidence and further agree that the mediator is
disqualified as a litigation witness for any party to the mediation. The
parties further agree that the mediation shall be considered to be a form of
settlement negotiations, the content of which shall not be admissible as
evidence of liability or damages in any proceeding. Each party shall bear its
own expenses, with each of the Purchaser and the Seller paying an equal share
of the expenses and fees of the mediator.

 



 

 **22.** **ARBITRATION**.

 



 

(a) If the parties are unable to resolve a dispute arising out of, in
connection with, or relating to this Agreement through good faith mediation in
accordance with _Section 21_, then such dispute shall be determined by
binding arbitration in accordance with this _Section 22_.

 



 

(b) The arbitration shall be conducted by one independent arbitrator who shall
be either a retired judge with experience in or a practicing attorney with
experience in disputes in the area of mergers and acquisitions Law, and who is
mutually acceptable to the parties. If the parties are unable to agree on an
arbitrator, then the parties agree that the arbitrator shall be appointed in
accordance with the rules of JAMS. The arbitration shall be held in Delaware,
and shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration
Rules and Procedures. The arbitrator shall give effect to statutes of
limitation in determining any claim, and any controversy concerning whether an
issue or dispute is arbitrable shall be determined by the

 



      
 

 



 

arbitrator. The arbitrator shall follow the Law in reaching a reasoned
decision and shall deliver a written opinion setting forth findings of fact,
conclusions of law and the rationale for the arbitrators decision. Such
decision shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the parties to this
Agreement. _Section 20_ shall apply to the claims and defenses in the
arbitration proceeding, and the opinion, which shall be Confidential
Information of both parties, except that final judgment upon the decision
rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction for
purposes of confirming and enforcing such award.

 



 

 **23.** **REPRESENTATION BY COUNSEL**.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding the fact that the Law Firm has jointly represented the
Seller and the Company Entities, and their respective Affiliates, in
connection with this Agreement, and have also represented the Seller, the
Company Entities and/or their respective Affiliates in connection with matters
other than the transactions that are the subject of this Agreement prior to
the Effective Time, the Law Firm will be permitted in the future, after the
Effective Time, to represent one or more of such parties, or their respective
equity holders, officers, directors or managers in connection with matters in
which such parties or their respective equity holders, officers, directors or
managers are adverse to the Purchaser, the Company Entities and/or their
respective Affiliates, including any disputes that such parties or their
respective equity holders, officers, directors or managers hereafter may have
against the Purchaser, the Company Entities or any of their respective
Affiliates in each case which arise out of or relate to this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Each party to this Agreement agrees to waive, in advance, any actual or
potential conflict of interest that may hereafter arise in connection with the
Law Firms future representation of the Seller and/or its respective
Affiliates or their respective equity holders, officers, directors or managers
on matters in which the interests of such party or their respective equity
holders, officers, directors or managers are adverse to the interests of
Purchaser and/or the Company Entities, including any matters that arise out of
this Agreement or that are substantially related to this Agreement or to any
prior representation by the Law Firm of the Seller or the Company Entities.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding any legal requirement to the contrary, all confidential
communications between any of the Law Firm and the Seller, the Company
Entities and/or their respective Affiliates or their respective equity
holders, officers, directors or managers that occurred in the context of the
Law Firms representation of the Seller or the Company Entities prior to the
Effective Time relating to this Agreement or transactions contemplated hereby
(" ** _Confidential Communications_** ") will remain privileged as between
such Law Firm and such party or their respective equity holders, officers,
directors or managers after the Effective Time, and the Company Entities agree
that the privilege shall remain with the Seller following the Effective Time
such that, without limiting the Sellers right to such privilege, the Seller
alone shall have and maintain the right to waive the privilege.

 



 

(d) Each of the Purchaser, the Seller and the Company Entities agree that
prior to the Effective Time, the Company Entities and their Affiliates or
their respective equityholders, officers, directors or managers shall attempt
to delete or otherwise remove from the Companys computer server(s) and/or
other records all copies of emails and other documents (both electronic or
otherwise) that contain Confidential Communications, and each of the
Purchaser, the Seller and

 



      
 

 



 

the Company Entities further agree that if the Company Entities and their
Affiliates or their respective equityholders, officers, directors or managers
fail to delete or remove all such documents, such failure shall be deemed
inadvertent and shall not constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege
or any other privilege applicable to such documents. The Purchaser hereby
further agrees that: (i) it will not seek disclosure of any Confidential
Communications from the Law Firm, the Seller, the Company Entities, their
respective Affiliates or their respective equityholders, officers, directors
or managers after the Effective Time, in the context of litigation or
otherwise; or (ii) to the extent any emails or other documents (either
electronic or otherwise) containing any Confidential Communications are
included in the computer server(s) used by the Company Entities or are
otherwise within the records of the Company Entities following the Effective
Time, they will, upon discovery of any such documents, deliver a copy of any
such documents to the Seller and thereafter permanently delete or destroy all
such emails or other documents containing such Confidential Communication and
not review or otherwise use such documents or the Confidential Communications
for any purpose.

 



 

 **24.** **NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES**. Except with respect to _Section
5.13_, the last sentence of _Section 11(a)_, _Section 11(b)_, _Section 14_,
this _Section 24_, _Section 26_, and the definitions of Debt Commitment
Letters, Debt Financing Sources, Debt Financing, and Purchaser Financing
Document which are intended to benefit, and to be enforceable by the Debt
Financing Sources, this Agreement will not confer any rights upon any Person
other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

 



 

 **25.** **EXHIBITS, APPENDICES AND COMPANY DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE**. The
Exhibits, Appendices and Disclosure Schedules referenced in this Agreement are
a material part of this Agreement. Each Disclosure Schedule will be deemed
incorporated into this Agreement. Except with respect to Disclosure Schedules

call for responsive information to be provided on a Disclosure Schedule (such
as _Schedule 3.11(a)_ , _Schedule 3.12(a)_ or _Schedule 3.17(a)_ , in
contrast to Disclosure Schedules corresponding to representations and
warranties that by their terms call for any exceptions to be listed on
Disclosure Schedules, such as _Schedule 3.11(b)_ , _Schedule 3.12(b)_ or
_Schedule 3.17(b)_ ), the Disclosure Schedules are intended only to qualify
and limit the representations, warranties and covenants in the Agreement and
shall not be deemed to expand in any way the scope or effect of any such
representations, warranties or covenants. No Disclosure Schedule relating to
any possible breach or violation of any agreement, law or regulation shall be
construed as an admission that any such breach or violation has actually
occurred. No reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter in the
Disclosure Schedules will be construed as an admission or indication that such
item or other matter disclosed is material or such item or other matter is
required to be referred to or disclosed in the Disclosure Schedules.
Disclosures made for the purpose of any one Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed made for the purpose of all representations and warranties so long as
the applicability to the other representations and warranties is reasonably
apparent on its face from such disclosure. Any reference to a contract,
statement, plan, report or other document of any kind in the Disclosure
Schedules shall be deemed to be a disclosure thereof to the extent the
applicable representation or warranty calls for a listing of the same and it
shall not in such case be necessary to identify or reference specific
provisions of such documents except to the extent necessary to clarify or
qualify such disclosure.

Claim, whether at Law or in equity, whether in Contract or in tort or
otherwise, against any Debt Financing Source arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letters, the Purchaser Financing
Documents, the Debt Financing or the performance thereunder shall be subject
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state or federal courts of the State of
New York (and appellate courts thereof), (ii) that any Claim, whether at Law
or in equity, whether in Contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Debt
Financing Source shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
Laws of the State of New York, (iii) not to bring or permit any of their
Affiliates to bring or support anyone else in bringing any such legal action
in any other court, (iv) that each party to this Agreement knowingly,
intentionally, and voluntarily waives to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim brought
by any of them against the other arising out of or in any way connected with
this Agreement, or any other agreements executed in connection herewith or the
administration thereof or any of the transactions contemplated herein or
therein, including any Claim relating to the Purchaser Financing or the
performance thereof or involving any Debt Financing Source and (v) that the
Debt Financing Sources are express third party beneficiaries of this _Section
26_.

if requested by the Neutral Auditor, a reasonable engagement letter with
respect to the determination to be made by the Neutral Auditor. All fees and

amount of the disputed items that are successfully disputed by the Seller (as
finally determined by the Neutral Auditor) bears to the aggregate dollar

the Purchaser shall pay $40,000 (40%) of such fees and expense and (ii) the

parties in connection with resolving any dispute hereunder before the Neutral
Auditor will be borne by the party incurring such cost and expense. The
Neutral Auditor will determine only those issues still in dispute at the end
of the Resolution Period and the Neutral Auditors determination will be based
upon and consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The scope
of the disputes to be resolved by the Neutral Auditor shall be limited to
determining the correct values for the items in dispute based on the
information presented, which shall be determined in accordance with this
Agreement (including the definition of Net Working Capital and _Schedule NWC_
attached hereto), but the Neutral Auditor shall not be limited to determining
whether either party has presented sufficient evidence of its position to meet
a particular standard. The Purchaser and the Seller will use their Reasonable
Best Efforts to make their respective presentations as promptly as practicable
following submission to the Neutral Auditor of the disputed items, and each
such party will be entitled, as part of its presentation, to respond to the
presentation of the other party and any questions and requests of the Neutral
Auditor. In deciding any matter, the Neutral Auditor (A) will be bound by the
provisions of _Section 1.4(b)(iv)_ and the definitions contained herein,
including the definition of Net Working Capital and (B) may not assign a value
to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by the
Purchaser or the Seller or less than the smallest value for such item claimed
by the Purchaser or the Seller. The Neutral Auditors determination will be
made within forty-five (45) days after its engagement (which engagement will
be made as promptly as practicable after the end of the Resolution Period, but
in no event later than ten (10) Business Days following the

 



      
 

 



 

end of the Resolution Period), or as soon thereafter as possible, will be set
forth in a written statement delivered to the Seller and the Purchaser and
will be final, conclusive, non-appealable and binding for all purposes
hereunder; _provided_ that such determination may be reviewed, corrected or
set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction but only if upon a finding that
the Neutral Auditor committed manifest error with respect to its
determination. The determination of the Neutral Auditor will not be deemed an
award subject to review under the Federal Arbitration Act or any other
statute.
