owned subsidiary of AMH OP (" **OP Merger Sub** "), American Residential

general partner of ARP OP (" **ARP GP** "). AMH, AMH Merger Sub, AMH OP, OP
Merger Sub, ARPI, ARP GP and ARP OP are each sometimes referred to herein as a
" **Party** " or collectively as the " **Parties**." AMH, AMH Merger Sub, AMH

WHEREAS, the board of trustees of AMH (the " **AMH Board** "), the manager of
AMH Merger Sub (the " **Merger Sub Board** ") and the board of directors of
ARPI (the " **ARPI Board** ") have determined that it is in the best interests
of their respective companies for AMH and ARPI to combine their businesses by
way of a merger of ARPI with and into AMH Merger Sub, with AMH Merger Sub
being the surviving entity resulting from the merger (the " **Parent Merger**
"), whereby each outstanding share of common stock of ARPI, $0.01 par value
per share (the " **ARPI Common Stock** "), issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time will be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the Maryland REIT Law (as
amended, the " **MRL** "), the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (as
amended, the " **DE LLC Act** ") and the Maryland General Corporation Law (as
amended, the " **MGCL** ");

 



 

WHEREAS, AMH, as the sole general partner of AMH OP, and ARPI, as the sole
member of ARP GP, which is the sole general partner of ARP OP, and AMH OP, as
the sole managing member of OP Merger Sub, deem it advisable and in the best
interests of their respective limited partners that, immediately prior to the
Parent Merger, OP Merger Sub shall merge with and into ARP OP, with ARP OP
continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly-owned subsidiary of AMH OP
resulting from the merger (such merger transaction, the " **Partnership
Merger** " and, together with the Parent Merger, the " **Mergers** "), on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in
accordance with the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (as
amended, the " **DRULPA** ") and the DE LLC Act;

 



 

WHEREAS, each of the AMH Board and the ARPI Board has taken all actions
required for the execution of this Agreement by AMH and ARPI, respectively,
and unanimously approved the consummation of the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, AMH, in its capacity as the general partner of AMH OP, ARPI, in its
capacity as the sole member of ARP GP, as the sole general partner of ARP OP,
and AMH OP, in its capacity as the managing member of OP Merger Sub, have
taken all actions required for

      
 

 



 

the execution of this Agreement by AMH OP and OP Merger Sub, and ARP GP and
ARP OP, respectively, and to approve the consummation by AMH OP and OP Merger
Sub, and ARP OP respectively, of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, as an inducement for the AMH Parties to enter into this Agreement,
concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, certain of ARPIs executive
officers have entered into an agreement, in the form of _Exhibit A_ (the "
**Voting Agreement** "), dated as of the date hereof, pursuant to which such
executive officers have agreed to vote all shares of ARPI Common Stock owned
beneficially or of record by such executive officers or over which such
executive officers have voting control, which represents less than 1.0% of the
issued and outstanding shares of ARPI Common Stock, in favor of the Mergers
and the other transactions contemplated hereby;

 



 

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the execution of this Agreement and to prescribe
various conditions to the Mergers; and

 



 

WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that (i) the Parent
Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " **Code** "),
and this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a "plan of
reorganization" with respect to the Parent Merger for purposes of Sections 354
and 361 of the Code, and (ii) the Partnership Merger shall qualify as and
constitute an "asset-over" form of merger under Treasury Regulations Section
1.708-1(c)(3)(i) with AMH OP being a continuation of ARP OP pursuant to
Treasury Regulations Section 1.708-1(c)(1) and with the holders of ARP OP
Units and ARPI LTIP Units (other than ARPI and ARP GP) being treated as
selling their ARP OP Units and ARPI LTIP Units to AMH OP in exchange for the
Partnership Fractional Unit Consideration and LTIP Fractional Unit
Consideration, as applicable, as provided in this Agreement.

 **THE MERGERS**

 



 

Section 2.1 _The Partnership Merger_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DRULPA and the DE LLC Act,
at the Partnership Merger Effective Time, OP Merger Sub shall merge with and
into ARP OP, with ARP OP continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of AMH OP, and AMH OP continuing as the operating partnership of
AMH. The Partnership Merger shall have the effects provided in this Agreement
and as specified in the DRULPA and the DE LLC Act.

 



 

(b) The Parties shall cause the Partnership Merger to be consummated by
filing, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, a certificate of merger
with respect to the Partnership Merger (the " **Certificate of Partnership
Merger** ") the SSSD in accordance with the DRULPA and the DE LLC Act, in such
form as required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions
of, the DRULPA and the DE LLC Act. The Parties shall make all other filings,
recordings or publications required under the DRULPA and the DE LLC Act in
connection with the Partnership Merger.

 



 

(c) The Partnership Merger shall become effective upon such time as the
Certificate of Partnership Merger has been filed with the SSSD, or such later
time which the Parties hereto shall have agreed upon and designated in such
filings in accordance with the DRULPA as the effective time of the Partnership
Merger, but not to exceed 30 days after the certificates of merger have been
accepted for record by the relevant governmental office (the " **Partnership
Merger Effective Time** ").

 



 

(d) If the consummation of the Partnership Merger prior to the consummation of
the Parent Merger (and, therefore, the Partnership Merger Effective Time
occurring prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time), as is contemplated by
this Agreement, would cause any of the Parties to incur a materially greater
amount of Transfer Taxes or any other adverse Tax consequences than would be
incurred if the Partnership Merger were consummated following the consummation
of the Parent Merger (and, therefore, if the Partnership Merger Effective Time
were to occur following the Parent Merger Effective Time), then,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, and with the
written consent of AMH and ARPI (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), the timing of the consummation of

 



      
 

 



 

the Parent Merger and Partnership Merger shall be re-ordered so that the
Partnership Merger shall occur and be consummated following the consummation
of the Parent Merger (and, therefore, the Partnership Merger Effective Time
will occur following the Parent Merger Effective Time).

 



 

Section 2.2 _The Parent Merger_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the applicable provisions of
the DE LLC Act and the MGCL, at the Parent Merger Effective Time, ARPI shall
be merged with and into AMH Merger Sub, with AMH Merger Sub continuing as the
surviving entity. The Parent Merger will have the effects set forth in the DE
LLC and the MGCL, as applicable.

 



 

(b) The Parties shall cause the Parent Merger to be consummated by filing as
soon as practicable on the Closing Date immediately after the Partnership

agreed in writing by the Parties (the " **Closing Date** "); provided,
however, that if the Closing would otherwise occur on a date that is within 30
days prior to the end of AMHs then-current fiscal quarter, AMH may elect to

compliance of such ARPI Designee with AMHs then-current corporate governance
guidelines and code of business conduct and ethics.

 



 

Section 2.6 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that, for federal income tax
purposes, (i) the Parent Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement be, and is

361 of the Code and (ii) the Partnership Merger shall qualify as and
constitute an "asset-over" form of merger under Treasury Regulations Section
1.708-1(c)(3)(i) with AMH OP being a continuation of ARP OP pursuant to

Unit Consideration, as applicable, as provided in this Agreement.

requested

 



       
 

 



 

by AMH, (ii) sell or cause to be sold all of the capital stock, shares of
beneficial interests, partnership interests, limited liability company
interests or other ownership interests owned, directly or indirectly, by ARPI,
ARP GP or ARP OP in one or more ARPI Subsidiaries to any Person at a price and
on terms all as designated by AMH, (iii) sell or cause to be sold any of the

ARP OP or any ARPI Subsidiary to transfer assets to one or more ARPI
Subsidiaries (such transactions contemplated by clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and
(iv) being " **Restructuring Transactions** ").

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) none of the Restructuring Transactions
shall delay or prevent the Closing, (ii) the Restructuring Transactions shall
be implemented as close as possible to the Closing (but after AMH shall have
waived (to the extent permissible) or confirmed that all of the conditions to
AMHs, AMH OPs, AMH Merger Subs and OP Merger Subs obligations to
consummate the Mergers set forth in _Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.2_ have
been satisfied), (iii) none of ARPI, ARP GP, ARP OP or any ARPI Subsidiary
shall be required to take any action in contravention of any Law, its
Organizational Documents or any ARPI Material Contract, (iv) the consummation
of any such Restructuring Transactions shall be contingent upon the receipt by
ARPI of a written notice from AMH confirming that all of the conditions to
AMHs, AMH OPs, AMH Merger Subs and OP Merger Subs obligations to
consummate the Mergers set forth in _Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.2_ have
been satisfied (or, at the option of AMH, waived) and that AMH, AMH OP, AMH
Merger Sub and OP Merger Sub are prepared to proceed immediately with the
Closing and any other evidence reasonably requested by ARPI that the Closing
will occur (it being understood that in any event the Restructuring
Transactions will be deemed to have occurred prior to the Closing), (v) the
Restructuring Transactions (or the inability to complete the Restructuring
Transactions) shall not affect or modify in any respect the obligations of
AMH, AMH OP, AMH Merger Sub and OP Merger Sub under this Agreement, including
payment of the Merger Consideration, the Partnership Merger Consideration and
the LTIP Consideration, (vi) none of ARPI, ARP GP, ARP OP or any ARPI
Subsidiary shall be required to take any such action that could adversely
affect the classification of ARPI as, or its qualification for taxation as, a
REIT prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time, and (vii) none of ARPI, ARP
GP, ARP OP or any ARPI Subsidiary shall be required to take any such action
that would reasonably be expected to result in an amount of Taxes being
imposed on, or other adverse Tax consequences to, any stockholder or other
equity interest holder of ARPI or ARP OP (in such persons capacity as a
stockholder or other equity interest holder of ARPI or ARP OP), or other
material adverse consequences to the stockholders or other equity interest
holders of ARPI or ARP OP as a whole, that are incrementally greater or more
adverse, as the case may be, than the Taxes or other adverse consequences to
such party in connection with the consummation of this Agreement in the
absence of such action taken pursuant to this _Section 2.7_ unless such
holders are indemnified by the AMH Parties for such incremental Taxes or other
consequences (provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, this clause (vii)
shall prohibit AMH from requiring ARPI to take any action that will trigger
any liability under any ARPI Tax Protection Agreement).

 



 

(c) ARPI shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with AMH in
connection with any Restructuring Transaction. AMH shall, upon request by ARPI
or ARP OP, advance to ARPI or ARP OP all reasonable out-of-pocket costs to be
incurred by ARPI or ARP OP or, promptly upon request by ARPI or ARP OP,
reimburse ARPI or ARP OP for all

 



      
 

 



 

reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by ARPI or ARP OP in connection with
any actions taken by ARPI or ARP OP in accordance with this _Section 2.7_
(including reasonable fees and expenses of their Representatives). Without
limiting the foregoing, none of the representations, warranties or covenants
of the ARPI Parties shall be deemed to apply to, or be deemed breached or
violated by, any of the Restructuring Transactions.

amount sufficient to pay the Fractional Share Consideration and any dividends
under _Section 3.5(d)_ (such evidence of book-entry AMH Common Shares and

holders of shares of ARPI Common Stock. AMH shall cause the Exchange Agent to
make, and the Exchange Agent shall make, delivery of the Merger Consideration,
payment of the Fractional Share Consideration and any amounts payable in
respect of dividends or other distributions on AMH Common Shares in accordance
with _Section 3.5(d)_ out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this
Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 



 

(b) The cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange
Agent as directed by AMH. Interest and other income on the Exchange Fund shall
be the sole and exclusive property of AMH. No investment of the Exchange Fund
shall relieve AMH or the Exchange Agent from making the payments required by
this _Article III_, and following any losses from any such investment, AMH
shall promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent to the extent
necessary to satisfy AMHs obligations hereunder for the benefit of the
holders of shares of ARPI Common Stock at the Parent Merger Effective Time,
which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Exchange Fund.

 



 

(c) _Exchange Procedures_.

 



 

(i) As promptly as practicable following the Parent Merger Effective Time (but
in no event later than five Business Days thereafter), AMH shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail (and to make available for collection by hand) to each
holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share (A) a letter of
transmittal (a " **Letter of Transmittal** ") which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall pass only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange
Agent, which Letter of Transmittal shall be in such form and have

 



      
 

 



 

such other customary provisions as AMH and ARPI may reasonably agree upon, and
(B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration into which the
number of shares of ARPI Common Stock previously represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall have been converted pursuant to this
Agreement, together with any amounts payable in respect of the Fractional
Share Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.8_ and dividends or other
distributions on AMH Common Shares in accordance with _Section 3.5(d)_.

 



 

(ii) Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share (or affidavit of loss
in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent, together with a Letter of Transmittal
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each
ARPI Common Share formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_ plus any Fractional Share
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of _Section 3.8_ and any amounts that such holder has the right to
receive in respect of dividends or other distributions on AMH Common Shares in
accordance with _Section 3.5(d)_ to be mailed or delivered by wire transfer
promptly following the later to occur of (A) the Parent Merger Effective Time
or (B) the Exchange Agents receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss
in lieu thereof), and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof)
so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall accept
such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) upon compliance with
such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to
effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with customary exchange
practices. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.5_, each
Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed, at any time after the Parent
Merger Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive, upon such
surrender, the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article III_. No
interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration or the
Fractional Share Consideration payable upon the surrender of the Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares and any distributions to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to _Section 3.5(d)_ hereof.

 



 

(iii) In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of ARPI Common Stock
that is not registered in the transfer records of ARPI, it shall be a
condition of payment that any Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Section 3.5(c)_ shall be
properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer Taxes and
other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share
surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of AMH
that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.

 



 

(d) _Dividends with Respect to AMH Common Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to AMH Common Shares with a record date after the
Parent Merger Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the AMH Common Shares issuable hereunder, and all
such dividends and other distributions shall be paid by AMH to the Exchange
Agent and shall be included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until the
surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) in accordance with this Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws,
following surrender of any such

 



      
 

 



 

Certificate or Book-Entry Share (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) there
shall be paid to the holder thereof, without interest, (i) the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Parent Merger
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such AMH Common Shares to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Parent Merger Effective Time but prior to such
surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such AMH Common Shares.

 



 

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any Fractional Share Consideration and any applicable dividends or
other distributions with respect to AMH Common Shares) which remains
undistributed to the holders of shares of ARPI Common Stock for 12 months
after the Parent Merger Effective Time shall be delivered to AMH, upon demand,
and any former holders of shares of ARPI Common Stock prior to the Parent
Merger who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ shall
thereafter look only to AMH for payment of the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(f) _No Liability_. None of the AMH Parties, the ARPI Parties or the Exchange
Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent or Affiliate thereof, shall
be liable to any person in respect of the Merger Consideration, as applicable,
if the Exchange Fund has been delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of any such shares immediately prior to the time at which
such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any
Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of AMH, free and clear of any claims or interest of such
holders or their successors, assigns or personal representatives previously
entitled thereto.

 



 

Section 3.6 _Withholding Rights_. The Parties, ARP OP, AMH OP, OP Merger Sub,
the respective Affiliates of the foregoing and the Exchange Agent, as
applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration, the Partnership Merger
Consideration, the Partnership Fractional Unit Consideration, the LTIP
Consideration and the LTIP Fractional Unit Consideration (and any other
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement), such amounts as
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payments under the
Code or any other provision of state, local or foreign Law. Any such amounts
so deducted and withheld shall be paid over to the applicable Governmental
Authority in accordance with applicable Law and shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

Section 3.7 _Structure_. Each party hereto shall cooperate reasonably in the
consideration of any changes regarding the structure of the transactions
contemplated herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such change shall (a)
alter or change the amount or kind of the consideration to be issued to
holders of shares of ARPI Common Stock or ARP OP Units as currently
contemplated in this Agreement, (b) reasonably be expected to impose any
material impediment or delay, or condition to, consummation of the Mergers,

holders of ARP OP Units (other than to the extent solely from ARP GP, as
general partner of ARP OP). In the event that the Parties mutually agree to
make such a change, the Parties agree to execute appropriate documents to
reflect the change.

 



 

Section 3.8 _No Fractional Shares or New AMH OP Units_. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of ARPI Common Stock
converted pursuant to the Parent Merger and each holder of ARP OP Units and
ARPI LTIP Units converted pursuant to the Partnership Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of an AMH Common Share or a

or made adequate provisions for, all material Taxes required to be paid by
them, whether or not shown on any Tax return. Neither ARPI nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received a written claim, or to the Knowledge of ARPI, an
unwritten claim, by any authority in a jurisdiction where any of them does not
file Tax Returns that it is or may be subject to taxation by that
jurisdiction.

 



 

(b) ARPI was formed under the laws of Maryland as a corporation on March 30,
2012. On April 6, 2012, ARPI filed a valid election to be treated as an S
corporation with an effective date of March 30, 2012. ARPI revoked its tax
status as an S corporation by filing a properly executed statement providing
that it revokes the election made under Code Section 1362(a) (the "
**Revocation Statement** ") effective as of May 10, 2012 (the " **Revocation
Date** "). ARPI obtained the properly executed consent of stockholders holding
a majority of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock on the
Revocation Date and attached such consents to the Revocation Statement. ARPI
filed the Revocation Statement with the IRS service center in Ogden, UT, the
service center with which ARPI filed its S corporation election. The
Revocation Statement and the stockholder consents attached thereto complied in
all respects with the requirements set forth under Treasury Regulations
Sections 1.1362-6(a)(3) and 1.1362-6(b).

 



 

(c) ARPI (i) for all taxable years commencing May 10, 2012 and through
December 31, 2014, has been subject to taxation as a real estate investment
trust within the meaning of Sections 856 and 857 of the Code (a " **REIT** ")
and has satisfied all requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT
for such years; (ii) has operated since May 10, 2012 and will operate to the
Parent Merger Effective Time in a manner consistent with the requirements for
qualification and taxation as a REIT; (iii) intends to continue to operate in
such a manner as to qualify as a REIT for its taxable year ending with the
Parent Merger; and (iv) has not taken or omitted to take any action that could
reasonably be expected to result in a challenge by the IRS to its status as a
REIT, and to the Knowledge of ARPI, no such challenge is pending or
threatened. No entity in which ARPI owns an interest, directly or indirectly,
is a corporation for federal income tax purposes, other than a corporation
that qualifies as a "qualified REIT subsidiary" within the meaning of Section
856(i)(2) of the Code (" **Qualified REIT Subsidiary** ") or a "taxable REIT
subsidiary" within the meaning of Section 856(l) of the Code (" **Taxable REIT
Subsidiary** "). _Section 4.12(c)_ of the ARPI Disclosure Letter sets forth a
list of each Qualified REIT Subsidiary and Taxable REIT Subsidiary of ARPI,
and each entity in which ARPI owns an interest not set forth in _Section
4.12(c)_ of the ARPI Disclosure Letter is and has been since its formation
classified as a partnership or entity disregarded as separate from ARPI or an
entity in which ARPI owns an interest for federal income tax purposes. Taking
into account all distributions to be made by ARPI prior to the Parent Merger
Effective Time, ARPI will have distributed cash to its stockholders in its
taxable year ending with the Parent Merger in an amount equal to or in excess
of the amount required to be distributed pursuant to Section 857(a) of the
Code in respect of its taxable year ending with the Parent Merger, and ARPI
will not be subject to Tax under Sections 857(b) or 4981 of the Code in
respect of its taxable year ending with the Parent Merger.

 



 

(d) Each ARPI Subsidiary that is a partnership, joint venture or limited
liability company and has not elected to be a Taxable REIT Subsidiary has been
since its

 



      
 

 



 

formation treated for federal income tax purposes as a partnership or
disregarded entity, as the case may be, and not as a corporation or an
association taxable as a corporation.

 



 

(e) (i) There are no audits, investigations by any Governmental Authority or
other proceedings on-going or, to the Knowledge of ARPI, threatened with
regard to any Taxes or Tax Returns of ARPI or any ARPI Subsidiary; (ii) to the
Knowledge of ARPI, except as set forth in _Section 4.12(e)(ii)_ of the ARPI
Disclosure Letter, no deficiency for Taxes of ARPI or any ARPI Subsidiary has
been claimed, proposed or assessed in writing or threatened, by any
Governmental Authority, which deficiency has not yet been settled, except for
such deficiencies which are being contested in good faith; (iii) except as set
forth in _Section 4.12(e)(iii)_ of the ARPI Disclosure Letter, neither ARPI
nor any ARPI Subsidiary has waived any statute of limitations with respect to
the assessment of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to any
Tax assessment or deficiency for any open tax year or is the beneficiary of an
extension of time to file any Tax Return except for any such waivers or
extensions relating to an extension of time to file any non-income Tax Return
obtained in the ordinary course of business; and (iv) except as set forth in
_Section 4.12(e)_ of the ARPI Disclosure Letter, neither ARPI nor any of the
ARPI Subsidiaries has entered into any "closing agreement" as described in
Section 7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state,
local or foreign income Tax Law).

 



 

(f) Neither ARPI nor any ARPI Subsidiary hold any asset the disposition of
which would be subject to (or to rules similar to) Section 1374 of the Code.

 



 

(g) Beginning with its taxable year ended December 31, 2012, (i) ARPI and the
ARPI Subsidiaries have not incurred any liability for material Taxes under
Sections 856(g)(5)(C), 857(b)(1), 857(b)(4), 857(b)(5), 857(b)(6)(A),
857(b)(7), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code which have not been previously paid and
shall not incur any such liability for such Taxes in the taxable year ending
on the Closing Date, and (ii) neither ARPI nor any ARPI Subsidiary has
incurred any material liability for Taxes other than (x) in the ordinary
course of business or consistent with past practice, or (y) transfer or
similar Taxes arising in connection with a sale, exchange, or other transfer
of property. No event has occurred, and no condition or circumstance exists,
which presents a material risk that any material Tax described in the
preceding sentence will be imposed upon ARPI or the ARPI Subsidiaries.

 



 

(h) ARPI and the ARPI Subsidiaries have complied, in all material respects,
with all applicable Laws, rules and regulations relating to the payment and

any state and foreign Laws) and have duly and timely withheld and, in each
case, have paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority all material
amounts required to be so withheld and paid over on or prior to the due date
thereof under all applicable Laws.

 



 

(i) There are no ARPI Tax Protection Agreements in force, and no person has
raised in writing, or, to the Knowledge of ARPI, threatened to raise, a
material claim against ARPI or any ARPI Subsidiary for any breach of any ARPI
Tax Protection Agreements. As used herein, " **ARPI Tax Protection
Agreements** " means any written agreement to which ARPI or any ARPI
Subsidiary is a party (i) pursuant to which any liability to holders of
interests in an

 



      
 

 



 

ARPI Subsidiary Partnership relating to Taxes may arise, whether or not as a
result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
or (ii) that was entered into in connection with or related to the deferral of
income Taxes of a holder of interests in an ARPI Subsidiary Partnership, and
that requires ARPI or any ARPI Subsidiary (A) to maintain a minimum level of
debt, continue a particular debt or provide rights to guarantee, or otherwise
assume economic risk of loss with respect to, debt, (B) to retain or not
dispose of assets, or engage in transactions of comparable tax effect, (C) to
make or refrain from making a Tax election, or (D) only dispose of assets in a
particular manner. As used herein, " **ARPI Subsidiary Partnership** " means
an ARPI Subsidiary that is a partnership for federal income tax purposes.

 



 

(j) There are no Tax Liens upon any property or assets of ARPI or any ARPI
Subsidiary except Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable or that are being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate
reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP.

 



 

(k) Neither ARPI nor any ARPI Subsidiary has requested or has received any
written ruling of a Governmental Authority, or has entered into any written
agreement with a Governmental Authority with respect to any Taxes.

with respect to which ARPI or any ARPI Subsidiary is a party (other than
customary arrangements under commercial contracts or borrowings entered into
in the ordinary course of business and ARPI Tax Protection Agreements).

 



 

(m) Neither ARPI nor any ARPI Subsidiary (A) has been a member of an
affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return or (B) has
any liability for the Taxes of any Person (other than ARPI or any ARPI
Subsidiary) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local, or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by
contract, or otherwise.

 



 

(n) Neither ARPI nor any ARPI Subsidiary has participated in any "reportable
transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b).

 



 

(o) Neither ARPI nor any of the ARPI Subsidiaries has constituted either a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning
of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock qualifying for
tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (A) in the two years prior to
the date of this Agreement or (B) in a distribution which could otherwise
constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the
meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(p) Except as set forth in _Section 4.12(p)_ of the ARPI Disclosure Letter,
no written power of attorney that has been granted by ARPI or any of the ARPI
Subsidiaries (other than to ARPI or an ARPI Subsidiary) currently is in force
with respect to any matter relating to Taxes.

 



      
 

 



 

(q) The Parties agree and acknowledge that the representations and warranties
set forth in this _Section 4.12_ are made based upon the assumptions that (i)
between the time of the Partnership Merger and the Parent Merger, the assets
and income of AMH OP and its Subsidiaries, (other than those assets formerly
held by ARP OP and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Partnership
Merger, and the income attributable thereto for such period) are such that
they would allow ARPI to qualify as a REIT on standalone basis with respect to
such time period and (ii) the Parties will comply with the their obligations
under the covenant in _Section 7.11(c)_. The Parties agree and acknowledge
that the purpose and intent of these qualifications and assumptions is that
ARPI is not making any representations or warranties in this _Section 4.12_
as to the assets or income of AMH OP immediately prior to the Partnership
Merger. Nothing in this _Section 4.12(q)_ shall limit ARPIs obligations
under _Section 7.11(c)_.

857(b)(6) of the Code or engaged in any transaction that would give rise to
"redetermined rents, redetermined deductions and excess interest" described in
Section 857(b)(7) of the Code.

 



 

(v) This _Section 4.12_ contains the sole and exclusive representations and
warranties of the ARPI Parties with respect to Taxes and Tax matters (other

comments from the SEC with respect thereto, or (y) submitting the NYSE listing
application to the NYSE or responding to any comments from the NYSE with
respect thereto, each of ARPI and AMH shall cooperate and provide the other a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response
(including the proposed final version of such document or response) and shall
give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments thereon made by
the other or its counsel and, with respect to clause (x) above, each of ARPI
and AMH also shall have consented to the filing and mailing contemplated
therein (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). AMH shall advise ARPI, promptly after it receives notice thereof,
(A) of the time of effectiveness of the Form S-4, the issuance of any stop
order relating thereto or the suspension of the qualification of the AMH
Common Shares issuable in connection with the Parent Merger for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction, and AMH shall use its reasonable best efforts to
have any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise
terminated and (B) of the time the NYSE listing application is accepted. AMH
shall take any other action required to be taken under the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, NYSE rules and regulations, any applicable foreign or state
securities or "blue sky" Laws and the rules and regulations thereunder in
connection with the issuance of the AMH Common Shares in connection with the
Parent Merger, and ARPI shall furnish all information concerning ARPI and the
holders of the shares of ARPI Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any such actions. AMH shall also take any other action
required to be taken under the Securities Act, any applicable foreign or state

 



      
 

 



 

securities or "blue sky" Laws and the rules and regulations thereunder in
connection with the issuance of the New AMH OP Units in connection with the
Partnership Merger, and ARPI shall furnish all information concerning ARPI,
ARP OP and the holders of the ARP OP Units as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any such actions.

 



 

(b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the ARPI Stockholder Approval, any
information relating to ARPI or AMH, or any of their respective Affiliates,
should be discovered by ARPI or AMH which, in the reasonable judgment of ARPI
or AMH, should be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, any of the
Form S-4 or the Prospectus/Proxy Statement, respectively, so that any of such
documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties, and ARPI
and AMH shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary
amendment of, or supplement to, the Prospectus/Proxy Statement or the Form S-4
and, to the extent required by Law, in disseminating the information contained
in such amendment or supplement to stockholders of ARPI. For purposes of
_Section 4.15_, _Section 5.14_ and this _Section 7.1_, any information
concerning or related to ARPI, its Affiliates or the ARPI Stockholder Meeting
will be deemed to have been provided by ARPI, and any information concerning
or related to AMH or its Affiliates will be deemed to have been provided by
AMH. Nothing in this _Section 7.1(b)_ shall limit the obligations of any
Party under _Section 7.1(a)_.

 



 

(c) Subject to the exercise of ARPIs rights with respect to a Superior
Proposal in accordance with _Section 7.4_, ARPI shall, in accordance with
applicable Law and the ARPI Charter and the ARPI Bylaws, establish a record
date (which shall be as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date
of this Agreement) for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold, the ARPI
Stockholder Meeting; _provided_ that such record date shall not be more than
60 days prior to the date of the ARPI Stockholder Meeting. ARPI shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Prospectus/Proxy Statement to be mailed
to the stockholders of ARPI entitled to vote at the ARPI Stockholder Meeting
and, subject to the exercise of ARPIs rights with respect to a Superior
Proposal in accordance with _Section 7.4_, to hold the ARPI Stockholder
Meeting as soon as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under
the Securities Act and in any event not more than 40 days thereafter without
AMHs prior written consent. ARPI shall, through the ARPI Board, recommend to
its stockholders that they vote in favor of the Parent Merger, include such
recommendation in the Prospectus/Proxy Statement and solicit and use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the ARPI Stockholder Approval, except to the
extent that the ARPI Board shall have made a Change in ARPI Recommendation as
permitted by _Section 7.4(b)_ and subject to the exercise of ARPIs rights
with respect to a Superior Proposal in accordance with _Section 7.4_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 7.1(c)_, if, on a
date for which the ARPI Stockholder Meeting is scheduled, ARPI has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of ARPI Common
Stock to obtain the ARPI Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is
present, ARPI shall, upon the request of AMH, make one or more successive
postponements or adjournments of the ARPI Stockholder Meeting solely for the
purpose of and for the times reasonably necessary to solicit additional
proxies and votes in favor of the Parent Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ that the ARPI Stockholder Meeting shall not be
postponed or adjourned to a date that is (i) more than 30 days after the date
for which the ARPI Stockholder Meeting was originally

 



      
 

 



 

scheduled (excluding any postponement or adjournments required by applicable
Law), (ii) more than 60 days following the record date established in
accordance with this _Section 7.1(c)_, or (iii) later than the Outside Date.

 



 

(d) Subject to the exercise of ARPIs rights with respect to a Superior
Proposal in accordance with _Section 7.4_, ARPI will use its reasonable best
efforts to hold the ARPI Stockholder Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable
after the date of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.2 _Access to Information_.

 



 

(a) During the Interim Period, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and
contracts, and subject to reasonable protocols described in writing
implemented from time to time upon advice of outside counsel, each of ARPI and
AMH shall, and shall cause each of the ARPI Subsidiaries and the AMH
Subsidiaries, respectively, to, afford to the other Party and to the
Representatives of such other Party reasonable access during normal business
hours and upon reasonable advance notice to all of their respective
properties, offices, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records and,
during such period, each of ARPI and AMH shall, and shall cause each of the
ARPI Subsidiaries and the AMH Subsidiaries, respectively, to, (i) furnish
reasonably promptly to the other Party a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities Laws, except to
the extent such materials are otherwise publicly available, and (ii) furnish,
upon reasonable request, all other information (financial or otherwise)
concerning its business, properties and personnel as such other party may
reasonably request. No representation or warranty as to the accuracy of
information provided pursuant to this _Section 7.2_ is made and the Parties
may not rely on the accuracy of such information except to the extent
expressly set forth in the representations and warranties included in _Article
IV_ or _Article V_, and no investigation under this _Section 7.2_ or
otherwise shall affect any of the representations and warranties of the ARPI
Parties or of the AMH Parties, respectively, contained in this Agreement or
any condition to the obligations of the Parties under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither ARPI nor AMH shall be required by this
_Section 7.2_ to provide the other Party or the Representatives of such other
Party with access to or to disclose information (x) that is subject to the
terms of a confidentiality agreement with a Third Party entered into prior to
the date of this Agreement or entered into after the date of this Agreement in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice (if ARPI or AMH,
as applicable, has used its reasonable best efforts to obtain permission or
consent of such Third Party to such disclosure), (y) the disclosure of which
would violate any Law or legal duty of the Party or any of its Representatives
(if ARPI or AMH, as applicable, has used its reasonable best efforts to make
appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure not in
violation of any Law or legal duty) or (z) that is subject to any attorney-
client, attorney work product or other legal privilege or would cause a risk
of a loss of privilege to the disclosing Party (if ARPI or AMH, as applicable,
has used its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure to
the maximum extent that does not result in a loss of any such attorney-client,
attorney work product or other legal privilege, including by means of entry
into a customary joint defense agreement that would alleviate the loss of such
privilege). Each of ARPI and AMH will use its reasonable best efforts to
minimize any disruption to the businesses of the other Party that may result
from the requests for access, data and information hereunder. Prior to the
Partnership Merger Effective Time, (A) each of the ARPI Parties and each of
the AMH Parties shall not, and shall

 



      
 

 



 

cause their respective Representatives and Affiliates not to, contact or
otherwise communicate with parties with which the other Party has a business
relationship (including tenants/subtenants), regarding the business of such
other Party or this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby without
the prior written consent of such other Party not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, and (B) the ARPI Parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts, at AMHs request, to arrange calls or meetings between the
AMH Parties and/or their Representatives and the lessees under the Mack Lease
and/or Heartland Lease, provided that management of ARPI shall have the option
to be present at, and participate, in all such calls or meetings ( _provided_
that, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 7.2(a)_ shall be
deemed to restrict a Party and its Representatives and Affiliates from
contacting such parties in pursuing its own business activities (operating in
the ordinary course)).

 



 

(b) ARPI shall provide AMH with audited financial statements that would be
required to be included in an Annual Report on Form 10-K with respect to the
fiscal year ending December 31, 2015 as promptly as reasonably practicable,
but in any event not later than February 28, 2016 or, if earlier, the Closing.
In the event that the Closing has not occurred prior to March 31, 2016, ARPI
shall begin and continue the review under SAS 71 of its financial statements
for the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2016 with its independent auditors.

 



 

(c) Any information exchanged pursuant to this _Section 7.2_ shall be subject
to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full
force and effect pursuant to the terms thereof notwithstanding the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Each of ARPI and AMH will give prompt written notice to the other upon
becoming aware of the occurrence or impending occurrence of any event or
circumstance relating to it or any of the ARPI Subsidiaries or the AMH
Subsidiaries, respectively, which could reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, an ARPI Material Adverse Effect or an AMH
Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be.

 



 

(e) ARPI shall give prompt notice to AMH (i) of any notice or other
communication received by ARPI or its Affiliates (A) from any Governmental
Authority in connection with this Agreement or the Mergers or the other
transactions contemplated hereby, (B) from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person (or another Person) is or may be required in connection
with the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated hereby, or (C) from
any Person in connection with any material violation or default under or
notice to terminate, not renew or challenge the validity or enforceability of
any ARPI Material Contract, (ii) of any Action commenced or, to ARPIs
Knowledge, threatened against, ARPI or any ARPI Subsidiaries or otherwise
relating to, involving or affecting ARPI or any ARPI Subsidiaries, in each
case in connection with, arising from or otherwise relating to the Mergers or
any other transaction contemplated hereby, and (iii) upon becoming aware of
the occurrence or impending occurrence of any event, change, development or
circumstance relating to it or any ARPI Subsidiary which makes or is
reasonably likely to make any of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_
to not be satisfied. The failure to deliver any such notice, in and of itself,
shall not result in the failure of, or otherwise affect, any of the conditions
set forth in _Article VIII_.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) ARPI shall cooperate and participate, as reasonably requested by AMH from
time to time, in efforts to oversee the integration of the Parties operations
in connection with, and taking effect upon consummation of, the Mergers
subject to applicable Law, including providing such reports on operational
matters and participating on such teams and committees as AMH shall reasonably
request (including tenant billings and other data files for the purpose of
system integration and testing and compensation and payroll data files for the
purpose of payroll system integration and testing).

 



 

Section 7.3 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Parties
shall use its reasonable best efforts (subject to, and in accordance with,
applicable Law) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do promptly,
or cause to be done promptly, and to assist and cooperate with each other in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to
consummate and make effective, as promptly as practicable, the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, but not limited
to, preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to
effect all required filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations,
submissions of information, applications and other documents necessary to
consummate the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate with the other
Parties in determining which filings are required to be made prior to the
Closing with, and which consents, clearances, approvals, permits or
authorizations are required to be obtained prior to the Closing from, any
Governmental Authority in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and in timely making all such filings, (ii) promptly
furnish the other Parties, subject in appropriate cases of sensitive or
proprietary information to appropriate confidentiality agreements to limit
disclosure to outside lawyers and consultants, with such information and
reasonable assistance as such other Parties and their Affiliates may
reasonably request in connection with their preparation of necessary filings,
registrations and submissions of information to any Governmental Authority
with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii)
supply as promptly as reasonably practicable and to the extent necessary any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant
to any applicable Laws by any Governmental Authority, and (iv) take or cause
to be taken all other actions necessary, proper or advisable to obtain
necessary or advisable clearances, consents, authorizations, approvals or
waivers and cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
periods with respect to the Mergers under any applicable Laws as promptly as
reasonably practicable and, in any event, no later than the Outside Date.

 



 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Parties
shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in _Section 7.3(a)_, use its
reasonable best efforts to: (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in
connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding
initiated by a private party with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) promptly notify the other Parties of
any material communication concerning this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby to that Party from or with any Governmental
Authority and consider in good faith the views of the other Parties and keep
the other Parties reasonably informed of the status of matters related to the

 



      
 

 



 

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including furnishing the other
with copies of any written notices or other material communications received
by such Party from, or given by such Party to, any U.S. or foreign
Governmental Authority and of any material communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any
of the transactions contemplated hereby, except that any materials concerning
one Partys valuation of another Party may be redacted; and (iii) to the
extent reasonably practicable, permit the other Parties to review in draft any
proposed written communication to be submitted by it to any Governmental
Authority with reasonable time and opportunity to comment, and consult with
each other in advance of any in-person or telephonic meeting or conference
with any Governmental Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a
private party with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, with any other Person, and, to the extent permitted by the applicable
Governmental Authority or Person, use its reasonable best efforts not to
participate in any meeting or discussion with any Governmental Authority
relating to any filings or investigations concerning this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby unless it consults with the other Parties
and their Representatives in advance and, so long as it is acceptable to the
Governmental Authority, invites the other Parties Representatives to attend
in accordance with applicable Laws. The Parties may, as they deem advisable
and necessary, designate competitively sensitive information provided to the
other under this _Section 7.3_ as "outside counsel only." Such materials and
the information contained therein shall be given only to outside counsel of
the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers, or directors of the recipient without the advance written consent of
the Party providing such materials.

 



 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Parties shall (i) use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve objections, if any, as may be asserted with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Laws,
including defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial
or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including seeking to have any stay,
temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction entered by any court or
other Governmental Authority vacated or reversed), and (ii) take, or cause to
be taken, all such further reasonable actions as may be necessary to resolve
such objections, if any, as any Governmental Authority or any other Person may
assert under any Law with respect to the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, and to avoid or eliminate every impediment under any Law
so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as reasonably practicable
and, in any event, no later than the Outside Date. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall AMH or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates be required to (x) propose, negotiate, commit to or
effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture, license or disposition of any assets of AMH or any of its
Subsidiaries (including ARPI and the ARPI Subsidiaries after the Closing) or
Affiliates, or (y) otherwise take or commit to take any actions that after the
Closing would limit the freedom of AMH or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates freedom of action with respect to one or more of AMHs, ARPIs or
their Subsidiaries businesses or assets. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any
other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this _Section 7.3_ shall limit
a Partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_ so long
as such Party has, prior to such termination, been complying with its
obligations under this _Section 7.3_.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Each of AMH and ARPI shall, if any Takeover Statute becomes applicable to
this Agreement, the Mergers, or any other transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, grant approvals and use all reasonable best efforts to ensure that
the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby or
thereby and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Takeover Statute on this
Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 7.4 _Acquisition Proposals; Changes in Recommendation_.

 



 

(a) ARPI agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, and its
and their respective officers, trustees, directors, employees and
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the making of any
proposal or offer (whether written or oral, binding or nonbinding, publicly
announced or confidentially submitted) by or with a Third Party with respect
to (A) any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination or
similar transaction involving ARPI or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) any direct
or indirect sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, license, transfer or
other disposition, directly or indirectly, by merger, consolidation, sale of
equity interests, share exchange, joint venture, partnership, business
combination or otherwise, of any of ARPIs assets or that of its Subsidiaries
(including stock or other ownership interests of its Subsidiaries)
representing 20% or more of the consolidated assets, as determined on a book-
value basis, or revenues or net income of ARPI and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, (C) any issue, sale or other direct or indirect disposition of
(including by way of merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture,
business combination, share exchange or any similar transaction) securities
(or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into,
such securities) representing 20% or more of the voting power of ARPI or any
of its Subsidiaries, (D) any tender offer or exchange offer in which any
Person or "group" (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act) shall seek to acquire beneficial ownership (as such term is
defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act), or the right to
acquire beneficial ownership, of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of any
class of the voting securities of ARPI or any of its Subsidiaries, (E) any
recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or other similar
type of transaction in which a Third Party shall acquire beneficial ownership
of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of any class of the voting securities
of ARPI or any of its Subsidiaries or (F) any combination of any of the
foregoing types of transactions if the sum of the percentage of consolidated
assets, consolidated revenues or earnings and voting power of securities of
ARPI and its Subsidiaries involved is 20% or more (any such inquiry, proposal,
offer, announcement or transaction (other than a proposal or offer made by one
Party or an Affiliate thereof to the other Party or an Affiliate thereof)
contemplating or otherwise relating to, or that could reasonably be expected
to lead to any of the foregoing, being hereinafter referred to as an "
**Acquisition Proposal** "), (ii) enter into, engage in, continue or otherwise
participate in any negotiations or discussions concerning, or provide any
confidential information or data to, or otherwise cooperate with, any person
relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or knowingly facilitate any effort or
attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve,
recommend, execute or enter into any letter of intent, indication of interest,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, asset purchase or share exchange
agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement (whether written or
oral, binding or nonbinding) related to any Acquisition Proposal (an "
**Acquisition Agreement** "), or (iv) propose publicly or agree to do any of
the foregoing.

 



      
 

 



 

(b)

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the ARPI Board shall be permitted, prior to
the ARPI Stockholder Meeting and subject to compliance with the other terms of
this _Section 7.4_ and to first entering into a confidentiality agreement
having provisions that are no less favorable to ARPI than those contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement (including the standstill provisions therein
effective until the Outside Date), to engage in discussions and negotiations
with, or provide any nonpublic information or data to, any Third Party in
response to an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by such
Third Party made after the date of this Agreement (provided ARPI and its
representatives did not breach this _Section 7.4_) and which the ARPI Board
concludes in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and
financial advisors) constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior
Proposal, if and only to the extent that the directors of ARPI conclude in
good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure to do
so would be inconsistent with their directors duties under applicable Law.
ARPI shall provide AMH with at least 48 hours prior notice of any meeting of
the ARPI Board at which it is reasonably expected to consider any Acquisition
Proposal. ARPI shall provide AMH with a copy of any nonpublic information or
data provided to a Third Party pursuant to this _Section 7.4(b)(i)_ prior to
or simultaneously with furnishing such information to such Third Party, and in
the event any nonpublic information or data is provided orally to such Third
Party, ARPI shall promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) provide AMH
with a written summary of such information or data. Neither ARPI nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall reimburse or agree to reimburse the expenses of any
Third Party in connection with any Acquisition Proposal unless this Agreement
shall have been terminated in accordance with the terms hereof.

 



 

(ii) ARPI shall notify AMH promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours)
after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any request for nonpublic
information relating to ARPI or any of its Subsidiaries by any person that
informs ARPI or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives that it is
considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry from
any person seeking to have discussions or negotiations relating to a possible
Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall be made orally and confirmed in
writing, and shall indicate the identity of the person making the Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry or request and the material terms and conditions of any
inquiries, proposals or offers (including an unredacted copy thereof if in
writing and any related documentation or correspondence and a written
description of any oral communications or discussions from or with the Third
Party making such Acquisition Proposal). ARPI shall also promptly, and in any
event within 24 hours, notify AMH, orally and in writing, if it intends to
enter into or enters into discussions or negotiations concerning any
Acquisition Proposal or provides nonpublic information or data to any person
in accordance with this _Section 7.4(b)_ and keep AMH informed in all
material respects of the status and terms of any such proposals, offers,
discussions or negotiations on a current basis (and in any case within 24
hours), including whether such Acquisition Proposal or request has been
withdrawn or rejected, any material change to the terms thereof and
concurrently providing a copy of all material documentation or correspondence
relating thereto and a written summary of any material oral communications or
discussions relating thereto. ARPI agrees that it and its Affiliates will not
enter into any agreement with any Person that prohibits ARPI from providing
any information to AMH in accordance with, or otherwise complying with, this
_Section 7.4_.

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) Except as provided in _Section 7.4(b)(iv)_ or _Section 7.4(b)(v)_,
neither the ARPI Board nor any committee thereof shall withhold, withdraw,
qualify or modify in any manner adverse to AMH, or propose publicly to
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify in any manner adverse to AMH, the
approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the ARPI Board or
any committee thereof with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (a " **Change in ARPI Recommendation** "). Except as
provided in _Section 7.4(b)(iv)_, the ARPI Board shall publicly reaffirm its
approval, recommendation and declaration of advisability of the Mergers and
the transactions contemplated hereby within four Business Days after requested
from time to time to do so by AMH and any failure to do so shall constitute a
Change in ARPI Recommendation as used herein.

 



 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal, the ARPI Board may make a Change in ARPI
Recommendation (and in the event that the ARPI Board determines such
Acquisition Proposal to be a Superior Proposal, in accordance with this
_Section 7.4_, terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_), if and
only if (A) an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal is made to
ARPI after the date hereof and is not withdrawn and ARPI has not breached this
_Section 7.4_, (B) the ARPI Board has concluded in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (C) the directors of
ARPI have concluded in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with their directors
duties under applicable Law, (D) four Business Days (the " **Notice Period**
") shall have elapsed since ARPI has given written notice to AMH advising AMH
that ARPI intends to take such action and specifying in reasonable detail the
reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of any such Superior
Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action and any information and
materials required to be delivered under _Section 7.4(b)(ii)_ that have not
yet been provided to AMH (including an unredacted copy of the most recent
version of any written agreement relating to the transaction that constitutes
a Superior Proposal or, if no such agreement exists, a written summary of the
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal) and any other related
available documentation and correspondence, including all draft or executed
financing commitments related thereto (a " **Notice of Recommendation Change**
"), (E) during such Notice Period, ARPI has, and has caused its
Representatives to, (if requested by AMH) negotiate with AMH and its
Representatives in good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases, in the
good faith judgment of the ARPI Board (after consultation with outside legal
counsel and financial advisors), to constitute a Superior Proposal, if AMH, in
its sole discretion, determines to make such adjustments, and (F) the
directors of ARPI, following such Notice Period, again reasonably determine in
good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel, and taking into
account any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed
by AMH) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with their directors
duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) if, during the
Notice Period, any material revisions are made to the Superior Proposal (it
being understood that a material revision shall include any change in the
purchase price or form or timing of payment of consideration in such Superior
Proposal), the ARPI Board shall give a new written notice to AMH and shall
comply with the requirements of this _Section 7.4(b)(iv)_ with respect to
such new written notice and (2) in the event the ARPI Board determines to make
a Change in ARPI Recommendation, pursuant to this _Section 7.4_ with respect
to another Superior Proposal or an amendment to a prior Superior Proposal, the
foregoing procedures referred to in this _Section 7.4(b)(iv)_ shall apply

 



       
 

 



 

anew and shall also apply to any subsequent withdrawal, amendment or change
with respect thereto.

 



 

(v) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.4_ shall prohibit ARPI from taking
and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making a statement contemplated by
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of
its position thereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that compliance with such
rules shall not in any way limit or modify the effect that any action taken
pursuant to such rules has under any other provision of this Agreement,
including _Section 7.1(c)_, and _provided_ , _further_ , that any such
disclosure that addresses the approval, recommendation or declaration of
advisability by the ARPI Board with respect to this Agreement or an
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a Change in ARPI Recommendation
unless the ARPI Board, in connection with such communication publicly states
that its recommendation with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby has not changed.

 



 

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, " **Superior Proposal** " means an
unsolicited written bona fide Acquisition Proposal (except that, for purposes
of this definition, the references in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal"
to 20% shall be replaced by "50%") made by a Third Party, on terms that the
ARPI Board determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation with
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, taking into account all
financial, legal, regulatory, timing and any other aspects of the transaction
described in such proposal and such other relevant factors (including the
identity of the Person making such proposal, the form of consideration,
ability to finance the Acquisition Proposal, any break-up fees, expense
reimbursement provisions, conditions to consummation and feasibility and
certainty of consummation (including whether consummation is reasonably
capable of being completed on a timely basis on the terms proposed and whether
such transaction constitutes a strategic transaction or change of control or
break-up of ARPI), as well as any changes to the financial terms of this
Agreement proposed by AMH in response to such proposal or otherwise), would,
if consummated, be more favorable to ARPI and its stockholders, from a
financial point of view, than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(d) ARPI agrees that (i) it will and will cause its Subsidiaries, and its and
their Representatives to, cease immediately and terminate any and all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any Third Party conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and cause, at AMHs
request, the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
previously furnished in connection therewith, and (ii) it will not release any
Third Party from, or waive or fail to enforce any provisions of, any (A)
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or (B) applicable Takeover
Statute. ARPI agrees that it will use its reasonable best efforts to promptly
inform its and its Subsidiaries respective Representatives of the obligations
undertaken in this _Section 7.4_.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding any Change in ARPI Recommendation, unless such Change in
ARPI Recommendation is with respect to a Superior Proposal and this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1_, ARPI shall cause the adoption of
this Agreement to be

 



      
 

 



 

submitted to a vote of its stockholders at the ARPI Stockholder Meeting in
accordance with _Section 7.1_.

 



 

(ii) Without the prior written consent of AMH (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), a proposal to approve the Parent Merger is
the only proposal, other than any say-on-golden parachute vote that may be
required pursuant to Section 14A(b)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-21(c)
thereunder and a proposal to approve the adjournment of the ARPI Stockholders
Meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional proxies, in the event that there
are not sufficient votes at the time of the ARPI Stockholders Meeting, to
obtain the approval of ARPIs stockholders, which ARPI shall propose to be
acted on by its stockholders at the ARPI Stockholders Meeting.

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section
7.4_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, if ARPI receives a written Acquisition
Proposal from any Third Party following the date hereof that is or may
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal and ARPI has not
breached this _Section 7.4_, then ARPI or its respective Representatives may
contact such Third Party in writing solely for the purpose of clarifying such
Acquisition Proposal (the " **Clarification Request** "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that ARPI shall deliver a copy of all Clarification Requests to
AMH concurrently with the delivery of such Clarification Requests to any Third
Party.

 



 

(e) References in this _Section 7.4_ to the ARPI Board shall mean the board
of directors of ARPI or a duly authorized committee thereof.

 



 

(f) ARPI shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any proposal
relating to any Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal other than the
Mergers prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms.

 



 

(g) ARPI shall ensure that its Subsidiaries and Representatives are aware of
the provisions of this _Section 7.4_ and any violation of the restrictions
contained in this _Section 7.4_ by any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives
shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 7.4_ by ARPI. Any breach of
this _Section 7.4_ shall be deemed to be a material breach of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.5 _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any Change in ARPI
Recommendation in accordance with _Section 7.4(b)(iv)_ or any action taken by
ARPI or the ARPI Board pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 7.4_, so
long as this Agreement is an effect, the Parties shall consult with each other
before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements or
filings with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and none of the Parties shall issue any such press release
or make any such public statement or filing prior to obtaining the other
Parties consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _however_ , that a Party may, without
obtaining the other Parties consent, issue such press release or make such
public statement or filing (a) as may be required by Law, Order or the
applicable rules of any stock exchange if for any reason it is not reasonably
practicable to consult with the other Party before making any public statement
with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (b) to the extent such press release or public statement or

 



      
 

 



 

filing contains information set forth in any previous press release, public
statement or filing made by any of the Parties in compliance with this
_Section 7.5_. The Parties have agreed upon the form of a joint press release
announcing the Mergers and the execution of this Agreement and shall make such
joint press release no later than one Business Day following the date on which
this Agreement is signed.

 



 

Section 7.6 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 



 

(a) AMH agrees that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Parent Merger
Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former trustees,
directors, officers, agents or fiduciaries of ARPI or any of the ARPI
Subsidiaries (the " **Indemnified Parties** ") as provided in the ARPI
Charter, the ARPI Bylaws, the ARP OP Agreement, any similar organizational
documents of any ARPI Subsidiary (the " **Organizational Documents** ") and
any indemnification agreement set forth on _Section 7.6(a)_ of the ARPI
Disclosure Letter (the " **Indemnification Agreements** "), in each case, as
in effect as of immediately prior to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, shall survive the Parent Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms, including by providing for such
provisions in the organizational documents of the surviving entities in each
of the Mergers. For a period of six years from the Parent Merger Effective
Time, (i) AMH shall and shall cause the AMH Subsidiaries (including AMH Merger
Sub and OP Merger Sub) to honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of
AMH and the AMH Subsidiaries (including AMH Merger Sub and OP Merger Sub) to
the Indemnified Parties under the Organizational Documents and any
Indemnification Agreement and (ii) the Organizational Documents, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified with respect
to acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time
for a period of six years from the Parent Merger Effective Time in any manner
that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or
prior to the Parent Merger Effective Time, were directors, officers, trustees,
agents or fiduciaries of ARPI or any of the ARPI Subsidiaries, unless such
modification shall be required by applicable Law and then only to the minimum
extent required by applicable Law.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, ARPI shall purchase, and
AMH shall cause to be maintained in full force and effect (and the obligations
under to be honored), during the six-year period beginning on the date of the
Partnership Merger Effective Time, a "tail" prepaid insurance policy or
policies (which policy or policies by their respective express terms shall
survive the Mergers), of at least the same coverage and amounts and containing
terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the directors, officers,
agents or fiduciaries of ARPI or any of the ARPI Subsidiaries as ARPIs and
the ARPI Subsidiaries existing policy or policies, for the benefit of the
current and former trustees, directors, officers, agents or fiduciaries of
ARPI and each ARPI Subsidiary with a claims period of six years from the
Partnership Merger Effective Time with respect to directors and officers
liability, employment practices liability and errors and omissions liability,
insurance for claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or prior to
the Partnership Merger Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall the aggregate premium payable for such "tail" insurance policy or
policies for its or their entire period exceed an amount per year of coverage
equal to 225% of the current annual premium paid by ARPI for such insurance
(such amount being the " **Maximum Premium** "). If ARPI is unable to obtain
the "tail" insurance described in

 



      
 

 



 

the first sentence of this _Section 7.6(b)_ for an amount equal to or less
than the Maximum Premium, ARPI shall be entitled to obtain as much comparable
"tail" insurance as possible for an amount equal to the Maximum Premium. If
ARPI is unable to purchase such "tail" insurance contemplated in the two
preceding sentences, AMH shall, at ARPIs request, purchase, and maintain in
full force and effect (and honor the obligations under), during the six-year
period beginning on the date of the Partnership Merger Effective Time, a
"tail" insurance policy from one or more insurance carriers believed to be
sound and reputable with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance and employment practices liability
insurance and errors and omissions liability insurance of at least the same
coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions no less favorable in
the aggregate to directors, officers, agents, or fiduciaries of ARPI or any of
the ARPI Subsidiaries as ARPI or any of the ARPI Subsidiaries existing policy
or policies for the benefit of the current and former directors, officers,
agents or fiduciaries of ARPI or any ARPI Subsidiary with a claims period of
six years from the Partnership Merger Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall AMH be required to pay more than the Maximum Premium as
the aggregate premium for such "tail" insurance policy or policies for its
entire period, in which case AMH will obtain as much comparable "tail"
insurance as possible for an amount equal to the Maximum Premium.

 



 

(c) If any of AMH, AMH OP or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges with or into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving company, partnership or other entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) liquidates, dissolves or winds-up, or
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of AMH or AMH OP, as applicable, shall assume
the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.6_.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 7.6_ are intended to be for the express
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person (who are
intended to be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.6_), his or her
heirs and his or her personal representatives, shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of AMH and ARPI, and shall not be amended in a manner
that is adverse to the Indemnified Person (including the successors, assigns
and heirs) without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person
(including the successors, assigns and heirs) affected thereby. The
exculpation and indemnification provided for by this _Section 7.6_ shall be
in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or exculpation which an Indemnified Person is entitled,
whether pursuant to applicable Law, contract or otherwise.

 



 

(e) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to insurance claims under any policy that
is or has been in existence with respect to ARPI, any of the ARPI Subsidiaries
or any of the respective directors, officers, employees, agents or
representatives thereof for any of their respective trustees, directors,
managers, officers or other employees.

 



 

Section 7.7 _Appropriate Action; Consents_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
ARPI and AMH shall, and shall cause the ARPI Subsidiaries and the AMH
Subsidiaries,

 



      
 

 



 

respectively, to use its and their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other Party in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Law or pursuant to any contract or agreement to
consummate and make effective, as promptly as practicable, the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the taking of
all actions necessary to cause the conditions to Closing set forth in _Article
VIII_ to be satisfied, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or
nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Persons (other than
Governmental Authorities, which are addressed in _Section 7.3_) necessary in
connection with the consummation of the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the making of all necessary registrations
and filings and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to
obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any
Governmental Authority or other Persons necessary in connection with the
consummation of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iii) subject to _Section 7.8(e)_, the defending of any lawsuits
or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of the Mergers or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental
Authority vacated or reversed, so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
reasonably possible, and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to fully carry out the purposes of this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each of AMH and
ARPI shall use its reasonable best efforts to give (or shall cause the AMH
Subsidiaries or the ARPI Subsidiaries, respectively, to use their reasonable
best efforts to give) any notices to third parties, and each of AMH and ARPI
shall use, and cause each of their respective Affiliates to use, its
reasonable best efforts to obtain any third-party consents not covered by
_Section 7.7(a)_ that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 7.7_, neither AMH
nor ARPI, nor any of their respective Subsidiaries, shall be required to pay
any consent fee or other consideration or accept any material concessions in
order to obtain the consent or waiver of any Third Party.

 



 

Section 7.8 _Notification of Certain Matters; Transaction Litigation_.

 



 

(a) The ARPI Parties shall give prompt notice to the AMH Parties, and the AMH
Parties shall give prompt notice to the ARPI Parties, of any notice or other
communication received by such Party from any Person alleging that the consent
of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Mergers or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) The ARPI Parties shall give prompt notice to the AMH Parties, and the AMH
Parties shall give prompt notice to the ARPI Parties, if (i) any
representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becomes
untrue or inaccurate such that it would be reasonable to expect that the
applicable closing conditions would be incapable of being satisfied by the
Outside Date or (ii) it fails to comply with or satisfy in any material
respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement; _provided_ ,

 



      
 

 



 

 _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the Parties or the conditions to the
obligations of the Parties under this Agreement. Without limiting the
foregoing, the ARPI Parties shall give prompt notice to the AMH Parties, and
the AMH Parties shall give prompt notice to the ARPI Parties, if, to the
Knowledge of such Party, the occurrence of any state of facts, change,
development, event or condition would cause, or would reasonably be expected
to cause, any of the conditions to Closing set forth herein not to be
satisfied or satisfaction to be materially delayed.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the failure by
the ARPI Parties or the AMH Parties to provide notice under _Section 7.8(a)_,
_Section 7.8(b)_ or _Section 7.8(d)_ shall not constitute a breach of
covenant for purposes of _Section 8.2(b)_ or _Section 8.3(b)_.

 



 

(d) Each of the Parties agrees to give prompt written notice to the other
Parties upon becoming aware of the occurrence or impending occurrence of any
event or circumstance relating to it or any of the other ARPI Subsidiaries or
the other AMH Subsidiaries, respectively, which could reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, an ARPI Material Adverse Effect or
an AMH Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be.

 



 

(e) The ARPI Parties shall give prompt notice to the AMH Parties and keep the
AMH Parties reasonably informed on a current basis, and the AMH Parties shall
give prompt notice to the ARPI Parties and keep the ARPI Parties reasonably
informed on a current basis, of any Action commenced or, to such Partys
Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving such Party or any of
the other ARPI Subsidiaries or the other AMH Subsidiaries, respectively, which
relates to this Agreement, the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. The ARPI Parties shall give the AMH Parties the opportunity
to reasonably participate in the defense and settlement of any litigation
against the ARPI Parties or their directors or trustees relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and no such settlement
shall be agreed to without AMHs prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The AMH Parties shall

and settlement of any litigation against the AMH Parties or their trustees or
directors relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to ARPI to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act. Upon request, ARPI shall promptly furnish

Section 7.11 _Certain Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) Each of AMH and ARPI shall use its respective commercially reasonable
efforts (before and, as relevant, after the Parent Merger Effective Time) to
cause the Parent Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. Provided ARPI shall have received the opinion of
counsel referred to in _Section 8.3(f)_, the Parties shall treat the Parent
Merger as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code and no Party
shall take any position for tax purposes inconsistent therewith, except to the
extent otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of
Section 1313(a) of the Code.

and any similar taxes that become payable in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (together with any related interests, penalties
or additions to Tax, " **Transfer Taxes** "), and shall cooperate in
attempting to minimize the amount of Transfer Taxes. Subject to _Section
3.5(c)(iii)_, from and after the Partnership Merger Effective Time, AMH and
AMH OP (or ARP OP) shall pay or cause to be paid, without deduction or
withholding from any consideration or amounts payable to holders of shares of

(c) The Parties agree and acknowledge that the income, assets and operations
of AMH OP and certain AMH Subsidiaries will affect the ability of ARPI to
qualify as a REIT for its taxable year ending at the Parent Merger Effective
Time. The Parties shall cooperate (and shall cause their Affiliates, agents,
and advisors to cooperate) and to take such actions (or, as applicable,
refrain from taking actions) as reasonably deemed necessary by ARPI or AMH to
permit ARPI to qualify as a REIT for its taxable year ending at the Parent
Merger Effective Time including, without limiting the foregoing, filing
elections to treat each corporation in which ARPI acquires an interest as a
result of the Partnership Merger as a Taxable REIT Subsidiary of ARPI on or
prior to the Closing Date of the Parent Merger.

 



 

Section 7.12 _Voting of Shares_. AMH shall vote all shares of ARPI Common
Stock beneficially owned by it or any of the AMH Subsidiaries as of the record

Business Day prior to the Closing Date (but contingent

 



      
 

 



 

upon the occurrence of the Mergers), (ii) adopt written resolutions, the form
and substance of which shall be subject to AMHs prior review and comment and
shall be reasonably satisfactory to AMH, (a) to terminate the ARPI 401(k)
Plan, (b) to 100% vest all participants under the ARPI 401(k) Plan, and (c) to
adopt all required compliance amendments, in each case effective as of the
Business Day prior to the Closing Date (but contingent upon the occurrence of
the Mergers) ), and (iii) prior to the Closing Date, (a) prepare (or cause to
be prepared) all termination-related documentation, notices and filings for
the ARPI 401(k) Plan and its related trusts, insurance contracts and other
agreements, and (b) take all action necessary to coordinate with and to
provide proper notice to all service providers for the ARPI 401(k) Plan with
respect to termination of the ARPI 401(k) Plan. AMH reserves the right to
suspend the distribution of benefits from the ARPI 401(k) Plan until the later
of the receipt of a favorable determination letter from the IRS with respect
to the termination of such plan and the completion of final testing and
recordkeeping for such plan.

AMH Board shall adopt resolutions (subject to and effective immediately
following the Partnership Merger Effective Time), and the AMH Board shall take

Merger Sub and OP Merger Sub)), AMH shall, and shall cause each AMH Subsidiary
(including AMH Merger Sub and OP Merger Sub), as applicable, to, provide each
individual who is an employee of ARPI or any ARPI Subsidiary immediately prior
to the Closing and who remains employed by ARPI, any ARPI Subsidiary, AMH or
any AMH Subsidiary (including AMH Merger Sub and OP Merger Sub) immediately
following the Closing (each a " **Continuing Employee** " and, collectively,

Sub and OP Merger Sub) and for determining levels of vacation and paid time-
off to the same extent that such service was recognized under a similar plan,
program, policy, agreement or arrangement of ARPI or any ARPI Subsidiary,
except that no such prior service credit will be required or provided to the
extent that (i) it results in a duplication of benefits, or (ii) such service
was not recognized under the corresponding ARPI Employee Benefit Plan.

 



 

(c) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, AMH shall cause each AMH
Employee Benefit Plan in which any Continuing Employee participates that
provides health or welfare benefits to (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions, exclusions, waiting periods and service conditions
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
Continuing Employees, other than limitations applicable under the
corresponding ARPI Employee Benefit Plan or to the extent that such pre-
existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and
waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable
ARPI Employee Benefit Plan and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to
honor any payments, charges and expenses of Continuing Employees (and their
eligible dependents) that were applied toward the deductible and out-of-pocket
maximums under the corresponding ARPI Employee Benefit Plan in satisfying any
applicable deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums or co-payments under a
corresponding AMH Employee Benefit Plan during the calendar year in which the
Closing occurs.

 



 

(d) Nothing in this _Section 7.17_ shall (i) confer any rights upon any
Person, including any Continuing Employee or former employee of ARPI or the
ARPI Subsidiaries, other than the parties to this Agreement and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, (ii) constitute or create an
employment agreement or create any right in any Continuing Employee or any
other Person to any continued employment or service with or for ARPI, the ARPI
Subsidiaries, AMH, or the AMH Subsidiaries, or to any compensation or benefits
of any nature or kind whatsoever, (iii) constitute or be treated as an
amendment, modification, adoption, suspension or termination of any employee
benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement of ARPI, the ARPI
Subsidiaries, AMH, or the AMH Subsidiaries, or (iv) alter or limit the ability
of ARPI, the ARPI Subsidiaries, AMH, or the AMH Subsidiaries to amend, modify
or terminate any benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement at
any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 7.18 _Transfer of Assets_. Upon request by AMH, ARPI and ARP OP shall
cause the transfer of all or any of the real property owned by ARP OP to a
direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of ARP OP prior to the Partnership
Merger Effective Time.

 



 

Section 7.19 _Takeover Statutes_. ARPI shall use its reasonable best efforts
(a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover Statute or Section 7.2 of
the ARPI Charter (the " **Charter Restrictions** ") is or becomes applicable
to the Mergers or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (b) if any such Takeover Statute or Charter Restrictions are or become
applicable to any of the foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effect of such Takeover
Statute or the Charter Restrictions on the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. ARPI shall not take any action to exempt any
Person (other than AMH and its Affiliates) from any Takeover Statute or the
Charter Restrictions that may purport to be applicable to the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise cause any
restrictions in any Takeover Statute or the Charter Restrictions not to apply
to any such Person, except in connection with the concurrent termination of
this Agreement and entry into a definitive agreement relating to a Superior
Proposal in accordance with _Section 9.1(e)_.

 



 

Section 7.20 _Exchangeable Notes_. As promptly as practicable following the
public announcement of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, ARP OP
shall provide the notice required to be delivered to the Notes Trustee and the
holders of Exchangeable Notes pursuant to Section 13.01(b)(iv) of the Notes
Indenture. AMH shall use its reasonable best efforts to take all action
necessary (i) to execute with the Notes Trustee (as defined below) the
supplemental indenture required by Section 13.05 of the Notes Indenture (as
defined below) in respect of the Mergers and (ii) to deliver to the Notes
Trustee the officers certificate and the opinion of counsel required by
Section 10.01 of the Notes Indenture in respect of the Mergers.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in the Notes
Indenture, in no event will AMH issue more than 19.99% of the outstanding
shares of AMH Common Shares as of immediately prior to the Closing (which
equates to approximately 52,448,199 shares as of the date hereof, subject to
adjustment in the event of stock splits or combinations) in connection with
the Mergers as contemplated by _Article III_ hereunder together with any
exchange of the Exchangeable Notes pursuant to the Notes Indenture (whether
occurring at or after the Closing), unless or until such time as AMH shall
have obtained shareholder approval to issue shares in excess of such amount in
accordance with the NYSE Listed Company Manual. For the avoidance of doubt,
AMH shall have no duty, obligation or commitment to seek shareholder approval
to issue shares in excess of such amount. If any such exchange of the
Exchangeable Notes would result in the issuance of more than such number of
shares of AMH Common Stock and no shareholder approval has been obtained, such
exchanges shall be settled in cash (along with any other exchanges required to
be settled in a similar fashion pursuant to the Notes Indenture).

such action;

(d) by either AMH or ARPI, upon written notice to the other Party, if there
shall have been a breach by the other Party of any of the covenants or

Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, and in the event that such
Acquisition Agreement is not substantially concurrently entered into and such
payment is not concurrently made, such termination shall be null and void.

written notice thereof shall be given to the other Party or Parties,

void and of no further force or effect whatsoever without liability on the
part of any Party hereto, and all rights and obligations of any Party hereto
shall cease; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding anything in the
foregoing to the contrary (a) no such termination shall relieve any Party

(i) by ARPI pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_ ( _provided Section 9.3(a)(ii)_
does not apply), or by ARPI pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)_, in each case as a
result of an intentional breach by AMH of this Agreement and provided that all
of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the AMH Parties to effect
the Mergers have been satisfied or waived by the AMH Parties, then AMH shall
pay, or cause to be paid, to ARPI a fee (in lieu of any liability or damages
under _Section 9.2(a)_ or otherwise) equal to the Termination Fee, plus the
Expense Amount by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by
ARPI, within two Business Days after such termination;

 



 

(ii) by either AMH or ARPI pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_ or _Section 9.1(e)_
and ARPI (x) receives or has received an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not
conditional) with respect to ARPI, which proposal has been publicly announced
or otherwise communicated or made known to the ARPI Board or holders of ARPI
Common Stock prior to or on the date of the ARPI Stockholder Meeting or any
postponement or adjournment thereof (with respect to a termination under
_Section 9.1(e)_) or prior to the termination of this Agreement (with respect
to a termination under _Section 9.1(c)_) and (y) within 12 months of the
termination of this Agreement,

 



      
 

 



 

consummates a transaction regarding, or executes a definitive agreement which
is later consummated (whether or not during such 12-month period) with respect
to, an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not involving the Acquisition Proposal
referred to in clause (x) above or a different Acquisition Proposal), then
ARPI shall pay, or cause to be paid, to AMH the Termination Fee, plus the
Expense Amount, unless the Expense Amount has been previously paid pursuant to
_Section 9.3(a)(iii)_, by wire transfer of same day funds to an account
designated by AMH, not later than the consummation of such transaction
relating to such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that for
purposes of this _Section 9.3(a)(ii)_, the references to "20%" in the
definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%";

 



 

(iii) by either AMH or ARPI pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_ because the ARPI
Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained, then ARPI shall pay, or
cause to be paid, to AMH the Expense Amount (by wire transfer to an account
designated by AMH) within two Business Days of such termination; _provided_ ,
that if at the time of such termination pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_, AMH had
a right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(f)_, then ARPI
shall pay, or cause to be paid, to AMH, in lieu thereof, the Termination Fee,
plus an amount equal to the Expense Amount, unless the Expense Amount has been
previously paid pursuant to this _Section 9.3(a)(iii)_, by wire transfer of
same day funds to an account designated by AMH within two Business Days of
such termination;

 



 

(iv) by AMH pursuant to _Section 9.1(f)_ or by ARPI pursuant to _Section
9.1(g)_, then ARPI shall pay, or cause to be paid, to AMH the Termination Fee,
plus the Expense Amount, unless the Expense Amount has been previously paid
pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)(iii)_, by wire transfer of same day funds to an
account designated by AMH within two Business Days of such termination.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Parties agree that:

 



 

(i) under no circumstances shall AMH or ARPI be required to pay the
Termination Fee or the Expense Amount on more than one occasion; and

 



 

(ii) neither AMH nor ARPI shall be required to pay any amount in excess of the
Termination Fee or any portion of the other Partys Expenses, except as set
forth in _Section 9.3(c)_ or as provided in _Section 9.2_.

 



 

(c) Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this _Section 9.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) neither the Termination Fee, the Expense Amount nor
any other amount payable pursuant to this _Section 9.3_ is a penalty, and
(iii) without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if AMH or ARPI, as the case may be, fails to timely
pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 9.3_ and, in order to obtain
such payment, either AMH or ARPI, as the case may be, commences a suit that
results in a judgment against the other Party for the payment of any amount
set forth in this _Section 9.3_, such paying Party shall pay the other Party
its costs and Expenses in connection with such suit, together with interest on
such amount at the annual rate of the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect
on the date of payment for the period

 



      
 

 



 

from the date such payment was required to be made through the date such
payment was actually received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted
by applicable Law.

 



 

(d) _Limitations on Payment_

 



 

(i) If one Party to this Agreement (the " **Fee Payor** ") is required to pay
another Party to this Agreement (the " **Fee Payee** ") the Expense Amount
and/or the Termination Fee, the Expense Amount and/or the Termination Fee, as
applicable, shall be paid into escrow on the date such payment is required to
be paid by the Fee Payor pursuant to this Agreement by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an escrow account designated in accordance with
this _Section 9.3(d)_. In the event that the Fee Payor is obligated to pay
the Fee Payee the Expense Amount and/or the Termination Fee, as applicable,
the amount payable to the Fee Payee in any tax year of the Fee Payee shall not
exceed the lesser of (i) the Expense Amount and/or the Termination Fee, as
applicable, of the Fee Payee, and (ii) the sum of (A) the maximum amount that
can be paid to the Fee Payee without causing the Fee Payee to fail to meet the
requirements of Section 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the relevant tax
year, determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income
described in Sections 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code (" **Qualifying
Income** ") and the Fee Payee has income from unknown sources during such year
in an amount equal to 1% of its gross income which is not Qualifying Income
(in addition to any known or anticipated income which is not Qualifying
Income), in each case, as determined by the Fee Payees independent
accountants, plus (B) in the event the Fee Payee receives either (x) a letter
from the Fee Payees counsel indicating that the Fee Payee has received a
ruling from the IRS as described below in this _Section 9.3(d)_ or (y) an
opinion from the Fee Payees outside counsel as described below in this
_Section 9.3(d)_, an amount equal to the excess of the Expense Amount and/or
the Termination Fee, as applicable, less the total amount paid under clause
(A) above.

 



 

(ii) To secure the Fee Payors obligation to pay these amounts, the Fee Payor
shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the Expense Amount or the
Termination Fee, as applicable, with an escrow agent selected by the Fee Payor
on such terms (subject to this _Section 9.3(d)_) as shall be mutually agreed
upon by the Fee Payor, the Fee Payee and the escrow agent. The payment or
deposit into escrow of the Expense Amount or the Termination Fee, as
applicable, pursuant to this _Section 9.3(d)_ shall be made at the time the
Fee Payor is obligated to pay the Fee Payee such amount pursuant to _Section
9.3_ by wire transfer. The escrow agreement shall provide that the Expense
Amount or the Termination Fee, as applicable, in escrow or any portion thereof
shall not be released to the Fee Payee unless the escrow agent receives any
one or combination of the following: (i) a letter from the Fee Payees
independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the
escrow agent to the Fee Payee without causing the Fee Payee to fail to meet
the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if
the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income and the Fee
Payee has income from unknown sources during such year in an amount equal to
1% of its gross income which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any
known or anticipated income which is not Qualifying Income), in which case the
escrow agent shall release such amount to the Fee Payee, or (ii) a letter from
the Fee Payees counsel indicating that (A) the Fee Payee received a ruling
from the IRS holding that the receipt by the Fee Payee of the Expense Amount
and/or Termination Fee, as applicable, would either constitute Qualifying
Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code or (B) the Fee

 



      
 

 



 

Payees outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the
receipt by the Fee Payee of the Expense Amount and/or the Termination Fee, as
applicable, should either constitute Qualifying Income or should be excluded
from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the
Code, in which case the escrow agent shall release the remainder of the
Expense Amount and/or the Termination Fee, as applicable, to the Fee Payee.
The Fee Payor agrees to amend this _Section 9.3(d)_ at the reasonable request
of the Fee Payee in order to (i) maximize the portion of the Expense Amount
and/or the Termination Fee, as applicable, that may be distributed to the Fee
Payee hereunder without causing the Fee Payee to fail to meet the requirements
of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (ii) improve the Fee Payees
chances of securing a favorable ruling described in this _Section 9.3(d)_ or
(iii) assist the Fee Payee in obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its
outside counsel as described in this _Section 9.3(d)_. Any amount of the
Expense Amount and/or the Termination Fee, as applicable, that remains unpaid
as of the end of a taxable year shall be paid as soon as possible during the
following taxable year, subject to the foregoing limitations of this _Section
9.3(d)_, _provided_ that the obligation of the Fee Payor to pay the unpaid
portion of the Expense Amount and/or the Termination Fee, as applicable, shall
terminate on the December 31 following the date which is five years from the
date of this Agreement. Any costs and expenses of the escrow agent shall be
borne solely by the Fee Payee.

 



 

Any payment due to a Party described in _Section 9.3(c)_ shall be subject to
the same limitations on payment as set forth in this _Section 9.3(d)_.

 



 

(e) Except as set forth in this _Section 9.3_, all fees and expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be paid by the Party incurring such expenses whether or not the Mergers
are consummated.

 



 

(f) The Parties each agree that in the event that the Termination Fee and, if
applicable, the actual, documented Expenses of the recipient Party up to the
Expense Amount, are paid or payable pursuant to _Section 9.3_, the payment of
the Termination Fee and, if applicable, the actual, documented Expenses of the
recipient Party up to the Expense Amount, together, if applicable, with the
costs, expenses and interest set forth in _Section 9.3(c)_, shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of the recipient Party and its Affiliates against the
paying Party or any of its Affiliates for, and in no event will any of the
Parties or any of their Affiliates be entitled to recover any other money
damages or any other remedy based on a claim in law or equity with respect to,
(1) any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Mergers to be
consummated, (2) the termination of this Agreement, (3) any liabilities or
obligations arising under this Agreement, or (4) any claims or actions arising
out of or relating to any breach, termination or failure of or under this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.4 _Amendment_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by the Parties hereto, by action taken or authorized
by the ARPI Board or the AMH Board, as applicable, at any time before or after
approval of the matters presented in connection with the Mergers by the
stockholders of ARPI or holders of ARP OP Units, but, after any such approval,
no amendment shall be made which by Law requires further approval by such
stockholders or holders without such further approval by such stockholders or
holders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of the Parties hereto.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 9.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Partnership Merger
Effective Time, the Parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by the ARPI
Board or the AMH Board, as applicable, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
the other Party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other Party contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party hereto to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of a Party to assert
any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a
waiver of those rights. No single or partial exercise of any right, remedy,
power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. Any
waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific
purpose for which given and shall not constitute a waiver to any subsequent or
other exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder.

Section 10.3 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and
delivered to each other Party (including by means of electronic delivery), it
being understood that the Parties need not sign the same counterpart.
Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by facsimile transmission, by
electronic mail in "portable document format" (".pdf"), or by any other
electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial
appearance of a document, will have the same effect as physical delivery of
the paper document bearing the original signature.

 



 

Section 10.4 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the schedules, documents and the instruments referred to herein)
constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof, other than the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement. Nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person
(other than the Parties hereto) any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement except for (i) the rights,
benefits and remedies granted to the Indemnified Parties under _Section 7.6_,
(ii) after the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the rights of the holders of
AMH OP Units to receive the consideration set forth in _Article III_ in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (iii) after the Parent
Merger Effective Time, the rights of the holders of shares of ARPI Common
Stock to receive the Merger Consideration, and (iv) the right

 



      
 

 



 

of ARPI and AMH, on behalf of its respective shareholders, to pursue claims
for damages and other relief, including equitable relief, for the other
Parties intentional breach of this Agreement, to the extent recovery is
otherwise permitted under _Section 9.2_. The representations and warranties
in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
Parties. Accordingly, Persons other than the Parties may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

 



 

Section 10.5 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability and,
unless the effect of such invalidity or unenforceability would prevent the
Parties from realizing the major portion of the economic benefits of the
Mergers that they currently anticipate obtaining therefrom, shall not render
invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement
or affect the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement
is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be
only so broad as is enforceable.

 



 

Section 10.6 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations of the Parties hereunder shall be assigned by any of
the Parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the
prior written consent of the other Parties, and any attempt to make any such
assignment without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

 



 

Section 10.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all claims or causes of
actions (whether at Law, in contract or in tort) that may be based upon, arise
out of or related to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of Maryland applicable to agreements entered into
and performed entirely therein by residents thereof, without regard to any
provisions relating to choice of laws among different jurisdictions.

 



 

Section 10.8 _Specific Performance; Venue_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached,
and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy
therefor. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_, the Parties shall be entitled to seek an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the any state or
federal court within the State of Maryland, and each Party hereto hereby
waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection
with such remedy, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that any
legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement
brought by any other Party or its successors or assigns shall be brought and
determined in any state or federal court within the State of Maryland, and
each of the Parties hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction
of the aforesaid courts for itself and with respect to its property, generally
and

 



      
 

 



 

unconditionally, with regard to any such action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided that if any such legal action or proceeding is brought in a state
court within the State of Maryland, each Party hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees to request and/or consent to the assignment of such
legal action or proceeding to the Business and Technology Case Management
Program of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland). Each of the
Parties agrees not to commence any action, suit or proceeding relating thereto
except in the courts described above in Maryland, other than actions in any
court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or award
rendered by any such court in Maryland as described herein. Each of the
Parties further agrees that notice as provided herein shall constitute
sufficient service of process and the Parties further waive any argument that
such service is insufficient. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a
defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (a) any
claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in
Maryland as described herein for any reason, (b) that it or its property is
exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process
commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior
to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment
or otherwise) and (c) that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in any such
court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action
or proceeding is improper, or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter
hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

 



 

Section 10.9 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO (A)
CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY
OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR
PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT,
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
10.9_.

 



 

Section 10.10 _Authorship_. The Parties agree that the terms and language of
this Agreement are the result of negotiations between the Parties and their
respective advisors and, as a result, there shall be no presumption that any
ambiguities in this Agreement shall be resolved against any Party. Any
controversy over construction of this Agreement shall be decided without
regard to events of authorship or negotiation.
