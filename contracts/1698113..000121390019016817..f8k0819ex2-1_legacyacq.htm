Article II 
 SHARE EXCHANGE

  



  

2.1 _Share Exchange and Additional Consideration_. Upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date, (a) the
Seller shall sell, transfer, convey, assign and deliver to the Purchaser, and
the Purchaser shall purchase, acquire and accept from the Seller, all of the
issued and outstanding Company Ordinary Shares (the " _Purchased Shares_
") all free and clear of all Liens, and (b) the Purchaser shall issue to the
Seller all of the Closing Payment Shares in full payment for the Purchased
Shares. In addition, the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller the Earnout Payment
in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement.

  



  

2.2 _Payment of Closing Payment Shares._

  



  

(a) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Purchaser
Class A Common Shares will be issued pursuant to the Share Purchase, and such
fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any rights of a stockholder of the Purchaser.

  



   

17

 



    



  

(b) _Legend_. Each certificate issued pursuant to the Share Purchase to any
holder of Company Ordinary Shares shall bear the legend set forth below, or
legend substantially equivalent thereto, together with any other legends that
may be required by any securities laws at the time of the issuance of the
Purchaser Class A Common Shares:

  



  

THE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN
REGISTERED UNDER THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE
"ACT"), AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED OR
HYPOTHECATED UNLESS AND UNTIL (I) SUCH OFFER, SALE, TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR
HYPOTHECATION HAS BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE ACT OR (II) THE ISSUER OF THE
SHARES OF COMMON STOCK HAS RECEIVED AN OPINION OF COUNSEL IN FORM AND
SUBSTANCE SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER THAT SUCH OFFER, SALE OR
TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR HYPOTHECATION IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE ACT.

  



  

2.3 _Cancellation of Treasury Shares_. At the Closing Date, any Company
Ordinary Shares held in treasury shall be canceled and extinguished
without any conversion thereof or payment therefor.

  



  

2.4 _Closing; Closing Date_. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated in
accordance with Article X, the closing of the Share Purchase (the " _Closing_
") shall take place at the offices of O'Melveny and Myers LLP, located at Times
Square Tower, 7 Times Square, New York, New York, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time,
on the third (3rd) Business Day following satisfaction or waiver (to the
extent permitted by applicable law) of the conditions set forth in Article
VII, or such other date as agreed by the parties in writing. The parties may
participate in the Closing via electronic means. The date on which the Closing
actually occurs is hereinafter referred to as the " _Closing Date_."

  



  

2.5 _Board of Directors_. Immediately after the Closing, the Purchaser Board
will consist of nine (9) directors. The Founder Investors' Representative
shall have the right to designate three (3) members of the Purchaser Board to
serve from the Closing until the election and qualification of their
respective successors, at least two of which must be NYSE Independent and at
least one of which must be Independent. The Seller shall have the right to
designate the remaining six (6) members of the Purchaser Board to serve
from the Closing until the election and qualification of their respective
successors, at least three of which must be NYSE Independent and at least two
of which must be Independent. In the event that applicable Laws or the listing
rules of the New York Stock Exchange require the Purchaser to appoint
additional members to the Purchaser Board in order to comply with applicable
independence requirements, Founder Investors' Representative agrees to grant
a proxy to the Seller with respect to the vote of all Purchaser Common Shares
Beneficially Owned by the Investors (as such term is defined above) with
respect to the appointment of any such NYSE Independent director(s) or
director nominee(s). The parties to this Agreement have entered into an
Investor Rights Agreement that will become effective as of the Closing, the
content of which includes provisions relating to election of directors
nominated by the Founder Investors' Representative and the Seller.

    



   

18

 



    



  

2.6 _Withholding_. The Purchaser, its Affiliates and any Group Company, shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable
or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be
required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under any provision of federal,
state, local or foreign Law or under any legal requirements or applicable
Orders, or based on the PRC Indirect Transfer Rules (to the extent any
amounts are not withheld by Seller from the Madhouse Purchase Price). To the
extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. In the case of
any withholding based on the PRC Indirect Transfer Rules or any other PRC
withholding Tax matter, (a) the Seller shall control the preparation and
filing of all applicable Tax Returns and any related proceedings, discussions
and correspondence with relevant Taxing Authorities and (b) the Purchaser
shall cooperate with the Seller and take any action in connection with the
foregoing reasonably requested by the Seller. The Purchaser agrees
and acknowledges that, without the prior written consent of the Seller,
neither the Purchaser nor any Group Company or their respective Affiliates,
agents, advisors or representatives shall make any filings with, communicate
with, or approach any PRC Taxing Authority in relation to any aspects
pertaining to the Seller\'s Tax liability under PRC Indirect Transfer Rules To
the extent that any amounts are withheld in connection with the PRC Indirect
Transfer Rules, if no Taxing Authority has asserted in writing that such
withholding is required within twelve (12) months following the Closing or it
is otherwise determined that an amount less than the withheld amount is
owing, such withheld amount (or excess withheld amount, if applicable) will be
remitted to the Seller within fifteen (15) days following such date. If it is
subsequently determined by a relevant Taxing Authority that an amount remitted
to the Seller pursuant to the foregoing sentence was required to be withheld,
the Seller shall remit such amount to the Taxing Authority or the Purchaser,
as applicable, in order to satisfy such obligation.

  



  

2.7 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the
Closing, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Purchaser with full right, title
and interest in, to and under, and/or possession of, all assets, property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Group Companies, the officers
and directors of the Purchaser are fully authorized in the name and on behalf
of the any of the Group Companies, to take all lawful action necessary or
desirable to accomplish such purpose or acts, so long as such action is not
inconsistent with this Agreement.

  



  

2.8 _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment_.

  



  

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, and in any
event within 90 days thereof, the Independent Director Committee will prepare
and deliver to the Seller a statement, in substantially the form set forth on
Exhibit F, executed by the members of the Independent Director Committee,
setting forth the Independent Director Committee's calculation of (i) the
aggregate amount of Cash of the Group Companies, which shall be at least
equal to or greater than the Minimum Company Cash (collectively, "
_Company Cash_ "), (ii) the aggregate amount of Assumed Borrowed Indebtedness
of the Group Companies minus Company Cash (" _Company Net Debt_ ") (which may
be a negative number if Company Cash exceeds the aggregate amount of such
Borrowed Indebtedness), (iii) Deferred Acquisition Purchase Price
Obligations, (iv) the Madhouse Purchase Price and (v) the " _Closing Date
Adjustment_ " being the sum, whether positive or negative, of (A) the Target
Company Net Debt minus the Company Net Debt, plus (B) the Target Deferred
Acquisition Purchase Price Obligations minus the Deferred Acquisition Purchase
Price Obligations plus (C) the Madhouse Purchase Price Target minus the
Madhouse Purchase Price, in each case as of 9:00 A.M. (Eastern Time) on the
Closing Date (such statement being referred to as the " _Purchaser Closing
Statement_ "). The Purchaser Closing Statement, the Final Closing Statement
and the component items thereof will be prepared and calculated in accordance
with U.S. GAAP. The Purchaser will provide to the Seller the books, records
(including work papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents) and
supporting data used to prepare the Purchaser Closing Statement.

  



   

19

 



    



  

(b) After receipt of the Purchaser Closing Statement from the Purchaser, the
Seller will have 30 days to review the Purchaser Closing Statement (the "
_Review Period_ "). The Purchaser Closing Statement will be binding and
conclusive upon, and deemed accepted by, the Seller unless the Seller
notifies Purchaser in writing prior to the expiration of the Review Period of
any dispute or objection thereto (any such written dispute or objection being
referred to as an " _Objection_ "), setting forth the basis for its dispute
or objections and the specific adjustments (including dollar amounts) to the
Purchaser Closing Statement which the Seller believes should be made. Any
items not disputed or objected to in an Objection will be deemed to have been
accepted by the Seller. If no Objection is delivered by the Seller to
Purchaser or the Seller notifies the Purchaser in writing that it has no such
disputes or objections, in each case prior to the expiration of the Review
Period, then the Purchaser Closing Statement will be deemed to have been
accepted by, and will be final and binding upon, the parties to this
Agreement. The Seller and the Purchaser will, within 15 days (or such longer
period as the Seller and the Purchaser may agree in writing) following
delivery of an Objection to the Purchaser (the " _Resolution Period_ "),
attempt in good faith to resolve their differences, and any resolution by
them as to any disputed amounts will be final, binding and conclusive. Any
items agreed to by the Seller and the Purchaser in writing, together with any
items not disputed or objected to by the Seller in the Objection, are
collectively referred to herein as the " _Resolved Matters_ ".

  



  

(c) If at the end of the Resolution Period the Seller and the Purchaser have
been unable to resolve any differences that they may have with respect to the
matters specified in the Objection, the Seller and the Purchaser will refer
all such matters that remain in dispute (the " _Unresolved Matters_ ") to a
nationally recognized independent public accounting firm jointly selected by
the Seller and the Purchaser (the " _Accounting Referee_ ")). The Accounting
Referee will, acting as experts in accounting and not as arbitrators,
determine on a basis consistent with the requirements of this Agreement, and
only with respect to the Unresolved Matters so submitted, whether and to what
extent the Purchaser Closing Statement requires adjustment. The Seller and
the Purchaser will instruct the Accounting Referee to (i) use its reasonable
best efforts to render its final written determination within 30 days after
such firm's engagement, (ii) prepare the Final Closing Statement (which will
be consistent with the Resolved Matters and the final determination of the
Accounting Referee of the Unresolved Matters), and (iii) calculate the
Closing Date Adjustment, if any, based on such Final Closing Statement. With
respect to each Unresolved Matter, the Accounting Referee's determination, if
not in accordance with the position of either the Seller or Purchaser, will
not be in excess of the higher, nor less than the lower, of the amounts
advocated by the Seller or the Purchaser with respect thereto. The Accounting
Referee's final written determination will be conclusive and binding upon the
parties to this Agreement. The " _Final Closing Statement_ " will be (i) in
the event that no Objection is delivered by the Seller to the Purchaser, or
the Seller notifies the Purchaser that it has no such disputes or objections
to the Purchaser Closing Statement, in each case prior to the expiration of
the Review Period, the Purchaser Closing Statement delivered by the Purchaser
to the Seller pursuant to Section 2.8(a); (ii) in the event that an Objection
is delivered by the Seller to the Purchaser prior to the expiration of the
Review Period, the Purchaser Closing Statement delivered by the Purchaser to
the Seller pursuant to Section 2.8(a), as adjusted pursuant to the agreement
of the Seller and the Purchaser in writing; or (iii) in the event that an
Objection is delivered by the Seller to the Purchaser prior to the
expiration of the Review Period and the Seller and the Purchaser are unable
to agree on all matters set forth in such Objection, the Purchaser Closing
Statement delivered by the Purchaser to the Seller pursuant to Section 2.8(a),
as adjusted by the Accounting Referee to be consistent with the Resolved
Matters and the final determination of the Accounting Referee of the
Unresolved Matters in accordance with this Section 2.8(c). In the event the
Final Closing Statement is determined (x) pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii) of
the immediately preceding sentence, the Purchaser will prepare the Final
Closing Statement and calculate the adjustment amounts, if any, in each case
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and deliver such items to the
Seller within three Business Days following the determination thereof or (y)
pursuant to clause (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Accounting
Referee will prepare the Final Closing Statement and calculate the adjustment
amounts, if any, based on the Final Closing Statement, in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, and deliver such items to the Seller and the
Purchaser within three Business Days following the delivery of the final
written determination of the Accounting Referee to the Seller and the
Purchaser.

  



  

(d) The Purchaser will bear 100% of the fees and disbursements of the
Accounting Referee.

  



  

(e) The parties hereto agree that, following the issuance or determination of
a Final Closing Statement pursuant to Section 2.8(c):

  



  

(i) in the event that the Closing Date Adjustment as set forth in the Final
Closing Statement is a positive number, the Purchaser shall issue to the
Seller that number of Purchaser Class A Common Shares equal to (x) the Closing
Date Adjustment divided by (y) the Per Share Adjustment Amount; or

  



  

(ii) in the event that the Closing Date Adjustment as set forth in the Final
Closing Statement is a negative number, the Seller shall, at the Seller's
option, either (A) pay to the Purchaser an amount in cash equal to the Closing
Date Adjustment, or (B) transfer to the Purchaser that number of Purchaser
Class A Common Shares held by the Seller equal to (x) the absolute value of
the Closing Date Adjustment divided by (y) the Per Share Adjustment Amount.

Article III 
 EARNOUT PAYMENT

  



  

3.1 _Earnout Payment_. In addition to the Closing Payment Shares, if Madhouse
meets certain performance requirements during a three-year performance period
ending December 31, 2022 as set forth on Schedule II (the " _Earnout
Provisions_ "), then the Purchaser shall make the one-time payment (the "
_Earnout Payment_ ") determined in accordance with the Earnout Provisions,
payable to the Seller and the long-term incentive plan (described below). As
set forth in more detail in, and subject to, the Earnout Provisions, the
Earnout Payment will be made in the form of (a) the Purchaser issuing to the
Seller additional Purchaser Common Shares (the " _Earnout Payment Shares_ ")
in the amount calculated pursuant to the Earnout Provisions, (b) a cash
payment, (c) a subordinated promissory note issued by the Purchaser to the
Seller, or (d) a combination of the foregoing payment methods. The Earnout
Payment shall be made by the Purchaser within five (5) Business Days after a
final determination of payment due to the Seller pursuant to this Section
3.1. The Purchaser hereby covenants and agrees to perform its obligations set
forth in the Earnout Provisions and to maintain the highest number of
Purchaser Common Shares potentially issuable under the terms of the Earnout
Provisions (which number shall not be less than 22,200,000) available for
issuance with respect to Earnout Payment Shares without any restriction or
limitation thereof, at all times after the Closing until all of the payment
obligations set forth in the Earnout Provisions have been satisfied or have
expired. The amount of the Earnout Payment (i) is subject to reduction as set
forth in the Earnout Provisions and Article VIII and, (ii) as set forth in the
Earnout Provisions, has been partially and irrevocably assigned by Seller to
fund a long-term incentive plan to be established for the benefit of
designated individuals employed by or associated with the Group Company
business, in a manner that shall be determined in Seller's discretion,
provided that Seller shall not receive any portion of such assigned Earnout
Payment.

  



  

3.2 _Delivery of Earnout Statement; Determination of Earnout Payment_. As
soon as practicable (but in any event within forty-five (45) days) after the
completion of the Purchaser's audited financial statements for the year ending
December 31, 2022, the Purchaser's chief financial officer (the " _CFO_ ")
will prepare and deliver to the Seller a written statement (the "
_Earnout Statement_ ") in the form attached to Schedule II setting forth the
CFO's determination of the Earnout Payment, if any, and the components
relevant to the determination thereof and the form of the Earnout Payment as
determined by the Independent Director Committee. All determinations to be
made by the Purchaser in connection with the Earnout Payment shall be made by
the Independent Director Committee, and the Purchaser shall cause all of its
and its subsidiaries' respective executives, managers, employees, agents and
other personnel or representatives (" _Representatives_ ") to assist and fully
cooperate with the Independent Director Committee. The Seller will have
thirty (30) days after its receipt of the Earnout Statement to review it. To
the extent reasonably requested in connection with the Seller's review of the
Earnout Statement, the Purchaser shall cause Madhouse to provide the Seller
and its Representatives with reasonable access to the books and records of the
Purchaser and its consolidated entities (including those of Madhouse), its
finance personnel and any other information that the Seller
reasonably requests relating to the determination of the Earnout Payment, the
calculation of the relevant components and the form of the Earnout Payment.
The Seller may deliver written notice to the Purchaser on or prior to the
thirtieth (30th) day after receipt of an Earnout Statement specifying in
reasonable detail any items that it wishes to dispute and the basis therefor.
If the Seller fails to deliver such written notice in such thirty (30) day
period, or if the Seller provides written notice to the Purchaser at any time
in such thirty (30) day period that it does not wish to dispute any items in
the Earnout Statement, then (i) the Seller will have waived its right to
contest the Earnout Statement and the calculations and other matters set forth
therein, (ii) the calculations and other matters set forth in the Earnout
Statement shall become final and binding for all purposes hereunder (absent
fraud or manifest error) at the end of such thirty (30) day period (or upon
the Purchaser's receipt of written notice that the Seller does not wish to
dispute any items in the Earnout Statement), and (iii) the Purchaser shall pay
or issue, as applicable, the Earnout Payment in accordance with Section 3.1.
If the Seller provides the Purchaser with written notice of any objections to
the Earnout Statement in such thirty (30) day period, then the Seller and the
Purchaser will, for a period of thirty (30) days following the date of
delivery of such notice, attempt to resolve their differences, and any written
resolution by them as to any disputed amount will be final and binding for
all purposes under this Agreement, and the Purchaser shall pay or issue, as
applicable, the Earnout Payment in accordance with Section 3.1. If at the
conclusion of such thirty (30) day period the Seller and the Purchaser have
not reached an agreement on any objections with respect to the Earnout
Statement, then upon request of either party, the parties will resolve the
dispute in accordance with the dispute resolution procedure set forth in
Section 3.3. The Purchaser shall not take, and cause its Affiliates not to
take, nor omit to take and cause its Affiliates to not omit to take, any
action that could adversely affect in a material manner the ability of the
parties to calculate the Earnout Payment and the relevant components thereof
or its outcome or the factors relevant to the permitted form of the Earnout
Payment for the three-year period from calendar year 2020 through calendar
year 2022 for purposes of this Article III.

  



   

21

 



    



  

3.3 _Dispute Resolution Procedure_. Matters disputed pursuant to Section 3.2
may be referred by either the Purchaser or the Seller exclusively to the
Independent Expert for determination in accordance with this Section 3.3. Each
of the Seller and the Purchaser agrees to execute, if requested by the
Independent Expert, a reasonable engagement letter with respect to the
determination to be made by the Independent Expert. All fees and expenses of
the Independent Expert will be borne by the Purchaser. The Independent
Expert will determine only those issues still in dispute as of the date that
the dispute is referred to the Independent Expert, and the Independent
Expert's determination will be based solely upon and consistent with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement. The determination by the Independent Expert
will be based solely on presentations with respect to such disputed items by
the Purchaser and the Seller to the Independent Expert and not on the
Independent Expert's independent review; provided, that such
presentations will be deemed to include any work papers, records, accounts or
similar materials delivered to the Independent Expert by the Purchaser or the
Seller in connection with such presentations and any materials delivered to
the Independent Expert in response to requests by the Independent Expert.
Each of the Seller and the Purchaser will use their reasonable efforts to make
their respective presentations as promptly as practicable following
submission to the Independent Expert of the disputed items, and each such
party will be entitled, as part of its presentation, to respond to the
presentation of the other party and any questions and requests of the
Independent Expert. In deciding any matter, the Independent Expert will be
bound by the provisions of this Agreement, including this Section 3.3. It is
the intent of the parties hereto that the procedures set forth in this Section
3.3 and the activities of the Independent Expert in connection herewith are
not (and should not be considered to be or treated as) an arbitration
proceeding or similar arbitral process and that no formal arbitration rules
should be followed (including rules with respect to procedures and discovery).
The Seller and the Purchaser will request that the Independent Expert's
determination be made within forty-five (45) days after its engagement, or as
soon thereafter as possible and be set forth in a written statement delivered
to the Purchaser and the Seller. The Purchaser and the Seller hereby agree
that the Independent Expert's determination will be final, conclusive, non-
appealable and binding for all purposes hereunder (other than for fraud or
manifest error), and that following such determination, the Purchaser shall
pay or issue, as applicable, any applicable Earnout Payment in the determined
form in accordance with Section 3.1.

  



   

22

 



    



  

3.4 _Future Operations_.

  



  

(a) Following the Closing through December 31, 2022 (the " _Earnout Period_
"), (i) the Purchaser shall not sell or dispose of Madhouse, Madhouse's
business or any material portion of Madhouse's assets (including that of its
Subsidiaries) without the prior written consent of the Seller, and (ii)
except as agreed to in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, Madhouse shall, and the Purchaser and its Affiliates shall
cause Madhouse to, operate in good faith in accordance with the business plan
and practices of Madhouse in effect prior to the Closing or as otherwise
agreed to in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
with the existing executives of Madhouse, and to use commercially reasonable
efforts to continue to engage in financing activities so as to obtain and
maintain resources for working capital, capital requirements and other
business needs at a level consistent with past practices, and Madhouse shall
not, and the Purchaser and its Affiliates shall cause Madhouse not to, make,
accelerate or defer any payments or expenditures or accelerate or defer
receipt of any revenues, or otherwise take, agree to take, not take or agree
not to take any action, different from the ordinary course past practices of
Madhouse prior to the Closing and in each case in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Earnout Payment (including
by adversely impacting the underlying components from which the Earnout
Payment is determined). In addition, during the Earnout Period, Madhouse
shall not, and the Purchaser and its Affiliates shall cause Madhouse not to:

  



  

(i) (A) effect any dividend or distribution of any portion of the cash of
Madhouse, (B) enter into any intercompany loans or similar arrangements with
the Purchaser or any Affiliates of the Purchaser or (C) other than the China
Commercial Collaboration and Shared Services Agreement, enter into any
intercompany arrangements or transactions with the Purchaser or any Affiliates
of the Purchaser on pricing or terms less favorable than those which could be
obtained on an arm's-length basis or in accordance with the China
Commercial Collaboration and Shared Services Agreement, in each case that
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the amount of the Earnout
Payment (if any) payable or potentially payable by the Purchaser (including by
adversely impacting the underlying components from which the Earnout Payment
is determined);

  



  

(ii) (A) incur any Indebtedness or other Liabilities except for such
Indebtedness or Liabilities as they relate to the operation of Madhouse, or
(B) incur any Indebtedness or other Liabilities on behalf of the Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates with respect to any business other than that of
Madhouse;

  



  

(iii) transfer, convey, license or otherwise dispose of any rights, assets or
properties to any corporate Affiliate of the Purchaser that is not a wholly
owned Subsidiary of Madhouse, except to the extent that any such rights,
assets and operations, or portions thereof, so transferred, conveyed,
licensed or otherwise disposed of continue to be included in the calculation
of Madhouse's operating results during the Earnout Period or to the extent
contemplated by the China Commercial Collaboration and Shared Services
Agreement; or

  



   

23

 



    



  

(iv) make any material change to its accounting practices, procedures or
policies that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the amount of
the Earnout Payment (if any) payable or potentially payable by the Purchaser
(including by adversely impacting the underlying components from which the
Earnout Payment is determined), except in each case as required by U.S. GAAP.

  



  

(b) In the event that the Purchaser Board (or the board of directors of any
of its Subsidiaries) recommends any transaction of the type described in
Section 3.4(a), any other acquisition of any business or disposition,
divestiture or other transfer of any assets, properties or business,
exclusive license, or any restructuring, reorganization, merger or other
similar transaction, in any case, directly or indirectly involving Madhouse
or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, other than in the ordinary course of
business consistent with Madhouse's past practice), or any other action
inconsistent with Section 3.4(a), in each case during the Earnout Period,
Purchaser, Madhouse or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, may take the
otherwise prohibited action if, and as a condition to the taking of otherwise
prohibited action, (i) the Purchaser Board determines in good faith, after
receipt of a favorable recommendation made by the Independent Director
Committee, that such transaction or action would not materially
adversely affect the Earnout Payment (including by materially adversely
impacting the underlying components from which the Earnout Payment is
determined) and (ii) Purchaser shall provide notice of such determination to
the Seller before any commitment is made or agreement is entered into by the
Purchaser with regard to such transaction or other action. If, within fifteen
(15) Business Days after its receipt of such notice, the Seller objects to
the Purchaser Board's determination that such transaction or other action
would not materially adversely affect the Earnout Payment, then the Seller
and the Purchaser will attempt in good faith to resolve their differences
and, if they are unable to do so, the Seller and the Purchaser shall engage
the Independent Expert to determine, in each case in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 3.3, as applicable, (A) whether or not the
proposed transaction or other action would materially adversely affect the
Earnout Payment and, if so, (B) such action (if any) as is necessary to
modify, as appropriate, the calculation of the underlying metrics from which
the amount of the Earnout Payment is derived or the Earnout Payment is
payable and the timing of any Earnout Payment so as to ensure that the Seller
maintains substantially equivalent economic rights under Section 3.1 after
such transaction so as to effect the original intention of the parties as
closely as possible. The Purchaser and the Seller hereby agree that (i) the
Independent Expert's determination will be final, conclusive, non-
appealable and binding for all purposes hereunder (other than for fraud or
manifest error) and (ii) the Purchaser shall not enter into any commitment or
agreement with respect to such transaction before the later of (x) the fifteen
(15) Business Day period referred to above and (y) such Independent Expert
determination. In addition, in the event that a proposed transaction involves
the sale of Madhouse, Madhouse's business or any material portion of
Madhouse's assets (including that of its Subsidiaries), then prior to the
consummation of such transaction, either (I) the Purchaser shall pay the
Earnout Payment, as agreed by the parties or as determined by the Independent
Expert pursuant to this Section 3.4(b), or (II) any buyer in such proposed
transaction shall have expressly agreed in writing with the Company and the
Seller as a condition to such transaction to assume all of the
Purchaser's obligations related to the Earnout Payment as if it were the
Purchaser, except that payment of the Earnout Payment by any buyer shall be
made entirely in cash.

in on a balance sheet are included in the Purchaser Financial Statements,
(ii) arising pursuant to this Agreement or incurred in connection with the

including but not limited to any violations of any applicable anti-
corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, counter terrorist financing,

government officials or employees, to foreign or domestic political parties
or campaigns or violated any provision of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act of 1977 or (iii) made any other unlawful payment, which, if not paid or
continued in the future, would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
business or prospects of the Purchaser and would reasonably be expected to
subject the Purchaser to suit or penalty in any private or
governmental litigation or proceeding. To the knowledge of the Purchaser,
neither the Purchaser, nor any director, officer, agent or employee of the
Purchaser (nor any Person acting on behalf of any of the foregoing, but solely
in his or her capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Purchaser) has, since the IPO, directly or indirectly, given or agreed to give
any gift or similar benefit in any material amount to any customer, supplier,

proceeding.

Contracts before any court, Authority or official or that in any manner
challenges or seeks to prevent, enjoin, alter or delay the transactions
contemplated hereby or by the Additional Agreements. There are no outstanding
judgments against the Purchaser. Except as disclosed in the Purchaser SEC
Documents, the Purchaser is not, and has not previously been, subject to any
legal proceeding with any Authority.

  



  

5.15 _Compliance with Laws_. The Purchaser is and, since the IPO, has been in
material compliance with all Laws and Orders (i) that are applicable to the
Purchaser, (ii) by which the Purchaser is bound, or (iii) that are applicable

Act, shall not conduct any business operations other than in connection with
this Agreement and ordinary course operations to maintain its status as a New
York Stock Exchange-listed special purpose acquisition company and as a

adverse to the Purchaser.

  



  

(c) Neither party shall (i) take or agree to take any action that might make
any representation or warranty of such party inaccurate or misleading in any
respect at, or as of any time prior to, the Closing Date or (ii) omit to take,
or agree to omit to take, any action necessary to prevent any such
representation or warranty from being inaccurate or misleading in any respect
at any such time.

  



  

(d) From the Agreement Date through the Closing Date, neither the Seller nor
the Group Companies, on the one hand, nor the Purchaser, on the other hand,
shall, and such Persons shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each of
their respective officers, directors, Affiliates, managers, consultant,

encourage, solicit, initiate, engage, respond to or participate in
negotiations with any Person concerning any Alternative Transaction, (ii) take
any other action intended or designed to facilitate the efforts of any Person

Alternative Transaction, (iii) approve, recommend or enter into any
Alternative Transaction or any Contract related to any Alternative Transaction

the obligations set forth above, in the event that there is an unsolicited
proposal for, or an indication of a serious interest in entering into, an
Alternative Transaction, communicated in writing to the Seller or any of the
Group Companies or the Purchaser or any of their respective
representatives or agents (each, an " _Alternative Proposal_ "), such party
shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event within one (1) Business
Day after receipt) advise the other parties to this Agreement orally and in
writing of any Alternative Proposal and the material terms and conditions of
any such Alternative Proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity
of the person making any such Alternative Proposal, and otherwise cease to
engage with the Person making such Alternative Proposal. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _Alternative Transaction_ " shall mean any of the
following transactions involving the Group Companies or the Purchaser (other
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement): (X) any merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination or other similar
transaction, or (Y) any sale, lease, exchange, transfer or other
disposition of a material portion of the assets of such Person (other than

transactions.

Business; provided that no investigation pursuant to this Section (or any
investigation prior to the Agreement Date) shall affect any representation or
warranty given by the Seller or the Purchaser and, provided further, that any
investigation pursuant to this Section shall be conducted in such manner as
not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the Business of the Group
Companies. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
neither party shall be required to provide the access described above or
disclose any information if doing so is reasonably likely to (i) result in a
waiver of attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or
similar privilege or (ii) violate any contract to which it is a party or to
which it is subject or applicable Law, provided that the non-disclosing party
must advise the other party that it is withholding such access and/or
information and (to the extent reasonably practicable) provide a description
of the access and/or information not disclosed.

  



  

6.3 _Notices of Certain Events_. Each party shall promptly notify the other
party of the following, provided that no such notice shall constitute an

in this Agreement, or any failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder, in each case which inaccuracy or failure would cause any of the
conditions set forth in Article VII not to be satisfied.

6.4 _Annual and Interim Financial Statements_. As soon as practicable (which
the Seller expects to be as disclosed in Schedule 6.4) after the Agreement

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Agreement Date (provided that the
Seller has provided to the Purchaser the information described in Section 6.4
and this Section 6.5(a)), but in any event no later than 30 days after the
Agreement Date, the Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC a proxy statement in preliminary

_Purchaser Stockholder Meeting_ ") seeking the approval of the Purchaser
Common Stockholders of the transactions contemplated hereby and offering to
redeem from its public stockholders the Purchaser Class A Common

and regulations of the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange, as modified by
the Letter Agreement, dated as of November 16, 2017, by and between the
Purchaser, the initial securityholders party thereto and the officers and
directors of the Purchaser party thereto (pursuant to which the initial
securityholders party thereto and the officers and directors of the Purchaser
party thereto agreed not to redeem their shares of Purchaser Common Shares in
connection with stockholder approval of a proposed Business Combination (as
defined therein)), and as may have been disclosed in the Prospectus. In the
Proxy Statement, the Purchaser shall seek (i) adoption and approval of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by the holders of
Purchaser Common Shares in accordance with the Purchaser's organizational
documents and the rules and regulations of the SEC and the New York Stock
Exchange, (ii) approval of an equity incentive plan for employees of the

Investor Rights Agreement (the " _Required Approval Matters_ "), (vi) the
adjournment of the special meeting if necessary or appropriate and (vii) to
obtain any and all other approvals necessary or advisable to effect the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby as the SEC (or staff
thereof) may indicate are necessary in its comments to the Proxy Statement or
in correspondence related thereto, or after consultation with the Seller,
determined by the Purchaser as necessary or appropriate in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. In connection with
the Proxy Statement, the Purchaser will also file with the SEC financial and
other information about the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance
with applicable proxy solicitation rules set forth in the Purchaser's
organizational documents, applicable Law and the rules and regulations of the
SEC and the New York Stock Exchange (such Proxy Statement and the documents
included or referred to therein pursuant to which the Purchaser Stockholder
Redemption will be made, together with any supplements, amendments and/or
exhibits thereto, the " _Proxy Documents_ "). Purchaser shall cause the Proxy
Documents to comply as to form and substance with the applicable requirements
of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. The Seller will
provide all financial and other information with respect to the Group
Companies and their business and operations as described in Section 6.4 and
such other information as is reasonably requested by the Purchaser and
necessary, pursuant to applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder, for inclusion in Proxy Documents. If
reasonably requested by the Purchaser in connection with the Purchaser's
preparation of the Proxy Documents, the Group Companies' financial statements

52

 



    



  

(b) The Purchaser shall mail the Proxy Statement to holders of Purchaser
Common Shares of record, as of the record date to be established by the
Purchaser Board. Each of the Seller and the Purchaser shall furnish all
information concerning such party and its Affiliates to the other party, and
provide such other assistance, as may be reasonably requested in connection
with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement. Each of
the Seller and the Purchaser shall promptly notify the other upon the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall provide the other
with copies of all correspondence between it and its representatives, on the
one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand. Each of the Seller and
the Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly
as reasonably practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect to the
Proxy Statement.

  



  

(c) Prior to filing with the SEC or mailing to the Purchaser Common
Stockholders, the Purchaser will consult and coordinate in good faith with
the Seller, and make available to the Seller preliminary drafts of the Proxy
Statement and any communications with the SEC related to the Proxy Statement,
and the parties will cooperate in good faith to respond to any SEC
communications and make any revisions to and finalize the Proxy Statement.
The Purchaser will advise the Seller promptly after receipt of notice thereof,

comments on the Proxy Statement promptly and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC under the Exchange Act
as soon after filing as reasonably practicable; provided, that prior to
responding to any comments or material requests from the SEC, the Purchaser
will make available to the Seller drafts of any such response and provide the
Seller with a reasonable opportunity to comment on such drafts (including the
proposed final version of such document or response).

  



  

   

53

 



    



  

(d) No information provided by the Seller or the Group Companies to the
Purchaser for inclusion in the Proxy Statement or any amendments thereto as
of the date of its submission to the SEC will cause the final Proxy Statement
to contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are made, not
misleading. If, at any time prior to the Purchaser Stockholder Meeting, there
shall be discovered any information that should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the Purchaser shall promptly transmit
to the Purchaser Common Stockholders an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement containing such information. If, at any time prior to the Purchaser
Stockholder Meeting, the Seller discovers any information, event or
circumstance relating to the Group Companies or any of its Affiliates,
officers, directors or employees that should be set forth in an amendment or a
supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, then the Seller
shall promptly inform the Purchaser of such information, event or
circumstance.

  



  

(e) The Purchaser shall make all filings required to be made by the Purchaser
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act, applicable "blue sky" laws and any rules and
regulations thereunder.

  



  

(f) The Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly
provide the Purchaser with all information concerning the Group Companies
reasonably requested by the Purchaser for inclusion in the Proxy Statement and
any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement (if any) and in any other
filing required to be made by the Purchaser with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, applicable
"blue sky" laws and any rules and regulations thereunder. The Seller shall
cause the officers and employees of the Group Companies to be reasonably
available to the Purchaser and its counsel in connection with the drafting of
the Proxy Statement and such other filings and responding in a timely manner
to comments relating to the Proxy Statement from the SEC.

  



  

   

54

 



    



  

6.6 _Purchaser Stockholder Meeting_. The Purchaser shall, as promptly as
practicable after being advised by the staff of the SEC that the staff of the
SEC has no further comments on the Proxy Documents, establish a record date
for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Purchaser Stockholder
Meeting. The Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
approval of the Required Approval Matters, including by soliciting proxies as
promptly as practicable in accordance with applicable Law and the
Purchaser's organizational documents for the purpose of approving the
Required Approval Matters. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Purchaser shall be entitled to adjourn the
Purchaser Stockholder Meeting (a) to ensure that any supplement or amendment
to the Proxy Statement that the Purchaser Board has determined in good faith
(based on written advice of the Purchaser's counsel) is required by
applicable Law is disclosed to the Purchaser Common Stockholders and for such
supplement or amendment to be promptly disseminated to the Purchaser Common
Stockholders prior to the Purchaser Stockholder Meeting, (b) if, as of the
time for which the Purchaser Stockholder Meeting is originally scheduled (as
set forth in the Proxy Statement), there are insufficient Purchaser Common
Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business to be conducted at the Purchaser
Stockholder Meeting, or (c) by ten (10) Business Days in order to solicit
additional proxies from the Purchaser Common Stockholders in favor of the
adoption of the Required Approval Matters; provided, that in the event of
an adjournment pursuant to clauses (a) or (b) above, the Purchaser
Stockholder Meeting shall be reconvened as promptly as practicable following
such time as the matters described in such clauses have been resolved, and in
no event shall the Purchaser Stockholder Meeting be reconvened on a date that
is later than ten (10) Business Days prior to November 21, 2019 unless the
Purchaser Common Stockholders have approved an Extension.

  



  

6.7 _Trust Account_.

  



  

(a) The Purchaser shall make appropriate arrangements to cause the funds in
the Trust Account to be disbursed in accordance with the Trust Agreement and
for the payment of (i) all amounts payable to stockholders of the Purchaser
holding Purchaser Units or Purchaser Common Shares who shall have validly
redeemed their Purchaser Units or Purchaser Common Shares upon acceptance by
the Purchaser of such Purchaser Units or Purchaser Common Shares, (ii) all
the Transaction Expenses of the Seller and the Purchaser,
respectively, incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, provided that all such Transaction Expenses shall be paid at
the Closing and (iii) the Deferred Underwriting Amount to the underwriter in
the IPO. Following the payments described in the preceding sentence, the
Trust Account shall terminate, except as otherwise provided in the Trust
Agreement. The Purchaser shall not agree to, or permit, any amendment or
modification of, or waiver under, the Trust Agreement without the prior
written consent of the Seller.

  



  

   

55

 



    



  

(b) Reference is made to the final prospectus of the Purchaser, filed with
the SEC (File No. 333-221116) (the " _Prospectus_ "), and dated as of
November 16, 2017. The Seller warrants and represents that it has read the
Prospectus and understands that the Purchaser established a trust account
containing the proceeds of the IPO and from certain private placements
occurring simultaneously with the IPO (collectively, with interest accrued
from time to time thereon, the " _Trust Fund_ ") initially in an amount of
$300,000,000 for the benefit of the Purchaser's public stockholders (the "
_Public Stockholders_ ") and certain parties (including the underwriters of
the IPO) and that, except for a portion of the interest earned on the
amounts held in the Trust Fund and not previously released to the Purchaser
to pay franchise and income taxes and up to $750,000 annually for working
capital purposes, that the Purchaser may disburse monies from the Trust Fund
only: (i) to the Public Stockholders in the event they elect to redeem the
shares of Purchaser Class A Common Shares in connection with the consummation
of the Purchaser's initial business combination (as such term is used in the
Prospectus) (the " _Business Combination_ "), (ii) to the Public Stockholders
if the Purchaser fails to consummate a Business Combination within 24 months
from the closing of the IPO, or (iii) to the Purchaser after or concurrently
with the consummation of a Business Combination. For and in consideration of
the Purchaser entering into this Agreement, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged,
the Seller hereby agrees that it does not now and shall not at any time
hereafter have any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any
monies in the Trust Fund or distributions therefrom, or make any claim
against, the Trust Fund, regardless of whether such claim arises as a result
of, in connection with or relating in any way to, any proposed or actual
business relationship between the Seller and the Purchaser, this Agreement or
any other matter, and regardless of whether such claim arises based on
contract, tort, equity or any other theory of legal liability (any and all
such claims are collectively referred to hereafter as the " _Claims_ "). The
Seller hereby irrevocably waives any Claims it may have against the Trust Fund
(including any distributions therefrom) now or in the future as a result of,
or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with the
Purchaser and will not seek recourse against the Trust Fund (including any
distributions therefrom) for any reason whatsoever (including, without
limitation, for an alleged breach of this Agreement; provided, however, that
this _Section 6.7_ shall not affect any other rights or remedies of the
Seller pursuant to this Agreement or any other agreement entered into in
connection herewith or in furtherance of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including but not limited to a breach of this Agreement). The Seller
agrees and acknowledges that such irrevocable waiver is material to this
Agreement and specifically relied upon by the Purchaser to induce it to enter
in this Agreement, and the Seller further intends and understands such waiver
to be valid, binding and enforceable under applicable law. To the extent the
Seller commences any action or proceeding based upon, in connection with,
relating to or arising out of any matter relating to the Purchaser, which
proceeding seeks, in whole or in part, monetary relief against the
Purchaser, the Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees its sole remedy shall be
against funds held outside of the Trust Fund and that such claim shall not
permit the Seller (or any party claiming on the Seller's behalf or in lieu of
the Seller) to have any claim against the Trust Fund (including any
distributions therefrom) or any amounts contained therein. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Seller shall be entitled to seek any and all remedies
available at law or in equity with respect to any funds from the Trust Fund
that are not subject to the limitations provided in this _Section 6.7(b)_
including, without limitation, pursuant to _Section 6.22(c)_.

  



  

6.8 _Effect of Purchaser Stockholder Redemptions_. Prior to the Closing and
pursuant to the Redemption Side Letter, in the event that the number of
Purchaser Class A Common Shares that are redeemed by the stockholders of the
Purchaser exceeds the threshold specified in the Redemption Side Letter, then
(a) a certain number of shares of Purchaser's Class F common stock shall be
forfeited by the holders thereof in accordance with the terms and the formula
set forth in the Redemption Side Letter and (b) the holders of Purchaser's
Class F common stock will receive the right to be issued a number of Class A
Common Shares equal to the number of such forfeited shares of Purchaser's
Class F common stock (subject to adjustment) upon the achievement of certain
stock price criteria of the Purchaser set forth in the Redemption Side
Letter, and subject in all respects to the terms and conditions thereof.

  



  

   

56

 



    



  

6.9 _Management and Key Employees_. Schedule 6.9 lists those individuals
designated by the Group Companies as management and key employees of the
Group Companies (the " _Key Personnel_ "). The Purchaser shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to enter into, prior to the Closing Date,
mutually agreeable agreements with the Key Personnel with respect to
compensation, equity ownership, incentive arrangements and retention.

  



  

6.10 _Listing_. The Purchaser shall (a) cause the Closing Payment Shares to
be approved for listing on and tradable over the New York Stock Exchange, (b)
cause the Purchaser Units, the Purchaser Class A Common Shares and the
Purchaser Warrants to remain listed on the New York Stock Exchange from and
after the Agreement Date until the earlier of the Closing Date and the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article X.

  



  

6.11 _Section 16 of the Exchange Act_. Prior to the Closing, the Purchaser
Board, or an appropriate committee thereof, shall adopt a
resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC relating to
Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act, such that the acquisition of Purchaser
Class A Common Shares pursuant to this Agreement by any officer or director of
the Group Companies who is expected to become a "covered person" of the
Purchaser for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder (" _Section 16_ ") shall be an exempt acquisition for
purposes of Section 16.

  



  

6.12 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Further Assurances_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including that the
parties' respective obligations in respect of actions under the Antitrust
Laws are solely governed by Section 6.13), each party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or desirable under
applicable Laws, and to cooperate as reasonably requested by the other
parties, to consummate and to implement expeditiously each of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Reorganization). The parties
hereto shall execute and deliver such other documents,
certificates, agreements and other writings and take such other actions as
may be necessary or reasonably desirable in order to consummate or implement
expeditiously each of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Reorganization).

  



  

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.12(a), the Seller and the
Group Companies will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the
Purchaser with all cooperation as it relates to the Seller and the Group
Companies reasonably necessary in connection with satisfying the conditions
to, or as is otherwise reasonably requested by the Purchaser in connection
with, all Required Approval Matters, including without limitation (i)
participating in a reasonable and limited number of meetings, presentations,
road shows and other sessions with Purchaser stockholders and their
respective advisors and (ii) assisting the Purchaser with the timely
preparation of presentations, memoranda or other documentation reasonably
requested in connection with the Required Approval Matters.

  



  

   

57

 



    



  

6.13 _Antitrust Filings_. Each of the Seller (and its Affiliates, if
applicable), on the one hand, and the Purchaser (and its Affiliates,
if applicable), on the other hand, will (i) file with the FTC and the
Antitrust Division of the DOJ a Notification and Report Form relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as required by
the HSR Act within twenty (20) Business Days following the Agreement Date;
and (ii) if required, promptly file comparable pre-merger or post-merger
notification filings, forms and submissions with any Authority that are
required by other applicable Antitrust Laws in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Seller and the
Purchaser will use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) cooperate and
coordinate (and cause its respective Affiliates to cooperate and coordinate)
with the other in the making of such filings; (B) supply the other (or cause
the other to be supplied) with any information that may reasonably be required
in order to make such filings; (C) promptly respond to any request for
additional information relating to such filings from the FTC, the DOJ or the
Authorities of any other applicable jurisdiction in which any such filing is
made; and (D) take all reasonable action necessary to (1) cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods pursuant to the
HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws applicable to the transactions
contemplated by this _Agreement_ ; and (2) obtain any required consents
pursuant to any Antitrust Laws applicable to the _transactions contemplated
by this Agreement_ , in each case as soon as practicable, subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Each of the Seller (and its
Affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand, and the Purchaser (and its
Affiliates), on the other hand, will promptly inform the other of any
communication from any Authority regarding the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in connection with such filings. If any party or Affiliate
thereof receives a request for additional information or documentary material
from any Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws applicable to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such party will make
(or cause to be made), as soon as reasonably practicable and after
consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in compliance with
such request. Each party will provide the other party in advance, with a
reasonable opportunity for review and comment thereon, copies of any proposed
communication with the FTC, the DOJ, or any other Authority relating to
the review under any Antitrust Law of the transactions contemplated hereby.
No party shall participate in any material communication or meeting with the
FTC, the DOJ, or any other Authority relating to the review under any
Antitrust Law of the transactions contemplated hereby, unless the party gives
the other party reasonable advance notice of such meeting or communication
and, unless prohibited by the relevant Authority, permits the other party to
attend and participate therein. Nothing in this Agreement obligates
the Purchaser, the Seller, or any of their respective Affiliates, as
applicable, to agree to or implement (i) any divestiture, holding separate,
sale, license, or other disposition of any assets, businesses, or operations
of the Purchaser, its Affiliates, or the Group Companies; or (ii) any
modification, restriction, limitation, or other restraint or condition upon
any assets, businesses, or operations of the Purchaser, its Affiliates, or
the Group Companies. Any such measures to which the Purchaser agrees that
affect the assets, businesses, or operations of the Group Companies shall be
conditioned upon the prior occurrence of the Closing. The Purchaser (and its
Affiliates, if applicable) agrees that, between the date of this Agreement and
the Closing, it shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to,
take any action, including but not limited to entering into any Contracts for
an acquisition (by stock purchase, merger, consolidation, amalgamation,
purchase of assets, license or otherwise) of any ownership interest or assets
of any Person, that would likely prevent or materially delay obtaining any
required consents pursuant to any Antitrust Laws applicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

   

58

 



    



  

6.14 _Reasonable Efforts to Obtain Consents_. The Seller shall cause the
Group Companies to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain each of the
third party consents identified on Schedule 6.14 as promptly as practicable
hereafter.

  



  

6.15 _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) _Cooperation_. The Purchaser, the Seller and their Affiliates will
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
party, in connection with any Tax matters relating to the Group Companies
(including by the provision of reasonably relevant records or information).
The party requesting such cooperation will pay the reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses of the other party. Each of Purchaser, the Group Companies and
Seller shall retain all books and records in their possession with respect to
Taxes for a period of at least seven (7) years following the Closing Date.

  



  

(b) _Tax Returns for Pre-Closing Tax Periods Filed before the Closing_. The
Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns for the Group
Companies that solely relate to Pre-Closing Tax Periods to be filed before the
Closing, and shall be responsible for the timely filing (taking into account
any extensions received from the relevant Taxing Authority) of such Tax
Returns. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the
terms of this Agreement and the Group Companies' past practices, as
applicable, except to the extent required by applicable Law. Such Tax Returns
shall be true and correct and completed in accordance with applicable Law.
Such Tax Returns (including any related work papers or other information
reasonably requested by the Purchaser), shall be provided to the Purchaser
for its review and comment at least thirty (30) days before the due date for
filing such Tax Returns (including extensions) and Seller shall reasonably
and in good faith consider revisions to such Tax Return as are requested by
Purchaser. Any disagreement between Purchaser and Seller shall be resolved by
the Independent Expert. All Taxes shown on such Tax Returns shall be paid by
the Group Companies as and when required by applicable Law.

  



  

(c) _Tax Returns for Pre-Closing Tax Periods Filed After the Closing._
Subject to Section 6.15(d), the Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be
prepared all Tax Returns solely relating to all Pre-Closing Tax Periods
required by applicable Law to be filed by the Group Companies after the
Closing Date to the extent not described in Section 6.15(b) above. If any such
Tax Returns would have the effect of increasing the liability of the Seller
for Taxes, either directly, as a result of an indemnification obligation
pursuant to this Agreement, or otherwise (" _Seller Tax Items_ "), then the
Purchaser shall provide such Tax Returns to the Seller for its review and
comment at least thirty (30) days prior to the date such Tax Returns are
required to be filed. The Purchaser shall reasonably and in good faith
consider revisions to such Tax Return as are requested by Seller to the extent
such comments relate to Seller Tax Items. Any disagreement between Purchaser
and Seller shall be resolved by the Independent Expert. Not later than five
(5) days prior to the due date for the payment of Taxes on any Tax Returns
which Purchaser has the responsibility to cause to be filed pursuant to this
Section 6.15(c), the Seller shall pay to Purchaser the amount of Taxes
included in such Tax Returns (unless otherwise taken into account as an
adjustment to the Closing Payment Shares).

  



  

   

59

 



    



  

(d) _ _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns for Straddle Periods__. In the
case of a Straddle Period, the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by
income, receipts or payroll of the Group Companies for the Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be determined based on a closing of the books as of the close of
business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the taxable period of any
partnership or other pass-through entity in which any Group Company holds a
beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time) and the
amount of other Taxes of the Group Companies for a Straddle Period that
relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of
such Tax for the entire taxable period (or, in the case of such Taxes
determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately
preceding period) multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period. The
Purchaser shall cause the Group Companies to prepare and file, or cause to be
prepared and filed, all Tax Returns for the Group Companies for the Straddle
Periods. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the
terms of this Agreement and the Group Companies' past practices, as
applicable, except to the extent required by applicable Law. Purchaser shall
permit the Seller to review and comment on each such Straddle Period Tax
Return prior to filing it, to the extent that such Straddle Period Tax Return
relates to Seller Tax Items, and Purchaser shall reasonably and in good faith
consider such revisions to such Straddle Period Tax Return as are requested
by Seller. Not later than five (5) days prior to the due date for the payment
of Taxes on any Tax Returns which Purchaser has the responsibility to cause
to be filed pursuant to this Section 6.15(d), the Seller shall pay to
Purchaser the amount of Taxes included in such Tax Returns that are allocable
to the pre-Closing portion of a Straddle Period pursuant to the provisions of
this Section 6.15(d) (unless otherwise taken into account as an adjustment to
the Closing Payment Shares). Any disagreement between the Purchaser and the
Seller as to the allocation of Tax items pursuant to this Section 6.15(d)
shall be resolved by the Independent Expert.

  



  

(e) _Tax Refunds_. (A) The Seller shall be entitled to any Tax refunds or
credits (that result in an actual reduction in cash Taxes) that are received
by the Purchaser or the Group Companies attributable to Taxes paid by the
Seller or the Group Companies with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
any Taxes for which the Seller has indemnified the Purchaser; __provided__ _,_
 that Sellers shall not be entitled to any such Tax refunds or credits to the
extent that (i) such Tax refunds or credits are taking into account in
calculating the Closing Payment Shares, (ii) such Tax refunds or credits
result from a loss carry-back from a Post-Closing Tax Period, or (iii) such
Tax refunds or credits are used by Purchaser to recover its right to indemnity
pursuant to this Agreement. The Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid,
over to the Seller any such refund or the amount of any such credit, net of
any costs incurred by Purchaser in obtaining such Tax refunds or credits,
within five (5) Business Days after actual receipt of such refund or actual
realization of such credit against Taxes. Purchaser and Seller will equitably
apportion any Tax refunds or credits (including any interest received
thereon) received or realized with respect to Taxes imposed on or with respect

2020 (the " _Initial Extension Date_ ") and thereafter it shall be extended

Initial Loan that were not redeemed prior to such date, plus (ii) the
loan amount specified in a certificate to the Seller signed by the Chief
Executive Officer of the Purchaser (the " _CEO Certificate_ "), certifying

resources available to the Purchaser at the relevant time from any
source, including any amounts available from the Trust Fund and any interest
payments available in connection therewith, which loan amount shall not
exceed $300,000.

  



  

   

63

 



    



  

(c) In the event that after the Initial Loan the Seller requests that the
Purchaser extend the then-current Outside Extended Date by an additional 30
days in accordance with Section 6.22(a), then the Purchaser shall so extend

to exceed one million dollars (US$ 1,000,000), provided that the Purchaser
delivered to the Seller a CEO Certificate, which CEO Certificate shall be
delivered by the Purchaser to the Seller prior to the Seller's determination
whether or not to request extension of the then-current Outside
Extended Date. The Seller Loans will be repayable by the Purchaser at the
Closing or upon consummation of any initial business combination. The Seller
Loans will be forgiven by the Seller if the Closing does not occur and the
Trust Account liquidates, except to the extent of any funds that are
available to the Purchaser (i) after such liquidation in accordance with the
Trust Agreement, or (ii) from any other source.

steps to mitigate and minimize all Losses that could result from or relate to
such breach or claim. All indemnification payments made pursuant to
this Agreement shall be treated by the parties as a purchase price adjustment
for Tax purposes to the extent permitted by applicable Law. To the extent the
Indemnified Party recognizes any net Tax Benefits as a result of any Losses in
the taxable year of such Indemnified Party in which such indemnity payment is
made (or, if applicable, a prior taxable year), the Indemnified Party
will pay the amount of such Tax Benefits to the Indemnifying Party within
thirty (30) days of such Tax Benefits being recognized by the Indemnified
Party (to the extent such Tax Benefits are recognized prior to the payment of
the Losses, the amount of the Losses will be reduced by the amount of the Tax
Benefit actually recognized). For this purpose, the Indemnified Party will be
deemed to recognize a Tax Benefit (the " _Tax Benefit_ ") with respect to a
taxable year if, and to the extent that, the Indemnified Party's liability
for Taxes for such taxable year, calculated by excluding any Tax items
attributable to the Losses, exceeds the Indemnified Party's actual liability
for Taxes for such taxable year, calculated by taking into account any Tax
items attributable to the Losses.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Seller shall not have any liability or indemnification obligation for any
Taxes of the Group Companies (i) resulting from any action taken on the
Closing Date after the Closing by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
(including the Group Companies) that is outside the ordinary course of
business or (ii) that are incurred in or relate to a Post-Closing Tax Period
(as determined under the principles set forth in Section 6.15(d)).

  



  

   

70

 



    



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, solely for
purposes of determining the amount of Losses that are the subject matter of a
claim for indemnification or reimbursement hereunder, each representation and
warranty in this Agreement will be read without regard and without giving
effect to the terms "material" or "Company Group Material Adverse Effect"
or similar phrases contained in such representation or warranty which have
the effect of making such representation and warranty less restrictive (as if
such word or qualification were deleted from such representation and
warranty).

  



  

(e) The Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to indemnification for Losses
suffered by it if, and to the extent, it (including Purchaser) has already
been fully compensated with respect to the underlying circumstances relating
to such Losses in a post-Closing adjustment under Section 2.8 or otherwise
under this Agreement.

  



  

8.5 _Procedure_. The following shall apply with respect to all claims by the
Indemnified Party for indemnification:

  



  

(a) In the event the Indemnified Party desires to make a Claim, the Purchaser
shall deliver a written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the Indemnifying
Party, setting forth (i) the nature of and factual and legal basis for the
Claim in reasonable detail and (ii) the aggregate amount of Losses for which
indemnification is being sought that have been incurred, or to the extent not
yet incurred, a good faith estimate of the amount of such Losses reasonably
expected to be incurred (the " _Claim Amount_ "). Any Claim Amount or any
other matter set forth in a Claim Notice will be deemed to be finally resolved
for purposes of this Article VIII when (A) resolved by a written agreement
executed by the Purchaser and the Seller or (B) resolved by a final,
nonappealable order, decision or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction
or arbitrator (clauses (A) and (B), together, a " _Final Resolution_ ").

  



  

(b) The Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party, as applicable,
prompt notice (and within no more than 10 days) of any Third Party Claim with
respect to which the Indemnified Party seeks indemnification pursuant to
Section 8.1 (a " _Third Party Claim Notice_ "), which shall include the same
information as a Claim Notice. The failure to give the Third- Party
Claim Notice shall not impair any of the rights or benefits of the
Indemnified Party to indemnification under this Article VIII, except to the
extent such failure actually prejudices any right, defense or claim available
to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim. Thereafter,
the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after
the Indemnified Party's receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received from the counterparty in such third party
Action by the Indemnified Party relating to the claim.

  



  

   

71

 



    



  

(c) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to exercise full control of
the defense, compromise or settlement of any Third Party Claim by written
notice to the Purchaser within sixty (60) days of delivery of the Third Party
Claim Notice. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any such Third
Party Claim pursuant to this Section 8.5(c), then the Indemnified Party shall
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in any manner reasonably requested in
connection with the defense, and the Indemnified Party shall have the right
to be kept reasonably informed by the Indemnifying Party and its legal counsel
with respect to the status of any legal proceedings, to the extent not
inconsistent with the preservation of attorney-client or work product
privilege. If the Indemnifying Party so assumes the defense of any such Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate
counsel and to participate in (but not control) the defense, compromise, or
settlement thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel employed by the
Indemnified Party shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party unless (i)
the Indemnifying Party has agreed to pay such fees and expenses, or (ii) the
named parties to such Third Party Claim (including any impleaded parties)
include the Indemnified Party and counsel for the Purchaser and the
Indemnifying Party agrees that there is an actual conflict of
interest between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party in
connection with the defense thereof, in which case the reasonable fees and
expenses of such separate counsel shall be Losses eligible for submission in a
Claim, subject to the other terms of this Article VIII. The Indemnifying
Party shall seek the prior written consent of the Purchaser (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to any settlement or
compromise of any Third Party Claim to the extent such settlement or
compromise: (A) includes equitable relief against the Indemnified Party, (B)
involves the resolution of criminal allegations against the Indemnified
Party or (C) will impose liability that will not be satisfied in full by the
Cap.

  



  

(d) To the extent the Indemnifying Party does not elect to assume the defense
of any Third Party Claim pursuant to the terms of Section 8.5(c), the
Purchaser may elect to conduct such defense, using legal counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party will not settle
any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  



  

8.6 _Insurance_. Any indemnification payments hereunder shall take into
account any insurance proceeds or other third party reimbursement
actually received. In the event that a recovery is made by the Indemnified
Party or any Affiliate of the Indemnified Party with respect to any Losses
for which the Indemnified Party has already been indemnified hereunder, then a
refund equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery shall be made promptly
to the Indemnifying Party.

  



  

8.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, except as expressly set forth otherwise,
this Article VIII shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnified
Party from and after the Closing and shall be in lieu of any other remedies
that may be available to the Indemnified Party under any other agreement or
pursuant to any statutory or common law with respect to any Losses directly
or indirectly resulting from or arising out of any claims arising under this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that the foregoing sentence shall not be deemed a waiver by any
party of any right to specific performance or injunctive relief, or any right
or remedy arising by reason of any Fraud Claims.

arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including the
existence, meaning, effect, validity, termination, interpretation,
performance, breach or termination thereof (including any action in
tort, contract, equity, or otherwise) or enforcement of this Agreement), or
any dispute regarding non-contractual obligations arising out of or relating
to it shall (except as specifically set forth in Sections 2.8, 3.3 and 3.4 of
this Agreement) be referred to and finally resolved by binding arbitration
under the then current provisions of the rules of the American Arbitration
Association in force when the notice of arbitration is submitted.

  



  

(b) The law of this arbitration clause shall be New York law.

  



  

(c) The seat of arbitration shall be New York, New York.

Arbitrators shall have any competitive interests with the Group Companies,
the Seller or the Purchaser.

  



  

(e) The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in English.

  



  

(f) The Arbitrators shall issue a written decision, setting forth findings of

(g) The parties agree that all costs and expenses (including counsel fees) of
any such arbitration shall be borne by the non-prevailing party, and the non-
prevailing party waives its right to seek an order compelling the prevailing
party to pay its portion of its costs and expenses (including counsel fees)
for any arbitration. The determination of a majority of the Arbitrators shall
be final and binding upon the parties and not subject to appeal.

  



  

(h) Any judgment upon any award rendered by the Arbitrators may be entered in
and enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties expressly
consent to the personal and subject matter jurisdiction of the Arbitrators to
arbitrate any and all matters to be submitted to arbitration hereunder
pursuant to the terms hereof. None of the parties hereto shall challenge any
arbitration hereunder on the grounds that any party necessary to such
arbitration (including the parties hereto) shall have been absent from such
arbitration for any reason, including that such party shall have been the
subject of any bankruptcy, reorganization, or insolvency proceeding.

  



  

(i) The parties to the arbitration may apply to a court of competent
jurisdiction for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction or
other interim or conservatory relief, as necessary, without breach of this
arbitration provision and without abridgement of the powers of the
Arbitrators.

  



  

(j) This arbitration section shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

  



  

   

73

 



    



  

9.2 _Waiver of Jury Trial; Exemplary Damages_.

  



  

(a) THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND
IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT EACH SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, IN ANY COURT IN WHICH AN ACTION MAY BE
COMMENCED, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
ADDITIONAL AGREEMENT. NO PARTY SHALL BE AWARDED PUNITIVE OR OTHER EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES RESPECTING ANY DISPUTE ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ADDITIONAL
AGREEMENT.

  



  

(b) Each of the parties to this Agreement acknowledge that each has been
represented in connection with the signing of this waiver by
independent legal counsel selected by the respective party and that such
party has discussed the legal consequences and import of this waiver with
legal counsel. Each of the parties to this Agreement further acknowledge that
each has read and understands the meaning of this waiver and grants this
waiver knowingly, voluntarily, without duress and only after consideration of
the consequences of this waiver with legal counsel.

  



  

Article X

competent jurisdiction, that, in each case, prohibits, makes illegal or
enjoins the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the Reorganization and has become final and non-appealable; _provided_ ,

10.1(b) shall not be available to a party if such prohibition or injunction

action or failure to act (which action or failure to act constitutes a
material breach by such party of any representation, warranty, covenant
or other agreement of such party set forth in this Agreement) has been the
primary cause of, or primarily resulted in, either (A) the failure to satisfy
the conditions to the obligations of the terminating party to consummate the
Closing set forth in _Article VII_ prior to the Outside Extended Date; or (B)
the failure of the Closing to have occurred prior to the Outside

days following the Purchaser's delivery of written notice of such breach or
failure to the Seller and (y) the Outside Extended Date;

  



  

(f) by the Purchaser, if the Seller is unable for any reason to deliver (as

agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform

days following the Seller's delivery of written notice of such breach or

(b) _Effect of Termination_. Any valid termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 10.1 will be effective immediately upon the delivery of
written notice by the terminating party to the other party, except as

stockholder, director, officer, employee, Affiliate, agent or other
Representative of such party) to the other party, as applicable, except (i)

11.2 _Amendments; No Waivers; Remedies_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement cannot be amended, except by a writing signed by each
party, and cannot be terminated orally or by course of conduct. No provision
hereof can be waived, except by a writing signed by the party against whom
such waiver is to be enforced, and any such waiver shall apply only in the
particular instance in which such waiver shall have been given.

  



  

(b) Neither any failure or delay in exercising any right or remedy hereunder
or in requiring satisfaction of any condition herein nor any course of
dealing shall constitute a waiver of or prevent any party from enforcing any
right or remedy or from requiring satisfaction of any condition. No notice to
or demand on a party waives or otherwise affects any obligation of that party
or impairs any right of the party giving such notice or making such demand,
including any right to take any action without notice or demand not
otherwise required by this Agreement. No exercise of any right or remedy with
respect to a breach of this Agreement shall preclude exercise of any other
right or remedy, as appropriate to make the aggrieved party whole with respect
to such breach, or subsequent exercise of any right or remedy with respect to
any other breach.

  



  

(c) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no statement herein of any
right or remedy shall impair any other right or remedy stated herein or that
otherwise may be available.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, neither shall any party
seek, nor shall any party be liable for, punitive or exemplary damages, under
any tort, contract, equity, or other legal theory, with respect to any breach
(or alleged breach) of this Agreement or any provision hereof or any matter
otherwise relating hereto or arising in connection herewith.

  



  

11.3 _Interpretation_. The parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event of an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement will be construed
as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof
will arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

11.4 _Publicity_.

  



  

(a) Except as required by Law and except with respect to the Purchaser SEC
Documents, the parties agree that neither they nor their agents shall
issue any press release or make any other public disclosure concerning the
transactions contemplated hereunder without the prior approval of the other
party hereto provided, however, that each party may make any such announcement
which it in good faith believes, based on advice of counsel, is necessary or
advisable in connection with any requirement of Law, it being understood and
agreed that each party shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, confer
with the other parties concerning the timing and content of such press
release or public announcement before the same is made.

  



  

   

77

 



    



  

(b) The Seller and the Purchaser shall mutually agree upon and, as promptly
as practicable after the execution of this Agreement (but in any event within
four (4) Business Days thereafter), issue a press release announcing the
execution of this Agreement (the " _Signing Press Release_ "). Promptly after
the issuance of the Signing Press Release (but in any event within four (4)
Business Days after the execution of this Agreement), the Purchaser shall
file a current report on Form 8-K (the " _Signing Filing_ ") with the
Signing Press Release and a description of this Agreement as required by
applicable federal securities Laws, which the Seller shall have the right to
review, comment upon and approve (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) prior to filing. The Seller and the
Purchaser shall mutually agree upon and, as promptly as practicable after the
Closing (but in any event within four (4) Business Days thereafter), issue a
press release announcing the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (the " _Closing Press Release_ "). Promptly after the issuance
of the Closing Press Release (but in any event within four (4) Business Days
after the Closing), the Purchaser shall file a current report on Form 8-K
(the " _Closing Filing_ ") with the Closing Press Release and a description
of the Closing as required by federal securities Laws which the Seller shall
have the right to review, comment upon and approve (which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) prior to filing. In
connection with the preparation of the Signing Press Release, the Signing
Filing, the Closing Press Release or the Closing Filing, each party shall,
upon written request by any other party, furnish such other party with all
information concerning itself, its directors, officers and equityholders, and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary for such report,
statement, filing, notice or application.

  



  

11.5 _Transaction Expenses_. If the transactions contemplated herein are
consummated, the Purchaser shall bear the Transaction Expenses (other than
Taxes to the extent not contemplated in the definition of Transaction
Expenses) of all parties in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby as provided herein.

  



  

11.6 _No Assignment or Delegation_. No party may assign any right or
delegate any obligation hereunder, including by merger,
consolidation, operation of law, or otherwise, without the prior written
consent of the other party; provided, however, that without prior
written consent, the Seller may assign any of its rights and delegate any of
its obligations under this Agreement (on a full or partial basis, permanently
or temporarily, or for one or more specific instances or circumstances) under
this Agreement to any of its Affiliates.

  



  

11.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with
and governed by the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to
the conflict of laws principles thereof that would result in the application
of the laws of another jurisdiction.

  



  

11.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple original,
PDF or facsimile counterparts, each of which shall constitute an
original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one agreement.
This Agreement shall become effective upon delivery to each party of an
executed counterpart or the earlier delivery to each party of original,
photocopied, or electronically transmitted signature pages that together (but
need not individually) bear the signatures of all other parties.

  



  

11.9 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement together with the Additional
Agreements sets forth the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous
understandings and agreements related thereto (whether written or oral). No
provision of this Agreement or any Additional Agreement may be explained or
qualified by any agreement, negotiations, understanding, discussion, conduct
or course of conduct or by any trade usage. Except as otherwise expressly
stated herein or any Additional Agreement, there is no condition precedent to
the effectiveness of any provision hereof or thereof. No party has relied on
any representation from, or warranty or agreement of, any person in entering
into this Agreement, prior hereto or contemporaneous herewith or any
Additional Agreement, except those expressly stated herein or therein.

  



  

   

78

 



    



  

11.10 _Severability_. A determination by a court or other legal authority
that any provision that is not of the essence of this Agreement is
legally invalid shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
provision hereof. The parties shall cooperate in good faith to substitute (or
cause such court or other legal authority to substitute) for any provision so
held to be invalid a valid provision, as alike in substance to such invalid
provision as is lawful.

  



  

11.11 _Construction_. In this Agreement:

  



  

(a) References to particular sections and subsections, schedules, and
exhibits not otherwise specified are cross-references to sections and
subsections, schedules, and exhibits of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) The words "herein," "hereof," "hereunder," and words of similar import
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of
this Agreement, and, unless the context requires otherwise, "party" means a
party signatory hereto.

  



  

(c) Any use of the singular or plural, or the masculine, feminine, or neuter
gender, includes the others, unless the context otherwise requires;
"including" means "including without limitation"; "or" means "and/or"; "any"
means "any one, more than one, or all"; and, unless otherwise specified, any
financial or accounting term has the meaning of the term under U.S. GAAP.

  



  

(d) Unless otherwise specified, any reference to any agreement (including
this Agreement), instrument, or other document includes all
schedules, exhibits, or other attachments referred to therein, and any
reference to a statute or other law includes any rule, regulation, ordinance,
or the like promulgated thereunder, in each case, as amended, restated,
supplemented, or otherwise modified from time to time. Any reference to a
numbered schedule means the same-numbered section of the disclosure schedule.
Any reference in a schedule contained in the disclosure schedules delivered
by a party hereunder shall be deemed to be an exception to (or, as
applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) the applicable representations and
warranties (or applicable covenants) that are contained in the section of
this Agreement that corresponds to such schedule and any other representations
and warranties of such party that are contained in this Agreement to which
the relevance of such item thereto is reasonably apparent on its face. The
mere inclusion of an item in a schedule as an exception to (or, as
applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) a representation or warranty
shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material
exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item would
have a Company Group Material Adverse Effect or Purchaser Material Adverse
Effect, as applicable, or establish any standard of materiality to define
further the meaning of such terms for purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

   

79

 



    



  

(e) If any action is required to be taken or notice is required to be given
within a specified number of days following a specific date or event, the day
of such date or event is not counted in determining the last day for such
action or notice. If any action is required to be taken or notice is required
to be given on or before a particular day that is not a Business Day, such
action or notice shall be considered timely if it is taken or given on or
before the next Business Day.

  



  

(f) Captions are not a part of this Agreement, but are included for
convenience, only.

  



  

11.12 _Further Assurances_. Each party shall execute and deliver such
documents and take such action, as may reasonably be considered within the
scope of such party's obligations hereunder, necessary to effectuate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Additional Agreements.

  



  

11.13 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any provision
hereof confers any benefit or right upon or may be enforced by any Person not
a signatory hereto.

  



  

11.14 _Waiver_. Reference is made to the final IPO prospectus of the
Purchaser, dated November 17, 2017 (the " _Prospectus_ "). The Seller has
read the Prospectus and understands that the Purchaser has established the
Trust Account for the benefit of the public stockholders of the Purchaser and
the underwriters of the IPO pursuant to the Trust Agreement and that, except
for a portion of the interest earned on the amounts held in the Trust

EARNOUT PROVISIONS

  



  



  

Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings
assigned thereto in the Share Exchange Agreement (the "Agreement") to which
these Earnout Provisions are attached.

  



  

Section 1. Earn-out Calculation; Indemnity Offset:

  



  

The "Earnout Payment" is the amount determined in accordance with Section 2
based on the Madhouse EBITDA Average Annual Growth Rate for the three
year performance period (i.e., calendar years 2020-2022), with the Earnout
Payment subject to reduction or offset for:

  



  

(x) the Madhouse Increased Working Capital Deduction (if any); and

  



  

(y) any indemnifiable Losses in accordance with the provisions of Article
VIII of the Agreement and to the extent not previously indemnified in cash.

  



  

As described in Section 6 below, Seller has assigned a portion of the Earnout
Payment actually received in connection with formation of a long-term
incentive plan.

  



    

Sch-II-1

 



    



  

Section 2. Earnout Payment; Certain Definitions:

  



  

The "Earnout Payment" is determined (before any reduction as provided in
Section 1) based on the Madhouse EBITDA Annual Average Growth Rate in
accordance with the following table:

  



      

_Madhouse EBITDA Annual Average Growth Rate _

  | _Earnout Payment_ 
---|--- 
   < 5%  | Zero 
   5%   | $29,000,0000 
   > 5% but less than or equal to 15%   | $29,000,000 _plus_ the product of
(i) $71,000,000 _times_ (ii) (X _minus_ 5%) _divided by_ 10%) 
   15%   | $100,000,000 
   > 15% but less than or equal to 25%  | $100,000,000 _plus_ the product
of (i) $122,000,000 _times_ (ii) (X _minus_ 15%) _divided by_ 10%) 
   25% or greater  | $222,000,000 
  



  

where, X = the Madhouse EBITDA Annual Average Growth Rate (expressed as a
percentage rounded to the nearest 1/100th of 1%)

  



  

"Borrowed Indebtedness" means, without duplication, the sum of (i)
Indebtedness for borrowed money (including any principal, premium, accrued and
unpaid interest, related expenses, prepayment penalties, commitment and other
fees) and (ii) obligations evidenced by notes, bonds, debentures or similar
instruments.

  



  

"Designated Working Capital" means, as of any particular time, the
difference, whether positive or negative, of (a) total current assets of
Madhouse (excluding Cash) minus (b) total current liabilities of Madhouse,
excluding the current portion of any Borrowed Indebtedness of Madhouse.

  



  

"Designated Working Capital Increase Related Interest Cost" means in respect
of calendar year 2020, 2021 and 2022, as applicable, the result of (i) the
excess, if any, of (a) the aggregate month-end Designated Working Capital
balances for each month of such year _divided by_ 12 _over_  (b) $46,000,000
_times_ (ii) the higher of (x) the Purchaser's average annual bank borrowing
rate for such year and (y) the average annual bank financing rate that
Madhouse actually incurred in such year.

  



  

   

Sch-II-2

 



    



  

"Madhouse Adjusted EBITDA" means Madhouse's earnings (calculated in
accordance with U.S. GAAP) for calendar years 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022, as
applicable,  _plus_ (a) each of the following, but only to the extent
deducted in determining such amount in such period and without
duplication: (i) interest or finance expense of Madhouse, (ii) income Taxes
for the period in question, surcharge Taxes and corporation Taxes of
Madhouse, (iii) depreciation and amortization of Madhouse (including the
depreciation or amortization of amounts incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement), (iv) non-operating expenses
(including any extraordinary expenses and extraordinary losses), and (v) any
expenses directly attributable to the transactions contemplated by the
Agreement (including (x) Reorganization related expenses, (y) for avoidance
of doubt, expenses or Taxes resulting from the assignment or payment
to Madhouse management or employees of a portion of the Earnout Payment
otherwise paid or payable to the Seller (whether pursuant to a long-term
incentive plan established for such purpose or otherwise) and (z) cash amounts
otherwise paid to acquire the 18.09% Madhouse Minority Interest not owned by
the Seller as of the Agreement Date); _minus_ (b) each of the following, but
only to the extent such items increase Madhouse's earnings for such period
and without duplication: (i) interest income and (ii) non-operating income
(including any extraordinary gains and any extraordinary income) and _minus_
(c) the Designated Working Capital Increase Related Interest Cost (if any)
for such period (beginning with calendar year 2020).

  



  

"Madhouse EBITDA Average Annual Growth Rate" is defined in, and determined in
accordance with the provisions of, Section 3 below.

  



  

"Madhouse Increased Working Capital Deduction" means the excess, if any, of
(i) the aggregate month-end Designated Working Capital balances for each
calendar month during the 2020-2022 performance period _divided by_ 36 over
(ii) $46,000,000.

  



  

Section 3. Madhouse EBITDA Growth Rates.

  



  

The Madhouse EBITDA Annual Average Growth Rate in respect of the three-year
measurement period from 2020-2022 and Madhouse EBITDA Annual Growth Rate with
respect to each calendar year in such period shall be calculated as set forth
in this Section 3.

  



  

Except as provided below, the "Madhouse EBITDA Annual Growth Rate" for
calendar years 2020, 2021 and 2022, as applicable, equals (x) the excess
(expressed as a percentage rounded to the nearest 1/100th of 1%) of (i)
Madhouse's Adjusted EBITDA for the year in question  _divided by_ (ii)
Madhouse's Adjusted EBITDA for the immediately prior year _minus_ (y) 100%.
For example, the calculation for calendar year 2020 is: 2020 Adjusted EBITDA/
2019 Adjusted EBITDA _minus_ 100%.

  



  

However, if the EBITDA Annual Growth Rate is negative in any of the three
years in the measurement period, the denominator in the subsequent year's
EBITDA Annual Growth Rate calculation will be the greater dollar value of
Madhouse Adjusted EBITDA for the two most recent prior years.

  



  

The "Madhouse EBITDA Annual Average Growth Rate" for the measurement period
(expressed as a percentage rounded to the nearest 1/100th of 1%) equals the
quotient of (i) the sum of the Madhouse EBITDA Annual Growth Rates for
calendar years 2020, 2021 and 2022 _divided by_  (ii) 3.

  



  

   

Sch-II-3

 



    



  

The following examples assume, among other things, 2019 Madhouse Adjusted
EBITDA of $29 million and are provided for illustrative purposes only.

Section 4. 2019 Madhouse Adjusted EBITDA; Earnout Statement.

  



  

(a) As soon as practicable (but in any event within forty-five (45) days)
after the completion of the relevant audited consolidated
financial statements for calendar year 2019, Purchaser's CFO or Seller (if
the Closing has not occurred prior to such date) will prepare and deliver to
the other party a statement (constituting the "2019 Earnout Statement")
setting forth the calculation in reasonable detail of 2019 Madhouse Adjusted
EBITDA.

  



  

(b) Subject to the timing requirements of Section 3.2 of the Agreement,
following the completion of Purchaser's audited financial statements for
calendar year 2020, 2021 and 2022, the Purchaser's CFO will prepare and
deliver to the Seller a statement (constituting the "2020 Earnout Statement",
"2021 Earnout Statement" and "2022 Earnout Statement", respectively) setting
forth in reasonable detail:

  



  

(i) for the 2020 and 2021 Earnout Statement, Purchaser CFO's determination of
the relevant components and calculations proposed to be used in the
determination of the Earnout Payment (as contemplated below) in conjunction
with the delivery of the 2022 Earnout Statement; and

  



  



  



  



  

   | 1| Due to the negative EBITDA Annual Growth Rate in 2020
under Scenario B, the Madhouse EBITDA Annual Growth Rate for 2021 (expressed
as a percentage) is calculated as: (i) 2021 Adjusted EBITDA divided by 2019
Adjusted EBITDA ($37.0/$29.0 million (or 127.59%)) minus (ii) 100% (or
27.59%).  
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

Sch-II-4

 



    



  

(ii) for the 2022 Earnout Statement,

  



  

(x) the Purchaser CFO's determination of:

  



  

(1) the Earnout Payment (including the relevant components and calculations
thereof);

  



  

(2) the offset, if any, with respect to any Madhouse Increased Working
Capital Deduction; and

  



  

(3) any previously unpaid indemnifiable Losses that may be potentially offset
against the Earnout Payment in accordance with the provisions of Article VIII
of the Agreement; and

  



  

(y) subject to the provisions of Section 5 below, the proposed form of the
Earnout Payment.

  



  

(c) The calculations and relevant amounts prepared or determined in
accordance paragraph (a) and (b) above shall be based on, as
applicable, Madhouse's standalone balance sheet and income statement for the
relevant period or date for 2019 and the 2020-2022 performance period as
derived from the Purchaser's audited financial statements (or, if applicable
in respect of 2019, as derived Seller's audited financial statements). The
2020 and 2021 Earnout Statements shall be for information purposes only. The
2019 Earnout Statement as delivered pursuant to paragraph (a) shall be
binding on Purchaser and Seller except either party may dispute the
calculation of and elect to resolve any related dispute with respect to 2019
Adjusted EBITDA by electing to follow the dispute procedures of Section 3.2
and 3.3 of the Agreement (applied as appropriate and including for avoidance
of doubt the obligation to seek to first resolve the dispute between the
parties through negotiation).

  



  

(d) Sections 3.2 and 3.3 of the Agreement contain, among others, provisions
with respect to (i) the establishment of the Independent Director Committee,
which shall be responsible for all determinations to be made by the Purchaser
in connection with the Earnout Payment; (ii) the review by the Seller of the
Earnout Statement; (iii) settlement on behalf of Purchaser of any disputes
with Seller in respect to the Earnout Statement and (iv) the retention of and
necessary access to work papers, information and personnel.

  



  

Section 5. Composition of Earnout Payment; Obligation to Obtain Cash Funding.

  



  

(a) If the VWAP for the Purchaser Common Shares for the ninety (90) trading
days preceding and including December 31, 2022 (the "90-day VWAP") is greater
than or equal to $10.00 per share (adjusted for stock splits, combinations or
the like after the Agreement Date), the Purchaser will have the option to
make the Earnout Payment in Purchaser Common Shares (using the 90-day VWAP in
calculating the number of shares to be delivered), in cash or in a
combination thereof.

  



  

(b) If the 90-day VWAP is less than $10.00 per share (adjusted for stock
splits, combinations or the like after the date of the Agreement), the
Purchaser shall, to the extent it has available cash or the ability within 90
business days to obtain such cash, make the Earnout Payment in cash with any
unpaid balance paid to the Seller in the form a subordinated note (subject
to the provisions of this Section 5).

  



  

   

Sch-II-5

 



    



  

(c) If any portion of the Earnout Payment payable to the Seller is proposed
to be paid other than in the form of Purchaser Common Shares, the Earnout
Statement shall be accompanied by (i) the related funding plan with respect to
the cash portion and (ii) if applicable, the terms of any Purchaser
subordinated note.

  



  

(d) The Purchaser shall take such actions as may be reasonably required or
requested by the Seller to promptly pay the Earnout Payment to the Seller in
the Purchaser's proposed or required form and to resolve any disputed
indemnity claim (as provided in Article VIII of the Agreement). If there is
any dispute with respect to any indemnifiable Losses proposed to offset the
Earnout Payment in accordance with the provisions of Article VIII of the
Agreement, the Purchaser will pay the undisputed amount of the
Earnout Payment. Following resolution of any disputed Losses, any additional
payment with respect to the Earnout Payment shall be made (i) if the 90-day
VWAP was greater than or equal to $10.00 per share (adjusted for stock splits,
combinations or the like after the Agreement Date), in the same proportion of
cash and Purchaser Common Shares as the initial payment of a portion of
Earnout Payment or (ii) if otherwise, first in cash and then in subordinated
notes.

  



  

(e) To the extent the Purchaser elects to, or is required to, pay the Earnout
Payment in cash, the Purchaser shall incur Borrowed Indebtedness on
commercially reasonable terms sufficient to pay the proposed or required cash
component; _provided that_ the Purchaser shall not be so obligated to incur
Borrowed Indebtedness if such borrowings would cause the Purchaser's Leverage
Ratio to exceed 4.0x Pro Forma Borrowed Indebtedness. If the Earnout Payment
would cause the Purchaser's Leverage Ratio to exceed 4.0x Pro Forma Borrowed
Indebtedness, any excess amount due pursuant to the Earnout Payment shall be
payable in (x) Purchaser Common Shares if Section 5(a) (VWAP greater than or
equal to $10.00 per share) is applicable or (y) otherwise a subordinated
promissory note provided it does not violate the terms, conditions or
covenants of any existing debt facilities or other obligations or
agreements that the Purchaser may have outstanding at the time. Any such
subordinated promissory note will (i) have a term of no longer than four (4)
years with at least 5% of the initial principal amount amortized annually over
the life of the term, (ii) be priced based on an opinion (of a financial
advisor to be reasonably acceptable to the Seller) of current market terms for
comparable credits rated BBB- by SandP or Fitch, or rated Baa3 Moodys, (iii)
have other mutually agreed terms consistent with a subordinated debt offering
and (iv) be prepayable by the Purchaser at any time prior to the initial
maturity without penalty.

  



  

"Leverage Ratio" means the ratio of (i) Pro Forma Borrowed Indebtedness to
(ii) 2022 Adjusted EBITDA.

  



  

"Pro Forma Borrowed Indebtedness" means the Purchaser's consolidated Borrowed
Indebtedness as reflected on its December 31, 2022 audited balance sheet
_plus_ , without duplication, the aggregate amount of any (i) cash purchase
price, expenses and contingent liabilities related to
contemplated acquisitions or investments, (ii) contemplated capital
expenditures, (iii) cash bonuses or (iv) any other existing or
contemplated corporate obligations or contingent obligations in cash
(including the Earnout Payment hereunder) actually incurred or expected to be
incurred within six (6) months from the date of determination.

  



  

"VWAP" means the volume weighted average trading price of Purchaser Common
Shares on the New York Stock Exchange (or such other national securities
exchange that is the principal U.S. trading market for Purchaser Common
Shares).

Section 6. Assignment by Seller of a Specified Portion of the Earnout
Payment.

  



  

Seller has partially and irrevocably assigned a portion of the Earnout
Payment to fund a long-term incentive plan to be established for the benefit
of designated individuals employed by or associated with the Group Company
Business. The assigned portion of any Earnout Payment (the "Assigned Earnout
Payment") is determined based on the amount of the Earnout Payment (without
regard to any deductions contemplated by Section 1) as provided below:

  



    

_Madhouse  Earnout Payment_

  | _Assigned  Earnout Payment_ 
---|--- 
   < or equal to $30,000,000  | Zero 
   > than $30,000,000 but less than or equal to $60,000,000  | the product
of (x) $12,000,000 _times_ (y) the quotient of (i) the Earnout Payment _minus_
$30,000,000 _divided by_ (ii) $30,000,000 
   $60,000,000  | 20% of the Earnout Payment (or $12,000,000) 
   > than $60,000,000 but less than or equal to $100,000,000   |
$12,000,000 _plus_ the product of (x) $18,000,000 _times_ (y) the quotient of
(i) the Earnout Payment _minus_ $60,000,000 _divided_ by (ii) $40,000,000 
   $100,000,000  | 30% of the Earnout Payment (or $30,000,000)) 
    

> than $100,000,000 but less than or equal to $150,000,000

 



  | $30,000,000 _plus_ the product of (x) $30,000,000 _times_ (y) the
quotient of (i) the Earnout Payment _minus_ $100,000,000 _divided by_ (ii)
$50,000,000 
   $150,000,000  | 40% of the Earnout Payment (or $60,000,000) 
    

> than $150,000,000 but less than or equal to $222,000,000

 



  | $60,000,000 _plus_ the product of (x) $51,000,000 _times_ (y) the
quotient of (i) the Earnout Payment _minus_ $150,000,000 divided _by_ (ii)
$72,000,000 
   $222,000,000  | 50% of the Earnout Payment (or $111,000,000) 
  



  

By way of example (rounding to two decimal places for illustrative purposes):

  



  

(1) if the Earnout Payment (before any deductions contemplated by Section 1)
is $55,000,000, the Assigned Earnout Payment would be $10,000,000 being the
product of (x) $12,000,000 (i.e., the Assigned Earnout Payment if the Earnout
Payment were $60,000,000) times (y) 83.33% (i.e., the quotient of (i)
$25,000,000 (i.e., the $55,000,000 Earnout Payment _minus_ $30,000,000)
_divided by_ (ii) $30,000,000) and;

  



  

(2) if the Earnout Payment (before any deductions contemplated by Section 1)
is $175,000,000, the Assigned Earnout Payment would be $77,708,300 (being
$60,000,000 (i.e., the Assigned Earnout Payment if the Earnout Payment were
$150,000,000) _plus_ $17,708,300 (being the product of (x) $51,000,000 (i.e.,
the potential additional assigned amount if the Earnout Payment were
$222,000,000) and (y) 34.72% (i.e., the quotient of $25,000,000 (being
the $175,000,000 Earnout Payment _minus_ $150,000,000) _divided by_
$72,000,000).

  



  

The assigned portion of the Earnout Payment expressed in nominal dollars
(based on the Assigned Earnout Payment Percentage) will be subject to
reduction based on the deductions contemplated by Section 1 (as specified in
the long-term incentive plan). The allocation of such assigned portion, as so
reduced, to the designated individuals shall be determined at Seller's
discretion provided that Seller shall not receive any portion of such amounts.
