by the Seller and the Purchaser (the &ldquo;<U>Accounting Referee</U>&rdquo;)). The Accounting Referee will, acting as experts
in accounting and not as arbitrators, determine on a basis consistent with the requirements of this Agreement, and only with respect
to the Unresolved Matters so submitted, whether and to what extent the Purchaser Closing Statement requires adjustment. The Seller
and the Purchaser will instruct the Accounting Referee to (i) use its reasonable best efforts to render its final written determination
within 30 days after such firm&rsquo;s engagement, (ii) prepare the Final Closing Statement (which will be consistent with the
Resolved Matters and the final determination of the Accounting Referee of the Unresolved Matters), and (iii) calculate the Closing
Date Adjustment, if any, based on such Final Closing Statement. With respect to each Unresolved Matter, the Accounting Referee&rsquo;s
determination, if not in accordance with the position of either the Seller or Purchaser, will not be in excess of the higher, nor
less than the lower, of the amounts advocated by the Seller or the Purchaser with respect thereto. The Accounting Referee&rsquo;s
final written determination will be conclusive and binding upon the parties to this Agreement. The &ldquo;<U>Final Closing Statement</U>&rdquo;

it has no such disputes or objections to the Purchaser Closing Statement, in each case prior to the expiration of the Review Period,

Objection is delivered by the Seller to the Purchaser prior to the expiration of the Review Period, the Purchaser Closing Statement
delivered by the Purchaser to the Seller pursuant to Section 2.8(a), as adjusted pursuant to the agreement of the Seller and the
Purchaser in writing; or (iii) in the event that an Objection is delivered by the Seller to the Purchaser prior to the expiration
of the Review Period and the Seller and the Purchaser are unable to agree on all matters set forth in such Objection, the Purchaser
Closing Statement delivered by the Purchaser to the Seller pursuant to Section 2.8(a), as adjusted by the Accounting Referee to
be consistent with the Resolved Matters and the final determination of the Accounting Referee of the Unresolved Matters in accordance
with this Section 2.8(c). In the event the Final Closing Statement is determined (x) pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii) of the immediately
preceding sentence, the Purchaser will prepare the Final Closing Statement and calculate the adjustment amounts, if any, in each
case in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and deliver such items to the Seller within three Business Days following
the determination thereof or (y) pursuant to clause (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Accounting Referee will prepare

Resolution Procedure</U>. Matters disputed pursuant to Section 3.2 may be referred by either the Purchaser or the Seller exclusively
to the Independent Expert for determination in accordance with this Section 3.3. Each of the Seller and the Purchaser agrees to
execute, if requested by the Independent Expert, a reasonable engagement letter with respect to the determination to be made by
the Independent Expert. All fees and expenses of the Independent Expert will be borne by the Purchaser. The Independent Expert
will determine only those issues still in dispute as of the date that the dispute is referred to the Independent Expert, and the
Independent Expert&rsquo;s determination will be based solely upon and consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
The determination by the Independent Expert will be based solely on presentations with respect to such disputed items by the Purchaser
and the Seller to the Independent Expert and not on the Independent Expert&rsquo;s independent review; provided, that such presentations
will be deemed to include any work papers, records, accounts or similar materials delivered to the Independent Expert by the Purchaser
or the Seller in connection with such presentations and any materials delivered to the Independent Expert in response to requests
by the Independent Expert. Each of the Seller and the Purchaser will use their reasonable efforts to make their respective presentations
as promptly as practicable following submission to the Independent Expert of the disputed items, and each such party will be entitled,
as part of its presentation, to respond to the presentation of the other party and any questions and requests of the Independent
Expert. In deciding any matter, the Independent Expert will be bound by the provisions of this Agreement, including this Section
3.3. It is the intent of the parties hereto that the procedures set forth in this Section 3.3 and the activities of the Independent
Expert in connection herewith are not (and should not be considered to be or treated as) an arbitration proceeding or similar arbitral
process and that no formal arbitration rules should be followed (including rules with respect to procedures and discovery). The
Seller and the Purchaser will request that the Independent Expert&rsquo;s determination be made within forty-five (45) days after
its engagement, or as soon thereafter as possible and be set forth in a written statement delivered to the Purchaser and the Seller.
The Purchaser and the Seller hereby agree that the Independent Expert&rsquo;s determination will be final, conclusive, non-appealable
and binding for all purposes hereunder (other than for fraud or manifest error), and that following such determination, the Purchaser
shall pay or issue, as applicable, any applicable Earnout Payment in the determined form in accordance with Section 3.1.</P>

Purchaser established a trust account containing the proceeds of the IPO and from certain private placements occurring simultaneously
with the IPO (collectively, with interest accrued from time to time thereon, the &ldquo;<U>Trust Fund</U>&rdquo;) initially in
an amount of $300,000,000 for the benefit of the Purchaser&rsquo;s public stockholders (the &ldquo;<U>Public Stockholders</U>&rdquo;)
and certain parties (including the underwriters of the IPO) and that, except for a portion of the interest earned on the amounts
held in the Trust Fund and not previously released to the Purchaser to pay franchise and income taxes and up to $750,000 annually
for working capital purposes, that the Purchaser may disburse monies from the Trust Fund only: (i) to the Public Stockholders in
the event they elect to redeem the shares of Purchaser Class A Common Shares in connection with the consummation of the Purchaser&rsquo;s
initial business combination (as such term is used in the Prospectus) (the &ldquo;<U>Business Combination</U>&rdquo;), (ii) to
the Public Stockholders if the Purchaser fails to consummate a Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO,
or (iii) to the Purchaser after or concurrently with the consummation of a Business Combination. For and in consideration of the
Purchaser entering into this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is
hereby acknowledged, the Seller hereby agrees that it does not now and shall not at any time hereafter have any right, title, interest
or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Trust Fund or distributions therefrom, or make any claim against, the Trust Fund,
regardless of whether such claim arises as a result of, in connection with or relating in any way to, any proposed or actual business
relationship between the Seller and the Purchaser, this Agreement or any other matter, and regardless of whether such claim arises
based on contract, tort, equity or any other theory of legal liability (any and all such claims are collectively referred to hereafter
as the &ldquo;<U>Claims</U>&rdquo;). The Seller hereby irrevocably waives any Claims it may have against the Trust Fund (including
any distributions therefrom) now or in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements
with the Purchaser and will not seek recourse against the Trust Fund (including any distributions therefrom) for any reason whatsoever
(including, without limitation, for an alleged breach of this Agreement; provided, however, that this <U>Section 6.7</U> shall
not affect any other rights or remedies of the Seller pursuant to this Agreement or any other agreement entered into in connection
herewith or in furtherance of the transactions contemplated hereby, including but not limited to a breach of this Agreement). The
Seller agrees and acknowledges that such irrevocable waiver is material to this Agreement and specifically relied upon by the Purchaser
to induce it to enter in this Agreement, and the Seller further intends and understands such waiver to be valid, binding and enforceable
under applicable law. To the extent the Seller commences any action or proceeding based upon, in connection with, relating to or
arising out of any matter relating to the Purchaser, which proceeding seeks, in whole or in part, monetary relief against the Purchaser,
the Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees its sole remedy shall be against funds held outside of the Trust Fund and that such claim
shall not permit the Seller (or any party claiming on the Seller&rsquo;s behalf or in lieu of the Seller) to have any claim against
the Trust Fund (including any distributions therefrom) or any amounts contained therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller
shall be entitled to seek any and all remedies available at law or in equity with respect to any funds from the Trust Fund that
are not subject to the limitations provided in this <U>Section 6.7(b)</U> including, without limitation, pursuant to <U>Section

any interest received thereon) received or realized with respect to Taxes imposed on or with respect to any Group Company for a

other party shall promptly repay the amount of such Tax refund or credit received, to the extent disallowed or reduced, to the
party that made such payment, together with any interest, penalties or other charges imposed thereon by the applicable Taxing Authority.
After the Closing, the Purchaser shall cause the Group Companies to continue to work in good faith and use commercially reasonable
efforts to diligently prosecute any Tax refund claims in order to maximize and obtain any such Tax refunds or credits, provided
that Purchaser shall not be required to prosecute any claims related to Tax refunds or credits if Purchaser reasonably determines
it would increase the Tax Liabilities of a Group Company in a Post-Closing Tax Period or otherwise result in any other material
adverse Tax consequences to Purchaser, any Group Company, or any of their Affiliates.</P>

the aggregate amount of Losses for which indemnification is being sought that have been incurred, or to the extent not yet incurred,
a good faith estimate of the amount of such Losses reasonably expected to be incurred (the &ldquo;<U>Claim Amount</U>&rdquo;).
Any Claim Amount or any other matter set forth in a Claim Notice will be deemed to be finally resolved for purposes of this Article

Reference is made to the final IPO prospectus of the Purchaser, dated November 17, 2017 (the &ldquo;<U>Prospectus</U>&rdquo;).
The Seller has read the Prospectus and understands that the Purchaser has established the Trust Account for the benefit of the
public stockholders of the Purchaser and the underwriters of the IPO pursuant to the Trust Agreement and that, except for a portion
of the interest earned on the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Purchaser may disburse monies from the Trust Account only
for the purposes set forth in the Trust Agreement. For and in consideration of the Purchaser agreeing to enter into this Agreement,
the Seller hereby agrees that it does not have any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Trust
Account and hereby agrees that it will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any claim it may have in the future as a
result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with the Purchaser; <U>provided</U> that (x) nothing herein
shall serve to limit or prohibit the Seller&rsquo;s right to pursue a claim against the Purchaser for legal relief against monies
or other assets held outside the Trust Account, for specific performance or other equitable relief in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby (including a claim for the Purchaser to specifically perform its obligations under this
Agreement) so long as such claim would not affect the Purchaser&rsquo;s ability to fulfill its obligation to effectuate the Purchaser
Stockholder Redemption, and (y) nothing herein shall serve to limit or prohibit any claims that the Seller may have in the future
against the Purchaser&rsquo;s assets or funds that are not held in the Trust Account (including any funds that have been released
from the Trust Account upon completion of a &ldquo;Business Combination&rdquo; as such term is defined in the Existing Charter
(except such amounts that are paid or payable to stockholders of the Purchaser holding Purchaser Common Shares sold in the IPO
who shall have elected to redeem their Purchaser Common Shares pursuant to the Existing Charter and any assets that have been purchased
