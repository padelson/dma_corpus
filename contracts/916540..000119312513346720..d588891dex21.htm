kind or nature other than Permitted Liens.

Purchased Assets shall be an amount equal to: 



     | (a) | CAD $645 million in cash; 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | increased or reduced, as the case may be, by the amount by

---|---|--- 



     | (c) | increased or reduced, as the case may be, by the amount by
which the Market Value of Finished Goods is greater than or less than the
value of such goods as reflected on the balance sheet of the Business as of
the Closing Date; provided, however, that any such increase or reduction shall
be without duplication of the same amounts calculated and taken into account
in accordance with paragraph 2.2(b) above; and  
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | increased by the amount of any capital expenditures incurred
by MFI after the date that is sixty (60) days from the date of this Agreement
up to the Closing Date, if the Closing Date occurs more than sixty (60) days
after the date hereof, in respect of a Major Project, which amount shall not
in any event exceed the maximum amount disclosed in _Section 1.1(b) of MFIs
Disclosure Letter_ without the express prior written consent of the Purchaser
(collectively with the amounts in (b) and (c) above, the "Adjustment Amount");
plus 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (e) | an amount equal to the value of the Assumed Liabilities. 
---|---|--- 

2.3 Estimated Purchase Price. Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, MFI shall deliver to the Purchaser a written statement (the
"Estimated Purchase Price Statement") setting forth MFIs estimate, as of the
Closing Date, of the Purchase Price (calculated using the same principles set
out in Section 2.6(a)), for the purpose of determining the Estimated Purchase
Price and the Estimated Cash Purchase Price. The Estimated Purchase Price
shall be the sum of clauses (a) through (e) in Section 2.2 above. The
Estimated Cash Purchase Price shall be the sum of clauses (a) through (d) in
Section 2.2 above. The Estimated Purchase Price and the Estimated Cash
Purchase Price shall be calculated in the manner set forth in Section 2.2
using an estimate of the Adjustment Amount as of the Closing Date that is set
out in the Estimated Purchase Price Statement. The Estimated Purchase Price
Statement shall set out each separate element of the estimated Adjustment
Amount. MFI shall provide the Purchaser with copies of or reasonable access to
such Books and Records and reasonable access to senior personnel within MFI
with knowledge of the matters recorded as are reasonably necessary for
purposes of confirming the amounts set forth in the Estimated Purchase Price
Statement.

 

2.4 Payment of the Purchase Price. At the Closing, the Purchaser shall pay an
amount (the "Closing Payment Amount") equal to the Estimated Purchase Price.
The Closing Payment Amount shall be paid and satisfied in full by: (i) the

Price to MFI; and (ii) the assumption by the Purchaser of the Assumed
Liabilities by delivery at the Closing of the agreement contemplated by
Sections 3.2(b) and 3.3(c).

 



\- 17 -  2.5 Allocation. The consideration payable for the Purchased Assets shall be an
amount equal to the aggregate of the Cash Purchase Price and the value of the

Exhibit shall be mutually agreed to by the Purchaser and MFI during the
Interim Period). The Purchaser and MFI shall report an allocation of the
Purchase Price among the Purchased Assets in a manner entirely consistent with
_Exhibit B_ and shall not take any position inconsistent therewith in the
preparation of financial statements for Tax purposes, the filing of any Tax
Returns or in the course of any audit by any Governmental Entity, Tax review
or Tax proceeding relating to any Tax Returns. In connection with any Transfer
Taxes payable in respect of the Purchased Assets under Section 12.15, MFI and
the Purchaser shall, no later than seven (7) days prior to the Closing Date,
mutually agree on an allocation of the Estimated Purchase Price in respect of
the Purchased Assets, including an allocation of such amounts to the
Purchased Assets located in each province, to be used for calculating the
amount(s) of Transfer Taxes to be remitted or self-assessed to the relevant
Governmental Entities.

2.6 Post-Closing Adjustment of Estimated Purchase Price. The Estimated
Purchase Price shall be adjusted following the Closing as provided in this
Section:

 



     | (a) | Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser
shall prepare, in accordance with GAAP and applying the same accounting
principles, policies and practices that were used by MFI in preparing the
Financial Statements, and deliver to MFI, a written determination of the
Adjustment Amount as of the Closing Date (the "Initial Determination"),
including the basis for such Initial Determination, which shall be set forth
in reasonable detail with all supporting calculations. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

Upon receipt of the Initial Determination, MFI shall have thirty (30) days
(the "Review Period") to review such Initial Determination and the related
calculations, provided however that MFI may object to the Initial
Determination only on the basis that (i) in the case of the Net Working
Capital Related to the Business, the amounts were not calculated by
applying the same accounting principles, policies and practices that were
used in preparing the Financial Statements, (ii) mathematical error, or (iii)
that a particular item was or was not required by this Agreement to be
included in the calculation of the Adjustment Amount. For such purpose, the
Purchaser shall give MFI and its representatives full access to the books,
records and other materials of the Purchaser and the personnel of, and work
papers prepared by or for, the Purchaser or its accountants and
representatives, including, without limitation, to such historical financial
information relating to the Business as MFI or its representatives may
request, acting reasonably. If MFI accepts such Initial Determination in
writing or does not provide written notice to the Purchaser setting forth any
objection in accordance with subsections (i), (ii) and (iii) above (the "MFI
Determination") to such Initial Determination, including each proposed change
to any component of the Initial Determination and the basis therefor prior to
the expiration of the Review Period, then the Adjustment Amount as of the
Closing Date, as set forth in such Initial Determination shall be final and
binding upon the Parties. If MFI delivers the MFI Determination prior to the
expiration of the Review Period, MFI and the Purchaser shall use their
reasonable efforts to resolve the differences between the MFI Determination
and the Purchaser Determination within fifteen (15) days following the receipt
by the Purchaser of the MFI Determination. If the Parties are unable to
resolve such differences within such fifteen (15) day period, then the matter
shall be submitted as promptly as practicable to Deloitte, or if Deloitte is
unwilling or unable to serve in such capacity, to such other accounting firm
agreed to 

---|---|--- 
 



\- 18 -  Settlement Accountant shall reach its own independent determination with
respect to the items referred to in subsections (i), (ii) and (iii) above
(the "Settlement Accountant Determination"), based on its review of each
component of the MFI Determination and of the Purchaser Determination and such
other information as the Settlement Accountant shall reasonably request and
obtain from the Parties. The Settlement Accountant Determination shall reflect
the net adjustment to the Estimated Purchase Price based on the Settlement
Accountants independent review; for greater clarity, the Settlement
Accountant Determination with respect to the Net Working Capital Related to
the Business shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP applying the same
accounting principles, policies and practices that were used in preparing the
Financial Statements. Following the preparation of the Settlement Accountant
Determination, the Settlement Accountant shall select either the Initial
Determination or the Purchaser Determination, whichever is quantitatively
closer to the Settlement Accountant Determination or, if the Settlement
Accountant Determination represents the precise average of the Initial
Determination and the Purchaser Determination, the Settlement Accountant shall
select the Settlement Accountant Determination. The Settlement Accountant
shall make such selection within fifteen (15) days following the submission of
the matter to it, and such selection shall be final and binding upon MFI and
the Purchaser and may be entered and enforced in any court having
jurisdiction. Each of MFI and the Purchaser agrees that it will not have any
right to, and will not, institute any proceeding of any kind challenging such
determination or with respect to the matters that are the subject of
this Section 2.6, except that the foregoing shall not preclude a proceeding
to enforce such determination. 
---|--- 



     | (c) | If any dispute is submitted to the Settlement Accountant
pursuant to this Section 2.6, the fees, charges and expenses of the Settlement
Accountant shall be paid one-half by MFI and one-half by the Purchaser. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | "Final Adjustment Amount" means the amount of the Adjustment
Amount as of the Closing Date and as agreed by MFI and the Purchaser or as
determined by the Settlement Accountant in accordance with Section 2.6(b). 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | If the Final Adjustment Amount is greater than the
Adjustment Amount set forth in the Estimated Purchase Price Statement (the
"Excess Adjustment Amount"), the Purchaser shall pay to MFI an amount equal
to the Excess Adjustment Amount, which amount shall be received by MFI in
accordance with the allocation set forth in _Exhibit B_. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (f) | If the Final Adjustment Amount is less than the Adjustment
Amount set forth in the Estimated Purchase Price Statement (the "Adjustment
Amount Deficiency"), MFI shall pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to the
Adjustment Amount Deficiency, which amount shall be paid by MFI in accordance
with the allocation set forth in _Exhibit B_. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (g) | Any payment due under this Section 2.6 shall (A) be payable
within five (5) Business Days after the determination of the Final Adjustment
Amount (the "Adjustment Payment Date"), and (B) be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds.

before expiration of such period; provided, that the limitations on MFIs
indemnification obligations and Purchasers ability to recover from MFI for
Damages contained in Section 9.4(a) and Section 9.4(b) shall not apply to
claims for General Excluded Liabilities (other than Taxes); and 
---|---|--- 



     | (j) | for the purpose of calculating the amount of any Damages
under Section 9.1(a) after a breach has occurred (and, for the sake of
clarity, not for the purpose of determining whether a breach has occurred),
any and all materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifications in Article 4
shall be disregarded. 
---|---|--- 

9.5 Limitations on Amount of Indemnification by the Purchaser. Notwithstanding
anything provided for in this Agreement to the contrary:

 



     | (a) | no Damages may be recovered from the Purchaser pursuant to
Section 9.2(a), unless and until the accumulated aggregate amount of Damages
of MFIs Indemnified Parties arising pursuant thereto exceeds an amount equal
to $6,450,000, in which event the Purchaser will be liable for all such
Damages in excess of $1,000,000; 
---|---|--- 
 



\- 43 -  to Section 9.2(a) for any individual item, group or series of related items or
items arising out of reasonably related facts or circumstances where the
Damages relating thereto is less than $25,000, and such items shall not be
aggregated for the purposes of clause (a) of this Section 9.5; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | the Purchasers total liability pursuant to Section 9.2(a)
shall not exceed an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price,
except in the event of actual fraud or intentional misrepresentation by the
Purchaser, it being acknowledged that liability for any Damages arising from
such fraud or intentional misrepresentation shall not exceed an amount equal
to the Purchase Price;  
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | without limiting the provisions of Section 9.5(c) above, the
Purchasers total liability pursuant to Section 9.2 shall not exceed an amount
equal to the Purchase Price; 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | no Damages may be recovered with respect to any claim for
breach of any representation or warranty after the expiration of the survival
period for such representation or warranty in Article 8, except with respect
to a claim for which MFI gives notice in accordance with Section 9.9 before
expiration of such period; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (f) | for the purpose of calculating the amount of any Damages
under Section 9.2(a) after a breach has occurred (and, for the sake of
clarity, not for the purpose of determining whether a breach has occurred),
any and all materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifications in Article 5
shall be disregarded. 
---|---|--- 

9.6 Other Limitations on Indemnification.



     | (a) | Except with respect to Damages claimed by the Purchaser
under Section 12.16 (Risk of Damage): (i) the Parties shall have no right to
indemnification with respect to any loss of profits or any consequential,
indirect, special or punitive damages (provided, however, and for greater
certainty, that such limitation does not apply to an award to a third party
based on a Third Party Claim or in the event of actual fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful breach by either Party); (ii) the Parties shall
have no right to indemnification with respect to any losses to the extent that
they are included in the calculation of any adjustment to the Purchase Price
pursuant to Section 2.6 and (iii) MFI shall have no liability under this
Agreement with respect to any matter to the extent that the expense, loss or
liability comprising the Damages arising from such matter has been provided
for in the Financial Statements or taken into account in calculating the
Adjustment Amount. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | The amount which the Indemnifying Party is required to pay
to, for, or on behalf of the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article 9
shall be reduced by any Tax benefit applicable thereto actually recognized by
the Indemnified Party. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

The Indemnified Party shall have an obligation to promptly seek to recover or
make a claim for insurance proceeds or other similar amounts as a result of
any matter giving rise to an indemnification claim of the Indemnified Party
against the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnified Party receives any
insurance proceeds or other similar amounts as a result of the matter giving
rise to any indemnification claim of the Indemnified Party prior to the date
upon which the Indemnifying Party is given Notice 

---|---|--- 
 



\- 44 -  obligation with respect to such claim shall be net of the amount of any such
insurance proceeds or other similar amounts actually received by the
Indemnified Party (minus the amount of any retroactive increases in premiums
with respect to such insurance resulting from such claim). If the Indemnified
Party receives any insurance proceeds or other similar amounts as a result
of the matter giving rise to any indemnification claim of the Indemnified
Party against the Indemnifying Party after the Indemnifying Party has paid
such indemnification claim to the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnified
Party shall promptly turn over any such insurance proceeds or other similar
amounts received to the Indemnifying Party to the extent of the payments made
by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party with respect to the claim
(minus the amount of any retroactive increases in premiums with respect to
such insurance resulting from such claim). 
---|--- 



     | (d) | Except in the event of actual fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful breach by MFI and except pursuant to the other
agreements attached as exhibits hereto, the sole recourse and exclusive
remedy of the Parties and their respective Indemnified Parties from and after
the Closing arising out of this Agreement or otherwise arising out of the
Purchasers acquisition of the Business, whether based on tort, contract,
statutory or common law remedy or equitable remedy or otherwise, including but
not limited to, any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or otherwise, shall
be to assert a claim for indemnification under the indemnification provisions
of this Article 9, and the Purchaser and MFI each covenant that it (and the
Purchasers Indemnified Parties and MFIs Indemnified Parties) will not seek
to obtain any remedy except as provided in this Article 9. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (e) | An Indemnified Party shall take commercially reasonable
steps to mitigate any Losses and shall respond to a claim or liability that
may provide a basis for indemnification in the same manner (but in any event
in a reasonable manner) it would respond in the absence of the indemnification
provided in this Agreement. In the event that the Indemnified Party fails to
make reasonable efforts to mitigate any losses, or resolve any claim or
liability, the Indemnified Party shall not be indemnified to the extent that
any Losses could reasonably be expected to have been avoided if the
Indemnified Party had made such efforts. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (f) | Each Party acknowledges and agrees that (a) prior to the
Closing, other than in the case of actual fraud, intentional misrepresentation
or willful breach by MFI, the sole and exclusive remedy of the Purchaser for
any breach of any of the representations and warranties of MFI contained in
Article 4 shall be, in the event that each of the conditions set forth in
Article 6 has not been satisfied or waived, refusal to close the purchase and
sale of the Purchased Assets hereunder; (b) following the Closing, (i) the
indemnification provisions of this Article 9 shall be the sole and exclusive
remedies of the Parties for any breach of the representations or warranties
contained in this Agreement except in the case of fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful breach and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, no breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation contained herein shall give rise to any right on the
part of either Party to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby except in the case of actual fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful breach; and (c) following the Closing, the
indemnification provisions of this Article 9 shall be the sole and exclusive
monetary remedies of the Parties for any breach or non-fulfillment of any
covenant (other than those covenants set forth under Section 13.1 and Section
13.2 for the enforcement of which a Party may also seek specific performance
or except in the case of actual fraud, intentional misrepresentation or
willful breach). 
---|---|--- 
 



\- 45 -  Section 9.1(a) for breach of any representation or warranty contained in
Section 4.11 or under Section 9.1(e) to the extent Damages arise from or
relate to any sampling and analysis by or on behalf of the Purchaser of any
environmental media subsequent to the Closing, except (i) in the event of
actual fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful breach by MFI; (ii)
where such sampling and analysis is required pursuant to Environmental Laws
and is not related to any post-Closing closure of a Facility; or (iii) where
such sampling and analysis is necessary to complete bona fide construction,
maintenance or expansion activities. 
---|---|--- 



     | (h) | In respect of any Environmental Liabilities which are the
subject of indemnification obligations under Section 9.1 which require cleanup
or remediation ("Remediation") MFI shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to conduct such Remediation. Whether MFI chooses to remediate or
indemnify, MFIs obligation shall be limited to Remediation to the least
stringent cleanup standards, including risk assessment where permitted, that
are applicable to a Real Property considering its use and use classification
as of the Closing. Any Remediation that is required to satisfy MFIs
indemnification obligations shall be performed in the most cost-effective
manner and may include the recording of deed restrictions or implementation of
institutional or engineering controls where such deed restrictions or controls
are acceptable to Governmental Authorities for the type of Hazardous
Materials that are the subject of the Remediation and to the landlord for
Leased Real Property. Where MFI chooses to remediate, MFI shall have the right
to control the Remediation in its sole discretion, acting reasonably, and MFI
and the Purchaser shall enter into an agreement addressing terms for access,
including reasonable measures to minimize disruption to Purchaser, on terms
and conditions acceptable to both, acting reasonably. 
---|---|--- 
 

9.7 GST/HST Gross-Up. If any payment made by MFI or the Purchaser pursuant to
this Article 9 or Section 10.3 is deemed by the  _Excise Tax Act_ (Canada) or
the _Act respecting the Quebec sales_ tax to include goods and services tax,
harmonized sales tax, or Quebec sales tax or is deemed by any applicable
provincial or territorial legislation to include a similar value added or
multi-staged tax, the amount of such payment shall be increased accordingly.

9.8 Indemnification Adjustment to Purchase Price. Any amounts payable by MFI
under this Article 9 shall constitute a reduction in the consideration paid or
payable to MFI in respect of the related Purchased Assets.

 

9.9 Notice of Claim. If an Indemnified Party becomes aware of any act,
omission or state of facts that may give rise to Damages in respect of which
a right of indemnification is provided for under this Article 9, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly give written notice ("Notice") thereof to the
Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall specify whether the potential Damages
arise as a result of a claim by a Person against the Indemnified Party (a
"Third Party Claim") or whether the potential Damages do not so arise (a
"Direct Claim"), and shall also specify with reasonable particularity (to the
extent that the information is available): (1) the factual basis for the
Direct Claim or Third Party Claim, as the case may be; and (2) the amount of
the potential Damages arising therefrom, if known. In addition, the
Indemnified Party shall provide to the Indemnifying Party all information and
documentation reasonably necessary to support and verify any Damages which the
Indemnified Party believes gives rise to a claim for indemnification
hereunder (including any demand letters and statements of claim) and shall
give the Indemnifying Party reasonable access to all premises, books,

 



\- 46 -   records and personnel in the possession or under the control of the
Indemnified Party which would have bearing on such claim. If the Indemnifying
Party does not receive Notice of a particular claim in time to effectively
contest the determination of any liability susceptible of being contested or
to assert a right to recover an amount under applicable insurance coverage,
then the liability of the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party shall
be reduced to the extent that Damages are incurred by the Indemnifying Party
resulting from the Indemnified Partys failure to give such notice on a timely
basis.

9.10 Direct Claims. In the case of a Direct Claim, the Indemnifying Party
shall have sixty (60) days from receipt of Notice thereof within which to make
such investigation as the Indemnifying Party considers necessary or
desirable. For the purpose of such investigation, the Indemnified Party shall
make available to the Indemnifying Party the information relied upon by the
Indemnified Party to substantiate its right to be indemnified under this
Article 9, together with all such other information as the Indemnifying Party
may reasonably request. If the Parties fail to agree at or before the
expiration of such sixty (60) day period (or any mutually agreed upon
extension thereof), the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such
remedies as may be available to it.

9.11 Third Party Claims. In the case of any Third Party Claim for which
indemnification is sought, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to: (i)
conduct and control any proceedings or negotiations; (ii) to perform and
control or direct the performance of activities required, (iii) take all
other steps to settle or defend any such claim (provided that the Indemnifying
Party shall not admit to any wrongdoing by the Indemnified Party or settle any
such claim without the consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless the settlement
includes a complete release of the Indemnified Party with respect to the
claim); and (iv) employ counsel (reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Party) to contest any such claim or liability. In the event the
Indemnifying Party elects to conduct and control any proceedings itself, the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to fully participate at its own expense
and by its own counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party in any
proceedings relating to any Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall,
within sixty (60) days after delivery of the Notice to the Indemnifying Party,
notify the Indemnified Party of its intention as to the conduct and control
of the defense of such claim. Until the Indemnified Party has received notice
of the Indemnifying Partys election whether to defend any claim, the
Indemnified Party shall take reasonable steps to defend (but may not settle)
such claim. If the Indemnifying Party shall decline to assume the defense of
any such claim, or the Indemnifying Party shall fail to notify the Indemnified
Party within sixty (60) days after delivery of the Notice of the Indemnifying
Partys election to defend such claim, the Indemnified Party shall defend
against such claim (provided that the Indemnified Party shall not settle such
claim without the consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)). Regardless of which Party
shall assume the defense of the claim, the Parties agree to cooperate fully
with one another in connection therewith and to keep each other reasonably
informed of the status of the claim and any related proceeding and shall take
no action or make any admissions or statements not required by Applicable Law
which would adversely affect the defense of any such claim.

 

ARTICLE 10

 

TERMINATION; EFFECT OF TERMINATION

10.1 Termination. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this
Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby abandoned
at any time prior to the Closing Date: 



     | (a) | by written agreement between the Purchaser and MFI; 
---|---|--- 
 



\- 47 -  contemplated hereby shall not have been consummated by the End Date, provided
that such failure is not due to the failure of the Party seeking to terminate
this Agreement to comply in all material respects with its obligations under
this Agreement; 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | by the Purchaser, if any of the conditions set forth in
Article 6 are not fulfilled by the End Date (provided that such failure is not
due to the failure of the Purchaser to comply in all material respects with
its obligations under this Agreement), and such conditions shall not have been
waived by the Purchaser; 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | by MFI, if any of the conditions set forth in Article 7 are
not fulfilled by the End Date (provided that such failure is not due to the
failure of MFI to comply in all material respects with its obligations under
this Agreement) and such conditions shall not have been waived by MFI; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | by either the Purchaser or MFI pursuant to and in accordance
with Section 12.16; or 
---|---|--- 

10.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 10.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void with no
liability or obligation on the part of any Party (or of any of its
Affiliates, directors, officers, agents, employees, advisors or
representatives), except that the obligations of Article 10 (relating to
termination); Section 12.3 (relating to public announcements); and Article
14 (relating to certain miscellaneous provisions), will survive; provided
however, that no termination shall relieve any Party of any liability
resulting from any willful or intentional breach of, or willful or intentional
failure to perform, any of such Partys representations, warranties,
covenants or other agreements set forth in this Agreement.

10.3 Reverse Termination Fee. 



     | (a) | If this Agreement is terminated by the Purchaser or MFI
pursuant to Section 10.1(b), 10.1(c) or 10.1(d) and the Purchaser has not
satisfied the Competition Act Clearance condition set out in Section 6.5
prior to the End Date, then, provided (i) such failure is not due to the
failure of MFI to comply in all material respects with its obligations under
this Agreement and (ii) the conditions in Sections 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 and 6.7
have been satisfied, the Purchaser shall pay to MFI, contemporaneously with
the termination of this Agreement, a termination fee in the amount of
$12,000,000 (the "Reverse Termination Fee"). Any Reverse Termination Fee
payable hereunder shall be paid by way of wire transfer in immediately
available funds to an account specified by MFI. MFI agrees that the payment by
the Purchaser and receipt by MFI of the Reverse Termination Fee in the manner
provided in this Section 10.3 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of MFI
with respect to this Agreement and the termination hereof, and that MFI shall
not have any further claim against the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
arising from or in connection with this Agreement or the termination hereof,
except for any breaches by the Purchaser of the covenants set forth in Section
12.12 (Confidentiality) or the Confidentiality Agreement.  
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Notwithstanding Section 10.3(a) above, provided that all of
the conditions set out in Article 6 have been satisfied or waived in
accordance with this Agreement, Section 10.3(a) shall not apply if (i) the
Purchaser has waived the Competition Act Clearance condition in Section 6.5,
and (ii) there is no Law prohibiting the completion of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.  
---|---|--- 
 



\- 48 -  10.4 End Date Extension.

 



     | (a) | In the event that, on December 31, 2013 (or such subsequent
date as the End Date may be extended to pursuant to this Section 10.4(a)),
either the Purchaser is negotiating with the Commissioner the terms of a
Consent Agreement or the Purchaser and Commissioner are in the process of
registering a Consent Agreement with the Tribunal such that there is a
reasonable likelihood that the Competition Act Clearance will be obtained,
either Party may, in such circumstance, by providing written notice to the
other Party, extend the End Date by up to ten (10) Business Days, one or more
times, provided that, in no case, shall the End Date extend under this
Section 10.4(a) beyond February 28, 2014. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

In the event that, prior to the Closing, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement become subject to Part IV of the Investment Canada Act, the "End
Date" shall mean the date that is the later of: (i) the End Date as otherwise
determined in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; or (ii) the date
that is seventy-five (75) days from when the Purchaser submits its
application for review under Part IV of the Investment Canada Act ("ICA
Application") pursuant to Section 12.8(a)(iii) of this Agreement (if the
seventy-fifth (75th) day falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the
applicable date shall be the next Business Day). Thereafter the End Date may
be extended under this Section 10.4(b) only either (i) by either Party upon
written notice to the other Party, for such period of time in which the
Minister requests an extension of the period pursuant to section 22 of
the Investment Canada Act or (ii) upon the mutual consent of both Parties.

ARTICLE 11

 

EMPLOYEES

11.1 Offers of Employment. The Purchaser shall offer employment effective as
of the Closing Date to all Employees of the Business on terms and conditions
which (a) for Employees whose employment is governed by a collective
agreement, are in accordance with that collective agreement; and (b) for
Employees whose employment is not governed by a collective agreement, are no
less favourable in the aggregate to those under which such Employees are
currently employed in terms of title, compensation, benefits, hours of work
and location, and with duties and reporting relationships that are comparable
to those enjoyed by such Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date. So
long as the Purchaser satisfies its obligations under the preceding sentence,
(i) in respect of Employees whose employment is not covered by a collective
agreement, or in respect of Employees whose employment is covered by a
collective agreement but where a defined benefit pension plan is not required
to be provided pursuant to the terms of such collective agreement or the
Purchasers obligations as successor employer of such unionized Employees, the
Purchaser shall not be required to provide or extend a defined benefit
pension plan to such Employees and (ii) in respect of Employees who
participate in MFIs long term incentive plan ("LTIP"), nothing shall obligate
the Purchaser to adopt any equity based compensation plan for the benefit of
the Transferred Employees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in respect of
Employees on an authorized leave of absence as of the Closing Date, provided
and conditional upon such Employee being cleared and fit to return to work
(including modified work with accommodation) within eighteen (18) months
after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall offer employment at such time as
the Employee is cleared and fit to return to work and the date upon which such
Employee returns to work shall be the effective date of employment with the
Purchaser. The Purchaser shall provide MFI with a copy of the form of the
offers of employment it intends to deliver to the Employees and the Purchaser
shall in good faith consider the comments of MFI on such form of offer of
employment. MFI will render commercially reasonable assistance to encourage
the Employees to accept the offers of employment. The Purchaser shall
recognize the past service of Transferred Employees with MFI for all purposes
other than for the purposes of benefit accrual under any pension or

 



\- 49 -   employee benefit plan of the Purchaser (except as may be expressly agreed to
by the Parties pursuant to an EPBA). For a period until the earlier of (a) the
expiration of the term of the applicable collective agreement and (b) 12
months following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall provide each
Transferred Employee with (i) a base salary or wage rate, and (ii) incentive
or bonus pay programs that are in the aggregate no less favourable than those
provided immediately prior to the Closing Date. No provision in this Section
11.1 shall give any Transferred Employee any right to continued employment or
impair in any way the right of the Purchaser to terminate the employment of
any Transferred Employee. From and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser
agrees to comply with all Applicable Laws with respect to the termination of
employment of any Transferred Employee.

 

11.2 Vacation and Bonuses. From and after the Closing Date, the Transferred
Employees shall be entitled to use their accrued and unused paid vacation
entitlement under the vacation policies of MFI determined as of the Closing
Date, and the Purchaser shall have all liability therefor conditional on such
accrued and unused vacation being properly accrued as a current liability for
the purposes of the Net Working Capital calculation. In addition, the
Purchaser shall be liable for all bonuses that had accrued in favour of any
Transferred Employee under the Employee Plans with respect to the period of
time prior to the Closing Date, including any discretionary bonuses that
would otherwise have been payable in favour of any Transferred Employee with
respect to the period of time prior to the Closing Date, in all cases
consistent with past practice and the bonus plans of MFI and conditional on
such amounts being properly accrued as a current liability for the purposes of
the Net Working Capital calculation.

11.3 Successor Employer Obligations. The Purchaser agrees to:



     | (a) | recognize the unions that are party to the collective
bargaining agreements set forth in _Section 4.15 of MFIs Disclosure Letter_
(true and complete copies of which, including all applicable schedules,
letters of agreement and exhibits, have been provided to the Purchaser) as the
sole and exclusive collective bargaining agents as of the Closing Date and
immediately thereafter for the unionized Employees represented by such unions
immediately prior to the Closing Date; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | to accept and be bound by the terms and conditions of the
collective bargaining agreements set forth in _Section 4.15 of MFIs
Disclosure Letter_ applicable to such unionized Employees except that the
Purchaser and the applicable collective bargaining agent shall be free (upon
mutual agreement) to change the terms and conditions of such unionized
Employees or otherwise modify the applicable collective bargaining agreement. 
---|---|--- 

11.4 Allocation of Employee Liabilities.

 



     | (a) | Subject to the provisions of Section 11.2 of this Agreement,
MFI will continue to be responsible for and will discharge all Liabilities for
wages, salary, incentive compensation, bonuses, vacation pay, benefits, and
source deductions, in respect of all Transferred Employees up to 11:59 p.m.
(Eastern Time) on the date immediately preceding the Closing Date and the
Purchaser assumes and will discharge all such Liabilities arising on and
after the Closing Date in respect of all Transferred Employees (save and
except for Employees on an authorized leave of absence as of the Closing Date
and for whom the Purchaser will only assume such Liabilities as of the date
the Employee becomes a Transferred Employee upon returning to work in
accordance with Section 11.1). In addition, the Purchaser assumes and will
discharge all liabilities for severance pay (contractual, statutory or at
common law), termination pay, notice of termination of employment or pay in
lieu of such notice, and damages for wrongful dismissal in respect of any
termination of employment of a Transferred Employee on or after the Closing
Date, whether such Liabilities relate to the Transferred Employees period of
service with MFI or the Purchaser. 
---|---|--- 
 



\- 50 -  of MFI to whom an offer of employment is not required to be made pursuant to
Section 11.1 or to any Employee of MFI who does not accept an offer made in
accordance with the terms of Section 11.1, including without limitation all
Liabilities for severance pay (contractual, statutory, at common law or at
civil law), termination pay, notice of termination of employment or pay in
lieu of such notice, and damages for wrongful dismissal. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | MFI is responsible for all Liabilities for wages, salary,
incentive compensation, bonuses, vacation pay, benefits, source deductions,
severance pay (contractual, statutory, at common law or at civil law),
termination pay, notice of termination of employment or pay in lieu of such
notice, and damages for wrongful dismissal in respect of an Employee who does
not accept an offer of employment made by the Purchaser in accordance with
the terms of Section 11.1.

     | (c) | _Capital Expenditures_. Except as contemplated by _Section

$5,000,000 in the aggregate; provided, however, that MFI shall (i) cause the
capital expenditures budgeted for the Major Projects, as set forth on _Section
1.1(b) of MFIs Disclosure Letter_, to be expended in a timely manner
consistent with such budget (subject to any delays in payment arising due to
delays in construction beyond the reasonable control of MFI), (ii) pay and
satisfy in full all monetary obligations of MFI or the Business in respect of
work performed in connection with a Major Project during the sixty (60) day
period referred to in Section 2.2(d), and (iii) promptly notify the Purchaser

hiring or appointment decision and provides the Purchaser with a reasonable
opportunity to consult regarding such hiring or appointment), pay or promise
to pay any special bonus or special remuneration to any Employee, or increase
or promise to increase the salaries or wage rates of the Employees other than
in the ordinary course of business (including, without limitation, in
accordance with the 2013 regularly-scheduled salary increases);

destroyed or damaged by fire or other casualty ("Casualty Damage"), and such
Facility is not capable of operating on substantially the same basis as it

---|---|---

Casualty Damage resulting in Damages (including all lost profits arising out
of, projected to arise out of, or related to the interruption of the
operation of the Business) to the Business of $100,000,000 or more), that the
condition to Closing set out in Section 6.3 will not be satisfied, and that
the Purchaser will not waive such condition in respect of such Casualty
Damage if it is not remedied prior to the Closing Date. For greater certainty,
in the event that the notice required to be delivered by MFI to the Purchaser
pursuant to clause (b) above is delivered less than fifteen (15) days before
the scheduled Closing Date, the Closing Date shall be automatically extended
to the end of such fifteen (15) day period.

proceeds have not been received prior to Closing, credit any proceeds of such
insurance received prior to Closing against the Purchase Price and refund any
resulting overpayment of the Purchase Price to the Purchaser; and (ii) in
respect of any such Casualty Damage or Damages resulting from the interruption
of the Business that are not settled by the proceeds from MFIs insurance
policies, be responsible for remedying such Casualty Damage or
Damages resulting from the interruption of the Business, at its sole cost and
expense; provided that, solely with respect to the foregoing clause (ii), in
the circumstances where the aggregate Damages (including lost profits arising
out of, projected to arise out of, or related to the interruption of the
operation of the Business) to the Business are, in the opinion of MFI acting
reasonably, estimated to exceed CAD $25 million, MFI shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the Purchaser. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the rights and
remedies extended under this Section 12.16 shall be the Purchasers sole
recourse and exclusive remedy for any Casualty Damage.

the Closing Date, and upon reasonable advance notice received from the
Purchaser, MFI shall, and shall cause its representatives to, (a) afford the
Purchaser and its representatives reasonable access, during regular business
hours, to the Real Property, MFIs personnel, Environmental Authorizations,
Books and Records, Environmental site assessments, audits, studies, reports
and other documents and data relating to the Facilities and Real Property, (b)
furnish them with copies of all such Environmental Authorizations, Books and
Records and other existing documents and data as the Purchaser may reasonably
request; (c) otherwise cooperate and assist, to the extent reasonably
requested by the Purchaser with the Purchasers investigation of the Real
Property, including allowing the Purchaser to conduct site visits,

Phase I Environmental site assessments, on terms and conditions acceptable to
both parties, acting reasonably; and (d) promptly provide such consents as may
be required in order to obtain file searches with respect to the Real Property
from any Governmental Entity, provided that no such consents shall request or
authorize any inspections by any Governmental Entity. It is acknowledged by
MFI that communications with Governmental Authorities may trigger inspections
even in the absence of any request for inspection. The Purchaser shall be
liable to MFI for any damage to the Real Property arising as a result of the
Purchasers negligence in exercising its rights under Section 12.17.

12.18 Financing. The Purchaser shall use its best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange for and obtain the proceeds of the debt
financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter concurrently with the Closing
on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter. The Debt
Commitment Letter may not be amended or superseded without the prior consent
of MFI to the extent that so amending or superseding the Debt Commitment
Letter would (i) expand in any way that is adverse to MFI the conditions to
the debt financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter; or (ii)
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the Closing.

12.19 Assignment of the Eco-energy Agreement. MFI will use commercially
reasonable efforts to work with the Purchaser and the Government of Canada to

Agreement to the Purchaser, including the right to assign all rights
and Liabilities under such agreement.

 



\- 58 -  12.20 Truro Encroachment. On or prior to the Closing Date, at its sole cost
and expense (which may require MFI to make continued payments to a
Governmental Entity after the Closing), MFI shall:



     | (a) | provide the Purchaser with evidence, satisfactory to the
Purchaser acting reasonably, that the Truro Encroachment may legally remain in
its present location so as to permit the Facility to continue to operate on
the same basis as it has been operating since January 1, 2013 or otherwise on
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Purchaser, acting reasonably; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | agree that it will, within a reasonable time following
Closing, cause the Truro Encroachment to be relocated onto a portion of the
Owned Real Property at Truro, Nova Scotia, approved by the Purchaser, acting
reasonably, which will permit the Facility to continue to operate on the same
basis as it has been operating since January 1, 2012 or which is otherwise
acceptable to the Purchaser, acting reasonably.  
---|---|--- 

12.21 Post-Signing Remedial Actions. Promptly after the execution of this
Agreement, MFI shall (i) commence the conduct of each Remedial Action set

Remedial Action" and, collectively, the "Post-Signing Remedial Actions")
and (ii) continue to conduct each such Post-Signing Remedial Action
diligently and in the same manner that would be utilized by MFI at such
facilities prior to the Closing at MFIs sole cost and expense, until all
Post-Signing Remedial Actions are completed in the manner set forth on
_Section 12.21 of MFIs Disclosure Letter_. For the sake of clarity, MFI
shall bear the sole responsibility for conducting and completing the Post-
Signing Remedial Actions, including, without limitation, during any period
from and after the Closing, and all costs and expenses related thereto and the
Purchaser shall cooperate with MFI and, as necessary, provide access to such
facilities for purposes of conducting and completing the Post-Signing
Remedial Actions.

permitted under, or expressly excluded from, any rendering supply and services

through a third-party recruiting firm where the solicitation is not

13.4 Remedies. Each of the Parties acknowledges that a breach of any of
the covenants contained in Sections 13.1 and 13.3 would result in damages to
the Purchaser and that the Purchaser may not be adequately compensated for
such damages by monetary award alone. Accordingly, each of the Purchaser and
MFI agrees that in the event of any such breach, in addition to any other
remedies available at law or otherwise, the Purchaser shall be entitled as a
matter of right to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for relief by
way of injunction, restraining order, decree or otherwise as may be
appropriate to ensure compliance with the provisions of this Article 13. Any

all restrictions in this Article 13 are necessary and fundamental to this
Agreement and are reasonable and valid. All defences to the strict enforcement
of this Article 13 are hereby waived. Each provision of this Article 13 shall
constitute a separate and distinct covenant and shall be severable from all
other such separate and distinct covenants contained in this Article 13. Any
provision of this Article 13 which is prohibited or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction, shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent
of such prohibition or unenforceability and shall be severed from the balance
of this Article 13, without affecting the remaining provisions of this Article
13 or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

\- 61 -  14.2 Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise stated in this Agreement, the
Parties will each be responsible for their respective legal and other
expenses in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.

14.3 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original and all of which
together will constitute one instrument.

14.4 Rules of Construction; Entire Agreement; Non-assignability; Parties in
Interest. This Agreement and the documents referred to herein are the product
of all of the Parties, and such Parties have been represented by counsel
during the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement. The
Parties therefore waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or
rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other
document will be construed against the Party drafting such agreement or
document; rather, this Agreement shall be given a fair and reasonable
construction in accordance with the intention of the Parties. This Agreement
and the documents referred to herein constitute the entire agreement among
the Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and merge all
prior negotiations and drafts of the Parties with regard to the transactions
contemplated herein and therein. Except for the Confidentiality Agreement and
the other agreements referenced herein, any and all other written or oral
agreements existing between the Parties regarding such transactions: (a) are
expressly terminated; and (b) except as set forth in Section 14.11, are not
intended to confer upon any other person any rights or remedies hereunder.
This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the
Parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, but
neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder may be assigned by any Party without the prior written consent of
the other Parties except that the Purchaser may designate one or more of its
Affiliates to purchase all or any portion of the Purchased Assets and assume
that portion of the Assumed Liabilities relating thereto; notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Purchaser shall remain responsible for all of its covenants and
other agreements contained in this Agreement.

14.5 Severability. If one or more provisions of this Agreement are held to be
unenforceable under Applicable Law, the Parties agree to use commercially
reasonable efforts to renegotiate such provision in order to maintain the
economic position enjoyed by each Party as closely as possible to that under
the provision rendered unenforceable. If the Parties cannot reach a mutually
agreeable and enforceable replacement for such provision, then such provision
will be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity,
without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining
provisions of this Agreement, and the balance of the Agreement will remain
enforceable in accordance with its terms.

14.6 Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise provided herein (including
Article 9 hereof which provides an exclusive remedy to the Indemnified Party
for Damages), any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party
will be deemed to be cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a
Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

14.7 Governing Law. This Agreement and all acts and transactions pursuant
hereto and the rights and obligations of the Parties shall be governed,
construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of
Ontario, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law. Each of the
Parties to this Agreement consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of
the courts in the Province of Ontario, and agree that no lawsuit shall be
filed by any Party with respect to the enforcement or interpretation of this
Agreement, or related to or arising out of the transactions contemplated
hereby, in any court other than such provincial or federal courts.

 



\- 62 -  14.8 Waiver of Jury Trial. The Parties hereby irrevocably waive any and all
rights to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or related to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

14.9 Planning Act. This Agreement is subject to compliance with the
subdivision control provisions of the _Planning Act_ (Ontario) and any other
similar legislation in any jurisdiction of Canada in which any Real Property
is located.

 

14.10 Amendments and Waivers. Any term of this Agreement may be amended only
with the written consent of MFI and the Purchaser or their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Any amendment effected in
accordance with this Section 14.10 will be binding upon the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

14.11 Financing Source-Related Party Arrangements.



     | (a) | Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
each of the Parties agrees (i) that any claim, cross-claim, suit, action or
proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether
in contract or in tort or otherwise, involving any of the Financing Source-
Related Parties that arises out of or relates to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated by the Debt
Financing or the performance of services thereunder shall be subject to the
exclusive jurisdiction of a state or federal court sitting in the Borough of
Manhattan within the City of New York and the appellate courts thereof, (ii)
not to bring or permit any of their Affiliates to bring or support anyone else
in bringing any such claim, suit, action or proceeding in any court other than
a state or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan within the City
of New York and the appellate courts thereof, (iii) to irrevocably waive any
and all rights to a trial by jury in any such claim, suit, action or
proceeding and (iv) that the Financing Source-Related Parties are express
third party beneficiaries of each of clause (b) contained in Section 14.4,
Section 14.10 (to the extent relating to any amendment to Section 14.4(b) or
this Section 14.11) and such provisions shall be enforceable by them.  
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
MFI agrees on its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates that none of the
Financing Source-Related Parties shall have any liability or obligation to
MFI or Affiliates relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated herein (including the Debt Financing). This Section 14.11(b) is
intended to benefit and may be enforced by the Financing-Source Related
Parties and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of MFI.
