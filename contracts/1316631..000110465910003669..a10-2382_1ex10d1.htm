 **7.8** ** **_Tax Matters_.

  



  

### **7.8.1** ** **Seller Parent will cause the taxable income of the Target

items related to its interest in Super Media for any taxable year of Super
Media ending on or before the Closing Date under Section 706(a) of the Code)
to be included in Seller Groups consolidated, combined or unitary Tax
Returns for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods. Seller Parent shall cause to
be prepared and filed all required income Tax Returns of the Target Group
Companies for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods. Buyer agrees to cooperate with
Seller Parent in the preparation of such Tax Returns pertaining to the Target
Companies and Super Media.

  

### 

  

### **7.8.2** ** **Buyer shall prepare, or caused to be prepared, and file
all Tax Returns of the Target Companies and Super Media for all Pre-Closing
Tax Periods and Straddle Periods which are required to be filed after the
Closing Date, other than Tax Returns described in _Section 7.8.1_.  Buyer
shall prepare all Tax Returns pursuant to this _Section 7.8.2_ consistent
with past practices, except as required by applicable law. Buyer shall permit
Seller Parent to review and comment on each such Tax Return described in the
preceding sentence within a reasonable period prior to filing and Buyer shall
make such revisions as are reasonably requested by Seller Parent, except:
 (i) where a contrary position is required under applicable law or (ii)
to the extent such comments, if incorporated in any such Tax Return, would
cause such Tax Return to be prepared in a manner inconsistent with past Tax
Returns.

  

### 

  

### **7.8.3** ** **For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Taxes
that are imposed and

  



        
   

  



  

### are payable for a Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax which relates
to the portion of such Tax period ending on the Closing Date shall (i) in
the case of _ad valorem,_ property Taxes or other Taxes measured by the
amount, value or level of any item, be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes
determined by multiplying (A) the amount, value or level of such items
immediately prior to the Closing, by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which
is the number of calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending
on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar
days in the entire Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes
be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of
business on the Closing Date. The portion of such Tax that is allocable
to the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date shall
equal the total amount of such Tax for the Straddle Period less the amount of
Tax that is allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date.

  

### 

  

### **7.8.4** ** **Buyer shall promptly notify Seller Parent, in the manner
set forth in _Sections 8.8 and 8.9_ of this Agreement, as applicable, of any
inquiries, Claims, assessments, audits or similar events with respect to
Taxes relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period for which
Seller Parent may be liable under this Agreement (such inquiry, Claim,
assessment, audit or similar event, a " **Tax Matter** "). Seller Parent
shall have the authority to represent the interests of the Target Companies
and Super Media and shall have sole control of the defense, compromise or
other resolution of any Tax Matter (i) involving any combined, consolidated
or unitary Tax Return of the Seller Group or its Affiliates that includes the
results of operations, the business or the assets of the Target Companies or
Super Media for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or (ii) with respect to any Tax
Return of Super Media for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, other than any Tax
Return of Super Media that was filed with respect to the SM Conversion (such
Tax Matters described in clause (i) and (ii) are collectively referred to as
" **Seller Parent Tax Matters** "). If the resolution of a Seller Parent Tax
Matter that does not involve a consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return
of the Seller Group of its Affiliates (whether by discharge, settlement,
compromise or other disposition) would reasonably be expected to have an
adverse effect on the Tax liability of a Buyer Indemnified Party for any
Post-Closing Tax Period or the portion of a Straddle Period that ends after
the Closing Date, then such resolution shall not be effected by the Seller
Parent without obtaining the prior written consent of the Buyer (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Buyer shall have the
authority to represent the interests of the Target Companies and Super Media
and shall have control of the defense, compromise or other resolution of any
Tax Matter for any Straddle Period (a " **Buyer Tax Matter** "), provided,
Buyer shall keep Seller Parent informed about the progress and substantive
aspects of any Buyer Tax Matter, and Buyer shall not resolve (whether by
discharge, settlement, compromise or other disposition) any Buyer Tax Matter
without obtaining the prior written consent of the Seller Parent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. Seller
Parent shall have the right to participate in, and jointly control with
Buyer, any Tax Matter that relates to the SM Conversion (a " **Conversion Tax
Matter** "). Such participation and control shall include the right to attend
conferences with Taxing Authorities, being provided with a reasonable
opportunity to comment before submitting any written materials to Taxing
Authorities and making joint decisions with respect to significant actions,
including with respect to settlement, compromise or other disposition of a
Conversion Tax Matter. Notwithstanding any other provision in this _Section
7.8.4_ to the contrary, Sumitomo, and not the Seller Parent or Buyer, shall
have the right to represent the interests of Super Media in any Tax Matter
for which Sumitomo is indemnifying Super Media pursuant to the Redemption
Agreement to the

  



        
   

  



  

### extent established in such agreement. The provisions in this _Section
7.8.4_ shall govern the rights of Seller Parent and Buyer to control and
participate in any Tax Matters notwithstanding any contrary provision in
_Section 8.9_.

  

### 

  

### **7.8.5** ** **Without the Seller Parents prior written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, the Buyer
shall not and it shall not permit or cause the Target Companies or Super
Media to make or change any Tax election, amend any Tax Return for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period or for a Straddle Period, take any action or enter into
any transaction that results in any increased Tax liability of the Seller
Parent or its Affiliates or that would increase the indemnification
obligation of the Seller Parent under this Agreement unless such election,
amendment, action or transaction is required by applicable law.

  

### 

  

### **7.8.6** ** **If requested by Seller Parent, Buyer and Seller Parent
shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, as promptly as
practicable, such information and assistance relating to the Target Companies
and Super Media as is reasonably necessary for the preparation and filing of
any Tax Return, claim for refund or other filings relating to Tax matters,
for the preparation for any Tax audit, for the preparation for any Tax
protest, for the prosecution or defense of any suit or other proceeding
relating to Tax matters.  Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to assist Seller
Parent in obtaining information and assistance reasonably necessary for
Seller Parent and its Affiliates to make any filings with applicable taxing
authorities that may be necessary as a result of their direct or indirect
ownership of J:COM through the Closing Date including, without limitation,
information and assistance reasonably necessary to prepare and file U.S.
Internal Revenue Service Form 5471 relating to the status of J:COM as a CFC
and filings to claim tax-credits under Section 902 of the Code.

  

### 

  

### **7.8.7** ** **Any Tax refund, credit or similar benefit, including any
interest paid or credited with respect thereto (" **Tax Refund** "), of
a Target Group Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or the portion of a
Straddle Period that ends on or before the date of the Closing Date shall be:

  

### 

  

#### (a) the property of Seller Parent in the case of a refund received by a
Target Company;

  

#### 

  

#### (b) the property of Seller Parent in the case of a refund received by
Super Media attributed to the SM Units held by Seller Parent or its
Affiliates;

  

#### 

  

#### (c) the property of Sumitomo in the case of a refund received by Super
Media attributed to the SM Units held by Sumitomo or its Affiliates.

  

#### 

  

#### If received by Buyer, its Affiliate or a Target Group Company, a Tax
Refund shall be paid over promptly to Seller Parent or Sumitomo, as the case
may be. Buyer shall, if Seller Parent so requests and at Seller Parents
reasonable expense, cause the applicable Target Company, Super Media or other
relevant entity to file for and use its best efforts to obtain and expedite
the receipt of any refund to which Seller Parent or Sumitomo is entitled
under this _Section 7.8.7_. Buyer shall permit Seller Parent or Sumitomo (as
the case may be) to participate in (at their own expense) the prosecution of
any such refund claim.

  

#### 

  

### **7.8.8** ** **Buyer and Seller Parent shall treat any indemnification
payments made

  



        
   

  



  

### pursuant to this Agreement as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes.

### **7.8.9** ** **On or prior to the Closing Date, all tax sharing
agreements between any of the Target Companies and Super Media, on the one
hand, and the Seller Group (other than the Target Companies), on the other
hand, shall be terminated and shall have no further effect for any Post-
Closing Tax Period.

  

### 

  

### **7.8.10** ** **Seller Parent and Buyer shall each be responsible for
the timely payment of one-half of all documentary, stamp, stock transfer and
other similar Taxes (" **Transfer Taxes** ") arising out the transfer of the
membership interests of the Target Companies pursuant to this Agreement.
Seller Parent and Buyer shall use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to minimize or avoid the incurrence of Transfer Taxes.

  

### 

  

 **7.9** ** **_No Solicitation_. Neither Seller Parent nor any of its
Affiliates nor their respective Representatives shall initiate, solicit or
knowingly encourage, directly or indirectly, any inquiries or the making or
implementation of any proposal or offer with respect to a merger,
consolidation or other business combination involving the Target Group
Companies or any acquisition or similar transaction (including,
without limitation, a tender or exchange offer) involving the purchase (or
indirect purchase) of (A) all or any significant portion of the assets of
the Target Group Companies and the J:COM Group taken as a whole or (B)
any shares of capital stock of any Target Group Company or J:COM Group
Company (any such proposal or offer being hereinafter referred to as an "

concerning, or provide any confidential information or data to, any Person or
group relating to an Alternative Proposal, or otherwise facilitate any effort
or attempt to make or implement an Alternative Proposal in each case except
as required by applicable Regulations. Seller Parent shall immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any third parties with respect to any of the foregoing.

Agreement, complete control and supervision over the Target Group Company
operations.

advance notice, Seller Parent shall, and shall cause each of the Target
Companies to, afford to Buyer and Buyers Representatives reasonable access,
during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Closing, to
all of the Target Group Companies properties, books, contracts and records
and, during such period, Seller Parent shall, and shall cause the Target
Companies to, furnish promptly to Buyer and its Representatives access to all

any other reason related to the Transaction; _provided_ , that in no event
shall Seller Parent be obligated to provide any access or information if

is entitled to recover from any insurer or third party any sum in respect of
any matter giving rise to a Claim for indemnification under this Agreement,
the Indemnified Person shall undertake all commercially reasonable and
appropriate steps to enforce such recovery. If the Indemnified
Person receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies, or from any
other Person alleged to be responsible for any Damages, subsequent to an
applicable indemnification payment by the Indemnitor, then such Indemnified
Person shall promptly reimburse the Indemnitor for any payment made or
expense incurred by such Indemnitor in connection with providing such
indemnification payment up to the amount received by the Indemnified Person,
net of any expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in collecting such
amount. The amount of any Damages payable by an Indemnitor shall be net of
any Tax benefits realized by the Indemnified Person as a result of such
Damages.

  

### 

  

### **8.7.2** ** **_Restriction on Claims_. The remedies expressly set forth
in this Agreement shall provide the exclusive remedies for, and each Party
hereby waives any Claim for any other remedy with respect to, any
misrepresentation, breach of representation, warranty or covenant, or other
Claim arising out of this Agreement or the Transaction, including, without
limitation, any Claim in respect of any certificate or other document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that it is
understood and agreed that, in addition to the remedies specifically set
forth in this Agreement, each Party shall be entitled to specific performance
and injunctive relief as a remedy where available under applicable law.
Following the Closing, each Party hereby agrees to limit its recourse for
breach of representation, warranty or covenant by another Party hereunder,
and not make any Claim for any Damages or other matter, under, relating to or
arising out of such breach, whether based on contract, tort, strict
liability, other Regulations or otherwise, except for Claims
for indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.2_ or _Section 8.5_.

  

### 

  

### **8.7.3 **_No Consequential Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, no Party shall be liable under a Claim
of indemnification for special, punitive, exemplary, consequential, or
indirect damages, internal administrative and

  



        
   

  



  

overhead costs, any potential or actual reduction in value of the Target
Group Companies or the J:COM Group Companies beyond the actual damage
incurred, any amounts in connection with arguments that the Purchase Price
was calculated upon incorrect assumptions, or lost profits or revenues,
whether based on contract, tort, strict liability, other Regulations or
otherwise, and whether or not arising from another Partys sole, joint or
concurrent negligence, strict liability or other fault.

  



  

 **8.8** ** _ _**_Notice of Claims_.  Any Indemnified Person, if seeking
indemnification hereunder, shall promptly, within the relevant Claim
Period provided for in _Section 8.1_, give to the Indemnitor a written
notice (a " **Claim Notice** ") describing in reasonable detail the
facts giving rise to any Claims for indemnification hereunder and shall
include in such Claim Notice (if then known) the amount or the method of
computation of the amount of Damages, and a reference to the provision of
this Agreement or any agreement, certificate or instrument executed pursuant
hereto or in connection herewith upon which such Claim is based; _provided_
,  _however_ , that a Claim Notice in respect of any action at law or suit
in equity by or against a third party as to which indemnification will be
sought shall be given promptly after the action or suit is commenced; and
_provided further_ , that failure to give such notice shall not relieve the
Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder except to the extent it shall have
been prejudiced by such failure.

  



  

 **8.9** ** _ _**_Third-Party Claims_.  If a Claim by a third party is made
against an Indemnified Person, and if such Indemnified Person intends to seek
indemnity with respect thereto under this _Section 8_, such Indemnified
Person shall promptly notify the Indemnitor in writing of such Claims,
setting forth such Claims in reasonable detail. The Indemnitor shall have
twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of such notice to undertake, conduct
and control, through counsel of its own choosing and at its own expense,
the settlement or defense thereof, and the Indemnified Person shall cooperate
with it in connection therewith; _provided, however_ , that the Indemnified
Person may participate in such settlement or defense through counsel chosen
by such Indemnified Person and paid at its own expense; and _provided
further_ , that if in the opinion of counsel for such Indemnified Person
there is a reasonable likelihood of a conflict of interest between the
Indemnitor and the Indemnified Person, the Indemnitor shall be responsible
for reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel to such Indemnified Person in
connection with such defense. The Indemnified Person shall not pay or settle
any such Claim without the consent of the Indemnitor. If the Indemnitor does
not notify the Indemnified Person within twenty (20) Business Days after
receipt of the Indemnified Persons notice of a Claim of indemnity hereunder
that it elects to undertake the defense thereof, the Indemnified Person shall
have the right to undertake, at Indemnitors cost, risk and expense, the
defense of the Claim but shall not thereby waive any right to indemnity
therefor pursuant to this Agreement. The Indemnitor shall not, except with
the consent of the Indemnified Person, enter into any settlement that
includes any obligations of the Indemnified Person other than the payment of
money by the Indemnitor on its behalf and that does not include as
an unconditional term thereof the giving by the Person or Persons asserting
such Claim to all Indemnified Persons (i.e., Seller Parent Indemnified
Persons or Buyer Indemnified Persons, as the case may be) of an unconditional
release from all liability with respect to such Claim or consent to entry of
any judgment.

 **10.4** ** _ _**_Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers; Interpretation_.
This Agreement, the NDA and all exhibits and schedules hereto and thereto
shall constitute the entire agreement among the Parties pertaining to the
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements, understandings,
negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, of the Parties. No
supplement, modification or waiver of this Agreement shall be binding unless
executed in writing by the Party to be bound thereby. No waiver of any of
the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver
of any other provision hereof (whether or not similar), nor shall such waiver
constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided. No failure
or delay on the part of any Party hereto to exercise any right or remedy
under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of such right or remedy, and
no single or partial exercise of any such right or remedy shall preclude any
other or further exercise thereof. No Party shall be deemed to have waived
any Claim arising out of this Agreement, or any right or remedy under
this Agreement, unless the waiver of such Claim, right or remedy is expressly
set forth in a written instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf of
such Party.

  



        
   

  



  

 **10.5** ** _ _**_Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

  



  

 **10.6** ** _ _**_Invalidity_. If any provisions of this Agreement shall be
held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that such
provisions will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect
the intent of the Parties, and the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not in any way be affected
or impaired thereby. If necessary to effect the intent of the Parties, the
Parties will negotiate in good faith to amend this Agreement to replace the
unenforceable language with enforceable language which as closely as possible
reflects such intent.

  



  

 **10.7** ** _ _**_Headings_. The headings of the Sections herein are
inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be a part
of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

this Agreement, each Party will pay its own expenses incident to this
Agreement and the Transaction, including legal and accounting fees and
disbursements.

  



  

 **10.9** ** _ _**_Schedules_. The schedules and exhibits referenced in this
Agreement are a material part hereof and shall be treated as if fully
incorporated into the body of the Agreement. Seller Parent may, at its option,
include in the Disclosure Schedule items that are not material in order to
avoid any misunderstanding, and any such inclusion, or any references to US
Dollar or Yen amounts, shall not be deemed to be an acknowledgment or
representation that such items are material, to establish any standard of
materiality or to define further the meaning of such terms for purposes of
this Agreement. Information disclosed in any section of the Disclosure
Schedule shall constitute a disclosure for purposes of all other sections of
the Disclosure Schedule notwithstanding the lack of specific cross-
reference thereto, but only to the extent the applicability of such
disclosure to such other sections of the Disclosure Schedule is reasonably
apparent. The mere inclusion of an item in the Disclosure Schedule shall not
be deemed an admission by Seller Parent that such item represents a material
exception or fact, event, or circumstance or that such item is reasonably
likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  

### 

  

### **10.10.2** ** **_Section 10.10.1_ shall not apply in the event the
public announcement is required by Regulation or any regulatory body or the
rules and regulations of any recognized stock exchange on which the
securities of a Party or its holding company are listed or quoted; _provided_
that so far as it is lawful and practical to do so prior to making such
public announcement, the Party with an obligation to make an announcement
shall provide a draft of its proposed public announcement (other than LGIs
Form 8-K filing) to the other Party in advance of such public announcement
and consider in good faith the

the provisions of this Agreement was not performed in accordance with
its specific terms or was otherwise breached.  Accordingly, each Party
agrees that the other Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions

specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in any action
or proceeding in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled, at

### **10.13.1** ** **The Parties shall make a diligent, good faith attempt
to resolve any dispute concerning the validity, interpretation, performance
or breach of this Agreement or otherwise arising in connection with this
Agreement before commencing dispute resolution by arbitration and,
with respect to any dispute regarding amounts owed under this Agreement, pay
such undisputed amounts pursuant to the terms hereof. If, despite the
Parties diligent, good faith attempt to resolve such dispute pursuant to the
first sentence of this _Section 10.13.1_, the Parties do not resolve such
dispute, then at the written request of any Party, the chief executive
officers of each disputing Party (or such other senior officer that a Partys
chief executive officer designates) shall meet at any mutually agreed
location within thirty (30) days of receipt of such request to resolve the
dispute. If, despite such meeting, the Parties do not resolve the dispute, or
if no such meeting takes place within such time despite one Partys attempts
therefor, any Party may commence an arbitration by submitting a request for
arbitration to the other Parties and the International Chamber of Commerce
Secretariat in accordance with this _Section 10.13.1_.  Arbitration shall
be the sole remedy for any dispute arising out of or in connection with this
