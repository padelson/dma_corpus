Following agreement or determination of the Business Current Asset Adjustment

Clause 8 in order to determine the final aggregate cash consideration for the
sale of the Business Assets (the "Final Cash Consideration"). The Final Cash
Consideration may only be further adjusted as specifically provided elsewhere
in this Agreement.

The Initial Cash Consideration, as adjusted to become the Final Cash

The Seller shall have a period of fifteen (15) days (the "Consideration

Consideration Allocation Statement to review the Draft Consideration
Allocation Statement, and within such Consideration Allocation Statement
Review Period may request (in writing) an adjustment to be made to any
allocation set out therein. If no such written request is presented to the
Purchaser within the Consideration Allocation Statement Review Period, then
the Draft Consideration Allocation Statement shall be deemed to have been

matter in dispute between them within fifteen (15) days following delivery to
the Purchaser of such a written request, and unless the Seller and the
Purchaser agree in writing to extend the period in which they may agree such
allocation, the Seller and the Purchaser agree that that each shall adopt its
own allocation of the Initial Cash Consideration for all purposes (including
Tax) and, for the avoidance of doubt, neither party shall have any liability
to the other for any actions, claims, demands, proceedings, judgments,
liabilities, loss, damages, payments, costs and expenses arising out of their
failure to agree the Consideration Allocation Statement.

Following agreement or determination of the Completion Current Asset Statement

should be amended to represent an agreed or determined allocation of the Final
Cash Consideration.

  |  

Should the Purchaser and the Seller agree to amend the Consideration
Allocation Statement in accordance with Clause 7.9, the allocation of the
Final Cash Consideration thus agreed or determined shall be adopted by the
Seller and the Purchaser for all purposes (including Tax).

For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed by the parties that
any valuation of assets and liabilities used in order to determine the
allocation pursuant to this Clause 7 is not intended to be, and shall not be
interpreted as, any assurance by any party as to the value of the assets and
liabilities being transferred.

  |  

Within ninety (90) days of the determination of the Final Cash Consideration
the Purchaser shall provide to the Seller a draft United States Internal

Form 8594 to provide any comments thereon to the Purchaser. If the Seller does
not provide any comments within that thirty (30) day period, the Form 8594

relevant member of the Purchaser\'s Group), or to permit the Seller (or other
relevant member of the GSK Group) to take such actions and steps as the Seller
may reasonably request and deem necessary (as the case may be), in each case
with a view to minimising the liability (if any) of the Seller (or relevant
member of the GSK Group), in response to incidents (including safety issues)
concerning such Products and, upon request, the parties shall provide, and

Payments

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

29.1

  |  

The parties shall use all reasonable endeavours to cooperate to ensure that
any amount payable by any party under this Agreement is, to the extent
reasonable having regard to the Tax affairs of both parties, made in such a
way as to ensure that the amount is not required by law to be paid subject to
any deduction or withholding on account of Tax.

   
---|--- 
 

   
 

    

29.2

  |  

If, notwithstanding the parties' compliance with Clause 29.1, any amount
payable by any party (whether paid on its own behalf or on behalf of the
Business Seller or, as the case may be, a Designated Purchaser) under this
Agreement (except for the Non-Compete Consideration or the Initial
Consideration or any interest) is required by law to be paid subject to any
deduction or withholding on account of Tax, the party which is obliged to make
the payment (the "Paying Party") shall be required to increase its payments to
such amount as will ensure that, after the withholding or deduction on the
increased amount is taken into account, the party to which the payment is to
be made (whether to be received on its own behalf or on behalf of the Business
Seller or, as the case may be, a Designated Purchaser) (the "Receiving Party")
receives and retains a set amount which is equal to that which the Receiving
Party would have received and retained had no such withholding or deduction
been required.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

29.3

  |  

To the extent the Receiving Party subsequently receives and is entitled to
retain and utilise a credit against, relief or remission for, or repayment of
any Tax (any of the foregoing being referred to as a "saving") in respect of
such additional amount or the payment to which such additional amount relates,
the Purchaser or, as the case may be, the Seller shall procure that the
Receiving Party shall pay an amount to the Paying Party which the Receiving
Party reasonably determines will leave it (after that payment) in the same
after-Tax position as it would have been in but for its utilisation of the
saving.

to the others, assign the benefit of this Agreement to a member of the GSK
Group (in the case of the Seller or the Business Seller) or to a member of the
Purchaser's Group (in the case of the Purchaser or any Designated Purchaser)
(a "Permitted Assignee") PROVIDED THAT such assignment shall be without cost
to, and shall not result in any increased liability, or any reduction in the
rights, of, any of the other parties AND FURTHER PROVIDED THAT if such
Permitted Assignee shall subsequently cease to be a member of the Purchaser's
Group or the GSK Group, as the case may be, the original assigning party shall
procure that prior to the Permitted Assignee ceasing to be a member of the
Purchaser's Group or the GSK Group, as the case may be, it shall assign the
benefit of this Agreement assigned to it to the party by whom such rights were
originally assigned or (upon giving further written notice to the other
parties) to another member of the Purchaser's Group or the GSK Group, as the
case may be. Any purported assignment in contravention of this Clause shall be
void.

32.3

  |  

Notwithstanding the provisions of Clause 32.2 or any other provisions of this
Agreement, the Purchaser shall be entitled to grant security over its rights,
or assign its rights by way of security, under this Agreement or any other
Purchaser Transaction Document (in each case, whether in whole or in part) for
the purposes of any debt financing to be provided to the Purchaser in
connection with its entry into this Agreement PROVIDED THAT any assignee of
any such rights shall not be entitled to further assign them (in whole or in
part) other than by way of enforcement of such security.

rights would have been had the assignment not occurred and the liabilities of
all members of the Purchaser's Group under this Agreement to the GSK Group

Business Intellectual Property, each of the parties shall from time to time,
so far as each is reasonably able, do or procure the doing of all such acts
and/or execute or procure the execution of all such documents in a form
reasonably satisfactory to the party concerned as they may reasonably consider

member of the Purchaser's Group) or otherwise to give the other party the full

connection the Purchaser shall give or cause to be given (and shall procure
that the relevant member of the Purchaser's Group shall give or cause to be
given) to the Seller all such assistance (at the Seller's cost) as it may
reasonably require in avoiding, disputing, resisting, settling, compromising,
defending or appealing any such claim, action or demand and shall instruct
such solicitors or other professional advisers as the Seller may nominate to
act on behalf of the Purchaser or any relevant member of the Purchaser's
Group, as appropriate, but to act solely in accordance with the Seller's
instructions provided that neither the Purchaser nor the relevant member of
the Purchaser's Group shall be required to commence any legal proceedings
where either:

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(i)

  |  

the Purchaser or the relevant member of the Purchaser's Group has validly
assigned all of its rights in relation to the relevant claim, action or demand

of any such claim, action and/or demand if the claim, action and/or demand
seeks any relief other than damages (including any orders, injunctions or
other equitable relief) against any member of the Purchaser\'s Group which the
relevant member of the Purchaser\'s Group reasonably determined cannot be
separated from any related claim for damages. If such claim for other relief
can be separated from the claim for damages, the Seller shall be entitled to
assume the defence of the claim for damages. The Seller shall further be
entitled to settle any claim, action and/or demand where relief other than
damages is sought if the claimant agrees to settle such claim for damages and
not to pursue other relief;

  

  

AND PROVIDED ALSO THAT the Seller shall not be entitled (on written notice
from the Purchaser) to assume or continue the defence of any such claim,
action and/or demand in the event that such claim, action and/or demand, or
the Seller's conduct of the defence thereof, has caused or could cause (in the
opinion of the Purchaser, acting reasonably and in good faith) material damage
to the reputation or goodwill of any member of the Purchaser\'s Group;

views thereon;

  

  

    

  |  

(D)

  |  

be entitled to participate in the defence of the relevant claim, action or
demand (as applicable) and to employ separate counsel to represent it as its
own expense PROVIDED THAT the Seller shall control the defence of the relevant
claim, action or demand (as applicable);

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(E)

  |  

(F)

  |  

take, or procure that there is taken, all reasonable action to mitigate any

which a claim could be made under the Warranties.

No liability shall attach to the Seller or to any member of the GSK Group by
reason of any breach of any of the Warranties to the extent that the same loss
has been recovered by the Purchaser or any other member of the Purchaser's
Group under any other Warranty or terms of this Agreement or any other
document entered into pursuant hereto and accordingly the Purchaser and each
other member of the Purchaser's Group may only recover once in respect of the
same loss.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

4.2

  |  

The Seller shall not be liable for breach of any of the Warranties to the
extent that the subject of the claim has been or is made good or is otherwise

cost to the Purchaser or any other member of the Purchaser's Group.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

4.3

  |

[***] Confidential Treatment Requested

  |  

then no such matter shall be the subject of a claim under any such Warranties
unless and until the appropriate member of the Purchaser's Group shall have
made a claim against its insurers and used all reasonable endeavours to pursue
such claim and any such insurance claim shall then reduce by the amount
recovered or extinguish any such claims under any such Warranties.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

5.2

  |  

Where the Purchaser or any member of the Purchaser's Group is at any time
entitled to recover from some other person any sum in respect of any matter
giving rise to a claim under the Warranties, the Purchaser shall, and shall
procure that the member of the Purchaser's Group concerned shall, take all
reasonable steps to enforce such recovery prior to taking action against the
Seller (other than to notify the Seller of such claim) and, in the event that
the Purchaser or any member of the Purchaser's Group shall recover any amount
from such other person, the amount of the claim against the Seller shall be
reduced by the amount so recovered.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

5.3

  |  

If the Seller or any other member of the GSK Group pays at any time to the
Purchaser or any member of the Purchaser's Group an amount pursuant to a claim
in respect of the Warranties or under any provision of this Agreement and the
Purchaser or member of the Purchaser's Group subsequently recovers from some
other person any sum in respect of any matter giving rise to such claim, the
Purchaser shall, and shall procure that the relevant member of the Purchaser's
Group shall, repay to the Seller the lesser of (i) the amount paid by the
Seller (or other member of the GSK Group) to the Purchaser or relevant member
of the Purchaser's Group and (ii) the sum (including interest (if any))
recovered from such other person, less any Tax thereon.

For the purposes of the Completion Current Asset Statement, the Seller shall
procure that there is carried out as at the Completion Time a stock count in

The Business Inventory Count shall be carried out in a manner consistent with
that adopted for the purposes of verifying the relevant stock position of the
GSK Group during the last complete financial year of the GSK Group prior to
the date hereof and shall consist of a reconciliation of the inventory figure
shown in the computerised warehousing inventory at the relevant distribution
centres as at the Completion Time (updated in accordance with the customary
rolling stock-check process), such figure to be verified by means of physical
sample stock-checks of selected items of Business Inventory at the relevant
locations referred to in paragraph 3.1 above in the same manner and to the
same material extent as was undertaken to verify the relevant inventory
position of the GSK Group (the "Verification Sample Inventory Checks") during
the last complete financial year of the GSK Group prior to the date hereof.
Both the Purchaser and the Seller and their respective representatives shall
be entitled to be present at the Verification Sample Inventory Checks and
shall be entitled to make such enquiries, tests and inspections, and to have
copies of such supporting documentation, in each case as either of them may
reasonably deem necessary.

After Completion, the Purchaser shall (and shall procure that each member of

without charge, such reasonable access to the personnel of any member of the
Purchaser's Group (who shall be instructed to give prompt information and
explanations) and to all books and records of the Purchaser's Group relating
to the Business on or prior to the Completion Date as the Seller or the
Seller's advisers may reasonably request in connection with the preparation of
the Draft Completion Current Asset Statement.

   
---|---

  |  

The Purchaser may dispute the Draft Completion Current Asset Statement by
delivering to the Seller notice in writing (the "Dispute Notice") within

  |  

exactly which items of the Draft Completion Current Asset Statement are
disputed;

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(B)

  |  

the reasons therefor, making specific reference to the parts of this Schedule
which the Purchaser claims have not been followed in preparing the Draft
Completion Current Asset Statement; and

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(C)

  |  

to the extent practicable, the effect that the Purchaser believes that the
items in dispute have on each of the following:

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(i)

  |  

the Completion Current Asset Amount;

  |  

(iii)

  |  

the Business Current Asset Adjustment Amount.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

4.4

  |  

Only those items or amounts specified in the Dispute Notice shall be treated
as being in dispute (the "Disputed Items") and no amendment may be made by
either the Seller or the Purchaser, or any Expert appointed pursuant to
paragraph 4.7 below, to any items or amounts which are not Disputed Items,
save in the case of manifest error. To the extent practicable, the Dispute
Notice shall be accompanied by all relevant supporting documentation and
working papers on which the Purchaser wishes to rely, it being acknowledged by
the Purchaser that it shall (to the extent practicable) provide further
documentation to support its claims promptly on reasonable request by the
Seller.

and explanations) and to all books and records of the GSK Group (to the extent
in the possession or control of the relevant member of the GSK Group) relating
to the Business on or prior to the Completion Date as the Purchaser or the
Purchaser's advisers may reasonably request in connection

with their review of the Draft Completion Current Asset Statement. It is
acknowledged and agreed by the Purchaser that neither it nor its advisers
shall be entitled to any such access, information or assistance which goes
beyond that reasonably necessary to determine whether the Draft Completion
Current Asset Statement has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of
this Schedule.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

4.6

  |  

If the Purchaser does not serve the Dispute Notice on the Seller by the end of
the Review Period then the Draft Completion Current Asset Statement shall, as
between the Seller and the Purchaser, in the absence of manifest error, be
deemed to have been accepted, approved and agreed by the Seller and the
Purchaser and shall be final and binding on the Seller and the Purchaser and
shall constitute the "Completion Current Asset Statement" for all purposes of
this Agreement.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

4.7

  |  

If the Dispute Notice is served on the Seller by the Purchaser by the end of
the Review Period then the Seller and the Purchaser shall attempt to resolve
the Disputed Items between them in good faith negotiations. If there are any
Disputed Items which have not been resolved in good faith negotiations within
a period of fourteen (14) days after the end of the Review Period, then the
Disputed Items shall be referred for determination to a partner of at least
ten (10) years qualified experience at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or, if no
such partner is able to act, on the application of either the Purchaser or the
Seller by the President for the time being of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales (the "Expert"), who shall be instructed to
notify the Purchaser and the Seller of his determination within thirty (30)
days of such referral.

  |  

The Seller and the Purchaser shall, and shall procure that each member of
their respective Groups shall, give the Expert reasonable access at reasonable
times to all books and records in their possession or control relating to the
period prior to the Completion Date and generally shall provide the Expert
with such other information and assistance as the Expert may reasonably
require. In making his determination, the Expert shall act as expert and not
as arbitrator and the Draft Completion Current Asset Statement, as amended by
the Expert, shall, as between the Seller and the Purchaser and in the absence
of manifest error, be deemed to have been accepted and approved by the Seller
and the Purchaser, shall be final and binding on the Seller and the Purchaser
and shall constitute the "Completion Current Asset Statement" for all purposes
of this Agreement. The fees and costs of the Expert shall be paid as the
Expert shall determine.
