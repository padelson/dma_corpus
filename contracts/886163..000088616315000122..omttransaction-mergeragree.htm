applicable, shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive, subject to Section 2.9 and Article VIII, the applicable
Merger Consideration and Additional Cash Consideration with respect to such

Immediately prior to, but contingent upon, the Merger 1 Effective Time, any
share of Company Capital Stock that is unvested shall become fully vested and
any rights of repurchase or forfeiture applicable to any such share shall
lapse.

(c) Company Warrants. Subject to Section 2.9 and Article VIII, each share of

product of the exercise price per share of Series B Preferred Stock subject or

the product of the Stock Consideration Ratio times the exercise price per

"Warrant Merger Consideration"). The Warrant Merger Consideration shall
constitute the sole consideration payable in respect of a canceled Company

be made only to those Optionholders who have delivered to the Company prior to
Closing an executed consent agreement and release (the "Optionholder Consent
Agreement") in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A. The Option Payment shall
constitute the sole consideration payable in respect of all canceled Company
Options and no additional consideration shall be paid in respect of any
canceled Company Options. The Company shall take all necessary actions,
including providing any required notice to Optionholders or obtaining any
required consents from Optionholders, necessary to effect the transactions
described in this Section 2.8(d) and to terminate the Company Option Plan
effective at the Merger 1 Effective Time.

(e) Dissenting Shares.

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of
Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Merger 1 Effective
Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Mergers or
consented thereto in writing and who has exercised and perfected appraisal for
dissenters rights for such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
and has not effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal or dissenters rights
(collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or
represent the right to consideration for Company Capital Stock set forth in
Section 2.8(b), and the holder or holders of such shares shall be entitled
only to such rights as may be granted to such holder or holders in Section 262
of the DGCL.

(ii) At the Merger 1 Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. Notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 2.8(e)(i), if any holder of Dissenting Shares shall
effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such
holder's appraisal rights and dissenters rights under Section 262 of the DGCL,
or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not
entitled to relief provided under Section 262 of the DGCL, then, as of the
later of the Merger 1 Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such
holder's shares of Company Capital Stock shall automatically be converted into
and represent only the right to receive the consideration for Company Capital
Stock set forth in Section 2.8(b), without interest, upon surrender of the
certificate representing such shares in the manner provided in Section 2.9 or,
in the case of a lost, stolen, mutilated, defaced or destroyed certificate,
upon delivery of the affidavit, described in Section 2.11.

(f) Stock of Merger Sub 1. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub 1 issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger 1 Effective Time shall be
converted into one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock of the Intermediate Surviving Corporation and all such shares
together shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Intermediate Surviving Corporation.

(g) Stock of Merger Sub 2. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub 2 issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger 2 Effective Time shall be
converted into one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation and all such shares together shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

2.9 Surrender of Certificates.

(a) Parent to Provide Cash. Prior to or at the Merger 1 Effective Time, Parent
shall make available to the Surviving Corporation for exchange in accordance
with this Article II, the Cash Merger Consideration and Additional Cash
Consideration, calculated using the Additional Cash Merger Consideration
Inputs provided in the Closing Notice and the Stock Merger Consideration, in
exchange for Company Capital Stock, Company Options and Company Warrants;
provided, that Parent will promptly pay to the Surviving Corporation any
amounts by which the Merger Consideration increases due to Dissenting Shares
being later deemed to be converted as of the Merger 1 Effective Time as
provided in Section 2.8(e)(ii). No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on
any consideration payable to holders of Company Capital Stock pursuant to the
provisions of this Article II. All amounts payable to the holders of Company
Options shall be subject to all applicable withholding taxes and shall be paid
by the Surviving Corporation through its payroll (or, to the extent the
Optionholder is not employed by or providing services to the Surviving
Corporation, the Surviving Corporation shall pay such amounts to the employer
of such Optionholder to be paid to the Optionsholder through its payroll).

(b) Exchange Procedures. Prior to the Merger 1 Effective Time, the Company
shall mail to each holder of record (as of the Merger 1 Effective Time) of a
certificate or certificates or an instrument or instruments (the
"Certificates"), which immediately prior to the Merger 1 Effective Time will
represent outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock or Company Warrants
whose shares or Company Warrants will be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration and Additional Cash Consideration pursuant to Section
2.8: (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery of the
Merger Consideration and Additional Cash Consideration shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates to the Parent and shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as are reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Stockholders'
Representative) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration and Additional Cash
Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to Parent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of record of such
Certificates (unless such Certificates represent Dissenting Shares) shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount, without interest,
constituting the Merger Consideration and Additional Cash Consideration such
holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.8, less the pro rata
amount deemed contributed by such Company Equityholder to the Escrow Amount
and the Representative Reimbursement Amount and the Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, outstanding
Certificates (other than those representing Dissenting Shares, unless the
holder thereof loses its right to appraisal) will be deemed from and after the
Merger 1 Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence the right to
receive the Merger Consideration and Additional Cash Consideration into which
such securities shall have been so converted. Each Optionholder shall have
delivered to the Company an executed Optionholder Consent Agreement as of the
Closing, as required by Section 2.8(d).

(c) Required Withholding. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
payable or other payment pursuant to this Agreement to any Company
Equityholder or any other Person such amounts as are required to be deducted
or withheld therefrom under the Code or otherwise under any other applicable
Legal Requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and
timely paid to the appropriate Tax Authority, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made.

(d) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
none of Parent, the Intermediate Surviving Corporation, the Surviving
Corporation or any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of any
shares of Company Capital Stock for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.

2.10 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock. All consideration
paid upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Capital Stock in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Capital Stock,
and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the
Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Capital Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Merger 1 Effective Time. If, after the
Merger 1 Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this Article II.

2.11 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen, mutilated, defaced or destroyed, upon the making
of an affidavit of fact reasonably acceptable to Parent by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen, mutilated, defaced or destroyed, and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Surviving Corporation shall,
subject to Section 2.9(b), pay in exchange for such lost, stolen, mutilated,
defaced or destroyed Certificate the amount of Merger Consideration and
Additional Cash Consideration such Person would have been entitled to receive
had such Person surrendered such lost, stolen, mutilated, defaced or destroyed
Company Certificate to the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section 2.9(b).

2.12 Accredited/Unaccredited Investors.

(a) Promptly following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver
an investor questionnaire in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the
"Investor Questionnaire") to each Company Equityholder, and thereafter the
Company shall deliver the Investor Questionnaire to all Persons who become
Company Equityholders during the period between such date and the Merger 1
Effective Time and to collect and deliver to Parent prior to the Closing
accurately completed Investor Questionnaires from all such Persons. The
Investor Questionnaire shall include questions and representations relating to
the potential issuance of Parent Common Stock under this Agreement to such
Company Equityholder under Regulation D under the Securities Act, including
regarding such Company Equityholder's status as an "accredited investor" as
defined in Rule 501 under the Securities Act ("Accredited Investors").

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, any Company Equityholder who fails to
return a properly completed Investor Questionnaire within two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date or otherwise fails to demonstrate, to Parent's
reasonable satisfaction, its, his or her status as an Accredited Investor,
shall be deemed to not be an Accredited Investor.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be payable to Company Equityholders that are not
Accredited Investors in connection with payment of the Merger Consideration,
and each such Company Equityholder shall instead receive (if, when and to the
extent applicable) an additional cash payment in lieu thereof, which payment
shall reduce the amount of cash payable to the Company Equityholder that are
Accredited Investors on a dollar-for-dollar basis, and the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock that would have been paid to the Company Equityholders
that are not Accredited Investors shall instead be paid to the Company
Equityholders that are Accredited Investors pro rata, with the aggregate
amount of such increase being rounded up to the next whole share. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall any adjustment pursuant to this Section
2.12(c) increase the Cash Merger Consideration and Additional Cash
Consideration.

2.13 Legend. All certificates representing any shares of Parent Common Stock
that may be issued pursuant to this Agreement shall have a restrictive legend

the amount by which the Estimated Signing Date Net Cash Amount is greater or

Cash Adjustment Amount"), (2) the amount by which the Estimated Signing Date
Net Working Capital Amount is greater or less than the Signing Date Net
Working Capital Amount (such amount, the "Signing Date Net Working Capital

(b) Draft Closing Statement.

(i) As soon as practicable following the Merger 1 Effective Time, Parent may
cause the Surviving Corporation to prepare a report setting forth the actual
amounts of the Additional Cash Merger Consideration Inputs as of the date
hereof and the Merger 1 Effective Time, along with a summary showing in
reasonable detail the Surviving Corporation's calculation of such amounts (the
"Draft Closing Statement"). If it so elects to prepare a Draft Closing

Stockholders' Representative not later than sixty (60) days following the
Closing Date.

(ii) The Draft Closing Statement shall also set forth the calculation of (1)

Adjustment Amount, (3) the amount by which the Closing Date Net Working
Capital is less than the Net Working Capital Target, if applicable (such

amount by which the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital Deficiency

(c) Review by Stockholders' Representative. As soon as practicable, but in any
event within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Draft Closing Statement, the
Stockholders' Representative shall provide to Parent a written report

including the calculation of the Signing Date Net Cash Adjustment Amount, the
Signing Date Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount, the Closing Date Net

Closing Statement; provided, that the Stockholders' Representative shall treat
all such information as confidential information of Parent. All other items on
the Draft Closing Statement which have not been cited in the Stockholders'
Representative's Report shall be deemed accepted by the Stockholders'
Representative. Failure by the Stockholders' Representative to object to the
Draft Closing Statement within such period shall be deemed to be the
Stockholders' Representative's acceptance of the entire Draft Closing
Statement and all items therein.

(d) Agreement on Closing Statement.

(i) Within fifteen (15) days of the receipt by Parent of the Stockholders'
Representative's Report, the Stockholders' Representative and Parent shall
endeavor in good faith to agree on any matters in dispute. Any matter that
Parent chooses not to dispute on the Stockholders' Representative's Report
within such fifteen (15) day period shall be deemed accepted by Parent.

(ii) If Parent and the Stockholders' Representative are unable to agree on any
remaining matters in dispute within fifteen (15) days after Parent's receipt
of the Stockholders' Representative's Report, then the matters in dispute will
be submitted for resolution to the San Diego office of a nationally recognized
certified public accounting firm that has not performed accounting, tax or
auditing services for Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates during the previous five (5) years, as may be mutually acceptable
to Parent and the Stockholder's Representative (any of the foregoing selected
to resolve the dispute, an "Appraiser"),which shall within thirty (30) days of
such submission determine and issue a written report to the Stockholders'
Representative and Parent upon such disputed items (in no event enlarging or
adding any new or additional item to those set forth in the Stockholders'
Representative's Report and not accepted by Parent), and such written decision
shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto. The Stockholders'
Representative and Parent shall cooperate reasonably with each other and each
other's representatives to enable the Appraiser to render a written decision
as promptly as possible. The fees and expenses of the Appraiser shall be borne
by the Stockholders' Representative and Parent in inverse proportion to their
respective success on the merits and such allocation of fees and expenses
shall be calculated by the Appraiser and shall be final and binding on the
parties. At any time, Parent and the Stockholders' Representative may agree to
settle any objections raised in the Stockholders' Representative's Report,
which agreement shall be in writing and binding upon each of Parent and the
Stockholders' Representative with respect to the subject matter of any such
objection so resolved.

any matters in dispute pursuant to Sections 2.14(c), 2.14(d)(i) and/or

Closing Statement shall have the legal effect of an arbitral award and shall
be final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto.

(e) Adjustment to Merger Consideration.

(i) Signing Date Net Cash Adjustment. Subject to Section 2.14(e)(iv), if the
Closing Statement shows that there is a negative Signing Date Net Cash
Adjustment Amount, then the Stockholder's Representative shall, within five
(5) Business Days after the determination of the Closing Statement, instruct
the Escrow Agent to release to Parent from the Escrow Account an amount equal
to the absolute value of the Signing Date Net Cash Adjustment Amount in
immediately available funds by check or by wire transfer to such bank account
or accounts as Parent may specify. Subject to Section 2.14(e)(iv), if the
Closing Statement shows that there is a positive Signing Date Net Cash
Adjustment, then Parent shall, within five (5) Business Days after the
determination of the Closing Statement, pay to the Escrow Agent an amount
equal to the Signing Date Net Cash Adjustment Amount in immediately available
funds and the Escrow Agent shall release such funds to the Company
Equityholders on a pro rata basis.

(ii) Signing Date Net Working Capital Adjustment. Subject to Section
2.14(e)(iv), if the Closing Statement shows that there is a negative Signing
Date Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount, then the Stockholder's
Representative shall, within five (5) Business Days after the determination of
the Closing Statement, instruct the Escrow Agent to release to Parent from the
Escrow Account an amount equal to the absolute value of the Signing Date Net
Working Capital Adjustment Amount in immediately available funds by check or
by wire transfer to such bank account or accounts as Parent may specify.
Subject to Section 2.14(e)(iv), if the Closing Statement shows that there is a
positive Signing Date Cash Adjustment, then Parent shall, within five (5)
Business Days after the determination of the Closing Statement, pay to the
Escrow Agent an amount equal to the Signing Date Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount in immediately available funds and the Escrow Agent shall
release such funds to the Company Equityholders on a pro rata basis; provided
that all amounts payable to the holders of Company Options shall be subject to
all applicable withholding Taxes and shall be paid by the Escrow Agent to be
paid by the Surviving Corporation through its payroll (or, to the extent the
Optionholder is not employed by or providing services to the Surviving
Corporation, the Surviving Corporation shall pay such amounts to the employer
of such Optionholder to be paid to the Optionholder though its payroll).

(iii) Closing Date Net Working Capital Deficiency. Subject to Section
2.14(e)(iv), if the Closing Statement shows that there is a Closing Date Net
Working Capital Deficiency Amount, then the Stockholder's Representative
shall, within five (5) Business Days after the determination of the Closing
Statement, instruct the Escrow Agent to release to Parent from the Escrow
Account an amount equal to the absolute value of the Closing Date Net Working
Capital Deficiency Amount (but only to the extent that the absolute value of
the Closing Date Net Working Capital Deficiency Amount is greater than the
absolute value of the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital Deficiency
Amount) in immediately available funds by check or by wire transfer to such
bank account or accounts as Parent may specify. Subject to Section
2.14(e)(iv), if the Closing Statement shows that there is a Closing Date Net
Working Capital Deficiency True-Up Amount, then Parent shall, within five (5)
Business Days after the determination of the Closing Statement, pay to the
Escrow Agent an amount equal to the Closing Date Net Working Capital
Deficiency True-Up Amount in immediately available funds and the Escrow Agent
shall release such funds to the Company Equityholders on a pro rata basis;
provided that all amounts payable to the holders of Company Options shall be
subject to all applicable withholding Taxes and shall be paid by the Escrow
Agent to be paid by the Surviving Corporation through its payroll (or, to the
extent the Optionholder is not employed by or providing services to the
Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation shall pay such amounts to the
employer of such Optionholder to be paid to the Optionholder though its
payroll).

(iv) The required payments, if any, set forth in Sections 2.14(e)(i) through
2.14(e)(iii) shall be netted against each other so that only one payment
(either from the Escrow Fund to the Parent or from the Parent to the Company
Equityholders through the Escrow Agent, as applicable) shall be made. Any
payment pursuant to this Section 2.14 shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Merger Consideration for Tax purposes to the greatest extent permitted by law.
For clarity, the parties intend that any increases in the Company's Cash or
the Company's Net Working Capital between the date hereof and the Merger 1
Effective Time shall accrue to the benefit of Parent.

2.15 No Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be
issued to the Company Equityholders under this Agreement. In lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, each Company Equityholder shall
receive an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the
product of (a) the fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock to which such
Company Equityholder would otherwise be entitled (after aggregating all
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such Company
Equityholder), multiplied by (b) the applicable Parent Stock Price.

2.16 Cash Amounts. The aggregate cash amount payable to any Company
Equityholder pursuant to this Article II shall be rounded to the nearest whole
cent ($0.01).

and directors of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub,
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub, any other actions and things
to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the
rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Mergers.

time or both) or give rise to any right or license of any third party relating
to the Company Intellectual Property or the Company Patent Rights. The
Contracts pursuant to which rights are licensed under each Inbound License
Agreement are fully assignable to the Surviving Corporation and shall be
exercisable by the Surviving Corporation on and immediately after the Closing
to the same extent as by the Company or OMT, LLC, as applicable, prior to the
Closing. Except as set forth on Section 3.8(c)(i) of the Disclosure Letter,
neither the Company nor OMT, LLC has granted to any third party any exclusive
rights under any Intellectual Property owned by or exclusively licensed to the
Company or OMT, LLC. All milestones and other conditions set forth in any
Inbound License Agreement that have been required to be satisfied in order for
the Company or OMT, LLC to retain any rights granted under such Inbound
License Agreement have been timely satisfied and all such rights are, to the
Company's or OMT LLC's Knowledge, valid, enforceable and remain in full force
and effect. All Outbound License Agreements can be assigned or otherwise
transferred to the Surviving Corporation at Closing.

(h) Except as disclosed in Section 3.8(d) of the Disclosure Letter, there is
no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company or OMT, LLC, threatened
opposition, interference, reexamination, review, injunction, claim, suit,
action, citation, summon, subpoena, investigation (by the International Trade
Commission or otherwise), complaint, arbitration, mediation, demand, decree or
other dispute, disagreement, proceeding or claim, in each case before a court
or other governmental or arbitral tribunal (collectively "Disputes")
challenging the legality, validity, enforceability or ownership of any of the
Intellectual Property or alleging any misuse of any of the Company Patent
Rights listed on Section 3.8(a) of the Disclosure Letter or any Disputes that
would (pursuant to the terms of an Inbound License Agreement) give rise to any
set-off against the payments due to the Company or OMT, LLC under such Inbound
License Agreement for the use of the related Intellectual Property. For
clarity, patent prosecution shall not be deemed a Dispute. Except as disclosed
in Section 3.8(d) of the Disclosure Letter, there are no Disputes pending, or,
to the Knowledge of the Company or OMT LLC, threatened by or with any Person
against the Company or OMT, LLC involving any of the Company Products. The
Intellectual Property listed on Section 3.8(a) of the Disclosure Letter and
any other material Intellectual Property owned by or licensed to the Company
or OMT, LLC are not subject to any outstanding injunction, judgment, order,
decree, ruling, settlement or other disposition as the result of a Dispute
(provided the foregoing representation is made to Company's and OMT LLC's
Knowledge with respect to Intellectual Property licensed to the Company).
Except as set forth in Section 3.8(c)(ii) of the Disclosure Letter, no other
Persons have any right, title or interest in the Company Intellectual Property
or any right to use such Company Intellectual Property, or any option,
consent, right of first or last offer or to a license to use such Company
Intellectual Property. Neither the Company, OMT, LLC and/or any of their
respective Subsidiaries has (i) transferred ownership (including any right of
joint ownership) of any Company Intellectual Property to any other Person or
(ii) permitted either of the Company's OMT, LLC's and/or any of their
respective Subsidiaries' rights in such Company Intellectual Property to enter
into the public domain. There are no agreements to which the Company, OMT, LLC
and/or any of their respective Subsidiaries is a party under which any U.S.,
state or local or foreign government or any agency or department thereof,
acquires rights with respect to any Company Intellectual Property.

(i) There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company or OMT, LLC,
threatened, and no event has occurred or circumstance exists (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) of which the Company or OMT, LLC has
Knowledge that would reasonably be expected to give rise to or serve as a
basis for any, action, suit or proceeding, or any investigation or claim by
any Person to which the Company, OMT, LLC, or to the Knowledge of the Company
or OMT, LLC, any counterparty or any sublicensee, in either case is or could
be a party, that claims that the Company Intellectual Property or the
manufacture, use, marketing, sale, offer for sale, importation or distribution
of any Company Product by the applicable counterparty, or any affiliate or
sublicensee of such counterparty, pursuant to and in compliance with the
License Agreements infringes on any Patent Right or other Intellectual
Property of any other Person or constitutes misappropriation of any other
Person's trade secrets or other Intellectual Property. Neither the Company nor
OMT, LLC has received any written communication containing an offer to license
to the Company or OMT, LLC, or a request that the Company or OMT, LLC consider
whether it wishes to obtain a license, under any Patent Right owned by a third
party. To the Knowledge of the Company or OMT, LLC, there are no pending
patent applications owned by any other Person that, if a patent were to issue
thereon, would limit or prohibit, in any material respect, the manufacture,
use or sale of any Company Product by the Company or OMT, LLC, any
counterparty or any sublicensee.

(j) Except as disclosed in Section 3.8(f) of the Disclosure Letter, to the
Knowledge of the Company or OMT, LLC, there is no Person infringing, violating
or misappropriating any of the Intellectual Property owned by or exclusively
licensed to the Company or OMT, LLC, nor has the Company or OMT, LLC received
any notice under any of the License Agreements of infringement of any of such
Intellectual Property.

(k) The Company, OMT, LLC and/or any of their respective Subsidiaries and, to
the Knowledge of the Company or OMT, LLC, each counterparty have taken all
reasonable precautions to protect the Company Intellectual Property and the
secrecy, confidentiality and/or value of any Trade Secrets of the Company and
OMT, LLC, and to the Knowledge of the Company or OMT, LLC there have been no
unauthorized disclosures of any Trade Secrets of the Company or OMT, LLC. The
Company, OMT, LLC and/or any of their respective Subsidiaries has a policy
requiring each current and former employee, consultant and contractor (a
"Developer") to execute work-for-hire, invention assignment, proprietary
information, and confidentiality agreements (as applicable) to protect the
Company Intellectual Property. To the Knowledge of the Company or OMT, LLC, no
party to any such agreement is in material breach thereof and neither the
Company nor OMT, LLC has taken any action to enforce such agreement.

(l) To the Knowledge of the Company or OMT, LLC, the Company Intellectual
Property and the Company Patent Rights constitute all of the Intellectual
Property necessary for the manufacture, use or sale of the Company Products in
the course of the Company Business as conducted by the Company.

(i) The Company or OMT, LLC, as applicable, owns exclusively, all right, title
and interest (including the sole right to enforce) in and to all Company
Intellectual Property free and clear of all Liens or otherwise has an
exclusive license to such Company Intellectual Property.

(ii) Except with respect to the License Agreements, none of the Company
Intellectual Property has been licensed to any Person other than the Company,
OMT, LLC and/or any of their respective Subsidiaries. There are not, and it is
reasonably expected that after the Closing there will not be, any restrictions
on the Company's, OMT, LLC's or their Subsidiaries' right to sell Company
Products owned by the Company or OMT, LLC, or to transfer or license any
Company Intellectual Property, in each case solely to the extent and in the
same manner they are sold, transferred or licensed in the Company Business.

(m) No legal opinion concerning or with respect to any third party
intellectual property rights relating to the Company Products, including any
freedom-to-operate, product clearance, patentability or right-to-use opinion,
has been delivered to the Company or OMT, LLC.

(n) Except as set forth on Section 3.8(j) of the Disclosure Letter, at no time
during the conception of, or reduction to practice of any Company Intellectual
Property was any inventor to such Company Intellectual Property operating
under any grants from any Governmental Entity or private source, performing
research sponsored by any Governmental Entity or private source or subject to
any employment agreement or invention assignment or nondisclosure agreement or
other obligation with any third party, that, in each case, does or would
reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the Company's or OMT,
LLC's rights in such Company Intellectual Property.

3.9 Compliance; Permits.

(a) Compliance. The Company is not, nor has it been in conflict with, or in
default or in violation of, any Legal Requirement applicable to the Company or
by which the Company or any of its respective businesses or properties is
bound or affected, except for those conflicts, defaults or violations that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not cause the Company to lose any
material benefit or incur any material Liability or that would otherwise have
a material impact on the Company. The Company has not received any notice of
or been charged with any material default or violation of any such Legal
Requirements. There is no judgment, injunction, order or decree binding upon
the Company which has or would reasonably be expected to have the effect of
prohibiting or materially impairing the Company Business. The Company has not
received notice of any pending or threatened claim, suit, proceeding, hearing,
enforcement, audit, investigation, arbitration, or other action from the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"), the National Institutes of Health within
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the "NIH"), the United
States Department of Agriculture ("USDA"), or other Governmental Entity
alleging that any operation or activity of the Company is in violation of any
applicable Legal Requirement.

(b) Permits. The Company holds all permits, licenses, variances, clearances,
consents, registrations, listings, exemptions, authorizations, and approvals
("Permits") from Governmental Entities, including the FDA, NIH, and USDA, that
are required to conduct the Company Business (collectively, "Company
Permits"). The Company has fulfilled and performed all of their material
obligations with respect to the Company Permits, and no event has occurred
which allows, or after notice or lapse of time would allow, suspension,
cancellation, revocation, or material adverse modification thereof or results
in any other material impairment of the rights of the holder of any Company
Permit. As of the date hereof, no suspension, cancellation, revocation or
material adverse modification of any of the Company Permits is pending or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, threatened. Each of the Company Permits is in
full force and effect, and the Company is in material compliance with the
terms of the Company Permits.

3.10 Litigation. There are no claims, suits, actions, proceedings or
investigations of any nature pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company or
OMT, LLC, threatened in writing against the Company, OMT, LLC or the assets or
properties of the Company, before any court, governmental department,
commission, agency, instrumentality or authority, or any arbitrator that seeks
to restrain or enjoin the consummation of the Transactions or which would
reasonably be expected, either singularly or in the aggregate with all such
claims, actions or proceedings, to result in a material Liability to the
Company or OMT, LLC. There is no legal proceeding brought by the Company or
OMT, LLC currently pending or that the Company or OMT, LLC intends to
initiate.

3.11 Brokers' and Finders' Fees; Fees and Expenses. Except as set forth on the
Company Disclosure Letter, the Company has not incurred, nor will it incur,
directly or indirectly, any Liability for brokerage or finders' fees or
agents' commissions or any similar charges in connection with this Agreement
and the Transactions.

3.12 Employee Benefit Plans.

(a) Schedule. Section 3.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a
list of each Company Employee Plan. Neither the Company nor any ERISA
Affiliate has any commitment to establish, adopt or enter into any new Company
Employee Plan, to materially modify any Company Employee Plan (except to the
extent required by law or to conform any such Company Employee Plan to the
requirements of any applicable Legal Requirements or as required by this
Agreement), or, except as contemplated in this Agreement, to terminate any
Company Employee Plan.

(b) Documents. The Company has provided to Parent correct and complete copies
of: (i) all documents embodying each Company Employee Plan, including all
amendments thereto and all related trust documents, administrative service
agreements, group annuity contracts, group insurance contracts, and policies
pertaining to fiduciary liability insurance covering the fiduciaries for each
Company Employee Plan; (ii) the most recent annual actuarial valuations, if
any, prepared for each Company Employee Plan; (iii) the three most recent
annual reports (Form Series 5500 and all schedules and financial statements
attached thereto), if any, required under ERISA or the Code in connection with
each Company Employee Plan; (iv) if the Company Employee Plan is funded, the
most recent annual and periodic accounting of Company Employee Plan assets;
(v) the most recent summary plan description together with the summary or
summaries of material modifications thereto, if any, required under ERISA with
respect to each Company Employee Plan; (vi) the most recent IRS determination
or opinion letters; (vii) all non-routine material correspondence to or from
any governmental agency in the last three (3) years relating to any Company
Employee Plan; and (viii) the three (3) most recent plan years' discrimination
tests for each Company Employee Plan for which such test is required.

(c) Benefit Plan Compliance. In all material respects, each Company Employee
Plan has been established and maintained in accordance with its terms and in
compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements, including but not limited
to ERISA and the Code. Any Company Employee Plan intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code and each trust intended to qualify under
Section 501(a) of the Code has either applied for, prior to the expiration of
the requisite period under applicable tax regulations issued by the IRS
("Treasury Regulations") or IRS pronouncements, or obtained a favorable
determination, notification, advisory and/or opinion letter, as applicable, as
to its qualified status from the IRS or still has a remaining period of time
under applicable Treasury Regulations or IRS pronouncements in which to apply
for such letter and to make any amendments necessary to obtain a favorable
determination. For each Company Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code, there has been no event, condition or
circumstance that has adversely affected or could reasonably be expected to
adversely affect such qualified status. No "prohibited transaction," within
the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Sections 406 and 407 of ERISA, and
not otherwise exempt under Section 408 of ERISA, has occurred with respect to
any Company Employee Plan that would reasonably be expected to result in any
material Liability. There are no current actions, suits or claims pending, or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, or threatened in writing (other than routine
claims for benefits) against any Company Employee Plan, against the assets of
any Company Employee Plan or against the Company or any ERISA Affiliate in
respect of any Company Employee Plan. There are no material audits, inquiries
or proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened in
writing by any governmental entity with respect to any Company Employee Plan.
Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate is subject to any penalty or tax
with respect to any Company Employee Plan under Section 502(i) of ERISA or
Sections 4975 through 4980 of the Code. The Company and each ERISA Affiliate
have timely made or otherwise provided for in all material respects all
contributions and other payments required by and due under the terms of each
Company Employee Plan.

(d) No Pension or Welfare Plans. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate
has ever maintained, established, sponsored, participated in, or contributed
to, any (i) Pension Plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412
of the Code; (ii) Multiemployer Plan; (iii) "multiple employer plan" as
defined in ERISA or the Code; or (iv) a "funded welfare plan" within the
meaning of Section 419 of the Code. No Company Employee Plan provides health
benefits that are not fully insured through an insurance contract.

(e) No Post-Employment Obligations. No Company Employee Plan provides, or
reflects or represents any Liability to provide post-termination or retiree
welfare benefits to any person for any reason, except as may be required by
COBRA or other applicable statute.

(f) Effect of Transaction.

(v) Except as set forth on Section 3.12(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter or
as contemplated by Section 2.8(d) hereof, neither the execution of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the Transactions will (either alone or upon
the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) constitute an event
under any Company Employee Plan or otherwise that will or may result in any
payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of
indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to
fund benefits with respect to any Employee or other Person.

(vi) No payment or benefit that could be received (whether in cash, property,
the vesting of property or otherwise) as a result of or in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions (either alone or upon the occurrence of any
additional or subsequent events) or by any of the other agreements referenced
herein, by any person who is a "disqualified individual" (as defined in Code
Section 280G and the regulations thereunder) could be characterized as a
parachute payment within the meaning of Code Section 280G(b)(2). There is no
contract, agreement, plan or arrangement to which the Company or any ERISA
Affiliates is a party or by which it is bound to compensate any Employee,
officer, director or consultant for excise taxes paid pursuant to Section 4999
of the Code or taxes pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.

(g) Employment Matters. The Company is in compliance in all respects with all
applicable foreign, federal, state and local laws respecting labor,
employment, employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, workers'
compensation, occupational safety, Tax withholding, prohibited discrimination,
equal employment, employee safety and health, and wages and hours. The Company
is in compliance with all United States immigration laws and has a valid Form
I-9 (Employment Eligibility Verification) on file for each Employee. The
Company has properly classified all individuals providing services to the
Company as employees or non-employees for all relevant purposes and the
Company has no liabilities for the payment of taxes, fines, penalties or other
amounts, however designated, for any failure to properly classify such
individuals.

(h) Labor. The Company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement
or union contract with respect to Employees. No collective bargaining
agreement is currently being negotiated by the Company and the Company has not
experienced any attempt by organized labor to cause the Company to comply with
or conform to demands of organized labor relating to its employees. There is
no labor dispute, strike or work stoppage against the Company pending or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, threatened. Neither of the Company, nor any of
its representatives, Employees, officers or directors has committed any unfair
labor practice in connection with the operation of the respective businesses
of the Company. There are no actions, suits, claims, labor disputes or
grievances pending, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, relating
to any labor, safety or discrimination matters involving any Employee,
including charges of unfair labor practices or discrimination complaints.

(i) International Employee Plans. Except as set forth on Section 3.12(i) of
the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company does not have, nor has it ever had,
the obligation to maintain, establish, sponsor, participate in, or contribute
to any International Employee Plan.

(j) Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plans. Each Company Employee Plan,
Employee Agreement or other contract, plan, program, agreement, or arrangement
maintained by the Company that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"
(within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) complies in form with
and has been operated in good faith compliance since January 1, 2005 and in
compliance since January 1, 2009, in each case, with Section 409A of the Code
and the then applicable guidance issued by the IRS thereunder.

(k) Section 3.12(k) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth for each
current employee or independent contractor of the Company, a true and complete
list of the individual's title or position, current annual base compensation
rate (or consulting rate), date of hire, target bonus opportunity or
commission opportunity, a description of the other benefits provided to each
such individual, whether such individual is employed full-time or part-time,
whether such individual is currently on leave, and such individual's
classification as an employee or consultant.

3.13 Real Property. The Company does not own, or has ever owned, any real
property. Section 3.13 of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of
the real property currently leased, subleased or licensed by or from the
Company (the "Leased Real Property"). The Company has provided or otherwise
made available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of all leases,
lease guaranties, subleases, agreements for the leasing, use or occupancy of
the Leased Real Property, including all amendments, terminations and
modifications thereof (the "Leases"). The Company has good and marketable
title to the leasehold estates in all Leases in each case free and clear of
all Liens, except for Liens incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice which would not impair the Company's use of such
property in any material way. The Company has no reason to believe that such
title would not be insurable subject to customary exceptions. There is not,
under any of the Leases, any material default by the Company, nor, to the
Knowledge of the Company, by any other party thereto, and no event has
occurred that with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both would
constitute a material default thereunder. There are no other parties occupying
the Leased Real Property other than the Company. The Leased Real Property is
in good repair and operating condition (normal wear and tear excepted). Each
of the Leases is valid and enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject
to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization,
moratorium and other laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and
general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or
at law). With respect to those Leases that were assigned or subleased to the
Company by a third party, all necessary consents to such assignments or
subleases have been obtained.

3.14 Assets. With respect to the material machinery, equipment, furniture,
fixtures and other tangible property and assets purported to be owned, leased
or used by the Company or OMT, LLC, each the Company and OMT, LLC has good,
legal and marketable title to all such assets free and clear of all Liens,
except Permitted Liens, and such assets are in good repair and operating
condition (normal wear and tear excepted). All such items of tangible property
and assets which, individually or in the aggregate, are material to the
operation of the respective businesses of the Company and OMT, LLC are
suitable for the purposes used for the operation of such businesses. For
purposes of clarity, this Section 3.14 does not relate to real property (such
items being the subject of Section 3.13) or Intellectual Property (such items
being the subject of Section 3.8).

3.15 Inventory. All inventory of the Company, whether or not reflected in the
Company Balance Sheet and LLC Balance Sheet, consists of a quality and
quantity usable and salable in the ordinary course of the Company's Business
consistent with past practice, except for obsolete, damaged (which, in the
case of animals that are inventory, may mean sick or dead), defective or slow-
moving items that have been written off or written down to fair market value
or for which adequate reserves have been established. All such inventory is
owned by the Company free and clear of all Liens, and no inventory is held on
a consignment basis. The quantities of each item of inventory (whether raw
materials, work-in-process or finished goods) are not excessive, but are
reasonable in the present circumstances of the Company.

3.16 Environmental Matters. The Company is not, nor at any relevant time has
been, in any material respect in violation of any applicable Environmental Law
(as defined below). The Company holds, to the extent legally required, all
Permits required pursuant to Environmental Laws that are material to the
operation of the Company's Business taken as a whole ("Environmental
Permits"). The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the
terms of the Environmental Permits. The Company has not received any written
notice alleging any claim, violation of or Liability under any Environmental
Law which has not heretofore been cured or for which there is any remaining
material Liability. For the purposes of this Section 3.16, (a) "Environmental
Laws" shall mean all applicable Legal Requirements relating to pollution or
protection of the environment, including laws and regulations relating to
Releases (as defined below) or threatened Releases of Hazardous Materials (as
defined below), (b) "Hazardous Materials" shall mean chemicals or substances
which are designated by a Governmental Entity as a "pollutant", "contaminant",
"toxic", "hazardous" or "radioactive", including friable asbestos, petroleum
and petroleum products or any fraction thereof, and (c) "Release" shall have
the same meaning as under the Comprehensive Environmental Response
Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. Section 9601(22). To the
Knowledge of the Company: (i) all real property now or previously owned or
leased by the Company and all surface water, groundwater and soil associated
with or adjacent to such property, is free of any chemicals, pollutants,
contaminants, wastes, toxic substances or material environmental contamination
of any nature; (ii) none of the real property now or previously owned or
leased by the Company contains any underground storage tanks, asbestos,
equipment using PCBs or underground injection wells; and (iii) none of the
real property now or previously owned or leased by the Company contains any
septic tanks in which process wastewater or any chemicals, pollutants,
contaminants, wastes or toxic substance have been released. To the Knowledge
of the Company, any location to which the Company has sent or otherwise
arranged for the disposal of any of its Hazardous Materials is not the subject
of any investigation or remediation activity under applicable environmental
laws, and the Company does not have any material Liabilities arising under any
applicable Environmental Laws (including any Liabilities arising from any
predecessor company, entity or Person or any Liabilities assumed by the
Company through any agreement or by operation of law). The parties agree that
the only representation and warranties related to Environmental Laws,
Environmental Permits, and Hazardous Materials are those included in this
Section 3.16 of this Agreement.

3.17 Contracts.

(a) Material Contracts. For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Material
Contract" shall mean any Contract:

$50,000 on its face in any given year in any individual case.

For purposes of clarity, no Company Employee Plans set forth in Section
3.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter under which future expenditures
required to be made by the Company will not exceed $50,000 in any given year,
shall be considered a Company Material Contract.

(b) Schedule. Section 3.17 of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a list
of all Company Material Contracts to which the Company or OMT, LLC is a party.
The Company has made available to Parent a true and complete copy of each
Company Material Contract. Unless otherwise noted in Section 3.17(a)(vii) of
the Company Disclosure Letter, all Company Material Contracts listed in
Section 3.17(a)(vii) of the Company Disclosure Letter may be terminated by the
Company or OMT, LLC at will on no more than thirty (30) days' notice without
material Liability or financial obligation to the Company or OMT, LLC.

(c) No Breach. All Company Material Contracts are in full force and effect
(except for those provisions thereof that have terminated or expired in
accordance with the terms of such Company Material Contracts) and constitute
legal, valid and binding agreements of the Company or OMT, LLC, enforceable in
accordance with their terms against the Company or OMT, LLC, as applicable,
and, to the Company's or OMT LLC's Knowledge, against the other parties
thereto, except in each case (i) as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other laws
affecting the rights of creditors generally and general equitable principles
(whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), and (ii) as the
remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable
relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of a court
of competent jurisdiction before which any proceeding may be brought. Neither
the Company, OMT, LLC nor, to the Knowledge of the Company or OMT, LLC, any
other party to any Company Material Contract, has violated any provision of,
or committed or failed to perform any act which, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both would constitute a default under the provisions of, any
Company Material Contract, except in each case for those violations and
defaults which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to be material to the Company taken as a whole (after giving effect
to the LLC Consolidation). Neither the Company nor OMT, LLC has waived any of
its rights under any Material Contract.

3.18 Regulatory Compliance.

(a) The operation of the Company Business, including the manufacture, import,
export, testing, development, processing, packaging, labeling, storage,

requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to

individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub
1 and Merger Sub 2 and no other corporate or other proceedings or actions on

duly executed and delivered by Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 and,
assuming due execution and delivery by the Company and, with respect to
Article VIII only, the Stockholders' Representative, constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of Parent, enforceable against Parent, Merger Sub 1 and

limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization,
moratorium and other laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and
general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or
at law), and (B) as the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and
other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to
the discretion of a court of competent jurisdiction before which any
proceeding may be brought.

Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 does not, and performance and compliance of this
Agreement by Parent, and the consummation by Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger

party under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment,
acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien on any of
the properties or assets of Parent, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 (other than a
Permitted Lien) pursuant to any material Contract to which Parent, Merger Sub
1, Merger Sub 2 is a party, except in each of the foregoing clauses (ii) and
(iii) as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on

of, or registration, declaration, filing or registration with, or notification
to, any Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or made by Parent in

conflict with, or in default or in violation of, any Legal Requirement
applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or by which Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses or properties is bound
or affected, except for those conflicts, defaults or violations that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not cause Parent to lose any material
benefit or incur any material Liability. Parent has not received any written
notice of or been charged with any material default or violation of any such
Legal Requirements. There is no judgment, injunction, order or decree binding
upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries which has or would reasonably be
expected to have the effect of prohibiting or materially impairing the
businesses conducted by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof or the acquisition of material property by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries.

Merger Sub 2 or any of Parent's other Subsidiaries, or the assets or
properties of Parent, Merger Sub 1, or Merger Sub 2, before any court,
governmental department, commission, agency, instrumentality or authority, or
any arbitrator that seeks to restrain or enjoin the consummation of the
Transactions or which would reasonably be expected, either singularly or in
the aggregate with all such claims, actions or proceedings, to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the ability of Parent, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 to
perform their respective obligations under this Agreement or consummate the
Transactions, nor, to Parent's knowledge, is there any reasonable basis
therefor, or any facts, threats, claims or allegations that would reasonably
be expected to result in any such threatened or pending action, suit,
proceeding or investigation.

through the date of this Agreement. The SEC Reports complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder when filed. As of their respective dates, the SEC
Reports did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

4.7 Sufficiency of Cash and Parent Common Stock. Parent has sufficient cash
on hand or other sources of immediately available funds to enable it to make
payment of the Cash Merger Consideration and a sufficient number of authorized
but unissued shares of Parent Common Stock to issue the Stock Merger
Consideration and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

4.8 Qualification as Reorganization. Neither Parent, Merger Sub 1 nor Merger

each of the Company and Parent may make internal announcements to its

6.4 Reasonable Best Efforts.

(w) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, each of the
parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Mergers and the other Transactions, including using
reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all
actions reasonably necessary to cause the conditions precedent to the other
party's obligations to close set forth in Article VII to be satisfied, (ii)
the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents,
approvals, waiting period expirations or terminations, orders, and
authorizations from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary
registrations, declarations and filings (including registrations, declarations
and filings with Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking of all
reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid any suit, claim, action,
investigation or proceeding by any Governmental Entity, (iii) the obtaining of
all Necessary Consents, (iv) the defending of any suits, claims, actions,
investigations or proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, including seeking to
have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other
Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, and (v) the execution or delivery of
any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions, and to
fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees to make any appropriate
filings of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to HSR Act with respect to
the Transactions as promptly as practicable, and in any event within five (5)
business days after the execution of this Agreement (unless a later date is
mutually agreed between the parties), and to supply as promptly as practicable
and advisable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to take all other actions necessary to
cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under
the HSR Act as soon as practicable; provided that Parent and the Company shall
split equally the filing and/or related fees associated with any filing
related to the HSR Act.

(x) Each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection with the efforts
referenced in Section 6.4(a) to obtain all necessary actions or nonactions,
waivers, consents, approvals, waiting period expirations or terminations,
orders, and authorizations from Governmental Entities for the Transactions
under the HSR Act or any other antitrust law, (i) cooperate in all respects
and consult with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in
connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding
initiated by a private party under any antitrust law, including by allowing
the other party to have a reasonable opportunity to review in advance and
comment on drafts of filings and submissions; (ii) promptly inform the other
party of any communication received by such Party from, or given by such party
to, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "DOJ"), the
Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") or any other Governmental Entity with
respect to any antitrust law, by promptly providing copies to the other party
of any such written communications, and of any material communication received
or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party under any
antitrust law, in each case regarding any of the Transactions provided,
however, that materials may be redacted (A) to remove references concerning
the valuation of Parent, the Company, OMT, LLC or any of their Subsidiaries,
(B) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (C) as necessary
to address reasonable privilege, confidentiality or compliance concerns; and
(iii) permit the other party to review in advance any communication that it
gives to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting, substantive
telephone call or conference with, the DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental
Entity with respect to the subject matter of this Section 6.4(b), or, in
connection with any proceeding by a private party under any antitrust law,
with any other Person (provided, however, that materials may be redacted (A)
to remove references concerning the valuation of Parent, the Company, OMT, LLC
or any of their Subsidiaries, (B) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements, and (C) as necessary to address reasonable privilege,
confidentiality, or compliance concerns), and to the extent permitted by the
DOJ, the FTC or any other applicable Governmental Entity or other Person with
respect to the subject matter of this Section 6.4(b), give the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate in any in-person meetings with the DOJ,
the FTC or any other Governmental Entity or other Person with respect to the
subject matter of this Section 6.4(b). Parent shall, on behalf of the parties,
control and lead all communications and strategy relating to the antitrust
laws (provided that the Company and OMT, LLC are not constrained from
complying with applicable laws), provided, further, that the parties shall
consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views
of one another, regarding the form and content of any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of either party in connection with proceedings under
or relating to any antitrust law prior to their submission. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event will Parent be
obligated to propose or agree to accept any undertaking or condition, to enter
into any consent decree, to make any divestiture, to accept any operational
restriction, or take any other action that, in the reasonable judgment of
Parent, could be expected to limit the right of Parent to own or operate all
or any portion of their respective businesses or assets. With regard to the
DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental Entity, neither the Company, OMT, LLC
nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall, without Parent's written
consent (which is to be within Parent's sole discretion), discuss or commit to
any divestiture transaction, or discuss or commit to alter their businesses or
commercial practices in any way, or otherwise take or commit to take any
action that limits Parent's freedom of action with respect to, or Parent
ability to retain any of the businesses, product lines or assets of the
Company or otherwise receive the full benefits of this Agreement. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, nothing in this
Agreement shall obligate Parent to litigate or otherwise contest any
litigation or order or the entry of any order seeking to delay, restrain,
prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of such transactions under
any antitrust law.

(y) Each of Parent, the Company and OMT, LLC shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the expiration or termination of all waiting periods and all
consents, waivers, authorizations and approvals of all third parties,
including Governmental Entities, necessary, proper or advisable for the
consummation of the Transactions and to provide any notices to third parties
required to be provided prior to the Merger 1 Effective Time; provided that,
without the prior written consent of Parent, neither the Company nor OMT, LLC
shall incur any significant expense or liability, enter into any significant
new commitment or agreement or agree to any significant modification to any
contractual arrangement to obtain such consents or certificates in each case,
that would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company after giving effect
to the LLC Consolidation.

6.5 Termination of Certain Benefit Plans. Unless otherwise requested by Parent
prior to the Closing, effective no later than the day immediately preceding
the Closing Date, the Company shall terminate any and all plans intended to
include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (collectively, "Company 401(k)
Plans"). Alternatively, the Company may amend the Company 401(k) Plan(s) to
(i) add OMT Therapeutics, Inc. to the Company 401(k) Plan(s) as an affiliate,
(ii) change the sponsor of the Company 401(k) Plan(s) from the Company to OMT
Therapeutics, Inc., and designate the Company an affiliate of the Company
401(k) Plan(s), (iii) rename the Company 401(k) Plan to "OMT Therapeutics,
Inc. 401K," and (iv) remove the Company as an affiliate of the Company 401(k)
Plan(s), provided that such restructuring of the Company 401(k) Plan(s) is
completed no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date. The
Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such Company 401(k) Plan(s)
have been terminated or restructured, as applicable, effective as of the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date pursuant to resolutions of the Board of
Directors of the Company. Unless otherwise requested by Parent prior to the
Closing, the Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary to terminate
the Company Option Plan prior to the Closing, and no further Company Options
or other rights shall be granted thereunder.

6.6 Tax Matters.

(c) Tax Returns.

(iii) The Company shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared or
timely filed, all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are
required to be filed (taking into account any extension) on or before the
Closing Date, and shall pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes of the Company and
its Subsidiaries due on or before the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be
prepared by treating items on such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the
past practices of the Company and its Subsidiaries, except as required by
applicable law. At least ten (10) Business Days prior to filing any such Tax
Return, the Company shall submit a copy of such Tax Return to Parent for
Parent's review and approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

(iv) Parent shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, on a basis consistent with past practice unless otherwise required by
applicable law, all Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries for any
periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date that are filed after the
Closing Date and all Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries for any
Straddle Periods. Parent shall deliver to the Stockholders' Representative for
the Stockholders' Representative's review and comment a copy of each such Tax
Return at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the due date for the filing of
such Tax Return (taking into account any extension). Parent shall consider in
good faith any comments that are received from the Stockholders'
Representative at least five (5) Business Days prior to the due date for the
filing of such Tax Return. The Company Equityholders shall be responsible for
all Taxes relating to the Pre-Closing Tax Period payable in connection with
such Tax Returns. The Stockholders' Representative and Parent shall instruct
the Escrow Agent to release from the Escrow Fund the amount due to Parent for
the Company Equityholders' share of Taxes relating to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period under this Section 6.6(a)(ii) at least two (2) Business Days before
payment of Taxes (including estimated Taxes) is due to the Tax Authority,
except to the extent such Taxes were taken into account in the calculation of
Current Assets or Current Liabilities and the Additional Cash Consideration.
The Company Equityholders shall be entitled to any tax refund related to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period Tax Returns; provided that (1) the related taxes were
paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing or by the
Company Equityholders after the Closing, (2) such refunds do not arise as a
result of a carryback of a loss or other tax benefit from a taxable period (or
portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date, and (3) such refunds were
not taken into account for the purposes of determining Current Assets, Current
Liabilities and Additional Cash Consideration. The proceeds of any such tax
refund shall be deposited into the Escrow Fund for distribution with the
remaining portion of the Escrow Fund, and such proceeds shall include, without
limitation, the proceeds with respect to any tax refund for the 2014 Federal
Tax Return. To the extent such tax refund is subsequently disallowed or
required to be returned to the applicable Tax Authority, the Company
Equityholders shall promptly repay the amount of such refund, together with
any interest, penalties or other additional amounts imposed by such Tax
Authority, to Parent. For purposes of this Agreement, the pre-closing portion
of any Taxes that are payable with respect to any Straddle Period will be (i)
in the case of Property Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the
entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of calendar days of such Straddle Period in the Pre-Closing Tax Period
and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire
Straddle Period and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes, determined as though
the taxable year of the Company or the applicable Subsidiary terminated at the
close of business on the Closing Date.

(d) Tax Contests. Parent and the Surviving Corporation, on the one hand, and
the Stockholders' Representative, on the other hand, shall promptly notify
each other upon receipt by such party of written notice of any inquiries,
claims, assessments, audits or similar events with respect to Taxes relating
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (any such inquiry, claim, assessment, audit or
similar event, a "Tax Contest"). Any failure to so notify the other party of
any Tax Contest shall not limit any of the indemnification obligations under
Article VIII (except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the
defense of such Tax Contest). Stockholders' Representative shall have the
right to control the conduct of all Tax Contests for which the Company
Equityholders may have an indemnification obligation under Article VIII,
including any settlement or compromise thereof; provided, however, that
Stockholders' Representative shall keep the Parent reasonably informed of the
progress of any such Tax Contest and Stockholders' Representative shall not
resolve such Tax Contest in a manner that would reasonably be expected to have
an adverse impact on any indemnification obligations under Article VIII
without the Parent's written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Each party shall bear its own costs for
participating in such Tax Contest, except that Parent may be entitled to
indemnification for its costs pursuant to this Agreement. In the event of any
conflict or overlap between the provisions of this Section 6.6(b) and Section
8.6, the provisions of this Section 6.6(b) shall control.

(e) Cooperation on Tax Matters. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Stockholders' Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns pursuant to this Agreement and any Tax Contest. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the other party's request) the provision of
records and information which may be reasonably relevant to any such Tax
Return or Tax Contest and making appropriate persons available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder.

(f) Transfer Taxes. All transfer, stamp, documentary, sales, use,
registration, value-added and other similar Taxes (including all applicable
real estate transfer Taxes) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions ("Transfer Taxes") will be borne by the Company Equityholders.
The Company (or Surviving Corporation, as applicable) hereby agrees to file,
or cause to be filed, in a timely manner all necessary documents (including,
but not limited to, all Tax Returns) with respect to such Transfer Taxes. The
Company (or Surviving Corporation, as applicable) shall provide Parent with
evidence satisfactory to Parent that such Transfer Taxes have been paid by (or
on behalf of) the Company Equityholders.

(g) Reorganization Treatment.

(i) The parties hereto shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
cause the Mergers to qualify, and shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts not to, and not to permit or cause any Affiliate or any Subsidiary to,
take any actions or cause any action to be taken which would prevent the
Mergers from qualifying, as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.

(ii) This Agreement is intended to constitute, and the parties hereto hereby
adopt this Agreement as, a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning
Treasury Regulation Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a). Parent, Merger Sub 1,
Merger Sub 2 and the Company shall report the Mergers as a reorganization

pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the
Code.

6.7 FIRPTA Compliance. On the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to
Parent a properly executed statement, dated as of the Closing Date, in a form
reasonably acceptable to Parent and that satisfies the requirements of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445‑2(c)(3), together with the required notice
to the IRS and written authorization for Parent to deliver such notice and a
copy of such statement to the IRS on behalf of the Company upon the Closing.

6.8 Third Party Consents. Prior to the Closing Date, (a) the Company shall
obtain and provide to Parent all consents and waivers required in connection
with the Mergers from third parties to all Company Material Contracts, and (b)
the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and provide to
Parent all consents and waivers required in connection with the Mergers from
third parties to all other Contracts to which the Company is a party and which
are listed in Section 6.8 of the Company Disclosure Letter. If the lessor or
licensor under any Lease conditions its grant of a consent (including by
threatening to exercise a "recapture" or other termination right) upon, or
otherwise requires in response to a notice or consent request regarding this
Agreement, the payment of a consent fee, "profit sharing" payment or other
consideration (including increased rent payments), or the provision of
additional security (including a guaranty), the Company shall be solely
responsible for making all such payments or providing all such additional
security.

6.9 Merger Sub Compliance. Parent shall cause Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 to
comply with all of Merger Sub 1's and Merger Sub 2's obligations, as
applicable, under or relating to this Agreement. Neither Merger Sub 1 nor
Merger Sub 2 shall engage in any business which is not in connection with the
Mergers pursuant to this Agreement.

notice to Parent of (a) any notice or other communication from any third party
alleging that the consent of such third party is or may be required in
connection with the Transactions, (b) any notice or other communication from
any third party whose consent is required in connection with the Transactions
that such third party refuses to give such consent, (c) any Material Adverse
Effect on the Company, (d) any breach of any of the Company's representations,
warranties, agreements, obligations or covenants pursuant to this Agreement or
(e) the occurrence or existence of any event that results, or with notice or
the passage of time or otherwise, is reasonably likely to result, in the
failure of the conditions set forth in Article VII; provided, however, that
the delivery of notice pursuant to this Section 6.10 shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to Parent.

6.11 Section 280G of the Code.

(a) Parent and the Company acknowledge that the consideration payable pursuant
to this Agreement and certain other amounts which may be received by any
person in connection with the Transactions may be deemed to constitute
"parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder ("Section 280G")). The Company shall obtain
and deliver to Parent, prior to the solicitation of the requisite approval of
the Company's stockholders described in Section 6.11(b), a Section 280G Waiver
from each person who is a "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of
Section 280G), as determined immediately prior to the initiation of the
solicitation of the requisite approval of the Company's stockholders described
in Section 6.11(b), and who might otherwise receive or have the right or
entitlement to receive a parachute payment under Section 280G in connection
with the Transactions, unless the requisite approval of the Company's
stockholders of such parachute payments is obtained pursuant to Section
6.11(b).

(b) As soon as practicable following the delivery by the Company to Parent of
the Section 280G Waivers, the Company shall submit to the Company's
stockholders for approval in accordance with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code
any payments and/or benefits that are subject to a Section 280G Waiver, such
that such payments and benefits shall not be deemed to be "parachute payments"
under Section 280G, and prior to the Merger 1 Effective Time the Company shall
deliver to Parent evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent (i) that a vote
of the Company's stockholders was solicited in conformance with Section 280G,
and the requisite approval of the Company's stockholders was obtained with
respect to any payments and/or benefits that were subject to such vote (the
"Section 280G Approval") or (ii) that the Section 280G Approval was not
obtained and as a consequence, pursuant to the Section 280G Waiver, such
"parachute payments" shall not be made or provided.

(c) The form of the Section 280G Waiver and any materials to be submitted to
the Company's stockholders in connection with the Section 280G Approval (the
"Section 280G Soliciting Materials") shall be subject to review and approval
by Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

6.12 Closing Date Allocation Schedule. At least three (3) Business Days prior
to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent the Closing Date
Allocation Schedule, and thereafter through the Closing any interim updates to
the Closing Date Allocation Schedule as necessary for the information
reflected thereon to be accurate in all material respects as of the Closing
Date.

6.13 Resale Form S-3. At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing,
Parent shall deliver to the Company a draft of a Registration Statement on
Form S-3 (the "Form S-3") registering the Parent Common Stock to be issued as

the Securities Act. Prior to March 1, 2016, Parent shall keep the Form S-3
effective and after March 1, 2016, Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to keep the Form S-3 effective, in either case, until all shares of
Parent Common Stock issued in connection with the Mergers and held by Persons
who are not "affiliates" of Parent, as defined in Rule 144 under the

shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, and under the Company's Charter Documents as in effect
immediately prior to the Merger 1 Effective Time, each such individual who is
now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, a director
or officer of the Company or any of its predecessors (each, a "Company
Indemnified Party") against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs,
expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses incurred in
advance of the final disposition of any action, suit, proceeding or

applicable law and the Company Charter Documents upon receipt of any
undertaking required by applicable law or reasonably requested by the
Surviving Corporation), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any such threatened or actual Proceeding in respect of acts,
errors or omissions of such Persons in such capacities occurring prior to the

in respect of any Proceeding asserted or made within such period shall
continue until the final disposition of such Proceeding.

or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a substantial portion of its properties
and other assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall
cause proper provision to be made so that the applicable successors and
assigns or transferees expressly assume the obligations set forth in this

(c) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section
6.14 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely
affect any Company Indemnified Party to whom this Section 6.14 applies without

or modification is required by applicable law. The provisions of this Section
6.14 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Company Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives,
and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to which
each Company Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to law, contract
or otherwise.

280G Waiver, and, as a consequence, such "parachute payments" subject to a

"parachute payments."

(g) Resignations. The Company shall have delivered to Parent resignations of

ARTICLE VIII. 
SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; INDEMNIFICATION; ESCROW

8.1 Survival of Representations and Warranties.

(d) All representations and warranties of the Company and OMT, LLC contained
in this Agreement and any certificate delivered by the Company or OMT, LLC
pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the consummation of the Mergers and
continue until the Escrow Termination Date, at which time such representations
and warranties shall terminate; provided, however, that the representations
and warranties in Section 3.8(h)(i) (Intellectual Property) and related
indemnity obligations shall survive until the date that is four (4) years
following the Closing Date; provided, further, that the representations and
warranties in Section 3.1 (Organization; Standing and Power; Charter
Documents; Subsidiaries), Section 3.2 (Capital Structure), Section 3.3
(Authority; Non-Contravention; Necessary Consents), the representations and
warranties in Section 3.7 (Taxes) and Section 3.14 (Assets) (together, the
"Fundamental Representations") and related indemnity obligations will survive
until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (the "Survival
Period"); provided, further, that if at any time prior to the termination of
any specific representation or warranty, an Indemnified Party has duly
delivered to the Stockholders' Representative a valid Indemnification Demand
or Claim Notice (with such Indemnification Demand or Claim Notice satisfying
the requirements set forth in Sections 8.6(a) or 8.7(a), as applicable)
relating to such representation or warranty, then the representation or
warranty underlying the claim asserted in such Indemnification Demand or Claim
Notice shall survive until such time as such claim is resolved. The Company,
OMT, LLC and Parent expressly agree pursuant to this Section 8.1 to shorten
the statutes of limitation applicable to all claims and causes of action based
directly or indirectly upon inaccuracies in or breaches of the representations
and warranties other than the Fundamental Representations made by the Company
or OMT, LLC in this Agreement. The respective covenants, agreements and
obligations of the parties contained in this Agreement shall survive (A) until
fully performed or fulfilled, unless non-compliance with such covenants,
agreements or obligations is waived in writing by the party or parties
entitled to such performance or (B) if not fully performed or fulfilled, until
the later of the end of the applicable statute of limitations and any
extensions thereof.

(e) The representations, warranties, agreements, obligations and covenants of
the Company or OMT, LLC, and the rights and remedies that may be exercised by
the Indemnified Parties, shall not be limited or otherwise affected by or as a
result of any information furnished to, or any investigation made by or
knowledge of, the Indemnified Parties or their representatives.

8.2 Escrow and Representative Reimbursement Amount Deposit.

(q) Promptly at the Closing, and without any act of any Company Equityholder,
Parent shall deposit the Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agent. For purposes of
determining the reduction in the amount of Merger Consideration payable to
each Company Equityholder pursuant to Section 2.8, Parent will be deemed to
have contributed on behalf of each Company Equityholder, his, her or its Pro
Rata Portion of the Escrow Amount to the Escrow Fund to be governed under the
terms set forth in this Agreement and in the Escrow Agreement.

(r) Promptly at the Closing, and without any act of any Company Equityholder,
Parent shall deposit the Representative Reimbursement Amount with the Escrow
Agent, to be held by the Escrow Agent and released on the instructions of the
Stockholders' Representative for the payment of expenses incurred by the
Stockholders' Representative in performing their duties pursuant to this
Agreement. For purposes of determining the reduction in the amount of Cash
Merger Consideration payable to each Company Equityholder pursuant to Section
2.8, Parent will be deemed to have contributed on behalf of each Company
Equityholder, his, her or its Pro Rata Portion of the Representative
Reimbursement Amount for retention by the Escrow Agent. Any of the
Representative Reimbursement Amount originally deposited with the Escrow Agent
at the Closing that has not been used by the Stockholders' Representative
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on or prior to the end of the period
in which the Indemnified Parties may make claims for indemnification pursuant
to Section 8.3(a) or, if later, the date on which all indemnification claims
of the Indemnified Parties outstanding at the end of such period have been
discharged in full, shall be released by the Escrow Agent to the Stockholders'
Representative for distribution to the Company Equityholders, in each case in
proportion to their respective Pro Rata Portion of such remaining funds, if
any. Notwithstanding the delivery of any remaining portion of the
Representative Reimbursement Amount to the Escrow Agent, such remaining
portion shall not be deemed part of the Escrow Fund and shall not be available
to satisfy any indemnification or other obligations to Parent hereunder.
Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall have any liability or
obligation with respect to the use of the Representative Reimbursement Amount
by the Stockholders' Representative.

8.3 Indemnification; Escrow Fund; Right of Setoff.

(a) From and after the Closing Date (but subject to Section 8.1 and the
limitations set forth in Section 8.3(d)), each Indemnified Party shall be
defended and held harmless, severally and not jointly, by the Company
Equityholders and shall be indemnified, severally and not jointly, by the
Company Equityholders from and against any Losses which are suffered or
incurred by any Indemnified Party or to which any Indemnified Party may
otherwise become subject (regardless of whether or not such Losses relate to
any Third-Party Claim) and which arise from or as a result of:

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of the
Company or OMT, LLC contained in this Agreement or any certificate delivered
by the Company or OMT, LLC pursuant to this Agreement;

(ii) any failure by the Company or OMT, LLC to perform or comply with any
agreement, obligation or covenant of the Company or OMT, LLC contained in this
Agreement;

(iii) any action, suit or proceeding, or any investigation or claim by any
other Person against Parent or the Surviving Corporation asserting that the
Company Products infringe on any Patent Right or other Intellectual Property
of any other Person or constitutes misappropriation of any other Person's
Intellectual Property, but excluding any action, suit or proceeding, or any
investigation or claim, relating to (A) improvements or modifications to the
Company Products made after the Merger 1 Effective Time to the Company
Products, whether by Company or any other Person, (B) combination of the
Company Products with anything not provided by Company or OMT LLC, where such
action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim would not have arisen but for
such combination, and (C) exploitation of a Company Product in violation of
any applicable contractual restrictions thereon;

(iv) (A) any Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period (including any such Taxes attributable to the LLC
Consolidation), (B) any Taxes for which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(or a predecessor thereof) is held liable under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law) by reason
of such entity being included in any consolidated, affiliated, combined or
unitary group at any time on or before the Closing Date, and (C) the Taxes of
any Person (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) imposed on the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a transferee or successor, by Contract
or otherwise, in each case as a result of a transaction consummated on or
before the Closing Date;

(v) any claim by any holder or former holder of Company Capital Stock or
equity interests of OMT, LLC exercising dissenters' rights or rights of
appraisal in respect of such holder's Dissenting Shares, together with all
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and
expenses) incurred by the Parent in respect of such holder's exercise;

(vi) any actual or alleged breach of fiduciary duty by an Equityholder or any
present or former director or officer of the Company or member of OMT, LLC
prior to the Closing (including, for the avoidance of doubt, all Losses
actually incurred by any Indemnified Party arising from the indemnification
of, the advancement or reimbursement of expenses to, or the payment of
insurance proceeds (including self-insured retention or deductible amounts,
costs and expenses of pursuing claims and related increases in insurance
premiums) to, any such Person based upon any actual or alleged breach of
fiduciary duty of such Person prior to the Closing);

(vii) any inaccuracy in the Closing Date Allocation Schedule, including to the
extent any Company Equityholder is entitled to receive any amounts in
connection with the Merger (in such Company Equityholder's capacity as an
Company Equityholder) in excess of the amounts indicated on the Closing Date
Allocation Schedule; and

(viii) fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct on the part
of the Company or OMT, LLC.

(b) In the event any Indemnified Party shall suffer any Losses for which such
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this Article VIII,
subject to Section 8.3(d), such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover
such Losses by obtaining the amount from the Escrow Fund equal in value to the
aggregate amount of such Losses (the "Right of Setoff").

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Escrow Fund
shall not be available to compensate any of the Indemnified Parties for any
Losses, and no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover from the Escrow
Fund unless and until the Indemnified Parties have incurred Losses in excess
of $500,000 in the aggregate (the "Deductible Amount"), in which event the
Indemnified Parties shall, subject to the other limitations contained herein,
be entitled to be indemnified only against the portion of such Losses in
excess of the Deductible Amount. The Deductible Amount shall not apply to:

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any Fundamental Representations; or

(ii) the matters referenced in Sections 8.3(a)(ii) through 8.3(a)(viii).

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein: (i) any Losses
recoverable from the Right of Setoff and the Escrow Fund hereunder shall be
reduced in amount by any insurance proceeds actually realized by any
Indemnified Party that are directly attributable to such Losses (provided that
the Indemnified Party shall not be required to litigate any dispute, or
otherwise bring any claim, lawsuit or other proceeding to obtain such
insurance proceeds); and (ii) no Losses (other than Losses from Third-Party
Claims) shall be recoverable from the Escrow Fund hereunder that constitute
punitive or consequential damages.

(e) All claims for recovery for any Loss or Losses from the Escrow Fund shall
be made pursuant to and in accordance with, and be governed by the terms of,
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

8.4 Limitation on Remedies.

(a) The Right of Setoff and recovery from the Escrow Fund shall be the sole
and exclusive remedies of the Indemnified Parties under this Agreement or for
any Losses incurred by any Indemnified Party (other than claims for injunctive
relief and/or specific performance of covenants that require performance after
the Closing). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) liability for any Losses
based on any inaccuracy in or breach of the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 3.8(h)(i) (Intellectual Property) or based on the matters
referenced in Section 8.3(a)(iii) shall not be limited to the Right of Setoff
and recovery from the Escrow Fund, and instead shall be limited to the
aggregate amount of $20,000,000, less any amounts from the Escrow Fund that
are not distributed to the Company Equityholders, (ii) liability for any
Losses based on the matters referenced in Sections 8.3(a)(ii), 8.3(a)(iv),
8.3(a)(vii) and 8.3(c)(i) shall not be limited to the Right of Setoff and
recovery from the Escrow Fund, and instead shall be limited to the aggregate
amount of the Merger Consideration paid, or due and payable, under this
Agreement, and (iii) a Company Equityholder's liability for its own fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct shall not be limited under
this Article VIII.

8.5 Stockholders' Representative.

(a) By virtue of the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the requisite
consent of the Company Stockholders, each of the Company Equityholders shall
be deemed to have agreed to appoint Fortis Advisors LLC as its exclusive agent
and attorney-in-fact (the "Stockholders' Representative") for and on behalf of
the Company Equityholders to give and receive notices and communications, to
authorize payment to any Indemnified Party from the Escrow Fund in
satisfaction of claims by any Indemnified Party, to object to such payments,
to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand
arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with
respect to such claims, to assert, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and
awards of arbitrators with respect to, any other claim by any Indemnified
Party against any Company Equityholder or by any such Company Equityholder any
Indemnified Party or any dispute between any Indemnified Party and any such
Company Equityholder, in each case relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions, and to take all other actions that are either (i) necessary or
appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholders' Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii) specifically mandated by the terms of
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Stockholders' Representative shall have no obligation to act on behalf of the
Company Equityholder, except as expressly provided herein and in the Escrow
Agreement, and for purposes of clarity, there are no obligations of the
Stockholders' Representative in any ancillary agreement, schedule, exhibit or
the Company Disclosure Letter. Such agency may be changed by the Company
Equityholders with the right to a majority in interest of the Escrow Fund from
time to time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Stockholders' Representative
may resign at any time by providing written notice of intent to resign to the
Company Equityholders, which resignation shall be effective upon the earlier
of (A) thirty (30) calendar days following delivery of such written notice or
(B) the appointment of a successor by the holders of a majority in interest of
the Escrow Fund. The immunities and rights to indemnification shall survive
the resignation or removal of the Stockholders' Representative or any member
of the Advisory Group and the Closing and/or any termination of this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement. No bond shall be required of the Stockholders'
Representative.

(b) Certain Company Stockholders have entered into an engagement agreement
with the Stockholders' Representative to provide direction to the
Stockholders' Representative in connection with its services under this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (such Company Stockholders, including their
individual representatives, collectively hereinafter referred to as the
"Advisory Group"). Neither the Stockholders' Representative nor its members,
managers, directors, officers, contractors, agents and employees nor any
member of the Advisory Group (collectively, the "Stockholders' Representative
Group"), shall be liable to any Company Equityholder for any act done or
omitted hereunder, under the Escrow Agreement or under any Stockholders'
Representative engagement agreement as Stockholders' Representative while
acting in good faith, even if such act or omission constitutes negligence on
the part of such Stockholders' Representative. The Stockholders'
Representative shall only have the duties expressly stated in this Agreement
and shall have no other duty, express or implied. The Stockholders'
Representative may engage attorneys, accountants and other professionals and
experts. The Stockholders' Representative may in good faith rely conclusively
upon information, reports, statements and opinions prepared or presented by
such professionals, and any action taken by the Stockholders' Representative
based on such reliance shall be deemed conclusively to have been taken in good
faith. The Company Equityholder shall indemnify and defend the Stockholders'
Representative Group and hold the Stockholders' Representative Group harmless
against any loss, liability, claims, damages, fees, costs or expense
(including expenses in connection with seeking recovery from insurers),
judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement incurred on the part of the
Stockholders' Representative (so long as the Stockholders' Representative were
acting in good faith in connection therewith) and arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the Stockholders'
Representative's duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses
of any legal counsel or other skilled professionals retained by the
Stockholders' Representative ("Stockholders' Representative Expenses"). The
Stockholders' Representative shall have the right to retain Stockholders'
Representative Expenses first, from the Representative Reimbursement Amount
prior to any distribution to the Company Equityholders, and prior to any such
distribution, shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a certificate setting forth
the Stockholders' Representative Expenses actually incurred, second, from any
distribution of the Escrow Fund otherwise distributable to the Company
Equityholders at the time of distribution, and third, directly from the
Company Equityholders. The Company Equityholders acknowledge that the
Stockholders' Representative shall not be required to expend or risk its own
funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the exercise or
performance of any of its powers, rights, duties or privileges or pursuant to
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby. Furthermore, the Stockholders' Representative shall not be
required to take any action unless the Stockholders' Representative has been
provided with funds, security or indemnities which, in its determination, are
sufficient to protect the Stockholders' Representative against the costs,
expenses and liabilities which may be incurred by the Stockholders'
Representative in performing such actions.

(c) The Stockholders' Representative shall be entitled to: (i) rely upon the
Closing Date Allocation Schedule, (ii) rely upon any signature reasonably
believed by it to be genuine, and (iii) reasonably assume that a signatory has
proper authorization to sign on behalf of the applicable Company Equityholder
or other party. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders'
Representative under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, including an
amendment, extension or waiver of this Agreement pursuant to Sections 9.4 or
9.5 hereof, shall constitute a decision of the Company Equityholders and shall
be final, binding and conclusive upon the Company Equityholders and such
Company Equityholder's successors as if expressly confirmed and ratified in
writing by such Company Equityholder. The powers, immunities and rights to
indemnification granted to the Stockholders' Representative Group hereunder:
(i) are coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable and survive the
death, incompetence, bankruptcy or liquidation of any Company Equityholder and
shall be binding on any successor thereto, and (ii) shall survive the delivery
of an assignment by any Company Equityholder of the whole or any fraction of
his, her or its interest in the Escrow Fund.

8.6 Third-Party Claims.

(a) In the event that an Indemnified Party becomes aware of a third-party
claim (a "Third-Party Claim") that the Indemnified Party reasonably believes
may result in a demand against the Right of Setoff or the Escrow Fund or for
other indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII, Parent shall promptly
notify the Stockholders' Representative and the Escrow Agent, if the Escrow
Fund has not ceased to exist, of such claim (a "Claim Notice"); provided,
however, that no delay or failure on the part of an Indemnified Party in
delivering any Claim Notice shall relieve the Company Equityholders from any
liability hereunder except and to the extent the Company Equityholders have
been actually prejudiced by such delay or failure.

(b) Parent may, at its election, undertake and conduct the defense of such
Third-Party Claim (except to the extent such Claim may be controlled by the
Stockholders' Representative pursuant to Section 6.6(b)) upon written notice
of such election to the Stockholders' Representative within thirty (30) days
after delivery of the Claim Notice. The Stockholders' Representative shall be
entitled to participate in, but not to determine or conduct, the defense of
such Third-Party Claim, unless such participation would affect any privilege
of Parent in respect of such Third-Party Claim; provided, however, that Parent
shall have the right in its reasonable discretion to settle any such claim;
provided, further, that except with the prior written consent of the
Stockholders' Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), no settlement of any such Third-Party Claim
with third-party claimants shall be determinative of any Losses relating to
such matter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Stockholders' Representative
shall have the right to receive copies of all pleadings, notices and
communications with respect to the Third-Party Claim to the extent that
receipt of such documents by the Stockholders' Representative does not affect
any privilege relating to the Indemnified Party.

(c) If Parent does not so elect to undertake and conduct the defense of such
Third-Party Claim, the Stockholders' Representative may undertake the defense
of and use all reasonable efforts to defend such claim and shall consult with
Parent regarding the strategy for defense of such claim, including with
respect to the Stockholders' Representative choice of legal counsel; provided,
however, that the Stockholders' Representative shall have the right in their
reasonable discretion to settle any such claim; provided, further, that except
with the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), no settlement of any such
Third-Party Claim with third-party claimants shall be determinative of any
Losses relating to such matter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
that (i) the control of the defense by the Stockholders' Representative would
be inappropriate due to a conflict of interest or because the Indemnified
Party has been advised by counsel that in such counsel's opinion it has claims
or defenses that are unavailable to the Company Equityholder which the
Stockholders' Representative is unable or unwilling to assert, (ii) such
Third-Party Claim (or the facts or allegations related to such Third-Party
Claim) involves criminal allegations or seeks equitable or injunctive relief,
or (iii) the Stockholders' Representative fail at any time to conduct the
defense of such proceeding, claim or demand in a reasonably active and
diligent manner, then Parent shall have the right to assume the control of
such defense. Until the Stockholders' Representative assumes the defense of
any such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may defend against such
Third-Party Claim in any manner the Indemnified Party reasonably deems
appropriate at cost and expense of the Company Equityholder if the Company
Equityholder are liable for indemnification hereunder. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Article VIII, the Stockholders' Representative shall
not enter into any compromise, settlement agreement or consent decree with
respect to any such Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of
Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned) unless such compromise, settlement agreement or consent decree
(x) provides solely for the payment of money in an amount that is less than
the amount of the Escrow Amount then remaining in the Escrow Fund, (y)
contains a complete and unconditional release by the third party asserting the
Third-Party Claim of the Indemnified Party and (z) does not contain any direct
or indirect requirements upon or provisions for or impose any obligations on
the Indemnified Party.

(d) The party controlling the defense of a Third-Party Claim (the "Controlling
Party") shall (i) keep the other party (the "Non-controlling Party") advised
of the status of such claim and the defense thereof (including all material
developments and events relating thereto) and shall consider in good faith
recommendations made by the Non-controlling Party with respect thereto and
(ii) make available to the Non-controlling Party any documents or materials in
its possession or control that may be necessary to understand the defense of
such claim (subject to protection of the attorney-client privilege). If
requested by the Controlling Party, the Non-controlling Party shall furnish
the Controlling Party with such information as it may have with respect to
such Third-Party Claim (including copies of any summons, complaints or other
pleadings which may have been served on such party and any written claim,
demand, invoice, billing or other document evidencing or asserting the same)
and shall otherwise reasonably cooperate with and assist the Controlling Party
in the defense of such Third-Party Claim.

8.7 Notice of Indemnity Claims Other than Third-Party Claims.

(a) In order to seek indemnification under this Article VIII other than with
respect to a Third-Party Claim, the applicable Indemnified Party shall deliver
a written demand (an "Indemnification Demand") to the Stockholders'
Representative and to the Escrow Agent, if the Escrow Fund has not ceased to
exist. The Indemnification Demand shall contain (i) a description and the
amount of any Losses incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the
Indemnified Party, (ii) a statement that the Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification under Section 8.3(a) for such Losses and a reasonable
explanation of the basis therefor and (iii) a demand for payment in the amount
of such Losses.

(b) The Stockholders' Representative may object to any liability claim set
forth in an Indemnification Demand by delivering written notice to Parent of
the Stockholders' Representative's objection (an "Indemnification Dispute
Notice"). Such Indemnification Dispute Notice will describe the grounds (to
the extent known) for such objection in reasonable detail. If the
Stockholders' Representative fail to deliver an Indemnification Dispute Notice
to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days following receipt of an
Indemnification Demand from a Indemnified Party that it disputes the indemnity
claimed therein, the indemnity claim set forth in the Indemnification Demand
shall be conclusively deemed a liability to be indemnified under this Article
VIII, and such Indemnified Party shall, subject to the limitations contained
in this Article VIII, be indemnified for the amount of the Losses stated in
such Indemnification Demand on demand. If an Indemnification Dispute Notice is
delivered, the parties shall thereafter comply with the following dispute
resolution provisions:

(iii) The Stockholders' Representative and the Indemnified Party shall attempt
to resolve such dispute promptly by negotiation in good faith. Each such party
shall give the other party involved written notice of any dispute not so
resolved within ten (10) days following delivery of an Indemnification Dispute
Notice. Within five (5) days following delivery of such notice, the party
receiving notice shall submit to the other a written response thereto. The
notice and response shall include the name and title of the Person who will
represent the Indemnified Party and any other Person who will accompany that
Person, in the case of the Indemnified Party, or the name of the agent, if
other than Stockholders' Representative, who will represent the Company
Equityholders and any other Person who will accompany that agent, in the case
of the Stockholders' Representative.

(iv) Within ten (10) days following delivery of the notice pursuant to Section
8.7(b)(i), the designated officer of the Indemnified Party and the
Stockholders' Representative or other designated agent of the Company
Equityholders shall meet at a mutually agreed time and place, and thereafter,
as often as they reasonably deem necessary, to attempt to resolve the dispute.
All negotiations conducted pursuant to this Section 8.7(b) (and any of the
parties' submissions in contemplation thereof) shall be kept confidential by
the parties.

(c) In the event the Stockholders' Representative and the Indemnified Party
are unable to resolve any dispute identified in an Indemnification Dispute
Notice in accordance with provisions (i) and (ii) of this Section 8.7(b)
within thirty (30) days after delivery of any Indemnification Dispute Notice,
either the Indemnified Party or the Stockholders' Representative may seek to
resolve the matter through litigation brought in accordance with Section 10.8.

8.8 No Circular Recovery. After the Closing, and except as provided for in
Section 6.15, the Company Equityholders shall not have any right of
contribution, right of indemnity or other right or remedy against Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, or any of their directors, officers or employees,
for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the
Company.

8.9 Determination of Indemnifiable Losses. For the purpose of determining the
amount of the Losses resulting from a breach or inaccuracy of a representation
or warranty (but not for the purpose of determining the existence of such
breach or inaccuracy), any "material," "materiality" or "Material Adverse
Effect" qualifiers or words of similar import contained in such representation
or warranty giving rise to the claim of indemnity hereunder shall in each case
be disregarded and without effect (as if such standard or qualification were
deleted from such representation or warranty).

8.10 Tax Consequences of Indemnification Payments. Any payments made to an
Indemnified Party pursuant to any indemnification obligations under this
Article VIII will be treated as adjustments to the purchase price for all
federal, state, local and foreign Tax purposes, and the parties shall file
their respective Tax Returns accordingly and such agreed treatment will govern
for purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise required by law.

ARTICLE IX. 
TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

9.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated, and the Mergers abandoned,
at any time prior to the Merger 1 Effective Time by duly authorized action by
the terminating party:

(s) by duly authorized mutual written consent of the Boards of Directors of
Parent and the Company and the Board of Managers of OMT, LLC;

(t) by any of the Company, OMT, LLC or Parent if the Mergers shall not have
been consummated by March 31, 2016 (the "End Date"); provided, if the waiting

Date, then any of the Company, OMT, LLC or Parent may extend the End Date by
written notice to the other party up to a date not beyond June 30, 2016;
provided, further, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this Section 9.1(b) shall not be available to any party whose action or
failure to act (including the failure to act in compliance with Section 6.4)
has been a principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the Mergers to
occur on or before such date and such action or failure to act constitutes a
breach of this Agreement;

(u) by any of the Company, OMT, LLC or Parent if a Governmental Entity shall
have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action (including
the failure to have taken an action), in any case having the effect of (i)
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Mergers, (ii)
prohibiting Parent's, the Company's or OMT, LLC's ownership or operation of
any portion of the business of the Company (after giving effect to the LLC
Consolidation), or (iii) compelling Parent or any of its Affiliates or the
Company or OMT, LLC to dispose of or hold separate, as a result of the
Mergers, any portion of the business or assets of Parent or any of its
Affiliates or the Company or OMT, LLC, which order, decree, ruling or other
action is final and nonappealable;

(v) by the Company or OMT, LLC, upon a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement on the part of Parent, Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 set
forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Parent,
Merger Sub 1 or Merger Sub 2 shall have become untrue, in either case such
that the conditions set forth in Sections 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) would not be
satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such representation
or warranty shall have become untrue, provided that neither the Company nor
OMT, LLC may terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(d) prior to the
later of the End Date and thirty (30) days following the receipt of written
notice by Parent from the Company or OMT, LLC of such breach (it being
understood that neither the Company nor OMT, LLC may terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 9.1(d) if the Company is in material breach of this
Agreement or if such breach by Parent is cured so that such conditions would
then be satisfied);

(w) by Parent, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of the Company or OMT, LLC set forth in this Agreement,
or if any representation or warranty of the Company or OMT, LLC shall have
become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in Sections
7.3(a) or 7.3(b) would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of
the time such representation or warranty shall have become untrue, provided
that Parent may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(e) prior
to the later of the End Date and thirty (30) days following the receipt of
written notice by the Company and OMT, LLC from Parent of such breach (it
being understood that Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 9.1(e) if Parent is in material breach of this Agreement or if such
breach by the Company and OMT, LLC is cured so that such conditions would then
be satisfied); or

9.2 Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination. Any termination of this
Agreement under Section 9.1 will be effective immediately upon the delivery of
a valid written notice of the terminating party to the other party hereto
(taking into consideration any cure periods provided in Section 9.1). In the
event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 9.1, this
Agreement shall be of no further force or effect, except (a) as set forth in
Section 6.2(a), this Section 9.2, Section 9.3 and Article X, each of which
shall survive the termination of this Agreement and (b) nothing herein shall
relieve any party to this Agreement from liability for any willful breach of
this Agreement. No termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations
of the parties contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which
obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with
their terms.

9.3 Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, all
fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions, including fees and expenses of financial advisors, financial
sponsors, legal counsel and other advisors ("Transaction Expenses"), shall be

50% of the cost of the audit, which share not to exceed $50,000.

9.4 Amendment. Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, this Agreement may be
amended by the parties hereto, by action duly authorized by the parties, at
any time before or after approval and adoption of this Agreement by the
stockholders of the Company, provided that no amendment shall be made which
requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company without such
further stockholder approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by
execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Parent,
Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2, Stockholders' Representative and the Company.

9.5 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Merger 1 Effective Time either
party hereto, by action duly authorized by such party, may, to the extent
legally allowed: (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the

inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such
party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. Delay in exercising any right under
this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right.

(b) When a reference is made in this Agreement to Exhibits, such reference
shall be to an Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. When a
reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section, Exhibit or
Schedule, such reference shall be to an Article, Section, Exhibit or Schedule
of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. For purposes of this Agreement;
(i) the words "include," "includes" and "including," when used herein, shall
be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation"; (ii)
"hereof", "hereto", "hereby", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar
import when used in this Agreement refer to this Agreement as a whole and not
to any particular provision of this Agreement; (iii) "date hereof" refers to
the date of this Agreement; (iv) "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall
mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase
does not mean simply "if"; (v) definitions contained in this Agreement are
applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms; (vi)
references to an agreement or instrument mean such agreement or instrument as
from time to time amended, modified or supplemented; (vii) references to a
Person are also to its permitted successors and assigns; (viii) words
importing the masculine gender include the feminine or neuter and, in each
case, vice versa; and (ix) references to a law or Legal Requirement include
any amendment or modification to such law or Legal Requirement and any rules
or regulations issued thereunder, if such amendment or modification, or such
rule or regulation is effective, on or before the date on which the compliance
with such law or Legal Requirement is at issue. The table of contents and
headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall
not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. When
reference is made herein to "the business of" an entity, such reference shall
be deemed to include the business of such entity and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole. The Company Disclosure Letter shall be arranged in sections and
subsections corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections and
subsections contained in this Agreement. An exception or disclosure made in
the Company Disclosure Letter with regard to a representation of the Company
or OMT, LLC in any section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter
shall qualify only the corresponding section or subsection of Article III.

10.3 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart.

10.4 Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement and the
documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as
contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Escrow Agreement and the certificates delivered by the Company in
connection herewith (a) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof, it being understood that the Confidentiality Agreement
shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing and shall survive
any termination of this Agreement and (b) are not intended to confer upon any
other Person any rights or remedies hereunder and no Person is or shall be
deemed to be a third party beneficiary hereunder, except, following the Merger
1 Effective Time, such provisions that act for the benefit of the Company
Equityholders and any Company Indemnified Party, as set forth in Sections
2.9(b), 2.9(c), 2.9(c) and 6.15, respectively.

10.5 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the greatest extent
possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or
unenforceable provision.

10.6 Other Remedies. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
Accordingly, each of the parties agrees that, without posting bond or other
undertaking, the other parties will be entitled to seek an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches or violations of the provisions of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and
provisions hereof in any proceeding instituted in any court of the United
States or any state thereof having jurisdiction over the parties and the
matter in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, in the case of
any claim as to which the federal courts have exclusive subject matter
jurisdiction, the Federal Court of the United States of America, sitting in
Delaware ("Federal Court")), this being in addition to any other remedy to
which it may be entitled, at law or in equity. Each party further agrees that,
in the event of any action for specific performance in respect of such breach
or violation, it will not assert the defense that a remedy at law would be
adequate.

10.7 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware regardless of the laws that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law
thereof.

10.8 Consent to Jurisdiction. In any action or proceeding between any of the
parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
Transactions, each of the parties hereto: (i) irrevocably and unconditionally
consents and submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive
jurisdiction and venue of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or,
in the case of any claim as to which the federal courts have exclusive subject
matter jurisdiction, the Federal Court); (ii) agrees that all claims in
respect of such action or proceeding must be commenced, and may be heard and
determined, exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or,
if applicable, the Federal Court); (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may
legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware (and, if applicable, the Federal Court); and
(iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if applicable, the Federal
Court). Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such
action or proceeding may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Each party to this Agreement
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices
in Section 10.1. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right of any party
to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

10.9 Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the parties irrevocably waives the right to
trial by jury in connection with any matter based upon or arising out of this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby.

10.10 Rules of Construction. The parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule
of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

10.11 Assignment. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval
of the other parties. Any purported assignment in violation of this Section
10.11 shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall
be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent may sell, transfer or assign its rights under this Agreement to any
third party, as part of a sale or transfer of substantially all of Parent's
assets or of the assets of the Surviving Corporation; provided that such third
party agrees in writing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

10.12 No Waiver. No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the
exercise of any right hereunder will impair such right or be construed to be a
waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or
agreement herein, nor will any single or partial exercise of any such right
preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right.

10.13 Privileged Information; Conflicts. Communications between the Company
and Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin and Hachigian, LLP ("Gunderson
Dettmer") with respect to the negotiation and documentation of this Agreement
or the consummation of Transactions contemplated by this Agreement will become
the property of the Company Equityholders following the Closing and will not
be disclosed by Gunderson Dettmer to Parent or the Company (following the
Closing) in any Proceeding between Parent or the Company (following the
Closing), on one hand, and Stockholders' Representative or the Company
Equityholders, on the other hand; provided, however, that (a) the Company
Equityholders may choose to waive the privilege in their sole discretion and
(b) in the event of any dispute between Parent, the Company (following the
Closing) or any of their respective subsidiaries, on the one hand, and a third
party (other than a party to this Agreement or a Related Party), on the other
hand, after the Closing, the Company and its affiliates may assert the
attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications
by Gunderson or any Company Equityholder to such third party.
