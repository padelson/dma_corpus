As of the date of this Agreement, Purchaser has at least $70,881,150.89 as of June 30, 2019 in the trust fund established by Purchaser
for the benefit of its public stockholders (the &ldquo;<U>Trust Fund</U>&rdquo;) in a trust account maintained by Continental
Stock Transfer &amp; Trust Company (the &ldquo;<U>Trustee</U>&rdquo;) at Morgan Stanley (the &ldquo;<U>Trust Account</U>&rdquo;),
and such monies are invested in &ldquo;government securities&rdquo; (as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended) and held in trust by the Trustee pursuant to the Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated as of December
18, 2018, between Purchaser and the Trustee (the &ldquo;<U>Trust Agreement</U>&rdquo;). The Trust Agreement is valid and in full
force and effect and enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization
or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors&rsquo; rights generally and by general principles of equity, and
has not been amended or modified. There are no separate agreements, side letters or other agreements or understandings (whether
written or unwritten, express or implied) that would cause the description of the Trust Agreement in the Purchaser SEC Documents
to be inaccurate in any material respect and/or that would entitle any Person (other than stockholders of Purchaser holding shares
of Purchaser Common Stock sold in Purchaser&rsquo;s IPO who shall have elected to redeem their shares of Purchaser Common Stock
pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation) to any portion of the proceeds in the Trust Account. Prior to the Closing, none
of the funds held in the Trust Account may be released except in accordance with the Trust Agreement and the Purchaser&rsquo;s
organizational documents. Purchaser has performed all material obligations required to be performed by it to date under, and is
not in material default or delinquent in performance or any other respect (claimed or actual) in connection with, the Trust Agreement,
and, to the knowledge of Purchaser, no event has occurred which, with due notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute such
a material default thereunder. There are no claims or proceedings pending with respect to the Trust Account.</P>

The following shall apply with respect to all claims by the Purchaser (an &ldquo;<U>Indemnified Party</U>&rdquo;) for indemnification
pursuant to this Article XI:</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1in">(a) An
Indemnified Party shall give the Shareholders&rsquo; Representative prompt notice (an &ldquo;<U>Indemnification Notice</U>&rdquo;)
of any third-party action with respect to which such Indemnified Party seeks indemnification pursuant to Section&nbsp;11.1 or 11.2
(a &ldquo;<U>Third-Party Claim</U>&rdquo;), which shall describe in reasonable detail the Loss that has been or may be suffered
by the Indemnified Party. The failure to give the Indemnification Notice shall not impair any of the rights or benefits of such
Indemnified Party under Sections 11.1 or 11.2, except to the extent such failure prejudices the ability of the Escrow Participants
(any of such parties, &ldquo;<U>Indemnifying Parties</U>&rdquo;) to defend such claim or increases the amount of such liability.</P>

the case of any Third-Party Claims as to which indemnification is sought by any Indemnified Party, such Indemnified Party shall
be entitled, at the sole expense and liability of the Escrow Participants, to exercise full control of the defense, compromise
or settlement of any Third-Party Claim unless the Shareholders&rsquo; Representative, within a reasonable time after the giving
of an Indemnification Notice by the Indemnified Party (but in any event within twenty (20) Business Days thereafter), shall notify
such Indemnified Party in writing of the intention of the Shareholders&rsquo; Representative to assume the defense thereof.</P>

the Indemnifying Parties assume the defense of any such Third-Party Claim pursuant to Section 11.3(b), then the Indemnified Party
shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Parties in any manner reasonably requested in connection with the defense, and the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to be kept fully informed by the Indemnifying Parties and their legal counsel with respect to the status
of any legal proceedings, to the extent not inconsistent with the preservation of attorney-client or work product privilege. If
the Indemnifying Parties so assume the defense of any such Third-Party Claim the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ
separate counsel and to participate in (but not control) the defense, compromise, or settlement thereof, but the fees and expenses
of such counsel employed by the Indemnified Party shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Party unless (i) the Indemnifying
Parties have agreed to pay such fees and expenses, or (ii) the named parties to any such Third-Party Claim (including any impleaded
parties) include an Indemnified Party and an Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party shall have been advised by its counsel
that there may be a conflict of interest between such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Parties in the conduct of the defense
thereof, and in any such case the reasonable documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses of one separate counsel of the Indemnified
Party shall be borne by the Indemnifying Parties subject to the limitations set forth in this Article XI.</P>

the same prior to a final judgment thereon or to forgo appeal with respect thereto, then the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying
Parties prompt written notice thereof and the Indemnifying Parties shall have the right to participate in the settlement, assume
or reassume the defense thereof or prosecute such appeal, in each case at the Indemnifying Parties&rsquo; expense. The Indemnifying
Parties shall not, without the prior written consent of such Indemnified Party settle or compromise or consent to entry of any
judgment with respect to any such Third-Party Claim (i) in which any relief other than the payment of money damages is or may be
sought against such Indemnified Party, (ii) in which such Third-Party Claim could be reasonably expected to impose or create a
monetary liability on the part of the Indemnified Party (such as an increase in the Indemnified Party&rsquo;s income Tax) other
than the monetary claim of the third party in such Third-Party Claim being paid pursuant to such settlement or judgment, or (iii)
which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant, person conducting such investigation or initiating

Representative</U>. By virtue of the adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, the approval of the
principal terms of the Merger, and the consummation of the Merger or participating in the Merger and receiving the benefits thereof,
including the right to receive the consideration payable in connection with the Merger, each Company Securityholder shall be deemed
to have appointed the designation of, and hereby designates, Shareholder Representative Services LLC as the Shareholders&rsquo;
Representative for all purposes in connection with this Agreement and the agreements ancillary hereto, including, but not limited
to, (i) to give and receive notices and communications to Purchaser for any purpose under this Agreement and the Additional Agreements,
(ii) to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts
and awards of arbitrators with respect to any indemnification claims (including Third-Party Claims) under Section 11.1 or, following
the Closing, other disputes arising under or related to this Agreement, (iii) to enter into and deliver the Escrow Agreement on
behalf of each of the Company Securityholders, (iv) to authorize or object to delivery to Purchaser of the Escrow Fund, or any
portion thereof, in satisfaction of indemnification claims by the Purchaser in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow Agreement,
(v) to act on behalf of Company Securityholders in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement, the securities described herein
and any other document or instrument executed in connection with the Agreement and the Merger and (vi) to take all actions necessary
or appropriate in the judgment of the Shareholders&rsquo; Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing. The Shareholders&rsquo;
Representative may resign at any time. Such agency may be changed by the Company Securityholders from time to time upon no less
than twenty (20) days prior written notice to the Purchaser, provided, however, that the Shareholders&rsquo; Representative may
not be removed unless holders of a majority of the shares of Company Capital Stock (on an as converted to Ordinary Shares and
Ordinary A Shares basis) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time agree to such removal. Any vacancy in the position
of Shareholders&rsquo; Representative may be filled by approval of the holders of a majority of the shares of Company Capital
Stock (on an as converted to Ordinary Shares and Ordinary A Shares basis) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
No bond shall be required of the Shareholders&rsquo; Representative. The Shareholders&rsquo; Representative will incur no liability
of any kind with respect to any action or omission by the Shareholders&rsquo; Representative in connection with the Shareholders&rsquo;
Representative&rsquo;s services pursuant to this Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, except in the event of liability
directly resulting from the Shareholders&rsquo; Representative&rsquo;s gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Shareholders&rsquo;
Representative shall not be liable for any action or omission pursuant to the advice of counsel. The Company Securityholders will
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Shareholders&rsquo; Representative from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages,
claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts
and their staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment) (collectively, &ldquo;<U>Representative Losses</U>&rdquo;)
arising out of or in connection with the Shareholders&rsquo; Representative&rsquo;s execution and performance of this Agreement
and any agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; provided, that Representative
Losses shall not include costs (other than third party expenses) incurred by the Shareholders&rsquo; Representative in the ordinary
course of business of the Shareholders&rsquo; Representative under the engagement letter entered into by the Shareholders&rsquo;
Representative, the Company, and certain of the Company Securityholders; provided, further, that in the event that any such Representative
Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Shareholders&rsquo;
Representative, the Shareholders&rsquo; Representative will reimburse the Company Securityholders the amount of such indemnified
Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the Shareholders&rsquo;
Representative by the Company Securityholders, any such Representative Losses may be recovered by the Shareholders&rsquo; Representative
from (x) the funds in the Expense Fund, and (y) the amounts in the Escrow Fund at such time as remaining amounts would otherwise
be distributable to the Company Securityholders; provided, that while this section allows the Shareholders&rsquo; Representative
to be paid from the aforementioned sources of funds, this does not relieve the Company Securityholders from their obligation to
promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Shareholders&rsquo; Representative
from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the Shareholders&rsquo; Representative be required
to advance its own funds on behalf of the Company Securityholders or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, any restrictions or limitations on liability or indemnification obligations of, or provisions limiting the recourse
against non-parties otherwise applicable to, the Company Securityholders set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended
to be applicable to the indemnities provided to the Shareholders&rsquo; Representative under this section. The foregoing indemnities
will survive the Closing, the resignation or removal of the Shareholders&rsquo; Representative or the termination of this Agreement.
Upon the Closing, the Company will wire US$30,000 (the &ldquo;<U>Expense Fund</U>&rdquo;) to the Shareholders&rsquo; Representative,
which will be used for the purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing the Shareholders&rsquo; Representative for, any third party
expenses pursuant to this Agreement and the agreements ancillary hereto. The Company Securityholders will not receive any interest
or earnings on the Expense Fund and irrevocably transfer and assign to the Shareholders&rsquo; Representative any ownership right
that they may otherwise have had in any such interest or earnings.&nbsp;The Shareholders&rsquo; Representative will not be liable
for any loss of principal of the Expense Fund other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Shareholders&rsquo;
Representative will hold these&nbsp;funds&nbsp;separate from its corporate&nbsp;funds, will not use these&nbsp;funds&nbsp;for
its operating&nbsp;expenses&nbsp;or any other corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these&nbsp;funds&nbsp;available
to its&nbsp;creditors&nbsp;in the event of bankruptcy. As soon as practicable following the completion of the Shareholders&rsquo;
Representative&rsquo;s responsibilities, the Shareholders&rsquo; Representative will deliver any remaining balance of the Expense
Fund to the Company. For tax purposes, the Expense Fund will be treated as having been received and voluntarily set aside by the
Company at the time of Closing.</P>
