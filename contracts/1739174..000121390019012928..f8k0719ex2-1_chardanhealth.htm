(a) The Company, Purchaser or any Person acting on their behalf (each, a "
_Payor_ "), shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
are required to be deducted and withheld therefrom under any applicable
provision of federal, local or foreign Tax law or under any applicable legal
requirements (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the regulation of
withholding from assets and services). To the extent such amounts are so

paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid (each,
a " _Payee_ "), and the Payor shall promptly provide the applicable Payee
with a document evidencing the amount so withheld and remitted to the Tax
authority with respect to the payment made to such Payee. If any Person

prior to its submission and such confirmation shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) confirming, among other things, that (1) in
relation to the consideration to be paid to the holders of 102
Company Securities, that the payment of consideration in respect of 102
Company Securities with respect to which the minimum trust period required by
Section 102 of the Ordinance has not passed, will not constitute a violation
of the requirements of Section 102 of the Ordinance as long as such
consideration is deposited with the 102 Trustee, and that payments of
consideration made to the 102 Trustee under this Agreement shall not be
subject to withholding of Israeli Tax, and (2) that the assumption of the
Company Options will not trigger a taxable event and that tax continuity will
apply to such assumed options such that they shall continue to be subject to
the same tax arrangement as applied to the Company Options (the " _Israeli Tax
Ruling_ ").

Ruling shall in all circumstances be subject to the prior written
confirmation of Purchaser or its counsel which confirmation shall not be

shares of Purchaser Common Stock sold in Purchaser's IPO who shall have
elected to redeem their shares of Purchaser Common Stock pursuant to the

Account. Prior to the Closing, none of the funds held in the Trust Account

obligations required to be performed by it to date under, and is not in

understood and agreed that as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no
event later than five (5) Business Days after receiving all necessary
information relating to the Company from the Company for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement, the Purchaser shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy
Statement, or such other form, statement, or report as may be required under
the United States federal securities laws (such Proxy Statement, or such other

or supplements thereto, the " _SEC Statement_ ") for the purpose of seeking

opportunity to review and comment thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither the Company nor the Purchaser will file any SEC Statement or Other
Filings without the other party's approval (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Purchaser and the Company
will advise the other parties hereto promptly after it receives any oral or
written request by the SEC for amendment of the SEC Statement or Other
Filings, as applicable, or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests
by the SEC for additional information and each party will promptly provide the
other with copies of any written communication between it or any of its
representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, any state securities
commission or their respective staffs, on the other hand, with respect to the
SEC Statement or the Merger. Purchaser and the Company shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts, after consultation with each other, to
resolve all such requests or comments with respect to the SEC Statement or
Other Filings as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt thereof.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Purchaser and the
Company shall cooperate with each other in the preparation of each of
SEC Statement and Other Filing and each of Purchaser and the Company shall
furnish the other with all information concerning it and its Affiliates as
the requesting party (after consulting with counsel) may deem reasonably
necessary or advisable in connection with the preparation of the SEC
Statement or Other Filings, as applicable. Purchaser and the Company shall
notify each other promptly of the time when the SEC Statement shall be
declared definitive, of the issuance of any stop order or suspension of the
qualification of the Purchaser Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or
the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the SEC Statement,
Other Filings or for additional information.

  



  

   

49

Filing, none of the Company Information, Required Company Financial
Statements or other financial information supplied by the Company in
connection with the SEC Statement or Other Filing shall contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

  



  

(d) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to
Purchaser or the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, directors,
officers or stockholders, should be discovered by Purchaser or the Company
which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either the SEC
Statement or Other Filings, so that any such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment
or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC
and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to Purchaser's stockholders.

  



  

9.4 _Confidentiality_. Except as necessary to complete the Proxy Statement or
any other SEC Statements or Other Filings, the Company, on the one hand, and
Purchaser and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall hold and shall cause their
respective representatives to hold in strict confidence, unless compelled to
disclose by judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of
Law, all documents and information concerning the other party furnished to it
by such other party or its representatives in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except to the extent that such
information can be shown to have been (a) previously known by the party to
which it was furnished, (b) in the public domain through no fault of such
party or (c) later lawfully acquired from other sources, which source is not
the agent of the other party, by the party to which it was furnished), and
each party shall not release or disclose such information to any other
person, except its representatives in connection with this Agreement. In the
event that any party believes that it is required to disclose any such
confidential information pursuant to applicable Laws, to the extent legally
permissible, such party shall give timely written notice to the other party so
that such party may have an opportunity to obtain a protective order or other
appropriate relief. Each party shall be deemed to have satisfied its
obligations to hold confidential information concerning or supplied by the
other party if it exercises the same care as it takes to preserve
confidentiality for its own similar information. The parties acknowledge that
some previously confidential information will be required to be disclosed in
the Proxy Statement and any other SEC Statements and Other Filings.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, following the
Closing, the Shareholders' Representative shall be permitted to disclose
information as required by Law or to employees, advisors, agents or
consultants of the Shareholders' Representative and to the Company
Securityholders, in each case who have a need to know such information,
provided that such persons are subject to confidentiality obligations
with respect thereto.

Shares (the " _Indemnifiable Loss Limit_ "). The Purchaser shall not be
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 11.1 unless and until
the aggregate amount of Losses to Purchaser equals at least $1,246,875 (the "
_Basket_ "), at which time, subject to the Indemnifiable Loss Limit, the
Purchaser shall be entitled to indemnification for any Losses above the
Basket, less $124,687.50 per Loss. The Escrow Participants shall have no
liability or obligation to indemnify any Purchaser or any other Indemnified
Party under this Agreement with respect to the breach or inaccuracy of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement based on any matter, fact or
circumstance known to Purchaser or any of its representatives or disclosed in
the information set out in any Schedule to this Agreement.

  



  

   

55

 



    



  

11.2 _Procedure_. The following shall apply with respect to all claims by the
Purchaser (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") for indemnification pursuant to this
Article XI:

  



  

(a) An Indemnified Party shall give the Shareholders' Representative prompt
notice (an " _Indemnification Notice_ ") of any third-party action with
respect to which such Indemnified Party seeks indemnification pursuant to
Section 11.1 or 11.2 (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), which shall describe in
reasonable detail the Loss that has been or may be suffered by the
Indemnified Party. The failure to give the Indemnification Notice shall not
impair any of the rights or benefits of such Indemnified Party under Sections
11.1 or 11.2, except to the extent such failure prejudices the ability of the
Escrow Participants (any of such parties, " _Indemnifying Parties_ ") to
defend such claim or increases the amount of such liability.

  



  

(b) In the case of any Third-Party Claims as to which indemnification is
sought by any Indemnified Party, such Indemnified Party shall be entitled, at
the sole expense and liability of the Escrow Participants, to exercise full
control of the defense, compromise or settlement of any Third-Party Claim
unless the Shareholders' Representative, within a reasonable time after the
giving of an Indemnification Notice by the Indemnified Party (but in any
event within twenty (20) Business Days thereafter), shall notify such
Indemnified Party in writing of the intention of the Shareholders'
Representative to assume the defense thereof.

  



  

(c) If the Indemnifying Parties assume the defense of any such Third-Party
Claim pursuant to Section 11.3(b), then the Indemnified Party shall cooperate
with the Indemnifying Parties in any manner reasonably requested in connection
with the defense, and the Indemnified Party shall have the right to be kept
fully informed by the Indemnifying Parties and their legal counsel with
respect to the status of any legal proceedings, to the extent not
inconsistent with the preservation of attorney-client or work product
privilege. If the Indemnifying Parties so assume the defense of any such
Third-Party Claim the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
employ separate counsel and to participate in (but not control) the defense,
compromise, or settlement thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
employed by the Indemnified Party shall be at the expense of such Indemnified
Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Parties have agreed to pay such fees and
expenses, or (ii) the named parties to any such Third-Party Claim (including
any impleaded parties) include an Indemnified Party and an Indemnifying Party
and such Indemnified Party shall have been advised by its counsel that there
may be a conflict of interest between such Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Parties in the conduct of the defense thereof, and in any such
case the reasonable documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses of one separate
counsel of the Indemnified Party shall be borne by the Indemnifying Parties
subject to the limitations set forth in this Article XI.

  



  

   

56

 



    



  

(d) If the Indemnifying Parties elect to assume the defense of any Third-
Party Claim pursuant to Section 11.3(b), the Indemnified Party shall not pay,
or permit to be paid, any part of any claim or demand arising from such
asserted liability unless the Indemnifying Parties withdraw from the defense
of such Third-Party Claim, or unless a judgment is entered against the
Indemnified Party for such liability by an Authority of competent
jurisdiction. If the Indemnifying Parties do not elect to defend, or if, after
commencing or undertaking any such defense, the Indemnifying Parties withdraw
such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to undertake the
defense or settlement thereof, at the Indemnifying Parties' expense subject to
the limitations set forth in this Article XI. In the event the Indemnified
Party retains control of the Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will not
settle the subject claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.

  



  

(e) If the Indemnified Party undertakes the defense of any such Third-Party
Claim pursuant to Section 11.1 or 11.2 and proposes to settle the same prior
to a final judgment thereon or to forgo appeal with respect thereto, then the
Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Parties prompt written notice
thereof and the Indemnifying Parties shall have the right to participate in
the settlement, assume or reassume the defense thereof or prosecute such
appeal, in each case at the Indemnifying Parties' expense. The
Indemnifying Parties shall not, without the prior written consent of such
Indemnified Party settle or compromise or consent to entry of any judgment
with respect to any such Third-Party Claim (i) in which any relief other than
the payment of money damages is or may be sought against such Indemnified
Party, (ii) in which such Third-Party Claim could be reasonably expected to
impose or create a monetary liability on the part of the Indemnified Party
(such as an increase in the Indemnified Party's income Tax) other than the
monetary claim of the third party in such Third-Party Claim being paid
pursuant to such settlement or judgment, or (iii) which does not include as
an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant, person conducting
such investigation or initiating such hearing, plaintiff or petitioner to
such Indemnified Party of a release from all liability with respect to such
Third-Party Claim and all other actions (known or unknown) arising or which
might arise out of the same facts.

  



  

(f) Following the Closing, the disinterested members of the board of
directors of the Purchaser shall have the authority to institute and
prosecute any claims for indemnification hereunder in good faith on behalf of
the Purchaser to enforce the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

11.3 _Escrow of Escrow Shares by Escrow Participants_. The Company hereby
authorizes the Purchaser to deliver the Escrow Shares into escrow (the "
_Escrow Fund_ ") pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. For purposes of this
Article XI, the Escrow Shares are valued at the greater of: (i) $10.00 per
share; or (ii) the Purchaser Redemption Amount (the " _Escrow Share Value_ ").

  



  

(a) _Escrow Shares. Payment of Dividends; Voting_. Any dividends, interest
payments, or other distributions of any kind made in respect of the Escrow
Shares will be delivered promptly to the Escrow Agent to be held in escrow
(the " _Escrow Income_ "). Each Escrow Participant shall be entitled to vote
such Escrow Participant's Escrow Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Shares on any
matters to come before the shareholders of the Purchaser. It is intended that
for U.S. federal income tax purposes that while the Escrow Shares are held by
the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Participants shall be treated owners of the
Escrow Shares, and to the extent required by Applicable Law, the Escrow Agent
shall report in a manner consistent with such treatment.

  



  

   

57

 



    



  

(b) _Distribution of Escrow Shares_. At the times provided for in Section
11.3(d), the Escrow Shares shall be distributed to each Escrow Participant in
accordance with such Escrow Participant's Escrow Pro Rata Portion. The
Purchaser will take such action as may be necessary to cause such
certificates to be issued in the names of the appropriate persons.
Certificates representing Escrow Shares so issued that are subject to resale
restrictions under applicable securities laws will bear a legend to that
effect. No fractional shares shall be released and delivered from the Escrow
Fund and all fractional shares shall be rounded to the nearest whole share.

  



  

(c) _Assignability_. No Escrow Shares or any beneficial interest therein may
be pledged, sold, assigned or transferred, including by operation of law, by
the Escrow Participants or be taken or reached by any legal or equitable
process in satisfaction of any debt or other liability of the Escrow
Participants, prior to the delivery to such Escrow Participants of the Escrow
Fund by the Escrow Agent as provided herein.

  



  

(d) _Release from Escrow Fund_. As soon as practicable, but in no event later
than five (5) Business Days, following expiration of the Survival Period (the
" _Release Date_ "), the Escrow Shares will be released from escrow to the
Escrow Participants (in accordance with such Escrow Participant's Escrow Pro
Rata Portion) less the number of Escrow Shares (at an assumed value equal to
the Escrow Share Value per Escrow Share) reasonably necessary to serve as
security for Losses set forth in any Indemnification Notice delivered by the
Purchaser prior to the expiration of the Survival Period that remain pending
and unresolved. Prior to the Release Date, the Shareholders' Representative
and the Purchaser shall jointly issue to the Escrow Agent a certificate
executed by each of them instructing the Escrow Agent to release such number
of Escrow Shares (in accordance with such Escrow Participant's Escrow Pro
Rata Portion) determined in accordance with this Section 11.4(d). Promptly,
but in no event later than five (5) Business Days, following the resolution
in accordance with the provisions of this Article XI of any claim(s) for
indemnification that remain unresolved as of the Release Date the
Shareholders' Representative and the Purchaser shall jointly issue to the
Escrow Agent a certificate executed by each of them instructing the Escrow
Agent to release to each Escrow Participant (in accordance with such Escrow
Participant's Escrow Pro Rata Portion) the number of Escrow Shares retained in
escrow following the resolution of such claim(s) and not released to
Purchaser.

  



  

11.4 _Payment of Indemnification_. In the event that Purchaser is entitled to
any indemnification for any Losses pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Purchaser's sole and exclusive remedy for such Losses shall be the recovery
of a number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock from the Escrow Shares having
a value equal to the Losses that have been finally determined to be owing to
the Purchaser in accordance with this Article XI (at an assumed value equal
to the Escrow Share Value per Escrow Share), in each case, subject to the
limitations set forth in this Article XI. Any payments to Purchaser from the
Escrow Shares will be treated as a reduction in the number of shares of
Purchaser Common Stock issued to the Escrow Participants for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

  



  

11.5 _Insurance_. In calculating amounts of Losses payable to an Indemnified
Party hereunder, the amount of any indemnified Losses shall be determined net
of amounts actually recovered under any insurance policy or other third party
reimbursement actually received.

  



  

   

58

 



    



  

11.6 _Survival of Indemnification Rights_. The representations and warranties
of the Company shall survive until six (6) months (the "Survival Period")
following the Closing. The covenants of the Company contained in this
Agreement to be performed prior to Closing shall expire and be of no further
force or effect as of the Closing, provided, that claims for breach or
nonfulfillment thereof shall survive until the expiration of the Survival
Period. The indemnification to which any Indemnified Party is entitled
from the Indemnifying Parties pursuant to Section 11.1 for Losses shall be
effective so long as it is asserted prior to the expiration of the Survival
Period; provided, that in the event that any Indemnification Notice shall have
been given in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement prior to the
expiration of the Survival Period and such claim has not been finally resolved
by the expiration of the Survival Period, the representations, warranties,
covenants, agreements or obligations that are the subject of such
Indemnifications Notice shall survive solely for purposes of resolving such
claim until such matters are finally resolved. The parties acknowledge that
the time periods set forth in this Section 11.6 for the assertion of claims
under this Agreement are the result of arms'-length negotiation among the
parties and that they intend for the time periods to be enforced as agreed by
the parties without regard to the applicable statute of limitations with
respect to such matters and that the 20 year statute of limitations
contemplated by Title 10 of Section 8106(c) of the Delaware Code shall not
apply to this Agreement.

  



  

11.7 _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. The remedies provided in this Article XI
and the rights to enforce the Additional Agreements in accordance with
their terms shall be deemed the sole and exclusive remedies of the
Indemnified Parties, from and after the Closing Date, with respect to any and
all claims arising out of or related to this Agreement or in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby, except nothing in this Agreement (i)
will limit the parties' rights to seek injunctive relief or other equitable
remedies, (ii) would prevent Purchaser from bringing an action for fraud
(with scienter) against the Person who committed such Fraud (with scienter)
or (iv) limit the right of any Person to pursue remedies under any Additional
Agreement against the parties thereto.

  



  

ARTICLE XII

12.1 _Arbitration_.

  



  

(a) The parties shall promptly submit any dispute, claim, or controversy

meaning, effect, validity, termination, interpretation, performance, or
enforcement of this Agreement) or any alleged breach thereof (including any
action in tort, contract, equity, or otherwise), to binding arbitration before
one arbitrator (the " _Arbitrator_ "). Binding arbitration shall be the sole
means of resolving any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or
relating to this Agreement (including with respect to the meaning, effect,
validity, termination, interpretation, performance or enforcement of this
Agreement) or any alleged breach thereof (including any claim in tort,
contract, equity, or otherwise).

  



  

(b) If the parties cannot agree upon the Arbitrator, the Arbitrator shall be

59

 



    



  

(c) Except with respect to matters set forth in Article II that relate to the
effectuation of the Merger, which are exclusively governed by the Law of the
State of Israel, the laws of the State of Delaware shall apply to any
arbitration hereunder. In any arbitration hereunder, this Agreement shall be
governed by the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to a contract
negotiated, signed, and wholly to be performed in the State of Delaware,
which laws the Arbitrator shall apply in rendering his decision. The
Arbitrator shall issue a written decision, setting forth findings of fact and
conclusions of law, within sixty (60) days after he shall have been selected.
The Arbitrator shall have no authority to award punitive or other exemplary
damages.

  



  

(d) The arbitration shall be held in New York, New York in accordance with
and under the then-current provisions of the rules of the
American Arbitration Association, except as otherwise provided herein.

  



  

(e) On application to the Arbitrator, any party shall have rights to
discovery to the same extent as would be provided under the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure, and the Federal Rules of Evidence shall apply to any
arbitration under this Agreement; provided, however, that the Arbitrator
shall limit any discovery or evidence such that his decision shall be rendered
within the period referred to in Section 12.1(c).

  



  

(f) The Arbitrator may, at his discretion and at the expense of the party who
will bear the cost of the arbitration, employ experts to assist him in his
determinations.

  



  

(g) The costs of the arbitration proceeding and any proceeding in court to
confirm any arbitration award or to obtain relief as provided in Section
12.1(h), as applicable (including actual attorneys' fees and costs), shall be
borne by the unsuccessful party (if the Shareholders' Representative, then
solely on behalf of the Company Securityholders) and shall be awarded as
part of the Arbitrator's decision, unless the Arbitrator shall otherwise
allocate such costs in such decision. The determination of the Arbitrator
shall be final and binding upon the parties and not subject to appeal.

  



  

(h) Any judgment upon any award rendered by the Arbitrator may be entered in
and enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties expressly
consent to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts (Federal and state) in
Delaware, to enforce any award of the Arbitrator or to render any
provisional, temporary, or injunctive relief in connection with or in aid of
the Arbitration. The parties expressly consent to the personal and subject
matter jurisdiction of the Arbitrator to arbitrate any and all matters to be
submitted to arbitration hereunder. None of the parties hereto shall
challenge any arbitration hereunder on the grounds that any party
necessary to such arbitration (including the parties hereto) shall have been
absent from such arbitration for any reason, including that such party shall
have been the subject of any bankruptcy, reorganization, or insolvency
proceeding.

  



  

(i) The parties (in the case of the Shareholders' Representative, solely on
behalf of the Company Securityholders) shall indemnify the Arbitrator and any
experts employed by the Arbitrator and hold them harmless from and against any
claim or demand arising out of any arbitration under this Agreement or any
agreement contemplated hereby, unless resulting from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the person indemnified.

  



  

   

60

 



    



  

(j) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement. The parties expressly
consent to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts (Federal and state)
in Delaware to render such relief and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

12.2 _Waiver of Jury Trial; Exemplary Damages_.

  



  

(a) THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND
IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT EACH SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, IN ANY COURT IN WHICH AN ACTION MAY BE
COMMENCED, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT. NO PARTY
SHALL BE AWARDED PUNITIVE OR OTHER EXEMPLARY DAMAGES RESPECTING ANY DISPUTE
ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

  



  

(b) Each of the parties to this Agreement acknowledge that each has been
represented in connection with the signing of this waiver by
independent legal counsel selected by the respective party and that such
party has discussed the legal consequences and import of this waiver with
legal counsel. Each of the parties to this Agreement further acknowledge that
each has read and understands the meaning of this waiver and grants this
waiver knowingly, voluntarily, without duress and only after consideration of
the consequences of this waiver with legal counsel.

  



  

ARTICLE XIII 
 TERMINATION

  



  

13.1 _Termination Without Default_.

  



  

(a) In the event that the Closing of the transactions contemplated hereunder
has not occurred by October 31, 2019 (the " _Outside Closing Date_ ");
provided, that if the SEC has not declared the Proxy Statement effective on or
prior to September 30, 2019, the Outside Closing Date shall be automatically
extended to November 30, 2019, and no material breach of this Agreement
by the party (i.e., the Purchaser or the Merger Sub, on one hand, or the
Company, on the other hand) seeking to terminate this Agreement shall have
occurred or have been made (as provided in Section 13.2 hereof), Purchaser or
the Company shall have the right, at its sole option, to terminate this
Agreement without liability to the other party. Such right may be exercised by
Purchaser or the Company, as the case may be, giving written notice to the
other at any time after the Outside Closing Date.

  



  

   

61

 



    



  

(b) In the event an Authority shall have issued an Order, having the effect
of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger,
which Order is final and non-appealable, Purchaser or the Company shall have
the right, at its sole option, to terminate this Agreement without liability
to the other party.

  



  

13.2 _Termination Upon Default_.

  



  

(a) The Purchaser may terminate this Agreement by giving notice to the
Company on or prior to the Closing Date, without prejudice to any rights or
obligations Purchaser may have, if: (i) the Company shall have breached any
representation, warranty, agreement or covenant contained herein to be
performed on or prior to the Closing Date, which has rendered the satisfaction
of any of the conditions set forth in Section 10.2 impossible; and (ii) such
breach shall not be cured by the earlier of the Outside Closing Date and
thirty (30) days following receipt by the Company of a written notice from
Purchaser describing in reasonable detail the nature of such breach.

  



  

(b) The Company may terminate this Agreement by giving notice to Purchaser,
without prejudice to any rights or obligations the Company may have, if: (i)
Purchaser shall have breached any of its covenants, agreements,
representations, and warranties contained herein to be performed on or prior
to the Closing Date, which has rendered the satisfaction of any of the
conditions set forth in Section 10.3 impossible; and (ii) such breach shall
not be cured by the earlier of the Outside Closing Date and thirty (30) days
following receipt by Purchaser of a written notice from the Company
describing in reasonable detail the nature of such breach.

  



  

13.3 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
this Article XIII, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect without
liability of any party (or any shareholder, director, officer, employee,
Affiliate, agent, consultant or representative of such party) to the other
party hereto; provided that, if such termination shall result from the willful
breach by a party of its covenants and agreements hereunder or fraud, such
party shall be fully liable for any and all liabilities and damages
incurred or suffered by the other party as a result of such failure. The
provisions of Section 9.4, Article XII, this Section 13.3 and Article XIV
shall survive any termination hereof pursuant to this Article XIII.

14.2 _Amendments; No Waivers; Remedies_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement cannot be amended, except by a writing signed by each
party, and cannot be terminated orally or by course of conduct. No provision
hereof can be waived, except by a writing signed by the party against whom
such waiver is to be enforced, and any such waiver shall apply only in the
particular instance in which such waiver shall have been given.

  



  

(b) Neither any failure or delay in exercising any right or remedy hereunder
or in requiring satisfaction of any condition herein nor any course of
dealing shall constitute a waiver of or prevent any party from enforcing any
right or remedy or from requiring satisfaction of any condition. No notice to
or demand on a party waives or otherwise affects any obligation of that party
or impairs any right of the party giving such notice or making such demand,
including any right to take any action without notice or demand not
otherwise required by this Agreement. No exercise of any right or remedy with
respect to a breach of this Agreement shall preclude exercise of any other
right or remedy, as appropriate to make the aggrieved party whole with respect
to such breach, or subsequent exercise of any right or remedy with respect to
any other breach.

  



  

(c) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no statement herein of any
right or remedy shall impair any other right or remedy stated herein or that
otherwise may be available.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, neither shall any party
seek, nor shall any party be liable for, punitive or exemplary damages, under
any tort, contract, equity, or other legal theory, with respect to any breach
(or alleged breach) of this Agreement or any provision hereof or any matter
otherwise relating hereto or arising in connection herewith.

  



  

   

64

 



    



  

14.3 _Arm 's length bargaining; no presumption against drafter_. This
Agreement has been negotiated at arm's-length by parties of equal bargaining
strength, each represented by counsel or having had but declined the
opportunity to be represented by counsel and having participated in the
drafting of this Agreement. This Agreement creates no fiduciary or other
special relationship between the parties, and no such relationship otherwise
exists. No presumption in favor of or against any party in the construction
or interpretation of this Agreement or any provision hereof shall be made
based upon which Person might have drafted this Agreement or such provision.

  



  

14.4 _Publicity_. Except as required by law or applicable stock exchange
rules and except with respect to the Additional Purchaser SEC Documents, the
parties agree that neither they nor their agents shall issue any press release
or make any other public disclosure concerning the transactions contemplated
hereunder without the prior approval of the other party hereto. If a party is
required to make such a disclosure as required by law or applicable stock
exchange rules, the party making such determination will, if practicable
in the circumstances, use reasonable commercial efforts to allow the other
party reasonable time to comment on such disclosure in advance of its
issuance. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
following the Closing Date and the public announcement of the Merger, the
Shareholders' Representative shall be permitted to include in its marketing
materials that it has been engaged to serve as the Shareholders'
Representative in connection with the Merger as long as such materials do not
disclose any of the other terms of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated herein.

  



  

14.5 _Expenses_. The costs and expenses in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Purchaser after the
Closing. If the Closing does not take place, each party (in the case of the
Shareholders' Representative, solely on behalf of the Company
Securityholders) shall be responsible for its own expenses.

  



  

14.6 _No Assignment or Delegation_. No party may assign any right or delegate
any obligation hereunder, including by merger, consolidation, operation of
law, or otherwise, without the written consent of the other party. Any
purported assignment or delegation without such consent shall be void, in
addition to constituting a material breach of this Agreement.

  



  

14.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with
and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
the conflict of laws principles thereof, except that matters referred to in
Article II that relate to the effectuation of the Merger are exclusively
governed by the Law of the State of Israel.

  



  

14.8 _Counterparts; facsimile signatures_. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which
shall constitute one agreement. This Agreement shall become effective upon
delivery to each party of an executed counterpart or the earlier delivery to
each party of original, photocopied, or electronically transmitted signature
pages that together (but need not individually) bear the signatures of all
other parties.

  



  

   

65

 



    



  

14.9 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement together with the Additional
Agreements, sets forth the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior and
contemporaneous understandings and agreements related thereto
(whether written or oral), all of which are merged herein. No provision of
this Agreement or any Additional Agreement may be explained or qualified by
any agreement, negotiations, understanding, discussion, conduct or course of
conduct or by any trade usage. Except as otherwise expressly stated herein or
any Additional Agreement, there is no condition precedent to the effectiveness
of any provision hereof or thereof.

  



  

14.10 _Severability_. A determination by a court or other legal authority
that any provision that is not of the essence of this Agreement is
legally invalid shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
provision hereof. The parties shall cooperate in good faith to substitute (or
cause such court or other legal authority to substitute) for any provision so
held to be invalid a valid provision, as alike in substance to such invalid
provision as is lawful.

  



  

14.11 _Construction of certain terms and references; captions_. In this
Agreement:

  



  

(a) References to particular sections and subsections, schedules, and
exhibits not otherwise specified are cross-references to sections and
subsections, schedules, and exhibits of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) The words "herein," "hereof," "hereunder," and words of similar import
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of
this Agreement, and, unless the context requires otherwise, "party" means a
party signatory hereto.

  



  

(c) Any use of the singular or plural, or the masculine, feminine, or neuter
gender, includes the others, unless the context otherwise requires;
"including" means "including without limitation;" "or" means "and/or;" "any"
means "any one, more than one, or all;" and, unless otherwise specified, any
financial or accounting term has the meaning of the term under United States
generally accepted accounting principles as consistently applied
heretofore by the Company.

  



  

(d) Unless otherwise specified, any reference to any agreement (including
this Agreement), instrument, or other document includes all
schedules, exhibits, or other attachments referred to therein, and any
reference to a statute or other law includes any rule, regulation, ordinance,
or the like promulgated thereunder, in each case, as amended, restated,
supplemented, or otherwise modified from time to time. Any reference to a
numbered schedule means the same-numbered section of the disclosure schedule.
Any reference in a schedule contained in the disclosure schedules delivered
by a party hereunder shall be deemed to be an exception to (or, as
applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) the applicable representations and
warranties (or applicable covenants) that are contained in the section or
subsection of this Agreement that corresponds to such schedule and any other
representations and warranties of such party that are contained in this
Agreement to which the relevance of such item thereto is reasonably apparent
on its face. The mere inclusion of an item in a schedule as an exception to
(or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) a representation
or warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a
material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item
would have a Material Adverse Effect or establish any standard of materiality
to define further the meaning of such terms for purposes of this Agreement.

(e) If any action is required to be taken or notice is required to be given
within a specified number of days following a specific date or event, the day
of such date or event is not counted in determining the last day for such
action or notice. If any action is required to be taken or notice is required
to be given on or before a particular day which is not a Business Day, such
action or notice shall be considered timely if it is taken or given on or
before the next Business Day.

  



  

(f) Captions are not a part of this Agreement, but are included for
convenience, only.

  



  

(g) For the avoidance of any doubt, all references in this Agreement to "the
knowledge or best knowledge of the Company" or similar terms shall be deemed
to include the actual knowledge of Sigal Fattal, Assaf Oron and Jonathan
Solomon.

  



  

14.12 _Further Assurances_. Each party shall execute and deliver such
documents and take such action, as may reasonably be considered within the
scope of such party's obligations hereunder, necessary to effectuate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

14.13 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Section 9.5 and
Section 14.16, neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof confers any
benefit or right upon or may be enforced by any Person not a signatory hereto.

  



  

14.14 _Waiver_. Reference is made to the final prospectus of the Purchaser,
dated December 18, 2018 (the " _Prospectus_ "). The Company has read the
Prospectus and understands that the Purchaser has established the Trust
Account for the benefit of the public shareholders of the Purchaser and the
underwriters of the IPO pursuant to the Trust Agreement and that, except for a
portion of the interest earned on the amounts held in the Trust Account, the
Purchaser may disburse monies from the Trust Account only for the purposes
set forth in the Trust Agreement. For and in consideration of the Purchaser
agreeing to enter into this Agreement, each of the Company and the
Shareholders' Representative, for itself and on behalf of the Shareholders,
hereby agrees that it does not have any right, title, interest or claim of
any kind in or to any monies in the Trust Account and hereby agrees that it
will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any claim it may have in
the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or
agreements with the Purchaser.

14.15 _Shareholders ' Representative_. By virtue of the adoption of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, the approval of
the principal terms of the Merger, and the consummation of the Merger or
participating in the Merger and receiving the benefits thereof, including the
right to receive the consideration payable in connection with the Merger, each
Company Securityholder shall be deemed to have appointed the designation of,
and hereby designates, Shareholder Representative Services LLC as the
Shareholders' Representative for all purposes in connection with this
Agreement and the agreements ancillary hereto, including, but not limited to,
(i) to give and receive notices and communications to Purchaser for any
purpose under this Agreement and the Additional Agreements, (ii) to agree to,
negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of and demand arbitration
and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to
any indemnification claims (including Third-Party Claims) under Section 11.1
or, following the Closing, other disputes arising under or related to this
Agreement, (iii) to enter into and deliver the Escrow Agreement on behalf of
each of the Company Securityholders, (iv) to authorize or object to delivery
to Purchaser of the Escrow Fund, or any portion thereof, in satisfaction of
indemnification claims by the Purchaser in accordance with the provisions of
the Escrow Agreement, (v) to act on behalf of Company Securityholders in
accordance with the provisions of the Agreement, the securities described
herein and any other document or instrument executed in connection with the
Agreement and the Merger and (vi) to take all actions necessary or
appropriate in the judgment of the Shareholders' Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing. The Shareholders' Representative may resign
at any time. Such agency may be changed by the Company Securityholders from
time to time upon no less than twenty (20) days prior written notice to the
Purchaser, provided, however, that the Shareholders' Representative may not
be removed unless holders of a majority of the shares of Company Capital Stock
(on an as converted to Ordinary Shares and Ordinary A Shares basis)
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time agree to such removal. Any
vacancy in the position of Shareholders' Representative may be filled by
approval of the holders of a majority of the shares of Company Capital Stock
(on an as converted to Ordinary Shares and Ordinary A Shares basis)
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No bond shall be
required of the Shareholders' Representative. The Shareholders' Representative
will incur no liability of any kind with respect to any action or omission by
the Shareholders' Representative in connection with the
Shareholders' Representative's services pursuant to this Agreement and any
agreements ancillary hereto, except in the event of liability directly
resulting from the Shareholders' Representative's gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Shareholders' Representative shall not be liable for any
action or omission pursuant to the advice of counsel. The Company
Securityholders will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Shareholders'
Representative from and against any and all losses, liabilities,
damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and
expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their
staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment)
(collectively, " _Representative Losses_ ") arising out of or in connection
with the Shareholders' Representative's execution and performance of this
Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such
Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; provided, that
Representative Losses shall not include costs (other than third party
expenses) incurred by the Shareholders' Representative in the ordinary course
of business of the Shareholders' Representative under the engagement letter
entered into by the Shareholders' Representative, the Company, and certain of
the Company Securityholders; provided, further, that in the event that any
such Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused
by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Shareholders' Representative, the Shareholders' Representative will reimburse
the Company Securityholders the amount of such indemnified Representative
Loss to the extent attributable to such gross negligence or willful
misconduct. If not paid directly to the Shareholders' Representative by the
Company Securityholders, any such Representative Losses may be recovered by
the Shareholders' Representative from (x) the funds in the Expense Fund, and
(y) the amounts in the Escrow Fund at such time as remaining amounts would
otherwise be distributable to the Company Securityholders; provided, that
while this section allows the Shareholders' Representative to be paid from
the aforementioned sources of funds, this does not relieve the Company
Securityholders from their obligation to promptly pay such Representative
Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Shareholders'
Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise.
In no event will the Shareholders' Representative be required to advance its
own funds on behalf of the Company Securityholders or otherwise.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions
or limitations on liability or indemnification obligations of, or provisions
limiting the recourse against non-parties otherwise applicable to, the
Company Securityholders set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not
intended to be applicable to the indemnities provided to the Shareholders'
Representative under this section. The foregoing indemnities will survive the
Closing, the resignation or removal of the Shareholders' Representative or the
termination of this Agreement. Upon the Closing, the Company will wire
US$30,000 (the " _Expense Fund_ ") to the Shareholders' Representative, which
will be used for the purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing the
Shareholders' Representative for, any third party expenses pursuant to this
Agreement and the agreements ancillary hereto. The Company Securityholders
will not receive any interest or earnings on the Expense Fund and irrevocably
transfer and assign to the Shareholders' Representative any ownership
right that they may otherwise have had in any such interest or earnings. The
Shareholders' Representative will not be liable for any loss of principal of
the Expense Fund other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Shareholders' Representative will hold these funds separate
from its corporate funds, will not use these funds for its operating expenses
or any other corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds
available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. As soon as practicable
following the completion of the Shareholders' Representative's
responsibilities, the Shareholders' Representative will deliver any remaining
balance of the Expense Fund to the Company. For tax purposes, the Expense
Fund will be treated as having been received and voluntarily set aside by
the Company at the time of Closing.

14.16 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may be enforced only against, and any
dispute, claim or controversy based upon, arising out of or related to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may be brought only
against, the entities that are expressly named as parties hereto and then
only with respect to the specific obligations set forth in this Agreement with
respect to such party. No past, present or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, shareholder, agent, attorney,
advisor, lender or representative or Affiliate of any named party to this
Agreement (which Persons are intended third party beneficiaries of
this Section 14.16) shall have any liability (whether in contract or tort, at
law or in equity or otherwise, or based upon any theory that seeks to impose
liability of an entity party against its owners or Affiliates) for any one or
more of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other
obligations or liabilities of such named party or for any dispute, claim or
controversy based on, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, provided, that this Section 14.16 shall not
apply to Section 14.15, which shall be enforceable by the Shareholders'
Representative in its entirety against the Company Securityholders.

  



  

14.17 _Waiver of Conflict; Privilege_.

  



  

(a) Each of the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that Goodwin Procter LLP
(" _Goodwin_ ") and Zysman, Aharoni, Gayer and Co (" _ZAG_ ", and together with
Goodwin, "Company Counsel") have each acted as counsel to the Company in
connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

   

69

 



    



  

(b) Purchaser hereby consents and agrees to, and agrees to cause the Company
to consent and agree to, Company Counsel representing the
Shareholders' Representative and/or any of the Company Securityholders
(collectively, the " _Seller Parties_ ") after the Closing, including with
respect to disputes in which the interests of the Seller Parties may be
directly adverse to Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Company).

  



  

(c) In connection with the foregoing, Purchaser hereby irrevocably waives and
agrees not to assert, and agrees to cause the Company to irrevocably waive
and not to assert, any conflict of interest arising from or in connection with
(i) either Company Counsel's prior representation of the Company or (ii)
either Company Counsel's representation of the Seller Parties after the
Closing.

  



  

(d) Purchaser further agrees, on behalf of itself and, after the Closing, on
behalf of the Company, that all communications in any form or
format whatsoever between or among any of either Company Counsel, the
Company, any of the Seller Parties, or any of their respective
directors, officers employees or other representatives that directly relate
to the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any dispute arising under this
Agreement (collectively, the " _Deal Communications_ ") shall be deemed to be
retained and owned collectively by the Company Securityholders, shall be
controlled by the Shareholders' Representative on behalf of the Company
Securityholders and shall not pass to or be claimed by Purchaser or the
Company. All Deal Communications that are attorney-client privileged (the "
_Privileged Deal Communications_ ") shall remain privileged after the Closing
and the privilege and the expectation of client confidence relating thereto
shall belong solely to the Shareholders' Representative and the Company
Securityholders, shall be controlled by the Shareholders' Representative on
behalf of the Company Securityholders and shall not pass to or be claimed by
Purchaser or the Company.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
any Indemnified Party, on the one hand, and a third party other than the
Shareholders' Representative or any Company Securityholder, on the other hand,
Purchaser or the Company may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent
the disclosure of the Privileged Deal Communications to such third party;
provided, however, that neither Purchaser nor the Company may waive such
privilege without the prior written consent of the Shareholders'
Representative. In the event that Purchaser or the Company is legally
required by an Order or otherwise to access or obtain a copy of all or
a portion of the Deal Communications, Purchaser (x) shall, to the extent
legally permissible, reasonably promptly notify the
Shareholders' Representative in writing (including by making specific
reference to this Section), (y) agrees that the Shareholders'
Representative can seek a protective order and (z) agrees to use, at the
Securityholders' sole cost and expense, commercially reasonable efforts to
assist therewith.

  



  

(f) To the extent that files or other materials maintained by either Company
Counsel constitute property of its clients, only the
Shareholders' Representative and the Company Securityholders shall hold such
property rights and neither Company Counsel shall have no duty to reveal or
disclose any such files or other materials or any Deal Communications by
reason of any attorney-client relationship between a Company Counsel, on the
one hand, and the Company, on the other hand.

SECURITYHOLDER NOR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE REPRESENTATIVES HAS MADE ANY
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER
RELATING TO THE COMPANY OR THE BUSINESS OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH THE

of the Company or any Company Securityholder, and are not and shall not be
deemed to be relied upon by Purchaser or Merger Sub in executing, delivering
and performing this Agreement, the Additional Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, in each case except for the representations
and warranties set forth in Article V, in each case, as modified by the

flows or the future financial condition of the Company or the future
business, operations or affairs of the Company.
