ARTICLE II

 

 _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK_

 

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common
Stock_ ") or any shares of capital stock of Purchaser:

 

(a) _Capital Stock of Purchaser_. Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Purchaser shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.

(b)  _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent- and Purchaser-Owned Stock_.
Any shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury
stock, and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Purchaser,
shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share
of Company Common Stock (including, subject to _Section 2.4_, shares of
Company Common Stock underlying any outstanding contingent equity grant issued
pursuant to an award agreement but other than shares to be canceled in
accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_, Dissenting

 



3  Shares and shares described in _Section 2.1(d)_) shall thereupon be
converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to
receive the Per Share Price without interest and subject to any applicable
withholding Taxes pursuant to _Section 2.2(g)_ (such amount, the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common
Stock shall no longer be issued or outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and the holders immediately prior to the
Effective Time of shares of Company Common Stock not represented by
certificates (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and the holders of certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company
Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be
paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Book-Entry Share or
Certificate in accordance with _Section 2.2(b)_ without interest (subject to
all applicable withholding Tax).

 

(d) _Excluded Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock held
by any Company Subsidiary or any Subsidiary of Parent (other than Purchaser)
will remain outstanding with appropriate adjustments to the number thereof to
preserve the relative percentage interest in the Company represented by such
shares.

 

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the "
_Paying Agent_ ") for the holders of the shares of Company Common Stock to
receive the funds to which holders of such shares of Company Common Stock
shall become entitled pursuant to this Agreement and enter into an agreement
reasonably acceptable to the Company with the Paying Agent relating to the
services to be performed by the Paying Agent. At or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall, or shall take all steps necessary to enable and cause
Purchaser to, deposit with the Paying Agent funds equal to the aggregate
Merger Consideration payable to holders of shares of Company Common Stock (the
" _Aggregate Merger Consideration_ " or the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Payment
Fund may, as determined by Parent, pending its disbursement pursuant to and
in accordance with this Agreement, be invested by the Paying Agent in (i)
short-term direct obligations of the United States of America or (ii) short-
term obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of
America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest. Any
interest and other income from such investments shall become part of the
Payment Fund; _provided_ , that any amount in the Payment Fund in excess of
the Aggregate Merger Consideration payable hereunder shall be disbursed to the
Surviving Corporation upon the termination of the Payment Fund pursuant to and
in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_. No investment by the Paying Agent of
the Payment Fund shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent from making the payments required by this _Article II_ and Parent shall
promptly replace any portion of the Payment Fund lost through any investment
made pursuant to this _Section 2.2(a)_. No investment by the Paying Agent of
the Payment Fund shall have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to
be made pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(b) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event
more than three (3) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company
Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which, in the case of shares of
Company Common Stock represented by Certificates, shall 

 



4  specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent, and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and
the Company may reasonably agree and shall be prepared prior to Closing) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Paying Agent or, in the case
of Book-Entry Shares, receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent (or
such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably
request), together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions (and such other customary
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent), the holder
of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor, subject to any required withholding Taxes, the Merger
Consideration, without interest, for each share of Company Common Stock
surrendered, and any Certificates surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. If
payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share in
exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (A)
the Person requesting such exchange present proper evidence of transfer and
(B) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of
the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is
not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_,
each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
as contemplated by this _Article II_ , without interest.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. The
Merger Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company Common Stock upon
the surrender for exchange in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock, and at the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares that
evidenced ownership of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to
such shares of Company Common Stock other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law.
If, at any time after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration pursuant to and in accordance with this _Article II_.

 

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, the posting by
such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent or the
Paying Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this _Article
II_.

 



5 (e) _Termination of Payment Fund_. At any time following the first (1st)
anniversary of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled
to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest
or other income received with respect thereto) that had been made available to
the Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed in accordance with this
_Article II_ , and thereafter Persons entitled to receive payment pursuant to
this _Article II_ shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general
creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration,
that may be payable upon surrender of any Company Common Stock held by such
holders, pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, without any
interest thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time
at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation, the
Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official or a Governmental Authority
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(g) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or under any applicable provision of
state, local or foreign Laws related to Taxes. To the extent amounts are so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, the withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

 

Section 2.3 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time which are held by a stockholder (each,
a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who is entitled to demand and properly demands
appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and complies in all respects with, the
provisions of Sections 351.447 and/or 351.455, as applicable, of the MGBCL
(the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable
for the right to receive the Merger Consideration (except as provided in this
_Section 2.3_), but instead such Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to
receive payment of the fair value of such shares of Company Common Stock held
by such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to and in accordance with Sections
351.447 and/or 351.455, as applicable, of the MGBCL (and at the Effective
Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such Dissenting
Stockholder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
rights set forth in Sections 351.447 and/or 351.455, as applicable, of the
MGBCL), unless and until such Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to
properly perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost rights to
appraisal under the MGBCL. If any Dissenting

 



6  Stockholder shall have failed to properly perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost such right, such Dissenting Stockholders shares of Company
Common Stock shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into
and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time,
the Merger Consideration for each such share of Company Common Stock, in
accordance with _Section 2.1_, without any interest thereon and less all
applicable withholding Taxes. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice
of any written demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock,
any effective or attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the MGBCL and received by the Company relating
to stockholders rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity and right to
participate in, direct and/or control, at Parents election, all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the MGBCL to the

of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, settle
or offer to settle, or approve the withdrawal of, any such demands for
appraisal.

Section 2.4 _Treatment of Equity Awards_.

 

(a) Each option that represents the right to acquire shares of Company Common
Stock which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether
or not then vested or exercisable) (each, an " _Option_ ") shall at the
Effective Time be canceled and terminated in exchange for an amount in cash
equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to the Option immediately prior to the Effective Time _times_
(y) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Price _over_ the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock under such Option, less applicable
Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment, and the holders
thereof shall have no further rights with respect thereto; _provided_ that if
the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock under any such Option is
equal to or greater than the Per Share Price, such Option shall be canceled
and terminated at the Effective Time without any cash payment being made or
payable in respect thereof.

 

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock issued, and each share of Company
Common Stock underlying any outstanding contingent equity grant issued
pursuant to an award agreement awarded, pursuant to any Company Stock Plan
that is subject to specified vesting criteria (each, a share of " _Restricted
Stock_ ") which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall at the Effective Time become fully vested and be treated in accordance
with _Section 2.1_ and shall not be assumed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation; _provided_ that, any award of shares of Restricted Stock subject
to certain vesting criteria for which the applicable performance or time
period has not yet been completed as of the Effective Time, shall vest in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable Company Stock
Plans. At the Effective Time, all outstanding dividends associated with each
share of Restricted Stock that becomes vested pursuant to this _Section
2.4(b)_, shall be paid out by the Company in a cash lump sum.

 

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this  _Section 2.4_ to any holder
of Options and shares of Restricted Stock such amounts as the Surviving
Corporation is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code, or any applicable provision of state, or local
Law related to Tax, and the Surviving Corporation shall make any required
filings with and payments to taxing authorities relating to any such deduction
or

 



7  withholding. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the
Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be treated for the purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Options or Restricted
Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Surviving Corporation.

(d) No later than the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to
be provided, to the Surviving Corporation all funds necessary to fulfill the
obligations under this _Section 2.4_. All payments required under this 
_Section 2.4_ shall be made at the Effective Time.

Section 2.5 _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date
of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Company shall occur as a result of any
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, any stock dividend or stock
or option issuance or distribution with a record date during such period, the
Per Share Price shall be equitably adjusted, and such adjustment shall provide
to the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect, and impose
on Parent and Purchaser no greater than the same economic obligation, as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing in this _Section 2.5_ shall be deemed to permit or authorize
the Company to effect any such change that it is not otherwise authorized or
permitted to undertake pursuant to this Agreement.

 

Section 2.6 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is determined by the Company, Parent, Purchaser or the
Surviving Corporation to be necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title
and possession of and to all rights and property of the Company, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully
authorized (in the name of the Company or otherwise) to take and shall take
such action.

be material).

(b) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are
defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. The
Companys disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure
that all material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
statements and reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is
accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. The Companys management has completed an assessment of

in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder for the years 

 



13  ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, and such assessment concluded that

claim that the Company has engaged in improper accounting practices that are
material to the consolidated financial statements of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries.

of Section 13(b) of the Exchange Act. Neither the Company nor any Company

Subsidiary has, in any respect, (i) used any corporate or other funds for

the Company, the Companys independent auditors has identified or been made
aware of (i) any significant deficiency or material weakness in the system of
internal accounting controls utilized by the Company and the Company

management or other employees who have a role in the preparation of financial
statements or the internal accounting controls utilized by the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries.

(a) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any liabilities which
would be required to be reflected or reserved against on a consolidated
balance sheet of the Company prepared in accordance with GAAP, except for

balance sheet, the " _Balance Sheet_ " and such date, the " _Balance Sheet
Date_ ") (including the notes thereto) included in the Filed Company SEC
Documents, (ii) incurred after the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice, (iii) under this Agreement
or incurred in connection with the Transactions or (iv) as would not be
reasonably likely to be material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,

(b) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract relating to any transaction or
relationship between or among the Company and any Company Subsidiary, on the
one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate (including any structured finance,
special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person), on the other hand, or
any "off-balance sheet arrangement" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation
S-K of the Securities Act), where the result, purpose or effect of such
Contract is to avoid disclosure in the Company SEC Documents of any
transaction involving, or liabilities of, the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries that would reasonably be expected to be material to the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries as a whole. 

 



14 Section 3.8 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Except as set forth on  _Section
3.8_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, since December 31, 2015, (i) except
in connection with the Transactions, the business of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries has been conducted in all material respects in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and (ii) the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries have not taken any action that, if taken after
the date of this Agreement, would constitute a violation of _Section
5.1_. Since December 31, 2015, there has not been any Company Material
Adverse Effect.

Section 3.9 _Legal Proceedings_. There is no, and during the past three years
there has been no, pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened,
legal, regulatory or administrative proceeding, claim, suit, arbitration or
action against the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, nor is there,
and during the past three years there has not been, any injunction, order,
judgment, ruling or decree imposed upon the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, in each case, by or before any Governmental Authority, that
would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

Section 3.10 _Compliance With Laws; Permits_.

 

(a) The businesses of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries are, and for
the past three years, have been, conducted in compliance with all laws,
statutes, ordinances, codes, rules, regulations, decrees judgments,
injunctions and orders of Governmental Authorities (collectively, " _Laws_ ")
applicable to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, except for
instances of non-compliance as would not reasonably likely be material to the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The Company is in
compliance in all material respects with the applicable listing requirements,
corporate governance and other rules and regulations of NASDAQ. The Company
and each of the Company Subsidiaries hold, and are in compliance with, all
licenses, franchises, permits, certificates, approvals and authorizations from
Governmental Authorities required by Law for the conduct of their respective
businesses as they are now being conducted (collectively, " _Company Permits_
"), except as the failure to hold or be in compliance with the Company Permits
would not result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. No investigation,

with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent

29 Section 4.5 _Ownership and Operations of Purchaser_. Parent owns beneficially
and of record all of the outstanding capital stock of Purchaser. Purchaser
was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions, has engaged
in no other business activities and has conducted its operations only as
contemplated hereby.

 

Section 4.6 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct and complete copies, as
of the date of this Agreement, of (i) an executed commitment letter dated as
of the date of this Agreement from each of the Equity Investors (each such
letter, an " _Equity Funding Letter_ ") to invest, subject to the terms and
conditions therein, cash in the aggregate amount set forth therein to Parent
(the " _Equity Financing_ ") and (ii) an executed commitment letter dated as
of the date of this Agreement (the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ ", and together
with the Equity Funding Letters, the " _Financing Letters_ ") to provide,
subject to the terms and conditions therein, debt financing in the aggregate
principal amount set forth therein as of the Closing Date (being collectively
referred to as the " _Debt Financing_ ", and together with the Equity
Financing collectively referred to herein as the " _Financing_ "). As of the
date of this Agreement, except as permitted by _Section 5.14(a)_, neither the
Equity Funding Letters nor the Debt Commitment Letter have been amended or
modified, no such amendment or modification is contemplated and the respective
commitments contained therein have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any
respect. As of the date of this Agreement, the Financing Letters, in the form
so delivered, are in full force and effect and are legal, valid and binding
obligations of Parent, enforceable against Parent in accordance with their
terms, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, except as
may be limited by the Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions. Parent has fully paid
or caused to be paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in connection
with the Equity Funding Letters and the Debt Commitment Letter that are
payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement. Assuming the funding of
the Financing in accordance with the terms of the Financing Letters, the net
proceeds contemplated by the Financing will, together with cash and cash
equivalents available to Parent and committed credit facilities in the
aggregate, be sufficient to consummate the Transactions upon the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and to pay all related fees and expenses
associated therewith, including payment of all amounts under _Article II_
of this Agreement and any repayment or refinancing of any outstanding debt
contemplated by this Agreement (to the extent required by, and pursuant to the
terms of, this Agreement). As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has no
reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy any term or condition of
closing to be satisfied by it contained in the Equity Funding Letters or the
Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent under any term or
condition of the Equity Funding Letters or the Debt Commitment Letter in each
case that would, individually or in the aggregate, permit the
financial institutions party thereto to terminate, or to not make the initial
funding of the facilities to be established thereunder upon satisfaction of
all conditions thereto. Except as set forth in the Financing Letters, there
are no (i) conditions precedent to the respective obligations of the Equity
Investors and the lenders party to the Debt Commitment Letter to fund the full
amount of the Financing; or (ii) contractual contingencies under any
agreements, side letters or arrangements (other than any fee letters
(customarily redacted) that have been provided to the Company) relating to the
Financing to which either Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective
Affiliates is a party that would permit the Equity Investors or the lenders
party to the Debt Commitment Letter to reduce

 



30  the total amount of the Financing, or that would materially and adversely
affect the availability of the Financing. Each of the Equity Funding Letters
provides, and will continue to provide, that the Company is a third party
beneficiary thereof in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
applicable Equity Funding Letters as of the date of this Agreement.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
net proceeds of the Financing, when funded in accordance with the Financing
Letters, will be sufficient for Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation to pay
the Aggregate Merger Consideration, all amounts required to be paid pursuant
to _Section 2.4_, any repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated by this
Agreement or required as a result of the consummation of the transactions
hereunder or the Financing Letters, and any other amounts required to be paid
in connection with the consummation of the Transactions and to pay all related
fees and expenses. Parent and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that their
obligations hereunder are not subject to any conditions regarding Parents,
Purchasers or any other Persons ability to obtain financing for the
consummation of the Transactions.

Section 4.7 _Share Ownership_. Neither Parent nor Purchaser has been, at any
time during the five (5) years preceding the date hereof, an "interested
shareholder" of the Company, as defined in Section 351.459 of the MGBCL. As of
the date of this Agreement, none of Parent, Purchaser and their respective
Affiliates owns (directly or indirectly, beneficially or of record) any
shares of capital stock of the Company and none of Parent, Purchaser and their
respective Affiliates holds any rights to acquire any shares of capital stock
of the Company except pursuant to this Agreement. 

Section 4.8 _Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there is no legal or
administrative proceeding, claim, suit or action pending or to the Knowledge
of Parent, threatened against Parent or Purchaser which seeks to, or would
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impair or materially delay the
consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions provided
for herein.

Section 4.9 _Absence of Certain Arrangements_. Except as set forth in _Section
4.9_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as of the date hereof, there are no
Contracts between Parent and Purchaser, on the one hand, and any member of the
Companys management or directors, on the other hand, as of the date hereof
that relate in any way to the Company or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

Section 4.10 _Solvency_. Assuming (a) the satisfaction of the conditions in
_Article VI_ and (b), the accuracy in all material respects of the
representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement and (c) that
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (x) the Company and each Company
Subsidiary is able to pay their respective debts as they become due and owns

31  contingent liabilities) and (ii) the Surviving Corporation and each of its
Subsidiaries will have adequate capital to carry on their respective
businesses. No transfer of property is being made and no obligation is being
incurred in connection with the Transactions with the intent to hinder, delay
or defraud either present or future creditors of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries.

 

Section 4.11 _Disclosure_. None of the information supplied by or on behalf of
Parent or Purchaser, including by any of their directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates, agents or other Representatives, for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the time of the
filing of the Proxy Statement with the SEC, at the time of the
first distribution or dissemination of the Proxy Statement to the Company
Stockholders or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any

required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not

Section 5.2 _No Solicitation; Change in Recommendation_.

 

(a) The Company agrees that it shall, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries, and its and their respective directors, officers and
employees to and shall direct, and use its reasonable best efforts to cause,
its other Representatives to, immediately cease all existing discussions or
negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Takeover
Proposal, or any existing discussion that could reasonably be expected to
lead to a Takeover Proposal, and the Company further agrees that it shall
request that all non-public information previously provided by or on behalf of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary to any such Persons be promptly
returned or destroyed in accordance with the terms of the applicable
confidentiality agreement or similar agreement with such Persons and shall
prohibit access for anyone other than Parent, the Company, Purchaser and
their respective Representatives to any electronic data room of the Company
in connection therewith. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, from
the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the
date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
7.1_, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, and its and
their respective directors, officers and employees not to, and shall direct,
and use its reasonable best efforts to cause, its other Representatives not
to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or
knowingly facilitate any inquiries, proposals or offers that constitute, or
that could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Takeover Proposal or the
making or consummation thereof, (ii) engage in, enter into, continue or
otherwise participate in any discussions (except to notify such Person of the
existence of the provisions of this _Section 5.2_) or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any non-public material
information in connection with or for the purpose of encouraging or
facilitating, any Takeover Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that
could reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal, (iii) enter into
any letter of intent, legal commitment or agreement to effectuate a Takeover

consummate the Transactions or (iv) direct any Representatives of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to take any action set forth in clauses (i), (ii)
or (iii) of this _Section 5.2(a)_.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
at any time prior to the date that the Company Stockholder Approval is
obtained, the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or any of its or
their respective Representatives receives a Takeover Proposal that did not
result from a breach of _Section 5.2(a)_ (an " _Unsolicited
Takeover Proposal_ "), which the Company Board (or a duly authorized
committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside legal and financial advisors, is or could be reasonably
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, the Company, the Company Board (or a
duly authorized committee thereof) and their Representatives may engage in
negotiations and discussions with, or furnish any information and other access
to any Person making such 

 



36  Takeover Proposal and any of its Representatives, _provided_ , that (i)
substantially concurrently (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
the Company makes available to Parent such information or access ( _provided_
that access to any information the Company deems competitively sensitive may
be be granted to Parent or its Representatives in accordance with the terms of
the Clean Team Agreement) to the extent such information or access was not
previously made available to Parent and (ii) prior to furnishing any material
non-public information to any such Person, the Company receives from the
Person making such Takeover Proposal an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement.
The Company will promptly (but in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent in
writing of the receipt of such Takeover Proposal and (i) if it is in writing,
deliver to Parent a copy of such Takeover Proposal and any related draft
agreements and other written material relating to such Takeover Proposal or
(ii) if oral, communicate to Parent the material terms and conditions thereof,
including, in each case, the identity of the Person making such
Takeover Proposal. The Company will keep Parent reasonably apprised on a
prompt and timely basis of the status and material terms of such Takeover
Proposal and with respect to any change in the price or any material terms
thereof within 24 hours of such material change, including the delivery to
Parent of any draft agreements or other written material reflecting any such
changes to price or the material terms of such Takeover Proposal. The Company
shall not terminate, amend, modify, waive or fail to enforce any provision of
any "standstill" or similar obligation of any Person unless the Company Board
(or a duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable law.

(c) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Company Board shall
not (i) withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, or publicly propose to withhold,
withdraw, amend or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser, the
Company Board Recommendation (including any failure to include the Company
Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement when mailed), (ii) approve,
endorse or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, endorse or recommend to
the Company Stockholders a Takeover Proposal, (iii) fail to publicly
recommend against acceptance of any tender offer or exchange offer for the
Shares within five (5) Business Days after commencement of such offer or
against any Takeover Proposal, (iv) enter into any definitive agreement
providing for a Takeover Proposal or (v) resolve or publicly propose to take
any action described in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv) (each of the
foregoing actions described in clauses (i) through (v) being referred to as a
" _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (but subject
to the Companys compliance in all material respects with the provisions of
this _Section 5.2_), the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee
thereof) may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change only in response to
the Company receiving an Unsolicited Takeover Proposal that the Company Board
(or a duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, constitutes
a Superior Proposal, cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ and, prior to or substantially concurrently with such
termination, cause the Company to enter into a definitive written agreement
providing for such Superior Proposal if, and only if, in all cases, the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consulting with outside counsel,
that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



37 (e) The Company may not make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ unless: (A) the
Company complies in all material respects with this _Section 5.2_, (B) the
Company provides Parent prior written notice of its intent to make any Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ at least five (5) Business Days prior to taking such
action, to the effect that the Company Board has received a Superior Proposal
and, absent any revision to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Company Board has resolved to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_, which notice
shall specify the basis for such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
termination, the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal and
the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal, and include a copy
of the then current forms of all of the relevant proposed transaction
documents related thereto, including definitive agreements with respect to
such Superior Proposal and any financing commitment relating thereto (a "
_Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") (it being understood that such Notice of
Superior Proposal shall not in itself be deemed a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change and that any material revision or amendment to the terms
of such Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and, in such case,
all references to five (5) Business Days in this _Section 5.2(e)_ shall be
deemed to be three (3) Business Days); (C) during such five (5) or three (3)
Business Day period, as applicable, if requested by Parent, the Company shall
have made its Representatives reasonably available, and directed its
Representatives, to discuss and negotiate with Parents Representatives any
proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement; (D)
Parent has not, within such five (5) or three (3) Business Day period, as
applicable, made a written, binding and irrevocable offer capable of being
accepted by the Company to alter the terms or conditions of this Agreement
such that such Takeover Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior
Proposal; and (E) the Company Board, after taking into account any
modifications to the terms of this Agreement and the Merger agreed to by
Parent and Purchaser after receipt of such notice, continues to believe that
such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal.

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) from (i) taking and
disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by Rule
14d-9 under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any disclosure to the Company
Stockholders if the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof)
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law or (iii)
informing any Person of the existence of the provisions contained in this
_Section 5.2_; or (iv) making any "stop, look and listen" communication to
the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or
any similar communication to the Company Stockholders). No disclosures under
this  _Section 5.2(f)_ shall be, in themselves, a breach of _Section 5.2_
or _Section 5.3_ or a basis for Parent to terminate this Agreement.

 



38 (g) As used in this Agreement, " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall mean any
_bona fide_ proposal or offer from any Person or "group" (as defined under
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) (other than Parent, Purchaser and any of
its Affiliates thereof) to purchase or otherwise acquire, directly or
indirectly, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, (a)
assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (including securities of
Subsidiaries, but excluding sales of assets in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice) that account for 15% or more of the Companys
consolidated assets or from which 15% or more of the Companys revenues or
earnings on a consolidated basis are derived, (b) beneficial ownership (as
defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of 15% or more of the
outstanding Company Common Stock or any other voting or equity securities of
the Company pursuant to a merger, consolidation or other business combination,
sale of shares of capital stock, tender offer, exchange offer or similar
transaction or (c) any combination of the foregoing.

(h) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any _bona
fide_ written Takeover Proposal which (i) is not subject to a financing
condition (it being understood that the remedy of a reverse termination fee or
other similar fee payable in the event that the third party submitting the
Takeover Proposal does not obtain its financing shall not be deemed to be a
financing condition) and (ii) is on terms which the Company Board (or a duly
authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation
with the Companys outside legal counsel and independent financial advisors,
to be more favorable to the holders of Company Common Stock from a financial
point of view than the Transaction, taking into account, to the
extent applicable, (x) any revisions to the terms of this Agreement and the
Financing Letters proposed by Parent to the Company pursuant to this _Section
5.2_ and (y) the legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such
Takeover Proposal (including the certainty of closing, the availability of
financing and the ability of such third party to consummate the transactions
contemplated by such Takeover Proposal) and this Agreement that the Company
Board considers relevant;  _provided_ that for purposes of the definition of
Superior Proposal, the references to "15%" in the definition of Takeover
Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "80%."

 

Section 5.3 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
Company, Parent and Purchaser shall use its respective reasonable
best efforts to (i) cause the Transactions to be consummated as soon as

submissions and filings under applicable Antitrust Laws or any other
applicable Laws with respect to the Transactions, (iii) promptly furnish

investigation, litigation or administrative or judicial action or proceeding
under Antitrust Laws, or (D) the nature and status of any objections raised or
proposed or threatened to be raised under Antitrust Laws with respect to the
Transactions and (v) obtain all actions or non-actions, approvals, consents,
waivers, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations from
any Governmental Authority or third party necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the Transactions as soon as practicable. For purposes hereof, "
_Antitrust Laws_ " means the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, the HSR Act and

 



39  the Federal Trade Commission Act and all other applicable Laws issued by a
Governmental Authority that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or
regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint
of trade or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing: (i) each party
hereto agrees to (A) make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report
Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as soon as
practicable and advisable and in any event within ten (10) Business Days
after the date hereof (unless the parties otherwise agree to a different
date), (B) supply as soon as reasonably practicable and advisable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested
pursuant to the HSR Act and (C) use its reasonable best efforts to take, or

waiting periods under the HSR Act (including any extensions thereof) as soon
as practicable and (ii) each party agrees to (A) supply as soon as reasonably
practicable and advisable any additional information and documentary material
that may be required or reasonably requested by any Governmental Authority
and (B) use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all other
actions consistent with this _Section 5.3_ as necessary to obtain any
necessary approvals, consents, waivers, permits, authorizations or other
actions or non-actions from each Governmental Authority as soon as
practicable.

(c) The Company, Parent and Purchaser shall: (i) promptly notify the other
parties hereto of, and if in writing, furnish the others with copies of (or,
in the case of oral communications, advise the others of the contents of) any
communication to such Person from a Governmental Authority and permit the
others to review and discuss in advance (and to consider in good faith any
comments made by the others in relation to) any proposed written communication
to a Governmental Authority, (ii) keep the others reasonably informed of any
developments, meetings or discussions with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any filings, investigation, or inquiry concerning the Transactions
and (iii) not independently participate in any meeting or discussions with a
Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry
concerning the Transactions without giving the other party prior notice of
such meeting or discussions and, unless prohibited by such Governmental
Authority, the opportunity to attend or participate. Each of Parent and
Company may designate any non-public information provided to any Governmental
Authority as restricted to "Outside Antitrust Counsel" only and any
such information shall not be shared with employees, officers or directors or
their equivalents of the other party without approval of the party providing
the non-public information.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section 5.3_,
in no event shall Parent, Purchaser or the Company (or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates) be required to effect or commit to
effect, by consent decree, hold separate orders, trust or otherwise, (i) the
sale, license, holding separate or other disposition of assets or businesses
of Parent, Purchaser or the Company (or any of their respective Subsidiaries
or Affiliates), (ii) the termination, relinquishment, modification or waiver
of existing relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations or other

Purchaser or the Company (or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates).

 



40 (e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, in the event that
any litigation or other administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
commenced, threatened or is foreseeable with respect to the Transactions
relating to any required submissions and filings under applicable Antitrust
Laws or any other applicable Laws and such litigation, action or proceeding
seeks, or would reasonably be expected to seek, to prevent, materially impede
or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions, each of the Company
and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to take any and all action to
avoid or resolve any such litigation, action or proceeding; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall require the Parent or
Purchaser to (and neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall without
the express written consent of Parent and Purchaser) defend through
litigation any claim asserted in court or administrative or other tribunal by
any Person (including any Governmental Authority) in order to avoid entry of,
or to have vacated or terminated, any Restraint that would prevent the
Closing prior to the End Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing in this
_Section 5.3(e) _shall require Parent or Purchaser or the Company to take any
action that would be inconsistent with the other provisions in this _Section
5.3_, including _Section 5.3(d)_ and _Section 5.3(f)_.

 

(f) Neither Parent nor Purchaser shall, nor shall they permit their respective
Subsidiaries to, acquire or agree to acquire any rights, assets, business,
Person or division thereof (through acquisition, license, joint venture,
collaboration or otherwise), for consideration in excess of $10,000,000 if
such acquisition would reasonably be expected to materially increase the risk
of not obtaining any applicable clearance, consent, approval or waiver under
U.S. Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transactions.

 

Section 5.4 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Following such initial press
release, Parent and the Company shall consult and cooperate with each other as
to the timing and contents, and give each other the opportunity to review
and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect
to the Transactions and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement prior to such consultation, except as such party may
reasonably conclude may be required by applicable Laws, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or national securities quotation system (and then only after as much
advance notice and consultation as is feasible); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.4_ shall not apply to any
release or public statement (a) made or proposed to be made by the Company in
connection with a Takeover Proposal, a Superior Proposal or a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or any action taken pursuant thereto, in each case, in
accordance with Section 5.2, or (b) in connection with any dispute between the
parties regarding this Agreement or the Transactions; _provided_ , _further_
, that the foregoing shall not limit the ability of any party hereto to make
internal announcements to their respective employees and other stockholders
or, in the case of Parent, to the limited partners of each of the Sponsors
and their respective advisors, as required, that are consistent in all
material respects with the prior public disclosures regarding the Transactions
and shall not limit the ability of the Company to make
regulatory announcements and filings that are required by applicable Law.
Nothing in this Agreement shall restrict or prohibit the Company, Parent or
Purchaser from making any

 



41  disclosure to a Governmental Authority in connection with the enforcement of
any right or remedy relating to this Agreement, the other agreements
contemplated hereby and the Transactions or making any regulatory filing.

Section 5.5 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, from
the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date on which
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company and
Parent shall afford to the other party and its Representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours to the Companys and the
Company Subsidiaries or Parents, as applicable, (i) properties, books,
Contracts, Tax Returns, operating data and records and the Company and Parent
shall furnish promptly to the other party such information concerning its
business and properties and (ii) officers, employees and advisors, in each
case, as such party may reasonably request (other than any publicly available
document filed by it pursuant to the requirements of federal or state
securities Laws); _provided_  that the Company, Parent, Purchaser and their
respective Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a manner
as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the other
party; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company and Parent shall not be
obligated to provide such access or information if the Company or Parent, as
applicable, determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing so would
violate applicable Law or a Contract or obligation of confidentiality owing
to a third-party, jeopardize the protection of the attorney-client privilege
(it being agreed that the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall give notice
to the other party of the fact that it is withholding such information or
documents, shall withhold only that portion of such information that is
reasonably necessary to be withheld to not violate applicable Law, Contract or
obligation and to preserve attorney-client privilege, and thereafter the
Company and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
cause such information to be provided in a manner that would not reasonably be
expected to violate such restriction or waive attorney-client privilege). The
information provided will be subject to the terms of the amended and restated
confidentiality letter agreement, dated as of November 10, 2015, between OPE
DTI Holdings and the Company (as it may be amended from time to time, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), that certain Clean Team Agreement, dated as
of April 29, 2016, between OPE DTI Holdings and the Company (as it may be
amended from time to time, the " _Clean Team Agreement_ ").

 

(b) Without limiting the representations and warranties of the Company set
forth in _Article III_ hereof, Parent acknowledges and agrees that it (i) had
an opportunity to discuss the business of the Company with the management of
the Company, (ii) has had access to the books and records, facilities,
contracts and other assets of the Company which it and its
Representatives have requested to review, (iii) has been afforded the
opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers from officers of the
Company and (iv) has conducted its own independent investigation of the
Company, its businesses and the Transactions.

Section 5.6 _Takeover Laws_. The Company and the Company Board shall each use
its reasonable best efforts to (a) ensure that no state takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the Transactions and
(b) if any state takeover statute or similar statute becomes applicable to the
Transactions, ensure that such Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Transactions.

 



42 Section 5.7 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall for six
(6) years after the Closing Date, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
current and former director and officer of the Company and any of the Company
Subsidiaries and each person who served as a director, officer, member,
trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise if such service
was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the "
_Indemnitees_ ") against all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments,
fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise)
and expenses that have been reasonably incurred (including fees and expenses
of legal counsel) in connection with any actual or threatened claim, suit,
action, proceeding or investigation (whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative) (each, a " _Claim_ "), whenever asserted, arising out of,
relating to or in connection with any action or omission relating to their
position with the Company or the Company Subsidiaries occurring or alleged to
have occurred before or at the Effective Time (including any Claim relating in
whole or in part to the Agreement or the Transactions), in each case, to the
fullest extent permitted under the Company Charter Documents and applicable
Law, and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all obligations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect of limitation of
liability, exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses as
provided in (A) the Company Charter Documents and the respective
organizational documents of each of the Company Subsidiaries as currently
in effect and (B) any indemnification agreements with an Indemnitee as set
forth on _Section 5.7(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, which shall in
each case survive the Transactions and continue in full force and effect to
the extent permitted by applicable Law. Without limiting the foregoing, at
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, for a period of six (6)
years after the Closing Date, cause the articles of incorporation and bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation to include provisions for limitation of
liabilities of directors and officers, indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation of the Indemnitees no less favorable to the
Indemnitees than as set forth in the Company Charter Documents or the
applicable organizational documents of the Company Subsidiaries in effect on
the date of this Agreement to the extent permitted by applicable Law, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees
except as required by applicable Law.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall pay
and advance to an Indemnitee any expenses (including fees and expenses of
legal counsel) in connection with any Claim relating to any acts or omissions
covered under this _Section 5.7_ or the enforcement of an Indemnitees
rights under this _Section 5.7_ as and when incurred to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ that the person to whom expenses
are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such expenses; _provided_ that
the obligations in this sentence shall apply only to the extent required by
applicable Law, the Company Charter Documents, applicable organizational
documents of Subsidiaries of the Company or applicable indemnification
agreements. Any determination required to be made with respect to whether an
Indemnitees conduct complies with an applicable standard under applicable
Law, the Company

 



43  Charter Documents, applicable organizational documents of Subsidiaries of
the Company, or applicable indemnification agreements, as the case may be,
shall be made by independent legal counsel selected by the Indemnitee and
reasonably acceptable to Parent.

(c) An Indemnitee shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assume and
control the defense of any Claim relating to any acts or omissions covered
under this _Section 5.7_ with counsel selected by the Indemnitee, which
counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent (i) shall be permitted to participate in the defense of such
Claim at its own expense and (ii) shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without Parents written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless such settlement
includes an unconditional release of each Indemnitee and the Surviving
Corporation and its Affiliates from any liabilities arising out of such Claim.
The Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnitees in the defense
of any Claim and shall provide access to properties and individuals as
reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be furnished records, information
and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested by an Indemnitee in
connection therewith. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this _Section 5.7_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, Parent shall not (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to) settle or compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with
respect to any Claim, unless such settlement, compromise, consent or
termination includes an unconditional release of all of the Indemnitees
covered by the Claim from all liability arising out of such Claim. Nothing in
this _Section 5.7(c)_ shall relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation of
its obligations set forth in this  _Section 5.7_.

(d) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the coverage provided by
the policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance in effect as of the date hereof maintained by the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the
Effective Time either through the Companys existing insurance provider or
another provider reasonably selected by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to
pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the
Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the coverages required to be
obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as
reasonably practicable for such amount; _provided_ , _further_ , that in lieu
of the foregoing insurance coverage, the Company may purchase "tail" insurance
coverage, at a cost per each year of "tail" insurance coverage no greater
than 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date
hereof, that provides coverage no materially less favorable than the coverage

The obligations of the Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this

opportunity to participate in (with its own counsel), but not control, the
defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries, directors or officers relating to this Agreement
or the Transactions, and the Company shall give due consideration to Parents
advice with respect to any such litigation. The Company shall consult with
Parent regarding the defense, settlement or prosecution of any stockholder
litigation; _provided_ , that (x) none of the Company, any Company Subsidiary
or any of their Representatives shall compromise, settle, come to an
arrangement regarding or agree to compromise, settle, or come to an
arrangement regarding any stockholder litigation or consent to the same
unless Parent shall have consented in writing (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and (y) after receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval, the Company shall, if requested by Parent, use
its reasonable best efforts to settle any unresolved stockholder litigation
in accordance with Parents direction (it being understood that such
settlement shall be conditioned on the consummation of the Merger). Each of
Parent and the Company shall notify the other promptly (and in any event
within 48 hours) of the commencement of any such stockholder litigation of
which it has received notice.

 

Section 5.9 _Section 16_. The Company shall take all steps reasonably
necessary to cause the Transactions, including any dispositions of equity

with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act.

Section 5.10 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each employee of
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries who continues employment with
the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries (" _Continuing Employees_ "),
the opportunity to receive such medical, dental, life insurance, disability,
supplemental unemployment and other welfare plan benefits which are
ordinarily provided to similarly-situated employees of Parent in the ordinary
course of business, as may be designated by Parent in its sole discretion from
time to time.

 

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall use reasonable best efforts to credit each
Continuing Employee, for purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and
level of benefits, but not for purposes of defined benefit pension accrual,
under the employee benefit and 401(k) plans of the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Continuing Employee after
the Effective Time (including the Company Plans or Non-U.S. Company Plan)
(the " _New Plans_ "), with his or her years of service with the Company and
its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time,
to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the
Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar employee benefit
or 401(k) plan in which such Continuing Employee participated or was eligible
to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the
foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the

 



45  Surviving Corporation shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that, (i)
each Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without
any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such
New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under a Company Plan or Non-U.S.
Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately before
the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii)
for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, the Surviving Corporation shall
use reasonable best efforts to cause all pre-existing condition exclusions
and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent such
conditions were inapplicable or waived under the comparable Old Plans of the
Company or its Subsidiaries in which such Continuing Employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by any Continuing Employee and
his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old
Plan ending on the date such Continuing Employees participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this Agreement shall (i) be treated as an amendment to
any Company Plan, (ii) obligate Parent or the Surviving Corporation to (A)
maintain any particular benefit plan or arrangement or (B) retain the
employment of any particular employee or (iii) prevent Parent or
the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating any benefit plan or
arrangement.

Company shall exercise, consistent with, and subject to, the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and
the Company Subsidiaries respective operations.

 

Section 5.13 _Company Stockholders  Meeting; Proxy Statement_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company, acting through the Company Board, shall, in accordance
with applicable Laws and the Company Charter Documents establish a record
date (which record date shall be as soon as legally permissible) for, call,
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the Company Stockholders (as
soon as legally permissible) (the " _Company Stockholders  Meeting_") for
the purpose of voting upon the approval of this Agreement in accordance with
the MGBCL; _provided_ , that the Company Stockholders Meeting shall be held
no later than 30 days after the definitive Proxy Statement is first
disseminated to the Company Stockholders (unless adjourned in accordance with
the terms of this _Section 5.13(a)_). Subject to _Section 5.2(d)_ hereof,
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and do or

 



46  cause to be done all things, necessary, proper or advisable on its part to
obtain the Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholders Meeting
or any adjournment or postponement thereof, including soliciting from the
Company Stockholders proxies in favor of the approval of this Agreement in
accordance with the MGBCL. The Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting
except that the Company may, without the prior written consent of Parent,
adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting, after
consultation with Parent, (i) if the failure to adjourn or postpone the
Company Stockholders Meeting would reasonably be expected to be a violation
of applicable Law or for the distribution of any required supplement or
amendment to the Proxy Statement, (ii) if, as of the time for which the
Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the
Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company Shares represented
(either in Person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct
the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting or (iii) to allow time for
the filing and dissemination of any supplemental or amended disclosure
document that the Company Board has determined in good faith (after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel) is necessary or
required to be filed and disseminated under applicable Laws or for the Company
to comply with its obligations under _Section 5.2(e)_;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the event that there are insufficient votes to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company
may, and upon Parents request the Company shall, postpone or adjourn the
Company Stockholders Meeting up to two (2) times for up to thirty (30) days
to the extent permitted by applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Companys obligation to establish a
record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting pursuant to this _Section 5.13(a)_ shall not be limited
to, or otherwise affected by, the commencement, disclosure, announcement
or submission to the Company of any Takeover Proposal. The Company shall
ensure that all proxies solicited in connection with the Company Stockholders
Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable Laws.

 

(b) In connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall
prepare and file with the SEC as promptly as practicable and in any event no
later than ten (10) Business Days following the date of this Agreement a proxy
statement, letter to stockholders, notice of meeting and form of proxy
accompanying the Proxy Statement that will be provided to the
Company Stockholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies for use
at the Company Stockholders Meeting, and any schedules required to be filed
with the SEC in connection therewith (collectively, as amended or
supplemented, the " _Proxy Statement_ "). The Company and Parent, as the case
may be, shall furnish all information concerning the Company or Parent as the
other party hereto may reasonably request in connection with the preparation
and filing with the SEC of the Proxy Statement. Subject to all applicable
Laws, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement to be cleared by the SEC and disseminated to the Company
Stockholders as promptly as practicable following the filing thereof with the
SEC. The Company shall provide Parent, Purchaser and their counsel reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement (including any
amendments or revisions thereto) and all other materials used in connection
with the Company Stockholders Meeting that (i) constitute "proxy materials"
or "solicitation materials" as those terms are used in Rules 14a-1 through
14a-17 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) are otherwise used for
the "solicitation" of "proxies" as those terms are defined in Rule 14a-1
promulgated under the Exchange Act, in each case prior to the filing thereof
with the SEC or the dissemination thereof 

 



47  to Company Stockholders and shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any comments made by Parent or its counsel. The Company shall
advise Parent, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request by
the SEC or its staff for an amendment or revisions to the Proxy Statement, or
comments thereon and responses thereto, or requests by the SEC or its staff
for additional information in connection therewith. The Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to any comments received from the SEC or its staff concerning the
Proxy Statement. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to
its stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after (and in any
event no later than five (5) Business Days after) the SECs clearance of the
Proxy Statement or the lapse of any applicable waiting period during which the
SEC is allowed to comment on the Proxy Statement. If at any time prior to the
Company Stockholders Meeting, any information relating to the Company or
Parent, or any of their respective directors, officers or Affiliates, should
be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party or parties
hereto, as the case may be, and an appropriate amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement describing such information shall be promptly prepared and
filed with the SEC by the Company and, to the extent required by applicable
Laws, disseminated to the Company Stockholders. The Company shall cause the
Proxy Statement to comply as to form and substance in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and NASDAQ.

(c) Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to _Article VII_
hereof, subject to the terms of _Section 5.2(d)_ hereof, the Company shall
include in the Proxy Statement the Company Board Recommendation.

 

Section 5.14 _Financing_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Financing
Letters, Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary or reasonably proper or advisable to obtain the Financing on the
terms and conditions described in the Financing Letters, and will not consent
to any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy under (1) the Equity Funding Letters whatsoever (except to
increase the amount of the Equity Financing) and (2) the Debt Commitment
Letter, in the case of this clause (2), solely to the extent such amendment,
modification or waiver would (i) reduce the aggregate principal amount of the
Debt Financing (unless the Equity Financing is increased by a corresponding
amount or Parent otherwise has available funds in an amount at least equal to
such reduction), or (ii) impose new or additional conditions, or otherwise
amend, modify or expand any conditions, to the receipt of the Debt Financing,
in the case of either clause (i) or (ii) above, in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to (A) materially delay or prevent the Closing, (B)
make the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to
obtaining the Financing) less likely to occur at the Effective Time or (C)
adversely impact the ability of Parent or Purchaser to enforce its rights
against the other parties to the Financing Letters or the definitive
agreements with respect thereto or the ability of Parent or Purchaser
to consummate the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and
Purchaser may (i) amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add

 



48  lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, agents, syndication agents,
documentation agents or similar entities who had not executed the Debt
Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement, (ii) amend or otherwise
modify the Debt Commitment Letter to implement any flex provisions applicable
thereto or (iii) otherwise amend, modify or replace, or agree to any waivers
in respect of, the Debt Commitment Letter so long as (x) such amendment,
modification, replacement or waiver does not impose new terms or conditions
that would reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the Closing,
(y) the terms thereof are not less beneficial with respect to conditionality
or enforcement, taken as a whole, to Parent or Purchaser than those in the
Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date of this Agreement and (z) with
respect to replacements, the replacement debt commitments otherwise
satisfy the terms and conditions of an Alternative Financing set forth below.
In the event of such amendment, modification, replacement or waiver of the
Debt Commitment Letter as permitted by the proviso to the immediately
preceding sentence, the financing under such amended, modified, replaced or
waived Debt Commitment Letter will be deemed to be "Debt Financing" as such
term is used in this Agreement. Parent will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to (I) maintain in effect the Financing Letters (including any
definitive agreements entered into in connection therewith) until the earlier
of the consummation of the Transaction and the termination of this Agreement,
(II) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions in the Financing Agreements and
in the Equity Funding Letters applicable to Parent and Purchaser (and that are
within their control) to obtaining the Financing, (III) negotiate and enter
into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on terms and
conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (as modified, to the extent
exercised, by the flex provisions applicable thereto) or otherwise consistent
in all material respects with the Debt Commitment Letter, or on other
terms acceptable to Parent that would not (i) reduce the aggregate principal
amount of the Debt Financing (unless the Equity Financing is increased by a
corresponding amount or Parent otherwise has available funds in an amount at
least equal to such reduction), or (ii) impose new or additional conditions,
or otherwise amend or modify any conditions, to the receipt of the Debt
Financing, in the case of either clause (i) or (ii), in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the Closing (such
definitive agreements, together with the Debt Commitment Letter, the "
_Financing Agreements_ "), and (IV) consummate the Financing at or prior to
the Closing (which efforts shall include, making demand upon the lenders to
consummate the Financing to the extent the conditions thereto have been
satisfied (other than those which are dependent upon, or are to occur
simultaneously with, the funding of the Financing, it being agreed that such
efforts shall not require the commencement of litigation against any lenders).
Upon the Companys request, Parent will keep the Company reasonably informed
on a timely basis of the status of Parents and Purchasers efforts to obtain
the Debt Financing and to satisfy the conditions thereof, including advising
and updating the Company, in a reasonable level of detail, with respect to
status, proposed Closing Date and material terms of the material definitive
documentation for the Debt Financing. If any portion of the Financing becomes
reasonably likely to be unavailable on the material terms and conditions
contemplated by the applicable Financing Agreements or the Equity Funding
Letters (giving effect to, to the extent exercised, the flex provisions
applicable thereto), (i) Parent will promptly notify the Company and (ii)
Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain alternative
financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the
Transactions (it being understood that Parent shall have no obligation to
accept any terms or conditions that are materially less favorable, taken as a
whole, to Parent, Purchaser and the Company than the terms and conditions set
forth in the applicable Financing

 



49  Agreements) (" _Alternative Financing_ ") as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event. In such event, as applicable: (1) the
terms "Financing" and "Debt Financing" as used in this Agreement will be
deemed to include any such Alternative Financing, (2) the term "Debt
Commitment Letter" will be deemed to include any commitment letters with
respect to any such Alternative Financing and (3) the term "Financing
Agreements" will be deemed to include any definitive agreement with respect to
the Alternative Financing.

 

(b) The Company will provide to Parent, and will cause its Subsidiaries to
provide, at Parents cost and expense as provided in  _Section 5.14(e)_, and
will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives to
provide, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is customary and
necessary in connection with arranging, obtaining and syndicating the Debt
Financing and causing the conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter and the
Financing Agreements to be satisfied, including using reasonable best efforts
in (i) assisting with the preparation of syndication documents and
materials, including information memoranda and packages, lender and investor
presentations, rating agency materials and presentations, and similar
documents and materials, in connection with the Debt Financing, and providing
reasonable and customary authorization letters and management representation
letters to the Financing Sources authorizing the distribution of information
to prospective lenders and other Financing Sources and containing customary
information (all such documents and materials, collectively, the "
_Syndication Documents_ "), (ii) preparing and furnishing to Parent and the
Financing Sources as promptly as practicable with all Required Information to
the extent it is available to the Company and all other information and
disclosures relating to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (including
their businesses, operations and financial projections) as may be reasonably
requested by Parent to assist in preparation of the Syndication Documents
(including execution of customary authorization and management representation
letters), (iii) causing the Companys and each of the Company Subsidiaries
respective management teams, with appropriate seniority and expertise, to
participate in (including the preparation for) a reasonable number of
meetings, conference calls, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions,
drafting sessions, sessions with ratings agencies and similar sessions in
connection with the Debt Financing, including direct contact between such
senior management of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and Parents
Financing Sources and potential lenders in the Debt Financing, (iv) assisting
Parent in obtaining any corporate credit and family ratings from any ratings
agencies contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, (v) assisting in the
preparation, negotiation, execution and delivery of definitive financing
documents and the schedules and exhibits thereto (including any loan
agreements, note purchase agreements, guarantees, collateral agreements,
hedging arrangements, legal opinion, officers certificates and a solvency
certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company in the form
required by the Debt Commitment Letter), (vi) subject to any contractual
agreement in effect, facilitating the pledging of collateral for the Debt
Financing, including taking commercially reasonable actions necessary to
permit the Financing Sources to evaluate the Companys and the Company
Subsidiaries real property, personal property, current assets, cash
management and accounting systems, policies and procedures for the purpose of
establishing collateral arrangements and establishing, as of the Effective
Time, bank and other accounts and blocked account agreements and lockbox
arrangements in connection with the Debt Financing, (vii) subject to any
contractual agreement in effect, obtaining from the Companys existing
lenders such consents, approvals, authorizations and instruments which may be
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Financing and
collateral arrangements, including customary payoff letters, lien releases,

 



50  instruments of termination or discharge, (viii) preparing and delivering to
Parent any supplements to the above information as may be required pursuant to
the Debt Commitment Letter, (ix) furnishing Parent and its Financing Sources
reasonably promptly following Parents written request with all documentation
and other information required by regulatory authorities under applicable
"know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations,
including the PATRIOT Act, that has been reasonably requested by Parent and
(x) causing the taking of corporate and other actions by the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries reasonably necessary to permit the consummation of the
Debt Financing on the Closing Date and to permit the proceeds thereof to be
made available to Parent as of the Closing Date; _provided_ , that no such
actions shall be effective prior to the Closing Date and the consummation of
the Merger.

(c) The Company hereby consents to the use of the Companys logos in
connection with the Debt Financing in a form and manner mutually agreed with
the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that such logos are used solely in a
manner that is not intended, or reasonably likely, to harm or disparage the
Company its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries. The Company will, upon request of Parent, use its
reasonable best efforts to periodically update any Required Information (to
the extent it is available) to be included in any Syndication Document to be
used in connection with such Debt Financing so that Parent may ensure that any
such Required Information does not contain any untrue statement of material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements contained therein not misleading.

(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of _Section 5.14(b)_, (i) solely
Parent shall be responsible for provision of any post-Closing pro forma
financial information, including cost savings, synergies, capitalization,
ownership or other pro forma adjustments ( _provided_ , that for the avoidance
of doubt, the Company shall provide Parent with financial and other
information relating to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries reasonably
requested by Parent to allow Parent to prepare such pro forma financial
information) and any financial projections of the Company for and after the
Effective Time, (ii) neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries
or their respective Representatives shall be required to enter into any
certificate, document, agreement or instrument which will be effective prior
to the Effective Time, (iii) nothing herein shall require cooperation
contemplated thereby to the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the
business or operations of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, (iv)
none of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries will be required to
pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other liability in
connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Effective Time, and (v)
nothing herein shall require cooperation or assistance from a Company
director, officer or employee to the extent such Company director, officer or
employee is reasonably likely to incur any personal financial liability by
providing such cooperation or assistance that will not be repaid or
reimbursed in full by the Parent.

(e) Parent will, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including

Subsidiaries contemplated by  _Section 5.14(b)_, on the earlier of the
Effective Time or termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article
VII_ (Termination). Parent will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and
all losses, damages, claims and reasonable

 



51  and documented costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in
connection with the arrangement of the Financing (including any action taken
in accordance with this  _Section 5.14_) and any information used in
connection therewith, except with respect to any information relating to the
Company provided in writing by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.

 

(f) Parent and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of
Financing, or any Alternative Financing, is not a condition to Closing. 

Section 5.15 _Actions with Respect to Existing Indebtedness; Other Items_. In
connection with the Closing, and subject to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, Parent shall make available, and pay to, the
Company for payment to the lenders under the Company Credit Agreement the full

accrued interest and cash collateral thereon and all fees and other
obligations of the Company accrued under the Company Credit Agreement
(including any prepayment premiums, penalties, breakage costs, termination
payments and similar obligations) (the " _Loan Payoff Amount_ "). Subject to
Parents compliance with the previous sentence, the Company shall pay the Loan
Payoff Amount to the lenders under the Company Credit Agreement and terminate
such agreement, all on the Closing Date. Unless otherwise agreed in writing
between Parent and the Company, the Company shall deliver the required
prepayment and commitment termination notices to the administrative agent in

which notices shall be conditioned upon the effectiveness of a credit facility

event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations
thereof set forth in this _Article V_.

2016 (the "End Date"); _provided, however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to a

material obligations under this Agreement;

(ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in _Section 6.1(a)_ shall
be in effect and shall have become final and non-appealable; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section

Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 7.1(d)(i)_ if it is then in breach of any representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements hereunder that would result in a
failure of a condition set forth in _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.3_;

 

(ii) at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, in
order to enter into a transaction that is a Superior Proposal, in accordance
with _Section 5.2_; _provided_ that the Company, substantially concurrently

(iii) if after the completion of the Marketing Period (A) the conditions set
forth in _Section 6.1_ and  _Section 6.2_ (other than those conditions that

condition is then capable of being satisfied at a Closing on such date) have
been satisfied, (B) Parent and Purchaser failed to consummate the Merger by
the time set forth in _Section 1.2_, (C) the Company confirmed to Parent in

sentence of _Section 5.5(a)_, all of which shall survive termination of this
Agreement), and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent, Purchaser
or the Company or their respective directors, officers and Affiliates

all of the Expenses of Parent, Purchaser and their respective Subsidiaries,
Affiliates and Representatives in an amount not to exceed $5,500,000 in the
aggregate (the " _Parent Expenses_ "), by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent,

57  Takeover Proposal ( _provided_ that for purposes of clause (iii) of this

Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%"), then the Company shall
pay or cause to be paid to or as directed by Parent the Termination Fee (less
the amount of any Parent Expenses previously paid to Parent pursuant to
_Section 7.3(a)_, if any), by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent, on the date of
consummation of such transaction. If, in order to collect the Termination Fee
or any Parent Expenses pursuant to  _Sections 7.3(a)_ , _(b)_ , _(c)_ or
this _Section 7.4(d)_, Parent commences a proceeding, claim, suit,
arbitration or action that results in a judgment in favor of Parent for the

expenses and other costs and expenses incurred in connection with such
proceeding, claim, suit, arbitration or action.

 

(e) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by (i) the Company pursuant
to _Section 7.1(d)(iii)_ or (ii) the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section
7.1(b)(i)_ if, at the time of such termination, the Company would have been
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(iii)_,
Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to the Company the Parent Termination
Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by the Company within five (5) Business Days of such
termination. If, in order to collect the Parent Termination Fee, the Company
commences a proceeding, claim, suit, arbitration or action that results in a
judgment in favor of the Company for the payment of the Parent Termination
Fee, Parent will pay to the Company all of the Companys reasonable and
documented attorneys fees and expenses and other costs and expenses incurred
in connection with such proceeding, claim, suit, arbitration or action.

 

(f) Subject to the Companys right to specific performance in accordance with,
and subject to the limitations of,  _Section 8.9_, notwithstanding anything
else in this Agreement, the Company acknowledges and agrees on behalf of
itself, its Affiliates and the Company Stockholders, that in the event that
the Company receives full payment of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section 7.3(e)_ in circumstances where the Parent Termination Fee is owed:
(i) the Parent Termination Fee shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy
of the Company, its Affiliates and the Company Stockholders, (ii) the Parent
Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all
losses or damages suffered or incurred by the Company, its Affiliates and the
Company Stockholders in connection with this Agreement and the Equity Funding
Letters (and the termination of any of the foregoing), the transactions
contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the
basis for such termination (or for any breach or failure to perform hereunder
or otherwise (in each case, whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally
or otherwise)), and (iii) Parent, Purchaser and any of their respective
Subsidiaries and Affiliates or any of the former, current or future general or
limited partners, shareholders, managers, members, directors, officers,
employees, direct or indirect equityholders or Representatives of any of the
foregoing (collectively, but excluding Parent and Purchaser, the " _Parent
Related Parties_ ") shall not have any further liability, whether pursuant to
a claim in contract or tort, at law or in equity or otherwise, to the Company,
any of its Affiliates or the Company Stockholders under this Agreement or the
Equity Funding Letters (and the termination of any of the foregoing), the
transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter
forming the basis for such termination.

 



58 (g) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Termination Fee_ " shall mean an amount
equal to $15,000,000.

(h)

 

(i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Parent be required to pay
(or cause to be paid) the Parent Termination Fee referred to in this _Section
7.3_ (i) on more than one occasion or (ii) if, at the time this Agreement is
terminated by Parent, this Agreement could have been terminated by the Company
pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(ii)_ or _Section 7.1(d)(i)_, but, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Company shall in such circumstances be entitled,
subject to _Section 8.9_, to seek such remedies to which it is entitled
under, and subject to, the terms of this Agreement.

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Company be required
to pay the Termination Fee referred to in this _Section 7.3_ (x) on more
than one occasion or (y) if, at the time this Agreement is terminated by the
Company, this Agreement could have been terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section 7.1(b)(ii)_ or  _Section 7.1(c)(i)_, and the payment of the
Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to Parent and
Purchaser with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions in the event any
such payment becomes due and payable pursuant to and in accordance with this
_Section 7.3_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon payment of the Termination
Fee, the Company (and the Companys Affiliates and its and their respective
directors, officers, employees, stockholders and Representatives) shall have
no further liability to Parent and Purchaser under this Agreement

parties hereto executed by duly authorized officers of the respective parties;
_provided_ , _however_ , that after the Company Stockholder Approval has been
obtained, if applicable, there shall be no amendment or change to the

rules of NASDAQ) requires further approval by the Company Stockholders
without the further approval of such stockholders. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Purchaser in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall
any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise

set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

part, by operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties, except that Parent or Purchaser

Debt Financing without the consent of the Company. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under this _Section
8.5_ shall be null and void.

from and after the Effective Time, the rights of the Company Stockholders and
holders of Options and Restricted Stock to receive the payments provided for
in _Article II_ herein at the Effective Time and (ii) the provisions of 
_Section 5.7_ and _Section 7.3(f)_, are not intended to and shall not confer

and enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in

enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by applicable Law.

 

Section 8.9 _Specific Enforcement; Limitations on Liability_.

 

(a) The parties agree that, subject to the provisions of this _Section 8.9_,
immediate, extensive and irreparable damage would occur for which monetary

provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or are otherwise breached. Accordingly, the parties agree that,
if for any reason Parent, Purchaser or the Company shall have failed to
perform its obligations under this Agreement or otherwise breached this
Agreement, then the party seeking to enforce this Agreement against such
nonperforming party under this Agreement shall be entitled to specific
performance and the issuance of immediate injunctive and other equitable
relief without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a
remedy, and the parties further agree to waive any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any such
injunctive or other equitable relief, this being in addition to and not in
limitation of any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in
equity;  _provided_ , that the Company shall only be entitled to enforce or
seek to enforce specifically Parents or Purchasers obligation to cause all
or any portion of the Equity Financing to be funded (whether under this
Agreement or the Equity Funding Letters) or otherwise cause Parent or
Purchaser to consummate the Merger, the Financing or the other transactions
contemplated hereby (including the obligation to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration) if: (i) the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and
_Section 6.2 _(other than those to be satisfied at the Closing itself, each
of which shall be capable of being satisfied, and shall in fact be satisfied,
at the Closing) have been satisfied and remain satisfied at the time when
Closing would have occurred but for the failure of the Financing to be funded,
(ii) Parent and Purchaser have failed to consummate the Merger by the date the
Merger is required to have occurred pursuant to  _Section 1.2_, (iii) the
Debt Financing is available to be funded at the Closing and has been funded or
will be funded if the Equity Financing is funded and (iv) the Company has
irrevocably confirmed to Parent in writing that if specific performance is
granted and the Financing is funded, then the Closing will occur.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, while the
Company may seek (i) specific performance, subject in all respects to this
_Section 8.9_, and (ii) payment of the Parent Termination Fee, if, as and
when payable pursuant to _Section 7.3(e)_, under no circumstances shall the
Company, directly or indirectly, be permitted or entitled to receive (A) both

(whether 

 



62  under this Agreement or the Equity Funding Letters), or to cause Parent or
Purchaser to consummate the Merger, the Financing or the other transactions

Consideration) or other equitable relief, on the one hand, and payment of any
monetary damages whatsoever or the payment of all or a portion of the Parent
Termination Fee, on the other hand, or (B) both payment of any monetary
damages, on the one hand, and payment of all or any portion of the Parent
Termination Fee, on the other hand. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event

portion of the Equity Financing to be funded (whether under this agreement or
the Equity Funding Letters) or cause Parent or Purchaser to consummate the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby (including the obligation
to pay the Merger Consideration) if all, substantially all, or any material
