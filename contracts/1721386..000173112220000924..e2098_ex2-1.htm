2.6 _Merger Consideration_.

  



  

(a) Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the anticipated
Closing Date, the Company will deliver to Parent a certificate signed by a
duly authorized officer, solely in such capacity and not in its personal
capacity (the " _Company Closing Certificate_ "), setting forth:

  



  

(i) the Company's good faith estimate of Company Transaction Costs
that will be unpaid as of the Closing; and

  



  

(ii) the Company's good faith estimate of Indebtedness as of the
Closing, including any Payoff Amount.

  



  

(b) The Company Closing Certificate so delivered by the Company will
confirm in writing that it has been prepared in good faith using the latest
available financial information and will include materials showing in
reasonable detail the Company's support and computations for the amounts
included in the Company Closing Certificate. Parent shall be entitled to
review and make reasonable comments on the matters and amounts set forth in
the Company Closing Certificate so delivered by the Company pursuant to
_Section 2.6(a)_. The Company will cooperate with Parent in the review of
the Company Closing Certificate, including providing Parent and its
Representatives with reasonable access to the relevant books, records and
finance employees of the Company. The Company will cooperate reasonably with
Parent to revise the Company Closing Certificate if necessary to reflect
Parent's reasonable comments. If the Company Closing Certificate is so
revised, such revised Company Closing Certificate, or if Parent had no such
comments, then the initial Company Closing Certificate shall be deemed to be
the final "Company Closing Certificate," in each case as approved in writing

(c) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement,
the aggregate consideration to be paid to the Seller shall be an amount equal
to the Merger Consideration.

  



  

(d) The Merger Consideration shall be paid to the Seller in the form

terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company, the Company Stockholders or the holders of any of
the securities of Parent, the following shall occur:

  



  

(a) Each share of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares)
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
cancelled and automatically deemed for all purposes to represent the right to
receive a portion of the Merger Consideration, with the Seller being entitled
to receive the Closing Number of Securities without interest, upon surrender
of stock certificates representing all of the Company Common Stock (each, a "
_Certificate_ ") and delivery of the other documents required pursuant to
_Section 2.8_. As of the Effective Time, the Seller shall cease to have any
other rights in and to the Company or the Surviving Corporation, and each
Certificate relating to the ownership of shares of Company Common Stock (other
than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive
the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration.

  



    

 | 7| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) No fraction of a share of Parent Class A Stock will be issued by
virtue of the Merger, and if the Seller otherwise would be entitled to a
fraction of a share of Parent Class A Stock (after aggregating all fractional
shares of Parent Class A Stock that otherwise would be received by the
Seller), the Seller shall receive from Parent, in lieu of such fractional
share: (i) one share of Parent Class A Stock if the aggregate amount of
fractional shares of Parent Class A Stock the Seller would otherwise be
entitled to is equal to or exceeds 0.50; or (ii) no shares of Parent Class A
Stock if the aggregate amount of fractional shares of Parent Class A Stock
the Seller would otherwise be entitled to is less than 0.50.

  



  

(c) Each issued and outstanding share of common stock of Merger Sub
shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation, which shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time,
all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed
for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence.

  



  

(d) Each share of Company Common Stock held in the Company's
treasury or owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time (each an " _Excluded Share_ "), shall be cancelled and no
consideration shall be paid or payable with respect thereto.

  



  

(e) The numbers of shares of Parent Class A Stock that the Seller is
entitled to receive as a result of the Merger and as otherwise
contemplated by this Agreement shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the
effect of any stock split, split-up, reverse stock split, stock dividend or
distribution (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into Parent Class A Stock), extraordinary cash dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Parent Class A Stock occurring on or after the
date hereof and prior to the Closing.

Consideration_.

  



  

(a) Subject to this _Section 2.8_ , at the Effective Time, the
Seller shall surrender each Certificate to the Parent and Parent shall
deliver, or cause to be delivered to the Seller the Closing Number of
Securities. The Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. Until so surrendered, each Certificate shall represent after the
Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive the applicable
portion of the Merger Consideration attributable to such Certificate. No
interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of
the Certificates.

Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration to be delivered
upon due surrender of the Certificate may be issued to such transferee if the
Certificate formerly representing such shares of Company Common Stock is
presented to the Parent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence
and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer
Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

  



  

(c) From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers
on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving
Corporation or Parent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and deemed exchanged
for (without interest and after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 2.11_ ) the portion of the Merger
Consideration represented by such Certificate.

  



  

(d) Any portion of the Merger Consideration that remains unclaimed
for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Surviving Corporation. Any holder of shares of Company Common Stock who has
not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to
the Surviving Corporation for payment of their respective portion of the
Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section 2.11_ ) upon due surrender of its Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in _Section
2.8(e)_ ), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none
of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any other Person shall be liable to
any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

  



  

(e) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed: (i) upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed; and (ii) if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount
and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation
with respect to such Certificate, the Parent will issue the portion of the
Merger Consideration attributable to such Certificate (after giving effect to
any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.11_ ).

  



  

2.9 _Surrendered Warrants and Surrendered Shares_. Immediately
prior to the Effective Time, Sponsor shall surrender and transfer to Parent,
for no consideration and as a contribution to the capital of Parent, the
Surrendered Warrants and Surrendered Shares in accordance with the Sponsor
Surrender Agreement.

  



  

2.10 _Tax Treatment of the Merger_.

  



  

(a) The Parties shall not take or cause to be taken any action, or
fail to take or cause to be taken any action, which action or failure to act
would reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

  



    

 | 9| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) For U.S. federal income tax purposes (and for purposes of any
applicable state or local Tax that follows the U.S. federal income
tax treatment), the Parties will prepare and file all Tax Returns consistent
with the treatment of the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code (or comparable provision of state and local Tax
law) and will not take any inconsistent position on any Tax Return, or during
the course of any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes,
except as otherwise required by a determination within the meaning of Section
1313(a) of the Code.

  



  

2.11 _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and their Affiliates shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, any
amount required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under Applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made. Any amounts so withheld shall be remitted to the
applicable Governmental Entity.

  



  

2.12 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time
after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation
following the Merger with full right, title and possession to all assets,
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger
Sub, the officers and directors or members, as applicable, (or their
designees) of the Company and Merger Sub are fully authorized in the name of
their respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such
lawful and necessary action, so long as such action is not inconsistent with
this Agreement.

excluding any employment or consulting agreement or offer letter that either:
(i) is terminable by the Company at will; or (ii) provides for notice and/or
garden leave obligations as required by Applicable Law, in each case, so long
as such agreement or offer letter does not provide for: (A) severance or
similar obligations; (B) transaction bonuses or change in control or similar
payments; or (C) Tax gross-ups; _provided_ that a form of such employment or
consulting agreement or offer letter is listed and made available to Parent
and the individual agreements or offer letters do not deviate from such form

administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and with
all Applicable Law. No non-exempt "prohibited transaction" (within the meaning

reasonably expected to occur with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan.

  



  

(d) Each Employee Benefit Plan intended to qualify under Section

the prototype plan on which such Employee Benefit Plan is based has received
an opinion letter) from the Internal Revenue Service upon which it may rely
regarding its qualified status under the Code, and nothing has occurred with

at any time sponsored or has ever been obligated to contribute to, or had any

Companies have no liability in respect of, post-retiree health, welfare or

are pending, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against any
Employee Benefit Plan, the assets of any of the trusts under such plans or the
plan sponsor or administrator, or against any fiduciary of any Employee
Benefit Plan with respect to the operation thereof that could reasonably be
expected to result in any material liability.

  



  

(h) All contributions, reserves or premium payments required to be
made or accrued for all prior periods through the date hereof to the Employee
Benefit Plans have been timely made or accrued in all material respects in
accordance with the provisions of each of Employee Benefit Plans, Applicable
Law and GAAP.

  



    

 | 15| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(i) Neither the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the Transactions will, either alone or in
connection with any other event(s): (i) result in any payment or benefit
becoming due to any current or former employee, contractor or director of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or under any Employee Benefit Plan; (ii)
increase any amount of compensation or benefits otherwise payable to any
current or former employee, contractor or director of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or under any Employee Benefit Plan; (iii) result in the

right to merge, amend or terminate any Employee Benefit Plan.

  



  

(j) Neither the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the Transactions shall, either alone or in
connection with any other event(s) give rise to any "excess parachute
payment" as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code, any excise Tax owing
under Section 4999 of the Code or any other amount that would not be
deductible under Section 280G of the Code.

any individual for any Tax or related interest or penalties incurred by such

(o) Any individual who performs services for the Company or any
Company Subsidiary and who is not treated as an employee for U.S.
federal income tax purposes by the Company or any Company Subsidiary is not
an employee under Applicable Law or for any purpose including, without
limitation, for Tax withholding purposes or Employee Benefit Plan purposes
with only immaterial exceptions. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries
have no liability by reason of an individual who performs or performed
services for the Company or any Company Subsidiary in any capacity being
improperly excluded from participating in an Employee Benefit Plan. Each
employee of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has been properly
classified as "exempt" or "non-exempt" under Applicable Law with only
immaterial exceptions, and no individual treated as an independent contractor
or consultant by any Group Company should have been properly classified as an
employee under Applicable Law.

(p) With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan that is mandated by a
government other than the United States or subject to the Applicable Laws of
a jurisdiction outside of the United States, (i) the fair market value of the
assets of each such plan to the extent funded, the liability of each insurer
for any such funded through insurance or the book reserve established for any
such plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure
or provide for the accrued benefit obligations, as of the date of
this Agreement, with respect to all current and former participants in such
plan according to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used
to determine employer contributions to such plan, and no transaction
contemplated by this Agreement shall cause such assets or insurance
obligations to be less than such benefit obligations, and (ii) each such plan
has been maintained and operated in all material respects in accordance with
the applicable plan document and all Applicable Laws and other
requirements, and if intended to qualify for special tax treatment,
satisfies, in all material respects, the requirements for such treatment.

4.7 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as set forth in
Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, and except as
contemplated by this Agreement, since the date of the Balance Sheet, there has
not been: (a) any Parent Material Adverse Effect; (b) any declaration,

4.9 _Trust Account_.

  



  

(a) As of the day immediately preceding the date hereof, Parent had
$141,970,563.17 in a trust account (the " _Trust Account_ "), maintained and
invested pursuant to that certain Investment Management Trust Agreement (the "
_Trust Agreement_ ") dated June 19, 2018, by and between Parent and
Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company, a New York corporation ("
_Continental_ ") for the benefit of its public stockholders, with such funds
invested in United States Government securities or money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company
Act. Other than pursuant to the Trust Agreement, the obligations of Parent
under this Agreement are not subject to any conditions regarding Parent's, its
Affiliates', or any other Person's ability to obtain financing for the
consummation of the Transactions.

  



  

(b) The Trust Agreement has not been amended or modified and is
valid and in full force and effect and is enforceable in accordance with its
terms, except insofar as enforceability may be limited by applicable
Enforceability Exceptions. Parent has complied in all material respects with
the terms of the Trust Agreement and is not in breach thereof or default
thereunder and there does not exist under the Trust Agreement any event
which, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time, would constitute such a
breach or default by Parent or, to the Knowledge of Parent, the trustee under
the Trust Agreement. There are no separate Contracts, side letters or other
understandings (whether written or unwritten, express or implied): (i) between
Parent and Continental that would cause the description of the Trust
Agreement in the Parent SEC Reports to be inaccurate in any material respect;
or (ii) to the Knowledge of Parent, that would entitle any Person (other than
stockholders of Parent holding Parent Class A Stock sold in Parent's initial
public offering who shall have elected to redeem their shares of Parent Class
A Stock pursuant to Parent's Charter Documents) to any portion of the
proceeds in the Trust Account. Prior to the Closing, none of the funds held in
the Trust Account may be released except: (A) to pay income and franchise
taxes from any interest income earned in the Trust Account; and (B) to redeem
Parent Class A Stock in accordance with the provisions of Parent's Charter
Documents. There are no Legal Proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, threatened in writing with respect to the Trust Account.

  



  

4.10 _Taxes_.

  



  

(a) All Tax Returns required to be filed by or on behalf of Parent
and Merger Sub have been duly and timely filed with the
appropriate Governmental Entity and all such Tax Returns are true, correct
and complete in all material respects. All Taxes payable by or on behalf of
Parent and Merger Sub (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have been fully
and timely paid and Parent and Merger Sub have adequately reserved on the
applicable financial statements in accordance with GAAP for all Taxes (whether
or not shown on any Tax Return) that have accrued but are not yet due or
payable as of the dates thereof.

  



  

(b) No claim, assessment, deficiency or proposed adjustment for any
Tax has been asserted or assessed by any Governmental Entity against Parent
or Merger Sub (or any consolidated, combined or unitary group of which Parent
or Merger Sub is a member) that has not been paid or resolved. No Tax audit,
proceeding or other examination of Parent or Merger Sub (or any consolidated,
combined, or unitary group of which Parent or Merger Sub is a member) by any
Governmental Entity is presently in progress, nor has Parent or Merger Sub
been notified of any request or threat for such an audit, proceeding or other
examination. None of Parent or Merger Sub (or any consolidated, combined, or
unitary group of which Parent or Merger Sub is a member) is a party to any
litigation or administrative proceeding relating to Taxes. There are no Liens
for Taxes (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of the assets of Parent or
Merger Sub (or any consolidated, combined, or unitary group of which Parent
or Merger Sub is a member). None of Parent or Merger Sub (or any
consolidated, combined, or unitary group of which Parent or Merger Sub is a
member) has consented to extend the time in which any Tax may be assessed or
collected by any Governmental Entity (other than pursuant to extensions of
time to file Tax Returns obtained in the ordinary course of business), which
extension is still in effect. None of Parent or Merger Sub has received a
claim by any Governmental Entity in any jurisdiction where it does not file a
particular Tax Return or pay a particular Tax that it is or may be subject to
taxation by that jurisdiction or required to file a Tax Return.

  



    

 | 36| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) None of Parent or Merger Sub has requested, has received or is
subject to any ruling of a Governmental Entity or has entered into
any written agreement with a Governmental Entity with respect to any Taxes,
and none of Parent or Merger Sub has entered into any "closing agreement" as
described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar
provision of state, local or foreign income Tax Law).

  



  

(d) None of Parent or Merger Sub has entered into or been a party to
any "listed transaction" within the meaning of Section 6707A(c)(2) of the
Code.

  



  

(e) None of Parent or Merger Sub has in any year for which the
applicable statute of limitations remains open distributed stock of
another person, or has had its stock distributed by another person, in a
transaction that was purported or intended to be governed in whole or in part
by Section 355 or Section 361 of the Code.

  



  

(f) None of Parent or Merger Sub is a party to or bound by any Tax
allocation, indemnity or sharing agreement. None of Parent or Merger Sub (A)
has been a member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income
Tax Return (other than a group the common parent of which was the Parent) and
(B) has any liability for the Taxes of another Person pursuant to Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign Law) or as a transferee or a successor or by Contract (other
than pursuant to commercial agreements entered into in the ordinary course of
business and the principal purpose of which is not related to Taxes) or
otherwise.

  



  

(g) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has complied with all applicable
Laws relating to the payment and withholding of Taxes (including
withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445, 1446, 1471-1474,
3102 and 3402 of the Code or similar provisions under any state or foreign
Laws) and has duly and timely withheld and, in each case, has paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Entity any and all amounts required to be so
withheld and paid over on or prior to the due date thereof under all
applicable Laws.

  



  

(h) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has collected or withheld and paid
(or had collected or withheld and paid on its behalf) all applicable sales,
use, ad valorem, and value added Taxes.

  



  

(i) None of Parent or Merger Sub has received notice from a taxing
authority that it has a permanent establishment (within the meaning of an
applicable Tax treaty) or otherwise has an office or fixed place of business
in a country or is subject to Tax on its net income other than the country in
which it is organized.

  



    

 | 37| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(j) None of Parent or Merger Sub will be required to include any
item of income in, or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for
any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a
result of: (i) any change in method of accounting for a taxable period ending
on or prior to the Closing Date; (ii) any "closing agreement" as described in
Section 7121 (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or
foreign income Tax Law) executed on or prior to the Closing Date; (iii) any
intercompany transaction, deferred intercompany gain or excess loss account
described in Treasury Regulations under Section 1502 of the Code (or any
corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax Law);
any (iv) installment sale or open transaction disposition made on or prior to
the Closing Date; or (v) any prepaid amount received on or prior to the
Closing Date.

  



  

(k) None of Parent or Merger Sub has any deferred payment obligation
pursuant to Section 965 of the Code.

  



  

(l) None of Parent or Merger Sub is currently required or will be
required on or after the Closing Date to make any payments in respect of the
transfer or surrender of any liability to Tax or any Tax loss or relief by
virtue of having been a member of a consolidated, combined, unitary, group
relief or other similar Tax group prior to the Closing.

  



  

(m) To the Knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub, there is no fact or
circumstance that would reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from
qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.

  



  

4.11 _Certain Provided Information_. None of the information supplied
or to be supplied by Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) will, at the date
mailed to the equity holders of Parent or at the time of the Special Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent makes no
representation, warranty or covenant with respect to: (a) statements made or
incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Proxy Statement; or (b) any projections or forecasts included in the Proxy
Statement.

Transaction Agreements and the consummation of the Transactions; and (b)
determined that the consummation of the Transactions is in the best interest
of the stockholders of Parent. Other than the approval of the Parent

necessary to approve the consummation of the Transactions.

4.13 _Title to Assets_. Subject to the restrictions on use of the
Trust Account set forth in the Trust Agreement, Parent owns good and
marketable title to, or holds a valid leasehold interest in, or a valid
license to use, all of the assets used by Parent in the operation of its
business and which are material to Parent, in each case, free and clear of any
Liens (other than Permitted Liens).

  



  

4.14 _Solvency_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby with the actual intent
to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors.

  



  

4.15 _Related Person Transactions_. Except as described in the Parent
SEC Reports, no transactions or Contracts, or series of related
transactions or Contracts, between Parent, on the one hand, and any present
or former officer, director, manager or Affiliate of Parent or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, any of their respective "associates" or "immediate
family" members (as such terms are defined in Rule 12b-2 and Rule 16a-1 of
the Exchange Act), on the other hand, will continue in effect following the
Closing.

  



  

4.16 _Brokers_. Other than fees or commissions for which Parent will
be solely responsible, none of Parent, Merger Sub, nor any of their
respective Affiliates, including Sponsor, has any liability or obligation to
pay, or is entitled to receive, any fees or commissions to any broker, finder
or agent with respect to the Transactions.

access to the books, records, facilities and personnel of the Group
Companies for purposes of conducting a due diligence investigation of the
Group Companies and their businesses, and (b) conducted an independent due
diligence investigation and verification of the financial condition, results
of operations, assets, liabilities, properties and projected operations of
the Group Companies. Each of Parent and its Affiliates has relied solely upon
the representations and warranties expressly made by the Company in _Article
III_ of this Agreement and the certificates delivered in connection
herewith or pursuant hereto, in each case, as qualified by the Disclosure
Schedules (subject to _Section 11.16_ ) (collectively, the " _Express Company
Representations_ "), in entering into the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and not on any other factual representations, opinions or
statements of any kind of the Group Companies, the Seller or any of their
respective Affiliates, agents, representatives or any other Person. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub (for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and
their agents and representatives, and each of the successors and assigns of
the foregoing) hereby (i) acknowledges and agrees that none of the Group
Companies, Seller or any other Person is making or has made any
representation, warranty or statement of any kind or nature expressed or
implied, at law or in equity, in respect of any Group Company or its
businesses, assets, liabilities, operations, prospects or condition
(including any relating to the future or historical financial condition,
results of operations, prospects, assets or liabilities of the Group
Companies, or the quality, quantity or condition of the Company's
assets), other than the Express Company Representations, and (ii) irrevocably
disclaims reliance on any representations, warranties or statements of any
kind or nature expressed or implied by any Person whatsoever, or the accuracy
or completeness of any information provided to (or otherwise acquired by)
Parent, Merger Sub or either of their respective agents or representatives, in
each case other than the Express Company Representations.

 | 42| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement will give Parent or Merger
Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Company's or
any Company Subsidiary's operations prior to the Closing and the Group
Companies' failure to take any action prohibited by _Section 5.1(a)_ , as a
result of Parent not timely consenting to the notice required to be delivered
by the Company to Parent pursuant to _Section 5.1(a)_ , will not be a breach
of _Section 5.1(a)_.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 5.1(a)_ ,
no Group Company that is directly or indirectly wholly owned by the
Company shall be restricted from (i) paying to its sole equity holder parent

5.2 _Access to Books and Records_. Subject to _Section 6.4_ , from
the date hereof until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement and
the Closing Date, the Company will provide Parent and its authorized
Representatives reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Parent 's
Representatives_") with reasonable access during normal business hours, and
upon reasonable notice, to the offices, properties, senior personnel, and all
financial books and records (including Tax records) of the Group Companies in
order for Parent to have the opportunity to make such investigation as it will
reasonably desire in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that in exercising access rights
under this _Section 5.2_ , Parent and the Parent's Representatives will not
be permitted to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of
any Group Company. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
no such access or examination will be permitted to the extent that it would
require any Group Company to disclose information subject to attorney-client
privilege or attorney work-product privilege, conflict with any third-party
confidentiality obligations to which any Group Company is bound, or violate
any Applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
no access or examination provided pursuant to this _Section 5.2_ will qualify
or limit any representation or warranty set forth herein or the conditions to
the Closing set forth in _Section 8.3(a)_. Parent will indemnify and hold
harmless the Group Companies from and against any Losses that may be incurred
by any of them to the extent arising out of or related to the bad faith or
gross negligence of Parent or the Parent's Representatives in the use,
storage or handling by Parent or the Parent's Representatives of (i) any
personally identifiable information relating to employees or customers of any
Group Company and (ii) any other information that is protected by Applicable
Law (including privacy Laws) or Contract and to which Parent or the Parent's
Representatives are afforded access pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
Parent acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained therein, the Confidentiality Agreement, will not terminate unless
the Closing occurs, and Parent is and will continue to be bound by the
Confidentiality Agreement in accordance with its terms.

5.3 _Payoff Letters and Lien Releases_. At least three (3) Business
Days prior to the anticipated Closing, the Company will deliver to Parent a
customary payoff letter or letters or other payoff documentation
(collectively, the " _Payoff Letter_ ") executed by the lenders of the
Indebtedness described in clause (a) below, which letter will set forth (a)
the total amount required to be paid at the Effective Time to satisfy in full
the repayment of all Indebtedness set forth on _Schedule 5.3_ of the
Disclosure Schedules and, if any, all prepayment penalties, premiums and
breakage costs that become payable upon such repayment (the " _Payoff Amount_
"), (b) the lenders' obligation to release all liens and other security
securing the Indebtedness described in clause (a) in due course and at
Parent's expense after receiving the Payoff Amount, and (c) wire transfer
instructions for paying the Payoff Amount.

  



  

5.4 _Notification_. From the date hereof until the earlier of the
termination of this Agreement and the Closing Date, if after the date hereof
the Company becomes aware of any fact or condition arising after the date
hereof that constitutes a material breach of any representation or warranty
made by the Company in _Article III_ or of any covenant that would cause the
conditions set forth in _Section 8.3(a)_ or _Section 8.3(b)_ , as
applicable, not to be satisfied as of the Closing Date, the Company will
disclose in writing to Parent such breach.

  



  

5.5 _Consents_. The Group Companies shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain consents of all Persons who are party to the
agreements set forth on _Schedule 3.4(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedules. All
costs incurred in connection with obtaining such consents shall be paid by
the Company on or prior to the Closing Date or as a Company Transaction Cost
on the Closing Date. Subject to Applicable Law relating to the exchange of

5.6 _280G Approval_. To the extent that any "disqualified
individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code and the
regulations thereunder) has the right to receive any payments or benefits that
could be deemed to constitute "parachute payments" (within the meaning of
Section 280G(b)(2)(A) of the Code and the regulations thereunder), then, the
Company will: (a) no later than ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date,
solicit and obtain from each such "disqualified individual" a waiver of such
disqualified individual's rights to some or all of such payments or benefits
(the " _Waived 280G Benefits_ ") so that any remaining payments and/or
benefits shall not be deemed to be "excess parachute payments" (within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations thereunder); and (b)
no later than three days prior to the Closing Date, with respect to each
individual who agrees to the waiver described in clause (a), submit to a vote
of holders of the equity interests of the Company entitled to vote on such

regulations promulgated thereunder, along with adequate disclosure intended to
satisfy such requirements (including QandA 7 of Section 1.280G-1 of such

prior to soliciting such waivers and approval, the Company shall
provide drafts of such waivers and approval materials to Parent for its
reasonable review and comment, and the Company shall consider in good faith
any changes reasonably requested by Parent. No later than seven (7) days prior
to soliciting the waivers, the Company shall provide Parent with the
calculations and related documentation to determine whether and to what extent
the vote described in this _Section 5.6_ is necessary in order to avoid the
imposition of Taxes under Section 4999 of the Code. Prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent evidence that a vote of the
stockholders of the Company was solicited in accordance with the foregoing
and whether the requisite number of votes of the stockholders of the Company
was obtained with respect to the Waived 280G Benefits or that the vote did
not pass and the Waived 280G Benefits will not be paid or retained.

should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so
that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not

Statement containing such information. If, at any time prior to the Closing,
the Company discovers any information, event or circumstance that should be
set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the
Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Company
shall promptly notify Parent so that an appropriate amendment or supplement
can be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required under
Applicable Law, disseminated to all stockholders of Parent.

  



  

(d) Parent shall make all necessary filings, if any, with respect to
the Transactions under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and
applicable "blue sky" laws, and any rules and regulations thereunder. The
Company agrees to promptly provide Parent with all information concerning the
business, management, operations and financial condition of the Company and

soliciting proxies as promptly as practicable in accordance with Applicable
Law for the purpose of seeking the approval of the Parent Stockholder Matters
and the Warrant Amendment.

  



  

(c) Parent shall include the Parent Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement. The board of directors of Parent shall not (and no committee
or subgroup thereof shall) change, withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, or
publicly propose to change, withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, the Parent
Recommendation (a " _Change in Recommendation_ "); _provided_ , that the board
of directors may make a Change in Recommendation if it determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that a failure to
make a Change in Recommendation would reasonably be expected to constitute a
breach by Parent's board of directors of its fiduciary obligations to
Parent's stockholders under Applicable Law.

  



  

(d) Parent agrees that its obligation to establish a record date
for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Special Meeting for the
purpose of seeking approval of the Parent Stockholder Matters shall not be
affected by any Change in Recommendation, and Parent agrees to establish a
record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Special
Meeting and submit for the approval of its stockholders the matters
contemplated by the Proxy Statement, regardless of whether or not there shall
have occurred any Change in Recommendation.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Parent shall be entitled to postpone or adjourn the Special
Meeting: (i) to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement that the board of directors of Parent has determined in good faith
is required by Applicable Law is disclosed to Parent's stockholders and for
such supplement or amendment to be promptly disseminated to Parent's
stockholders prior to the Special Meeting; (ii) if, as of the time for which
the Special Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement), there are insufficient shares of Parent Class A Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary
to conduct the business to be conducted at the Special Meeting; or (iii) in
order to solicit additional proxies from stockholders for purposes of
obtaining approval of the Parent Stockholder Matters; _provided_ , that in
the event of a postponement or adjournment pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii)
above, the Special Meeting shall be reconvened as promptly as practicable
following such time as the matters described in such clauses have been
resolved.

of any Legal Proceeding with respect to such transactions; (d) not agree to
participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any such
Governmental Entity in respect of any filing, investigation or inquiry

the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other Party the
opportunity to attend; (e) keep the other reasonably informed as to the status
of any such Legal Proceeding; and (f) promptly furnish each other with copies
of all correspondence, filings (except for filings made under the HSR Act)

Parent).

Tax purposes in a manner consistent with the treatment described in this

by filing all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with such treatment) unless
otherwise required by a taxing authority in connection with a good faith
resolution of a Legal Proceeding. Prior to or following the Effective Time,
none of Parties shall, and they shall not permit any of their respective
Affiliates to, (i) take (or fail to take) any action which action (or failure
to act) could reasonably be expected to cause the Merger to fail to qualify
as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, unless
required to do so by Applicable Law.

  



  

(c) The Parent shall be responsible for and shall pay all local,
non-U.S. or other excise, sales, use, value-added, transfer (including real

expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect
to all such Transfer Taxes.

  



  

7.13 _Qualification as an Emerging Growth Company_. Parent shall, at
all times during the period from the date hereof until the Closing: (a)
take all actions necessary to continue to qualify as an "emerging growth
company" within the meaning of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of

not qualify as an "emerging growth company" within the meaning of the JOBS
Act.

  



  

7.14 _Registration Rights_.

  



  

(a) Following the Closing Date, Parent shall, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, (i) file with the SEC (A) a resale shelf registration
statement under the Securities Act on Form S-3 (or any successor short form
registration involving a similar amount of disclosure) or if then ineligible
to use any such form, then any other available form of registration statement,
or (B) pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, a prospectus
supplement that shall be deemed to be part of an existing shelf registration
statement in accordance with Rule 430B under the Securities Act, in each case
for a public offering of the shares of Parent Class A Stock received by
the Seller as Merger Consideration (the " _Registrable Stock_ ") to be made
on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act (the "
_Registration Statement_ ") and, in the case of clause (A) above, use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become
effective within 180 days after the Closing Date, (ii) use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to remain
effective until the earlier of (1) the date when all Registrable Stock
covered by the Registration Statement has been sold or (2) the date when all
Registrable Stock covered by the Registration Statement first becomes
eligible for sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act without volume
limitation or other restrictions on transfer thereunder, and (iii) use its
reasonable best efforts to prepare and file with the SEC any required
amendments to the Registration Statement and the prospectus (including any
prospectus supplement) used in connection therewith (" _Shelf Prospectus_
"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall have no obligation to
register or to maintain the effectiveness of the Registration Statement after
all Registrable Stock covered by the Registration Statement first becomes
eligible for sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act without
volume limitation or other restrictions on transfer thereunder. In the event
that the filing deadline contemplated by this _Section 7.14(a)_ shall occur
during a trading "blackout" period under Parent's securities trading
policies, then Parent shall not be required to file the Registration Statement
contemplated by this _Section 7.14(a)_  until such "blackout" period is no
longer applicable. In addition, Parent shall not be required to file the
Registration Statement contemplated by this _Section 7.14(a)_ if Parent, in
its reasonable good faith judgment (after consultation with its legal
advisors), has determined that the offer and sale or other disposition of
Registrable Stock pursuant to the Registration Statement would require public
disclosure by Parent of material nonpublic information that Parent is not
otherwise obligated to disclose.

(b) (i) Upon the issuance by the SEC of a stop order suspending the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the initiation of any Legal
Proceeding with respect to the Registration Statement under Section 8(d) or
8(e) of the Securities Act, or (ii) if the Registration Statement or Shelf
Prospectus shall contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading (including, in any such case, as a
result of the non-availability of financial statements), (iii) Parent, in its
reasonable good faith judgment, has determined that the offer and sale or
other disposition of Registrable Stock would require public disclosure by
Parent of material nonpublic information that is not included in the
Registration Statement and that immediate disclosure of such information would
be materially detrimental to Parent, or (iv) upon the occurrence or existence
of any other development, event, fact, situation or circumstance relating
to Parent that, in the judgment of a majority of the board of directors of
Parent, makes it appropriate to suspend the availability of the Registration
Statement and/or Shelf Prospectus, (A)(1) in the case of clause (ii) above,
and subject to clauses (iii) and (iv) above, Parent shall as promptly as
reasonably practicable prepare and file a post-effective amendment to such
Registration Statement or a supplement to the related Shelf Prospectus, as
applicable, so that such Registration Statement or Shelf Prospectus, as
applicable, does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading, and subject to clause (iii) above, in
the case of a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement, use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause it to become effective as promptly as
reasonably practicable, and (2) in the case of clause (i) above, use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such stop order to be lifted, and
(B) Parent shall give notice to the Seller that the availability of such
Registration Statement or Shelf Prospectus is suspended (a " _Deferral
Notice_ ") and, upon receipt of any Deferral Notice, the Seller agrees that it
shall not sell any Registrable Stock pursuant to the Registration Statement
or Shelf Prospectus until the Seller is notified by Parent of the
effectiveness of the post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement
provided for in clause (A) above, or until it is notified in writing by
Parent that the Shelf Prospectus may be used. In connection with any
development, event, fact, situation or circumstance covered by clause (iii)
above, Parent shall be entitled to exercise its rights pursuant to this
_Section 7.14(b)_ to suspend the availability of the Registration Statement
and Shelf Prospectus for no more than an aggregate of 120 days in the
aggregate in any one year period.

(c) In connection with the performance of its obligations under this
_Section 7.14_, Parent shall pay all registration fees under the Securities
Act, all printing expenses and all fees and disbursements of Parent's legal
counsel, Parent's independent registered public accounting firm and any other
persons retained by Parent, and any other expenses incurred by Parent. The
Seller shall pay any discounts, commissions and transfer Taxes, if any,
attributable to the sale of Registrable Stock and any other expenses
(including the fees and expenses of other advisors and agents, if any)
incurred by it; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall pay the reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses of one (1) legal counsel to
represent the interests of the Seller under this _Section 7.14_.

  



  

(d) The Seller (i) shall furnish to Parent such information as is
required to be included under the Securities Act in the
Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or any Shelf
Prospectus, (ii) shall comply with the prospectus delivery requirements under
the Securities Act in connection with the sale or other distribution of
Registrable Stock pursuant to the Registration Statement, (iii) shall
indemnify Parent, each officer and director of Parent, and each person, if
any, who controls Parent within the meaning of either Section 15 of the
Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act (each of the foregoing, an
"indemnified party" for purposes of this _Section 7.14(d)_ ) against any and
all loss, liability, claim and damage arising out of any untrue statement of
a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any Shelf
Prospectus (or any amendment thereto) or the omission therefrom of a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions made
in the Registration Statement or any Shelf Prospectus (or any amendment
thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in
writing to Parent by or on behalf of the Seller for use in the Registration
Statement or any Shelf Prospectus (or any amendment thereto), and (iv) shall
report to Parent all sales or other distributions of Registrable Stock
pursuant to the Registration Statement. If the indemnification provided for
in this _Section 7.14(d)_ from the Seller is unavailable to an indemnified
party hereunder in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities
referred to in this _Section 7.14(d)_ , the Seller, in lieu of
indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Seller and indemnified party
in connection with the actions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages
or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. No
person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any
person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The
obligations of Parent and the Seller under this _Section 7.14(d)_ shall
survive the completion of any offering or sale of Registrable Stock pursuant
to any Registration Statement.

but excluding any registration statement on Form S-8 or S-4 or comparable
successor forms or a registration statement relating to a dividend
reinvestment plan), which is available for use for the sale of Parent Class A
Stock under the Securities Act, then Parent shall give written notice of such
proposed filing to the Seller at least ten (10) Business Days before the
anticipated filing date of such registration statement, and such notice shall
offer the Seller the opportunity to include in such registration statement
Parent Class A Stock then owned by the Seller, as the Seller may request in
writing within three (3) days after receipt of Parent's notice (which
request shall specify the number of Parent Class A Stock to be included in
such registration statement and the intended method of disposition). For the
avoidance of doubt, the Seller acknowledges that the inclusion of any Parent
Class A Stock held by Seller in any such registration statement shall be
subject to the terms and conditions of the Existing RRA.

11.3 _Counterparts; Electronic Delivery_. This Agreement, the
Transaction Agreements and each other document executed in connection with the
Transactions, and the consummation thereof, may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same document and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being understood that
all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Delivery by facsimile or
electronic transmission to counsel for the other Parties of a counterpart
executed by a Party shall be deemed to meet the requirements of the previous
sentence.

  



  

11.4 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,
the other Transaction Agreements and any other documents and instruments and
agreements among the Parties as contemplated by or referred to herein,
including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto: (a) constitute the entire
agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof; and (b) other
than the rights, at and after the Effective Time, of Persons pursuant to the
provisions of _Section 11.14_ (which will be for the benefit of the
Persons set forth therein), are not intended to confer upon any other Person
other than the Parties any rights or remedies.

or restriction of this Agreement, or the application thereof, is held to be
illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future requirement of
Law: (a) such provision will be fully severable; (b) this Agreement will be
construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision

(d) in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there will

enforceable provision as similar in terms of such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision as may be possible.

  



  

11.6 _Other Remedies; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise
provided herein, prior to the Closing, any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such
Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that each Party shall be entitled to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court of the
United States or any state having jurisdiction and immediate
injunctive relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement, without the
necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy and without
bond or other security being required, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the Parties
hereby acknowledges and agrees that it may be difficult to prove damages with
reasonable certainty, that it may be difficult to procure suitable substitute
performance, and that injunctive relief and/or specific performance will not
cause an undue hardship to the Parties. Each of the Parties hereby further
acknowledges that the existence of any other remedy contemplated by this
Agreement does not diminish the availability of specific performance of the
obligations hereunder or any other injunctive relief. Each Party hereby
further agrees that in the event of any action by any other party for specific
performance or injunctive relief, it (i) will not assert that a remedy at law
or other remedy would be adequate or that specific performance or injunctive
relief in respect of such breach or violation should not be available on the
grounds that money damages are adequate or any other grounds, and (ii) waives
any requirement under Applicable Law to post security as a prerequisite to
obtaining equitable relief.

action, claim, cause of action or suit to any court other than one of the
above-named courts, whether on the grounds of inconvenient forum or
otherwise. Each Party hereby consents to service of process in any such
proceeding in any manner permitted by Delaware law, and further consents to
service of process by nationally recognized overnight courier service
guaranteeing overnight delivery, or by registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested, at its address specified pursuant to _Section 11.1_.

OR COUNTERCLAIMS ASSERTED IN ANY LEGAL DISPUTE RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT,
EACH OTHER TRANSACTION AGREEMENTS AND THE CONSUMMATION OF THE TRANSACTIONS,
AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM RELATING THERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING
OR HEREAFTER ARISING. IF THE SUBJECT MATTER OF ANY SUCH LEGAL DISPUTE IS ONE

ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY SHALL ASSERT IN SUCH LEGAL
DISPUTE A NONCOMPULSORY COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION AGREEMENTS AND THE CONSUMMATION OF THE
TRANSACTIONS. FURTHERMORE, NO PARTY NOR ANY PERSON ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A
THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY SHALL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH LEGAL DISPUTE WITH
A SEPARATE ACTION OR OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDING IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE
WAIVED.

  



  

11.9 _Rules of Construction_. Each of the Parties agrees that it has
been represented by independent counsel of its choice during the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and each Party hereto and its
counsel cooperated in the drafting and preparation of this Agreement and the
documents referred to herein and, therefore, waive the application of any law,
regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an
agreement or other document will be construed against the Party drafting such
agreement or document.

  



  

11.10 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, whether or not the Transactions are consummated, each Party will
pay its own costs and expenses incurred in anticipation of, relating to and
in connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the

interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the
other Parties. Subject to the first sentence of this _Section 11.11_, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties

other acts of the other Party; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to the other Party contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto; and (c) waive compliance with any
of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such Party contained
herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of such Party. Delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall not
constitute a waiver of such right. In the event any provision of any of the
other Transaction Agreement in any way conflicts with the provisions of this
Agreement (except where a provision therein expressly provides that it is
intended to take precedence over this Agreement), this Agreement shall
control.

liabilities or obligations of the Parties for any Legal Proceeding (whether

of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith. No Party shall have any right of recovery in respect hereof against
any Related Party of a Party and no personal liability shall attach to any
Related Party of a Party through such Party, whether by or through attempted

of its directors, members, partners, officers, employees or Affiliates (other
than, after the Closing, the Company) (collectively, the " _Seller Group_ "),
in each case, in connection with any Legal Proceeding or obligation arising
out of or relating to this Agreement, any Transaction Agreement or the
Transactions, notwithstanding its representation (or any continued
representation) of the Group Companies or other Waiving Parties, and each of
Parent and the Company on behalf of itself and the Waiving Parties hereby
consents thereto and irrevocably waives (and will not assert) any conflict of
interest, breach of duty or any other objection arising therefrom or relating
thereto. Parent and the Company acknowledge that the foregoing provision
applies whether or not Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher LLP provides legal services to
any Group Companies after the Closing Date. Each of Parent and the Company,
for itself and the Waiving Parties, hereby further irrevocably acknowledges
and agrees that all communications, written or oral, between any Group Company
or any member of the Seller Group and its counsel, including Gibson, Dunn and
Crutcher LLP, made in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution, delivery and performance under, or any dispute or
Legal Proceeding arising out of or relating to, this Agreement,
any Transaction Agreements or the Transactions, or any matter relating to any
of the foregoing, are privileged communications that do not pass to the
Company notwithstanding the Merger, and instead survive, remain with and are
controlled by the Seller Group (the " _Privileged Communications_ "), without
any waiver thereof. Parent and the Company, together with any of their
respective Affiliates, Subsidiaries, successors or assigns, agree that no
Person may use or rely on any of the Privileged Communications, whether
located in the records or email server of the Company or otherwise (including
in the knowledge or the officers and employees of the Company), in any Legal
Proceeding against or involving any of the Parties after the Closing, and
Parent and the Company agree not to assert that any privilege has been waived
as to the Privileged Communications, whether located in the records or email

11.16 _Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits_. The Disclosure Schedules
shall be arranged in separate parts corresponding to the numbered and
lettered sections and subsections contained in this Agreement, and the
information disclosed in any numbered or lettered part shall be deemed to
relate to and to qualify only the particular representation or warranty set
forth in the corresponding numbered or lettered Section or subsection of this
Agreement, except to the extent that: (a) such information is cross-referenced
in another part of the Disclosure Schedules; or (b) it is reasonably apparent
on the face of the disclosure (without reference to any document referred to

respect to the matters covered by the information, and may not be required to
be disclosed pursuant to this Agreement. The specification of any dollar
amount in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or
the inclusion of any specific item in the Disclosure Schedules is not
intended to imply that such amounts (or higher or lower amounts) are or are
not material, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts
or the fact of the inclusion of any such item in the Disclosure Schedules in
any dispute or controversy between the Parties as to whether any obligation,
item, or matter not described herein or included in Disclosure Schedules is
or is not material for purposes of this Agreement.
