reasonable discretion after consultation with the Equityholder Representative,
results in the foregoing certificates being insufficient to avoid withholding
under Section 1445 of the Code (and the Treasury Regulations promulgated

(or certifications), in a form reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, as is
necessary to avoid withholding of Tax under Section 1445 of the Code (and the

Equityholders under this Agreement; provided, further, that the sole recourse
for failing to deliver such form is to withhold under _Section 1.9_ to the

Section 1.9 _Withholding Rights_. Purchaser, the Surviving Company, the
Equityholder Representative, the Escrow Agent and the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to an
Equityholder pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
applicable Tax Laws; provided, however, that the Person intending to withhold
shall notify the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding
would be made in writing of its intention to deduct and withhold such amounts
and the reason therefor as soon as reasonably practicable, and such Person and
each of the applicable parties shall cooperate in good faith to reduce the
amount of, or eliminate the necessity for, such withholding. To the extent
amounts are so withheld and timely paid over to the appropriate Tax authority,
the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made. If any withholding obligation may be avoided by such
holder providing information or documentation to Purchaser, the Surviving
Company, the Equityholder Representative, the Escrow Agent or the Paying
Agent, such information shall be requested prior to any such withholding.

Effective Time (other than any Excluded Units) held by a Continuing Employee
(or a Permitted Transferee of such employee) (a " _Continuing Incentive Unit_

thereafter represent the right to receive (A) an amount in cash at the
Closing, without interest, equal to 75% of the Closing Company Unit
Consideration applicable to such Incentive Unit, (B) an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the remaining 25% of the Closing Company Unit

and conditions of the Escrow Agreement. Immediately following the Closing, the
Paying Agent shall pay (and the Escrow Agreement will provide for the Paying
Agent to pay) Blocker Holdings the Blocker Closing Consideration, by wire

purpose by Blocker Holdings, automatically and without the need for a Letter
of Transmittal or further instruction from any party. The Equityholder
Representative hereby agrees that the Closing Payments Memorandum (as defined
in the Escrow Agreement) delivered to the Escrow Agent (as Paying Agent) shall
in all respects be consistent with the Closing Payment Schedule. After the
Closing, promptly after receipt by the Equityholder Representative of a duly
executed and completed Letter of Transmittal by a Unitholder, a copy of which
is provided by the Equityholder Representative to Purchaser in accordance
herewith, the Equityholder Representative and the Purchaser shall deliver
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent (as Paying Agent) to release
from the Closing Date Holdback (as defined in the Escrow Agreement) the
portion of the Closing Aggregate Non-Escrow Consideration to which such
Unitholder is entitled at the Closing pursuant to _Article I_ , in accordance
with the Closing Payment Schedule (solely to the extent no such payment to
such Unitholder was already made by the Paying Agent under the Closing
Payments Memorandum).

  


 

  

(b) _Additional Consideration_. Any Additional Consideration which is payable
to the Equityholders in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and/or the
Escrow Agreement, when such consideration becomes payable under _Section 2.3_
, upon release of any Escrow Amount pursuant to the Escrow Agreement or upon
the distribution of any Holdback Amount by the Equityholder Representative
pursuant to this Agreement, as applicable, shall be paid by Purchaser, the
Escrow Agent or other applicable Person to the Equityholder Representative
(for the benefit of the applicable Equityholders) or as otherwise directed in
writing by the Equityholder Representative, subject to _Section 12.2(e)_ , or
shall be deposited in the

  


 

  

 

9  

  


 

  


 

  

Incentive Escrow Account as contemplated by _Section 1.10(d)(iii)_. Any
Additional Consideration shall be allocated by the Equityholder Representative

_1.10(d)_ , subject to _Section 12.2(e)_.

  


 

  

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in or Obligations from
Company Units_. The applicable portion of the Total Consideration paid in
respect of Company Units upon the surrender of a Letter of Transmittal in
accordance with the terms of this _Article I_ shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights and obligations pertaining to the
Company Units (other than any other rights and obligations provided herein),
and at the Effective Time, the membership interest transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration
of transfers on the membership interest transfer books of the Surviving
Company of the Company Units that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

  


 

  

(d) _Termination of Fund_. At any time following the first (1st) anniversary
of the Closing Date, the Surviving Company shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds that had been made available to the
Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed in accordance with this
_Article I_ (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, any Escrow Amount or
Continuing Incentive Amount held by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement), and thereafter Unitholders entitled to receive
payment pursuant to this _Article I_ shall be entitled to look only to the
Surviving Company (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any
applicable portion of the Closing Aggregate Non-Escrow Consideration, that may
be payable upon surrender of any Company Units held by such Unitholders, as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Company, Purchaser, the
Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of
Company Units for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant
to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by such Unitholders at such time at which such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority
shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of the
Surviving Company, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

  


 

  

(e) Purchaser shall have no liability to any of the Equityholders for any act

consistent classifications, judgments and estimation methodology, as were used
in the preparation of the Latest Balance Sheet, except as otherwise set forth
in the definitions of such terms (including, in the case of the Indebtedness
Amount, to the extent Indebtedness includes any non-GAAP items), and the Cash
Amount, Indebtedness Amount, Transaction Expenses and Net Working Capital
Amount shall be calculated without giving effect to and shall not include (w)
any changes in assets or liabilities as a result of purchase accounting
adjustments, (x) any transactions occurring on the Closing Date after the
Closing outside of the ordinary course of business, (y) transactions or
liabilities incurred by or at the direction of Purchaser or its Affiliates not
contemplated by this Agreement or described in clauses (a) through (c) of the
last sentence of the definition of "Transaction Expenses," or (z) any other
accounting adjustments arising from or resulting as a consequence of the

the Cash Amount, Indebtedness Amount, Transaction Expenses and Net Working
Capital Amount and the related purchase price adjustment contemplated by this
_Section 2.2_ (including any estimates of the foregoing pursuant to _Section
2.1_ ) is to (i) measure the Cash Amount, Indebtedness Amount and Transaction
Expenses and (ii) measure changes in the Net Working Capital Amount against
the Target Net Working Capital Amount, and such processes are not intended to
permit the introduction of different judgments, accounting methods, policies,
principles, practices, procedures, classifications or estimation methodologies
for the purpose of preparing the Preliminary Statement or determining the Cash
Amount, Indebtedness Amount, Transaction Expenses or Net Working Capital
Amount that are different from those contemplated by the immediately foregoing
sentence. The Cash Amount, Indebtedness Amount, Transaction Expenses and Net
Working Capital Amount in the Preliminary Statement shall be derived from the
books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and shall be prepared
and calculated in accordance with the Accounting Principles.

  


 

  

(b) The Equityholder Representative and its Representatives shall be permitted
reasonable access during normal business hours to review and obtain copies of
the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' books and records and any work papers
related to the preparation of the Preliminary Statement and the adjustments

may make inquiries of Purchaser, the Company and their respective accountants
regarding questions or disagreements, and Purchaser shall use its, and shall
cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to use their, reasonable

of the Equityholder Representative, the Surviving Company shall make available
its and its Subsidiaries\' personnel to advise and assist the Equityholder
Representative in its review of the Preliminary Statement and any objections
or disputes with respect thereto. If the Equityholder Representative has any
objections to the Preliminary Statement, the Equityholder Representative shall
deliver to Purchaser a statement setting forth its objections thereto, which
statement shall indicate each disputed item and the amount and the basis for
the Equityholder Representative\'s disagreement therewith and, to the extent
it has received from Purchaser the necessary related information, giving
reasonable detail in support thereof, and which statement may further indicate
any disputed items with respect to which the Equityholder Representative has
not received from Purchaser such necessary related information requested by
the Equityholder Representative (an " _Objections Statement_ "). The
Objections Statement shall only include disagreements based on mathematical
errors or based on the Cash Amount, Indebtedness Amount, Transaction Expenses
and Net Working Capital Amount not being calculated in accordance with this
Agreement. If an Objections Statement is not delivered to Purchaser within
forty-five (45) days after delivery of the Preliminary Statement to the
Equityholder Representative, the Preliminary Statement shall be final, binding
and non-appealable by the parties hereto.

  


 

  

(c) The Equityholder Representative and Purchaser shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve any objections in the Objections Statement, but if and to the

adjustments that is mutually selected by Purchaser and the Equityholder

Valuation Firm must be written and delivered to each party to the dispute. The
Valuation Firm shall make a final determination of the Cash Amount,
Indebtedness Amount, Transaction Expenses, Net Working Capital Amount and the
resulting Final Closing Aggregate Consideration calculated with reference to
such amounts (solely to the extent such amounts are in dispute), in accordance
with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement and in _Exhibit
F_. The parties shall cooperate with the Valuation Firm during the term of its
engagement. The determination of the Cash Amount, Indebtedness Amount,
Transaction Expenses, Net Working Capital Amount and the resulting Final
Closing Aggregate Consideration calculated with reference thereto, in each
case in the manner contemplated by this _Section 2.2_ , shall become final and
binding on the parties on the date the Valuation Firm delivers its final
resolution in writing to the parties, absent a showing of manifest error, and
an order may be entered in respect thereof in any court of competent
jurisdiction, subject to _Section 12.9_.

immediately available funds to the account designated in writing by the

_Section 1.11(b)_ the remaining funds in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Account, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in accordance with
the wire transfer instructions designated in writing by the Equityholder
Representative to the Escrow Agent. If the Final Closing Aggregate
Consideration is less than the Closing Aggregate Consideration, (x) the
Equityholder Representative and Purchaser shall promptly (but in any event
within three (3) Business Days of the determination of the Final Closing
Aggregate Consideration) jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to pay to Purchaser
from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount the absolute value of such
difference by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or more
accounts designated in writing by Purchaser to the Escrow Agent; provided that
(A) to the extent the absolute value of such difference exceeds the Purchase
Price Adjustment Escrow Amount (the amount of such excess, the " _Shortfall
Amount_ "), Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative shall promptly (but
in any event within three (3) Business Days of the determination of the Final
Closing Aggregate Consideration and simultaneously with the instruction in
clause (x)) jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to pay to Purchaser the
Shortfall Amount from the Indemnity Escrow Account simultaneously with the
payment to Purchaser from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account and (B)
to the extent that the absolute value of such difference is less than the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount and any balance in the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Account will remain after such payment to Purchaser from the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account, the Equityholder Representative and
Purchaser shall promptly (but in any event within three (3) Business Days of
the determination of the Final Closing Aggregate Consideration and
simultaneously with the instruction in clause (x)) jointly instruct the Escrow
Agent to pay, to the Equityholders in accordance with _Section 1.11(b)_ , the
amount remaining in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account, to the
account or accounts designated in writing by the Equityholder Representative
to the Escrow Agent. Neither the Equityholders nor the Equityholder
Representative shall have any liability for any amounts due pursuant to
_Section 2.2_ or _Section 2.3_ in excess of the Escrow Amount, and
Purchaser\'s sole source of recourse and recovery for such amounts due shall
be the funds available in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account or the
Indemnity Escrow Account, as applicable.

  


 

  

(b) The funds available in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account may be
distributed to Purchaser, the Equityholder Representative (for the benefit of
the Equityholders) and/or the Equityholders solely and exclusively in
accordance with _Section 2.3(a)_ and the terms of the Escrow Agreement
applicable to the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account and shall not be
available for any other payment to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates. All
title and all rights to all remaining funds in the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Account shall automatically transfer to the Equityholders (i)
immediately after the payments made to Purchaser under _Section 2.3(a)_ , if
the Final Closing Aggregate Consideration is less than the Closing Aggregate
Consideration, or (ii) immediately upon the final determination of the Final
Closing Aggregate Consideration, if the Final Closing Aggregate Consideration
is greater than or equal to the Closing Aggregate Consideration, in each case
in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

  


 

  

(c) The parties agree that any amount paid under this _Section 2.3_ shall be
treated as an adjustment to the Final Closing Aggregate Consideration for Tax
purposes and, except to the extent required by applicable Laws, agree not to
take any position inconsistent with such treatment on any Tax Return.

(c) Purchaser, and to the extent applicable its Affiliates, are legally,
technically and financially qualified to acquire, own and operate the Systems.
To the Knowledge of Purchaser, as of the date hereof, there is no fact
relating to Purchaser or its Affiliates that would reasonably be expected to
cause any Governmental Authority to fail to grant in a timely fashion any
consent or approval necessary for consummation by Purchaser and Merger Sub of
the Transactions. As of the date hereof, no waiver of any applicable Law is
necessary to be obtained for Purchaser, and to the extent applicable its
Affiliates, to obtain authority to hold, or control the holder of, as
applicable, any Company Permit set forth on Section 3.9(b) of the Disclosure
Schedule.

  


 

  

Section 6.4 _Governmental Approvals_. Except for (a) the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
pursuant to the DLLCA, (b) filings required under, and compliance with other
applicable requirements of, the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws, (c) the
consents, approvals and filings listed in Section 3.3 of the Disclosure
Schedule and (d) filings required under, and compliance with the other
applicable requirements of, the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and the listing
rules of the New York Stock Exchange, no material consents or approvals of, or
material filings, declarations or registrations with, any Governmental
Authority are necessary for the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Purchaser and Merger Sub and the consummation by Purchaser and Merger Sub of
the Transactions, other than as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

  


 

  

Section 6.5 _Brokers and Other Advisors_. No broker, investment banker,
financial advisor, intermediary, finder or other Person is entitled to any
broker\'s, finder\'s or financial advisor\'s fee or other similar fee or
commission, or the reimbursement of expenses, directly or indirectly, in
connection with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf
of Purchaser, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries for which the
Equityholders or the Equityholder Representative would be liable following the
Closing.

  


 

  

Section 6.6 _Ownership and Operations of Merger Sub_. Purchaser owns
beneficially and of record all of the outstanding membership interests of
Merger Sub. Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
Transactions, has engaged in no business activities, has never held any assets
and has taken actions only as contemplated hereby.

  


 

  

Section 6.7 _Financing_. Purchaser has provided to the Company a true and
complete copy, as of the date hereof, of an executed commitment letter from
the financial institutions identified therein and a corresponding fee letter
(which may be redacted solely to omit fee amounts and the economic terms of
the "market flex" items in a customary manner, and none of which redactions
would reduce the aggregate principal amount, adversely affect the conditions
to funding or availability of the Debt Financing or otherwise limit, prevent,
impede or delay the consummation of the Debt Financing) (as amended, modified
or supplemented in accordance with the terms herein, the " _Fee Letter_ ")
(together with all exhibits, annexes, schedules and term sheets attached
thereto and as may be amended, supplemented, modified, replaced or extended
from time to time to the extent permitted by _Section 7.15_ , collectively,
the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ "), providing, subject to the terms and
conditions therein, debt financings in the amounts set forth therein for the
purpose of funding the Transactions (the applicable debt financing under the
Debt

  


 

  

 

40  

  


 

  


 

  

Commitment Letter is referred to herein as the " _Debt Financing_ "). The
execution, delivery and performance of the Debt Commitment Letter by Purchaser
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, have been duly
and validly authorized by all requisite corporate action by Purchaser. The
Debt Commitment Letter (i) has been duly and validly executed by Purchaser and
(ii) is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Purchaser and, to the
Knowledge of Purchaser, the other parties thereto, in each case except as
enforceability may be limited by the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. As of
the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and
the respective obligations and commitments contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter have not been withdrawn, rescinded or terminated or otherwise amended
or modified in any respect, and no withdrawal, rescission, amendment or
modification thereof is contemplated by Purchaser or, to the Knowledge of
Purchaser, any other party thereto, or the subject of any discussions with
Purchaser or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, any other party thereto (other
than any customary amendment to include new lenders, lead arrangers or other
financial institutions or as expressly provided for thereunder upon obtaining
(or not obtaining) the Amendment (as defined therein)). As of the date hereof,
no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would constitute a breach or default on the part of Purchaser or, to the
Knowledge of Purchaser, any of the other parties to the Debt Commitment
Letter. Assuming (i) the accuracy of the representations in all material
respects set forth in _Articles III_, _IV_ and _V_ , (ii) the performance by
the Company and its Subsidiaries of the covenants and agreements set forth in
_Section 7.1_, and (iii) that the Debt Financing is funded in accordance with
its terms, the net proceeds from the Debt Financing, together with cash on
hand of Purchaser and cash on hand of the Company and its Subsidiaries, will
be sufficient for Purchaser to consummate the Transactions, including the
repayment of any Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries contemplated
by this Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letter and the payment of the maximum
amount of all related fees and expenses (including all indicative, "flex" and
other fees and original issue discount) payable by Purchaser in connection
with the Transactions. Purchaser has paid in full any and all commitment or
other fees required in connection with the Debt Commitment Letter that are due
as of the date hereof. The only conditions precedent to the obligations of the
Debt Financing Sources to fund the full amount of the Debt Financing are those
expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, and assuming the accuracy
of the representations in all material respects set forth in _Articles_ _III_
, _IV_ and _V_ and the performance of the covenants and agreements set forth
in this Agreement by each of the Company and its Subsidiaries, Purchaser does
not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Debt
Financing will not be satisfied or that the Debt Financing will not be
available to Purchaser on the date of the Closing. There are no side letters
or other Contracts or any understandings, conditions or contingencies (except
for the Fee Letter), relating to or affecting the Debt Financing to which
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates is
a party other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter that
would (i) impair the enforceability of the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) impose
new or additional conditions precedent to the Debt Financing, (iii) reduce the
aggregate principal amount of the Debt Financing that is available at the
Closing or (iv) otherwise materially limit, prevent, impede or delay the
consummation of the Debt Financing.

  


 

  

Section 6.8 _Legal Proceedings_. There are no suits or proceedings pending
(except for proceedings affecting the cable or telecommunications industry
generally) or, to Purchaser\'s Knowledge, threatened in writing against
Purchaser or Merger Sub, at law or in equity, or before or by any Governmental
Authority, which, if determined adversely to Purchaser or Merger Sub, would
prevent or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay Purchaser\'s or

  


 

  

 

41  

  


 

  


 

  

Merger Sub\'s timely performance under this Agreement or the consummation of
the Transactions. Neither Purchaser nor Merger Sub are subject to any
outstanding judgment, order or decree of any Governmental Authority (other
than judgments, orders or decrees affecting the cable or telecommunications
industry generally) that would prevent or materially impede, interfere with,
hinder or delay Purchaser\'s or Merger Sub\'s timely performance under this
Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions.

  


 

  

Section 6.9 _Investment Representation_. Purchaser is acquiring the membership
interests of the Company through the Merger and the Shares for its own account
with the present intention of holding such securities for investment purposes
and not with a view to, or for sale in connection with, any distribution of
such securities in violation of any federal or state securities Laws.
Purchaser is an "accredited investor" as defined in Regulation D promulgated
by the SEC under the Securities Act. Purchaser acknowledges that the
membership interests of the Company and the Shares have not been registered
under the Securities Act, or any state or foreign securities Laws and that the
membership interests of the Company and the Shares may not be sold,
transferred, offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of
unless such transfer, sale, assignment, pledge, hypothecation or other
disposition is registered under any applicable state or foreign securities
Laws or sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities
Act, and any applicable state or foreign securities Laws.

  


 

  

Section 6.10 _Solvency_. Assuming (a) that the representations and warranties
of the Company, Blocker and Blocker Holdings contained in this Agreement are
true and correct in all material respects, (b) the compliance and performance
by the Company and its Subsidiaries, Blocker and Blocker Holdings of their
respective obligations hereunder in all material respects, (c) the
satisfaction of the conditions to Purchaser\'s obligations to close in
_Article VIII_ and (d) that the Company and its Subsidiaries are solvent
immediately prior to the Effective Time, immediately after giving effect to
the Transactions, Purchaser, the Surviving Company and each of their
respective Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis (i) will be able to pay their
respective debts as they become due, (ii) shall own property that has a fair
saleable value greater than the amounts required to pay their respective debts
(including a reasonable estimate of the amount of all contingent liabilities)
and (iii) will have adequate capital to carry on their respective businesses.
No transfer of property is being made and no obligation is being incurred in
connection with the Transactions by Purchaser or Merger Sub with the intent to
hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of Purchaser,
Merger Sub, Blocker, the Surviving Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries.

waivers,

  


 

  

 

48  

  


 

  


 

  

registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations from any
Governmental Authority necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Transactions as soon as practicable in connection with Antitrust Laws. For
purposes hereof, " _Antitrust Laws_ " means the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act,
the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act and all other applicable Laws
issued by a Governmental Authority that are designed or intended to prohibit,
restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or
restraint of trade or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition.

  


 

  

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing: (i) Purchaser,
Merger Sub and the Company agree to (A) make, or cause to be made, appropriate
filings of Notification and Report Forms pursuant to the HSR Act and any other
required filings under any other Antitrust Laws with respect to the
Transactions as soon as practicable (and, with respect to filings under the
HSR Act, within fifteen (15) Business Days after the date hereof (unless
Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative otherwise agree to a different
date)), (B) supply as soon as practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or any
other Antitrust Law and (C) use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all other actions consistent with this _Section 7.5_ necessary to
cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under
the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Law (including any extensions thereof) as
soon as practicable and (ii) each party agrees to, in connection with
Antitrust Laws and required filings thereunder, (A) supply as soon as
practical any additional information and documentary material that may be
required or requested by any Governmental Authority and (B) use its reasonable
best efforts to take or cause to be taken all other actions consistent with
this _Section 7.5_ as necessary to obtain any necessary approvals, consents,
waivers, permits, authorizations or other actions or non-actions from each
Governmental Authority as soon as practicable. The parties shall cause the
filings under the HSR Act to be considered for grant of "early termination,"
and shall request the equivalent under any other Antitrust Laws.

  


 

  

(c) Each party hereto shall, in connection with Antitrust Laws and required
filings thereunder: (i) promptly notify the other parties hereto of, and if in
writing, furnish the others with copies of (or, in the case of oral
communications, advise the others of the contents of) any material
communication to such Person from a Governmental Authority and permit the
others to review and discuss in advance (and to consider in good faith any
comments made by the others in relation to) any proposed written communication
to a Governmental Authority, (ii) keep the others reasonably informed of any
developments, meetings or discussions with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any filings, investigation, or inquiry concerning the Transactions
and (iii) not independently participate in any meeting or discussions with a
Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry
concerning the Transactions without giving the other party prior notice of
such meeting or discussions and, unless prohibited by such Governmental
Authority, the opportunity to attend or participate. However, each of
Purchaser and the Company may designate any non-public information provided to
any Governmental Authority as restricted to " _Outside Antitrust Counsel_ "
only and any such information shall not be shared with employees, officers,
managers or directors or their equivalents of the other party without approval
of the party providing the non-public information.

  


 

  

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, but subject to
_Section 7.5(f)_ , Purchaser and Merger Sub agree to take, and to cause their
respective Subsidiaries to take,

  


 

  

 

49  

  


 

  


 

  

promptly any and all steps necessary to avoid, eliminate or resolve each and
every impediment and obtain all clearances, consents, approvals and waivers
under Antitrust Laws that may be required by any Governmental Authority so as
to enable the parties to close the Transactions as soon as practicable (and in
any event no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Outside Date),
including committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
orders, trust, or otherwise, (i) the sale, license, holding separate or other
disposition of assets or businesses of Purchaser, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, (ii) terminating, relinquishing, modifying or waiving
existing relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations or other
arrangements of Purchaser, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries, (iii)
creating any relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations or other
arrangements of Purchaser, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries and
(iv) any other action, including agreeing to future behavioral remedies,
requested by a Governmental Authority in order to achieve clearance under any
Antitrust Law (each, a " _Remedial Action_ "); provided, __ however, that any
Remedial Action involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any of
their respective assets or businesses) shall, unless otherwise consented to by
the Company in its sole discretion, be conditioned upon consummation of the
Transactions.

  


 

  

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, but subject to
_Section 7.5(f)_ , in the event that any litigation or other administrative or
judicial action or proceeding is commenced, threatened or is foreseeable
challenging any of the Transactions and such litigation, action or proceeding
seeks, or would reasonably be expected to seek, to prevent, materially impede
or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions, Purchaser shall use
its reasonable best efforts (including a Remedial Action) to avoid or resolve
any such litigation, action or proceeding and each of the parties hereto shall
cooperate with each other and use its respective reasonable best efforts to
contest and resist any such litigation, action or proceeding and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Transactions as
promptly as practicable and in any event no later than three (3) Business Days
prior to the Outside Date.

  


 

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing in this
Agreement, including this _Section 7.5_ and the "reasonable best efforts"
standard, shall require or be construed to require Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries or other Affiliates to take any Remedial Action in connection
with Antitrust Laws (i) with respect to or involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, to the extent that such action, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) with respect to or involving Purchaser
or any of its Subsidiaries, to the extent that such action, individually or in
the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to be material to Purchaser and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (a " _Burdensome Condition_ "). Without the
prior written consent of Purchaser (which may be withheld for any reason or no
reason at all), Blocker, the Company and its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates
will not take or agree to take any Remedial Action in connection with
Antitrust Laws regardless of whether such action would constitute a Burdensome
Condition.

  

  

(g) The Company, Merger Sub and Purchaser shall each, with the reasonable
cooperation of the other, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
consents with respect to the consummation of the Transactions in respect of
the Contracts set forth on _Section 7.5(g)_ of the

  

 

50  

  


 

  


 

  

Disclosure Schedule and all other third-party consents reasonably requested by
Purchaser in writing within thirty (30) days of the date hereof which are
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Transactions as soon as
practicable. For purposes of this _Section 7.5(g)_ , "commercially reasonable
efforts" in connection with such consents will not, among other things, be
deemed to require the Company, Merger Sub or Purchaser to undertake
extraordinary measures, including the waiver of any condition to Closing in
its favor, the initiation or prosecution of any legal proceedings or the
expenditure of payment of funds in excess of normal and usual administrative
and processing fees, if any, or the giving of any other consideration by the
Company, Purchaser or Merger Sub or any adjustment to the Closing Aggregate
Consideration with respect to seeking or obtaining any such consents.

  


 

  

Section 7.6 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be reasonably agreed upon by Purchaser,
the Company and the Equityholder Representative. Following such initial press
release, Purchaser, the Company and the Equityholder Representative shall
consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to
review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with
respect to the Transactions and shall not issue any such press release or make
any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as such party may
reasonably conclude may be required by applicable Law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or the listing rules of any
national securities exchange or national securities quotation system (and then
only after as much advance notice and consultation as is reasonably feasible);
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not preclude (a) communications or
disclosures necessary to implement the provisions of this Agreement or,
following a Closing, in connection with court filings made in any litigation
related to the parties or this Agreement or (b) press releases and other
communications or disclosures that in the good faith judgment of the
applicable party are consistent with prior press releases issued or other
public communications or disclosures made in compliance with this _Section
7.6_ ; provided, further, that each Equityholder and its respective Affiliates
may disclose financial return and other financial performance or statistical
information in connection with fundraising, marketing, informational or
reporting activities to current and potential equityholders or investors.

  


 

  

Section 7.7 _Access to Information; Contact with Employees, Customers and
Suppliers; Confidentiality_. (a) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, from the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing
or the date on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its
terms, the Company shall afford to Purchaser and its Representatives
(including any insurers and underwriters in respect of the Representation and
Warranty Insurance Policy) reasonable access during normal business hours to
the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' properties, books, Contracts and
records, and the Company shall furnish promptly to Purchaser such information
concerning the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' respective business and
properties as Purchaser may reasonably request; provided that Purchaser and
its Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as not
to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or
its Subsidiaries; provided, further, that the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall not be obligated to provide such access or information (i) if the
Company determines, in its reasonable judgment after consultation with
counsel, that doing so would violate applicable Law or a Contract or
obligation of confidentiality owing to a third-party, jeopardize the
protection of the attorney-client privilege or expose such party to risk of
liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal information or (ii) that
constitute non-financial trade secrets

  


 

  

 

51  

  


 

  


 

  

(provided that, in each case, the parties shall reasonably cooperate in
seeking an alternative means whereby Purchaser is provided access to such
information or the contents or a reasonable redacted summary thereof). Until
the Closing, the information provided shall be subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement and, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Purchaser shall not, and Purchaser shall cause its respective
Representatives not to, use such information for any purpose unrelated to the
consummation of the Transactions.

  


 

  

(b) Prior to the Closing, Purchaser, Merger Sub and their respective
Representatives may only contact and communicate with the employees,
customers, service providers and suppliers of the Company and its Subsidiaries
related to the Transactions (i) pursuant to Section 7.7(b) of the Disclosure
Schedule or (ii) after prior consultation with and written approval of the
Equityholder Representative, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

  


 

  

(c) Copies of confidentiality agreements entered into by the Company or any of
its Affiliates with any Person in connection with the proposed sale of the
Company shall be provided by the Company to Purchaser on or promptly after the
Closing Date.

  


 

  

Section 7.8 _Access to Books and Records_. From and after the Closing, for a
period of seven (7) years, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Company to, provide the Equityholder Representative and its authorized
Representatives with access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable
notice, to (i) the books and records (for the purpose of examining and
copying) of Blocker and the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to
periods or occurrences prior to or on the Closing Date and (ii) employees of
Purchaser, the Surviving Company and their Subsidiaries for purposes of better
understanding such books and records in each case only (A) to the extent
necessary for the Equityholder Representative or the Equityholders to comply
with applicable Law, comply with a request, investigation, inquiry or
examination from any regulatory authority or comply with or perform
obligations under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement or the obligations of
the Equityholder Representative or its Affiliates to their limited partners or
(B) in connection with a dispute, action, suit, proceeding, DandO Claim or
litigation (x) under this Agreement or (y) brought by a third party against an
Indemnitee or an Equityholder or one of their Affiliates; provided that the
Equityholder Representative and its authorized Representatives shall conduct
any such activities in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the
business or operations of Purchaser, the Surviving Company or their respective
Subsidiaries; provided, further, that in connection with litigation to which
the Equityholder Representative, the Equityholders or any of their respective
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, on the
other hand, are adverse parties, Purchaser shall not be required to (I)
provide access to employees of Purchaser, the Surviving Company and their
Subsidiaries or (II) disclose any information to the extent disclosure of such
information is protected by Purchaser\'s privilege in connection with such
litigation (and for the avoidance of doubt, is not subject to the privileged
rights referred to in _Section 12.17_ ). Unless otherwise consented to in
writing by the Equityholder Representative, Purchaser shall not, and shall not
permit Blocker, the Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries to, for a period of
seven (7) years following the Closing Date, destroy, alter or otherwise
dispose of any of the books and records of Blocker or the Company or its
Subsidiaries for any period prior to the Closing Date without first giving
reasonable prior written notice to the Equityholder Representative and
offering to surrender to the Equityholder Representative such books and
records or any portion thereof that

  


 

  

 

52  

  


 

  


 

  

Purchaser or the Surviving Company or an Affiliate may intend to destroy,
alter or dispose of. From and after the Closing, the Equityholder
Representative agrees not to disclose the information obtained pursuant to
this _Section 7.8_ to any Person, other than as would be permitted under
exceptions similar to those applicable to Purchaser under the Confidentiality
Agreement as of the date hereof (it being understood that any use restrictions
contained therein shall instead be deemed to refer to uses in furtherance of
the circumstances described in the foregoing clause (A) and (B)).

  


 

  

Section 7.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

  


 

  

(a) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Company and Blocker, as applicable, to (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless
each individual who is a current or former member, manager, director and
officer of Blocker, the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable,
(each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") against
all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs
(including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and expenses (including
fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any actual or
threatened claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation (whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative) (each, a " _D andO Claim_"), whenever
asserted, arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or
omission relating to their position with Blocker, the Company or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, occurring or alleged to have occurred before or
at the Closing (including any DandO Claim relating in whole or in part to this
Agreement or the Transactions), to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law and (ii) assume all obligations of Blocker, the Company and its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, to the Indemnitees in respect of limitation of
liability, exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses as
provided in (A) the Company Charter Documents or Blocker Charter Documents, as
applicable, and the respective organizational documents of each of the
Company\'s Subsidiaries, in each case, as in effect on the date hereof and (B)
any indemnification agreements with an Indemnitee, in each case, as in effect
on the date hereof, which shall in each case survive the Transactions and
continue in full force and effect to the extent permitted by applicable Law.
Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the Closing, Purchaser shall
ensure that (x) the Surviving Company fulfills its obligations to the
applicable Indemnitees pursuant to the terms of the Company Charter Documents,
and (y) Blocker fulfills its obligations to the applicable Indemnitees,
pursuant to the terms of Blocker Charter Documents, in each case, as in effect
on the date hereof.

  


 

  

(b) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Company and Blocker to, pay and advance to each Indemnitee any expenses
(including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any DandO
Claim relating to any acts or omissions covered under this _Section 7.9_ or
the enforcement of an Indemnitee\'s rights under this _Section 7.9_ as and
when incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; provided,
that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay
such expenses (but only to the extent required by applicable Law, the Blocker
Charter Documents, the Company Charter Documents, applicable organization
documents of Subsidiaries of the Company or applicable indemnification
agreements as in effect prior to the date hereof).

  


 

  

(c) Each of Purchaser, Blocker and the Company shall cooperate with the
Indemnitees in the defense of any DandO Claim and shall provide access to
properties and individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be
furnished records, information and

  


 

  

 

53  

  


 

  


 

  

testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery, proceedings, hearings,
trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested by an Indemnitee in
connection therewith. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this _Section 7.9_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, Purchaser shall not (and
Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Company and Blocker not to) settle or
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek
termination with respect to any DandO Claim, unless such settlement, compromise,
consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all of the
Indemnitees covered by the claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation. Nothing in this _Section 7.9(c)_ shall relieve Purchaser,
Blocker or the Surviving Company of its obligations set forth in _Section
7.9_.

  


 

  

(d) Prior to the Closing, the Company may negotiate and purchase, and after
the Closing Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, maintain
in effect, "tail" insurance coverage (" _Tail Coverage_ ") with an insurer
with the same or better credit rating as the current carrier of the Company as
of the date hereof that provides coverage for a period of six (6) years from
the Closing with respect to the policies of directors\' (or managers\') and
officers\' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance in effect as
of the date hereof maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries covering
matters arising on or before the Closing; provided that if the Company does
not negotiate and purchase such Tail Coverage prior to the Closing, Purchaser
shall negotiate and purchase such Tail Coverage upon Closing and provide
reasonably satisfactory evidence to the Equityholder Representative of the
purchase and funding of such Tail Coverage in connection with the Closing.
Such Tail Coverage shall be on terms with respect to coverage and in amounts
no less favorable than those of the policies of directors\' (or managers\')
and officers\' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance in effect
as of the date hereof; provided that the premium for such Tail Coverage shall
not exceed 250% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company and its
Subsidiaries for such insurance in effect as of the date hereof.

  


 

  

(e) The provisions of this _Section 7.9_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution
for or limitation of, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. The obligations of
Purchaser, Blocker and the Surviving Company under this _Section 7.9_ shall
not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the
rights of any Indemnitee to whom this _Section 7.9_ applies unless (A) such
termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (B) the affected
Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or her representatives shall have
consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly
agreed that the Indemnitees, heirs and representatives to whom this _Section
7.9_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.9_ ).

  


 

  

(f) In the event that Purchaser, Blocker, the Surviving Company or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Purchaser, Blocker and the Surviving Company shall assume all of
the obligations thereof set forth in this _Section 7.9_.

  


 

  


 

  

 

54  

  


 

  


 

  

(g) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to members\', managers\', directors\' and
officers\' insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to Blocker, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective managers, directors or officers.

  


 

  

Section 7.10 _Merger Sub and the Surviving Company_. Purchaser shall take all
actions necessary to (a) cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Company to perform
promptly their respective obligations under this Agreement and (b) cause
Merger Sub to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement. Purchaser unconditionally guarantees the full and prompt
performance by Merger Sub and the Surviving Company, as applicable, of their
respective obligations under this Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 7.11 _No Control of Other Party\'s Business_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement is intended to give Purchaser or Merger Sub, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct Blocker\'s, the Company\'s or its
Subsidiaries\' operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective
Time, each of Blocker and the Company, as applicable, shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries\' respective operations.

  


 

  

Section 7.12 _Employee Matters_.

  


 

  

(a) Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Company to, and the Surviving Company
shall, for a period of at least one year following the Closing (or any such
shorter period of employment), provide to each individual who is an employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the
Closing (each, a " _Company Employee_ ") at least the same base salary that
was provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing.

  


 

  

(b) For eligibility and vesting purposes (other than vesting of future equity
awards) and for purposes of determining severance amounts and future vacation
accruals under the compensation and employee benefit plans, policies or
arrangements of Purchaser and its Affiliates, each Company Employee shall
receive credit for his or her service with the Company and its Subsidiaries
before the Closing to the same extent that such Company Employee was entitled,
before the Closing, to credit for his or her service under any similar or
comparable Company Plans (except to the extent this credit would result in a
duplication of accrual of benefits in respect of the same period of service).
In addition, for any medical, dental, health or other welfare benefit plan,
program or arrangement maintained by Purchaser or its Affiliates (each, a "
_Successor Plan_ ") other than the plan or plans in which Company Employees
participated immediately prior to the Closing (each, a " _Prior Plan_ "),
Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause each Company
Employee to be eligible to participate immediately, without any waiting time,
in any and all Successor Plans, (ii) cause the Successor Plans to not include
any restrictions, limitations or exclusionary provisions with respect to pre-
existing conditions, exclusions or any actively-at-work requirements relating
to such Company Employee and his or her dependents (except to the extent that
such exclusions or requirements were applicable under any similar Prior Plan
at the time of commencement of participation in such Successor Plan) and (iii)
cause any eligible expenses incurred by any Company Employee and his or her
covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Prior Plan
ending on the date of such Company Employee\'s commencement of participation
in the Successor Plan to be taken into account under the Successor Plan for
purposes

  


 

  

 

55  

  


 

  


 

  

of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if these amounts had been paid in
accordance with the Successor Plan. Prior to the Closing, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall have taken such actions as may be necessary to fully vest
all account balances of participants and beneficiaries in all Company Plans
providing for deferral of compensation pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Code
or Roth 401(k) contributions (each, a " _Company 401(k) Plan_ "). The Company
and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall cause to be adopted resolutions
terminating each Company 401(k) Plan effective at least one day prior to the
Closing Date but contingent on the occurrence of the Closing, and shall
provide Purchaser with copies of such adopted resolutions. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, as soon as practicable and in any event
within ninety (90) days following the Closing, Purchaser shall (i) permit each
Company Employee who was a participant in or eligible to participate in a
Company 401(k) Plan prior to the Closing to participate in a tax-qualified
defined contribution retirement plan established or designated by Purchaser
(the " _Purchaser 401(k) Plan_ ") and (ii) take any and all actions as may be
required to permit each Company Employee to make rollover contributions of
"eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of
the Code) in the form of cash and excluding plan loans to the Purchaser 401(k)
Plan in an amount equal to the eligible rollover distribution portion of the
account balance distributed to such Company Employee from any Company 401(k)
Plan.

  


 

  

(c) After the Closing, the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries shall (i)
recognize and provide all earned but unused paid vacation and sick leave days
of the Company Employees as of the Closing Date and (ii) allow each of the
Company Employees to use such earned but unused vacation and sick leave days
at such times as would have been allowed under the Company\'s vacation and
sick leave policies as in effect immediately prior to the Closing.

  


 

  

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.12_ , express or implied: (i) shall
be construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement or arrangement, (ii) shall subject to compliance with the
other provisions of _Section 7.12_ alter or limit the Surviving Company\'s or
any of their Affiliates\' ability to amend, modify or terminate any particular
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing, (iii) is
intended to confer upon any current or former employee any right to employment
or continued employment for any period of time, or any right to a particular
term or condition of employment, (iv) shall limit the ability of Purchaser or
its Affiliates to terminate the employment of any employee at any time and for
any or no reason or (v) is intended to confer upon any individual other than a
party to this Agreement (including employees, retirees, or dependents or
beneficiaries of employees or retirees) any right as a third party beneficiary
of this Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 7.13 _LFA Consents and Filings_.

  


 

  

(a) The Company, Merger Sub and Purchaser shall each, with the reasonable
cooperation of the other, use reasonable best efforts to obtain and maintain
all LFA Approvals in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

  


 

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to, within ten (10) Business Days after the date
hereof (unless Purchaser and the Company otherwise agree to a different date),
prepare (for Purchaser\'s review and

  


 

  

 

56  

  


 

  


 

  

reasonable input prior to filing) and file or deliver, or cause to be prepared
and filed or delivered, all applications and requests required to be filed
with or delivered to a Governmental Authority that are necessary to obtain any
LFA Approval in connection with the Transactions contemplated hereby.

  


 

  

(c) If Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Company are unable to obtain one or more
of the LFA Approvals prior to the Closing, despite using their respective
reasonable best efforts to obtain such LFA Approvals in accordance with this
Agreement and other than as a result of a breach or inaccuracy of any of the
Company Representations, Blocker Representations, Blocker Holdings
Representations or Purchaser Representations, from and after the Closing, none
of Purchaser, the Surviving Company or the Equityholder Representative shall
have any further obligation with respect to obtaining such LFA Approvals or
any liability arising out of or relating to the failure of such LFA Approvals
to have been obtained and no Indemnified Person may make a claim or recover
with respect thereto pursuant to _Article X_ (it being understood that nothing
in this _Section 7.13(c)_ shall preclude any Indemnified Person from making
claims or recovering under _Article X_ with respect to the Company\'s or
Purchaser\'s and Merger Sub\'s, as applicable, failure to use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain all LFA Approvals or otherwise breaching any of its
covenants or agreements contained in this _Section 7.13_ prior to the
Closing). For purposes of this Agreement, "reasonable best efforts" in
connection with LFA Approvals will not, among other things, be deemed to
require the Equityholder Representative, the Equityholders, the Company or
Purchaser to undertake extraordinary measures, including the waiver of any
condition to Closing in its favor, the initiation or prosecution of any legal
proceedings or the expenditure or payment of any funds in excess of normal and
usual administrative, transfer, filing and processing fees, if any, or the
giving of any other consideration by the Equityholder Representative, the
Equityholders, the Company or Purchaser or any adjustment to the Closing
Aggregate Consideration with respect to seeking or obtaining any such consents
or LFA Approvals. To the extent that payment of any such excess funds is
required to obtain any LFA Approval and Purchaser has not elected to pay 50%
of such excess funds (provided that such portion of such excess funds to be
borne by Purchaser under the definition of Shared Expenses shall not exceed
the amount set forth on Section 7.13(c) of the Disclosure Schedule), then any
such LFA Approval shall be deemed obtained and received for purposes of
_Article III_ and _Section 8.2_.

  


 

  

(d) Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that, on the
Closing Date, Purchaser has replaced any such arrangements set forth on
Section 3.6(d) of the Disclosure Schedule. The Company and its Subsidiaries
may take any necessary steps to cash collateralize any such bonds, guaranties,
letters of credit or similar arrangements that will not be, or they reasonably
believe may not be, replaced by Purchaser at the Closing, and any cash of the
Company or its Subsidiaries used for such purpose at the Closing shall be
deemed Cash (except to the extent drawn upon by the beneficiary of such
arrangement).

  


 

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser and
the Company will jointly control and manage the process of obtaining the LFA
Approvals. Purchaser will cooperate with the Company in all commercially
reasonable respects in connection with the Company\'s efforts to obtain such
consents and LFA Approvals. Neither Purchaser nor any of its employees,
agents, representatives or any other Person acting on behalf of Purchaser will
contact any Governmental Authority or other Person from whom a LFA Approval is
sought

  


 

  

 

57  

  


 

  


 

  

for the purpose of seeking any amendment, modification or change to any
Franchise, License, other governmental authorization, or Contract, or for the
purpose of waiving or extending the time period in which such Governmental
Authority or other Person is required to act on the request for the LFA
Approval, or for any other purpose that could have the result of hindering or
delaying the receipt of any the Company\'s LFA Approval; provided, however, it
is understood and agreed that nothing herein shall prevent Purchaser (or its
employees, agents, representatives or any other Person acting on behalf of
Purchaser) from responding to requests initiated by Governmental Authorities
or other Persons from whom a LFA Approval is sought provided that Purchaser
shall promptly apprise the Company of all such requests prior to responding
and shall consult with the Company in good faith with respect to such
response.

  


 

  

(f) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall not agree, without Purchaser\'s
prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, to any
adverse change to the terms of any Company Permit or Contract as a condition
to obtaining any LFA Approval. If in connection with obtaining any such LFA
Approval, a Governmental Authority or other third party seeks to impose any
adverse condition or adverse change to any Company Permit or Contract to which
such consent or approval relates that would be applicable to Purchaser, the
Company or its Subsidiaries as a requirement for granting such consent or
approval, the Company will promptly notify Purchaser of such fact and the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall not agree to such condition or change
unless Purchaser shall, in its reasonably exercised discretion, consent to
such condition or change in writing. To the extent Purchaser has not consented
to any such change that is immaterial or commercially reasonable, any such LFA
Approval shall be deemed obtained and received for purposes of this Agreement
(including _Section 8.2_ ).

  


 

  

(g) The Company shall or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to (i) timely
file valid requests for renewal under Section 626 of the Cable Act with the
proper Governmental Authority with respect to all Franchises that will expire
within 30 months of the Closing Date, except with respect to Franchises for
which the Company and/or the applicable Subsidiary receives a replacement
statewide Franchise covering the applicable System(s), and (ii) timely file
valid requests for renewal with the proper Governmental Authority, to the
extent required, with respect to all other telecommunications franchises that
will expire within six (6) months of the Closing Date. The Company shall or
shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to use reasonable best efforts to obtain a
renewal, extension or replacement of any Franchise for which a valid notice of
renewal pursuant to the formal renewal procedures established by Section 626
of the Cable Act has not been timely delivered to the appropriate Governmental
Authority after January 1, 2014 and with respect to which no written
confirmation has been received after January 1, 2014 from such Governmental
Authority that the procedures established by Section 626 nonetheless will be
applicable with respect to the renewal or extension of such Franchise;
provided that the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not agree to any adverse
condition or adverse change to such Franchise unless Purchaser shall, in its
reasonably exercised discretion, consent to such condition or change in
writing. To the extent Purchaser has not consented to any such condition or
change that is immaterial or commercially reasonable, any such Franchise
extension or Franchise renewal shall be deemed obtained and received for
purposes of this Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 7.14 _Updates_. From the date hereof until the Closing Date, if the
Company, Blocker or Blocker Holdings becomes aware of any variances from the
Company Representations, Blocker Representations or Blocker Holdings
Representations in _Article III_,

  


 

  

 

58  

  


 

  


 

  

 _Article IV_, or _Article __V_ , respectively, the Company, Blocker, or
Blocker Holdings shall disclose to Purchaser in writing such variances
promptly following the Company, Blocker or Blocker Holdings obtaining
knowledge thereof.

  


 

  

Section 7.15 _Financing_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Debt
Financing on the terms and conditions (including the "market flex" provisions)
described in the Debt Commitment Letter, including using its reasonable best
efforts to (i) comply with its obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter,
(ii) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter, (iii) negotiate and enter
into definitive agreements (such definitive agreements, together with the Debt
Commitment Letter and any related fee letters, the " _Debt Financing
Documents_ ") with respect to the Debt Financing on terms and conditions
(including the "market flex" provisions) contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter (or on other terms that, with respect to conditionality or the ability
of Purchaser to timely consummate the Debt Financing or the Closing, are not
less favorable in any material respect to Purchaser than those contained in
the Debt Commitment Letter), (iv) satisfy on a timely basis at or prior to the
Closing all conditions precedent to funding in the Debt Commitment Letter that
are within the control of Purchaser or any of Purchaser\'s Affiliates,
including the payment of any fees required as a condition to the Debt
Financing (or, if deemed advisable by Purchaser, obtain the waiver of
conditions applicable to Purchaser contained in the Debt Commitment Letter),
(v) enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter to the extent
necessary to cause any lender to provide such Debt Financing and (vi) if all
conditions explicitly set forth in the first paragraph of Section 5 of the
Debt Commitment Letter (the " _Financing Conditions_ ") have been satisfied or
waived, consummate the Debt Financing on the Closing Date. Purchaser shall
keep the Equityholder Representative and the Company informed on a reasonable
basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Debt Financing, including (x) providing the Equityholder Representative and
the Company with copies of all assignments, amendments, supplements,
modifications, replacements, restatements, substitutions or waivers to or
under the Debt Commitment Letter and executed definitive agreements related to
the Debt Financing (subject, in the case of any fee letter related to the Debt
Financing, to redactions solely to omit fee amounts and economic terms of the
"market flex" items in a customary manner, and none of which redactions would
reduce the aggregate principal amount or adversely affect the conditionality
of the Debt Financing or otherwise limit, prevent, impede or delay the
consummation of the Debt Financing), (y) upon reasonable request of the
Company, confirming with the financial institutions party to the Debt
Commitment Letter their intent and ability to perform, and the availability of
the Debt Financing, under the Debt Commitment Letters, subject only to
satisfaction or waiver of the Financing Conditions and (z) upon reasonable
request of the Company, confirming that neither Purchaser nor the financial
institutions party to the Debt Commitment Letter are aware of any event or
condition that would reasonably be expected to result in the failure of a
Financing Condition. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, nothing contained in this _Section 7.15_ shall require, and in
no event shall the reasonable best efforts of Purchaser be deemed or construed
to require, Purchaser to pay any material fees in excess of those contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter (including the "market flex" provision) or agree
to "market flex" provisions (taken as a whole) materially less favorable to
Purchaser than such corresponding market flex provisions contained in or
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (in each case, whether to secure
waiver of any conditions contained therein or otherwise).

  


 

  


 

  

 

59  

  


 

  


 

  

(b) Purchaser shall give the Equityholder Representative and the Company
prompt written notice (x) upon having knowledge of any material default or
breach or threatened (in writing) material default or breach by any party to
the Debt Financing Documents or any termination of any of the Debt Financing
Documents, (y) upon the receipt of any written notice or other written
communication, in each case from any lender, finance source or affiliate
thereof with respect to any actual or potential material breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to any of the Debt Commitment Letters
or any Debt Financing Documents or any material dispute or disagreement
between or among any parties to any of the Debt Commitment Letters or Debt
Financing Documents with respect to the obligation to fund the Debt Financing
or the amount of the Debt Financing to be funded at Closing and (z) if for any
reason Purchaser believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain all
or any portion of the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter (taking into account any "market flex").
Purchaser shall not, without the prior written consent of the Equityholder
Representative, amend, modify, replace, extend, supplement, grant any consent
under or waive any of the conditions to funding contained in the Debt
Financing Documents or any other provision of the Debt Financing Documents
(other than in accordance with the "market flex" provisions), in each case if
such amendment, modification, replacement, extension supplement, grant of
consent or waiver could reasonably be expected to (i) reduce the aggregate
amount of the net proceeds of the Debt Financing below an amount that,
together with cash on hand of Purchaser and cash on hand of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, will be sufficient to consummate the Transactions, (ii)
materially delay, impede or prevent the funding of the Debt Financing (or
satisfaction of the conditions to the Debt Financing) on the Closing Date or
(iii) adversely impact the ability of Purchaser to consummate the Transactions
or the ability of Purchaser to enforce its rights against other parties to the
Debt Commitment Letter with respect to the Debt Financing; provided that
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Purchaser shall be
entitled from time to time to amend, restate, replace, supplement or otherwise
modify the Debt Commitment Letter solely for the purpose of adding agents, co-
agents, lenders, arrangers, bookrunners or other persons that have not
executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof, in each case,
subject to subclauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above. Upon any such amendment,
supplement, modification or waiver, in accordance with the terms of this
_Section __7.15(a)_ , the term " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " shall mean for all
purposes of this Agreement the Debt Commitment Letter as so amended,
supplemented, modified or waived. Purchaser shall promptly deliver to the
Equityholder Representative and the Company true and complete copies of any
such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver (subject, in the case of
any fee letter related to the Debt Financing, to redactions solely to omit fee
amounts and economic terms of the "market flex" items in a customary manner,
and none of which redactions would reduce the aggregate principal amount or
adversely affect the conditionality of the Debt Financing or otherwise limit,
prevent, impede, or delay the consummation of the Debt Financing). If all or
any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable, Purchaser shall
promptly notify the Company in writing and Purchaser shall use its reasonable
best efforts to (i) arrange to promptly obtain such portion of the Debt
Financing from alternative debt sources in an aggregate amount of net proceeds
sufficient, when added to any portion of the Debt Financing that is available,
cash on hand of Purchaser and cash on hand of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, to pay all amounts required to consummate the Transactions ("
_Alternative Debt Financing_ ") and (ii) obtain a new debt financing
commitment letter (the " _Alternative Debt Commitment Letter_ ") and new
definitive agreements with respect thereto that provides for financing on
terms and conditions (taken as a whole) not materially less

  


 

  

 

60  

  


 

  


 

  

favorable, in the aggregate, to Purchaser (taking into account the "market
flex" provisions of the existing Debt Commitment Letter); provided, however,
that without the prior consent of the Company, any amendment, modification,
supplement or waiver contained in such Alternative Debt Commitment Letter
shall be subject to subclauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this clause (b) above.
In such event, the term " _Debt Financing_ " as used in this Agreement shall
be deemed to include any Alternative Debt Financing, and the term " _Debt
Commitment Letter_ " as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to include any
Alternative Debt Commitment Letter. Purchaser shall promptly deliver to the
Equityholder Representative and the Company true and complete copies of any
such Alternative Debt Commitment Letter and such definitive documentation
(subject, in the case of any fee letter related to the Alternative Debt
Financing, to customary redactions (none of which redactions would reduce the
aggregate principal amount or adversely affect the conditionality of the
Alternative Debt Financing)).

  


 

  

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, each of Blocker Holdings, Blocker and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide, and shall cause
their Subsidiaries and use reasonable best efforts to cause their
Representatives to use reasonable best efforts to provide, on a timely basis,
to Purchaser, at Purchaser\'s sole expense, all cooperation reasonably
requested by Purchaser in connection with the arrangement, syndication and
consummation of the Debt Financing, which cooperation shall be limited to
using reasonable best efforts to:

  


 

  

(i) promptly furnish to Purchaser and its Debt Financing Sources such
customary reasonably available pertinent financial and other information as
Purchaser shall reasonably request in order to consummate the Debt Financing,
including all customary reasonably available information relating to Blocker,
the Company and its Subsidiaries customary for use in a confidential
information memorandum to syndicate loans of the type contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter;

  


 

  

(ii) provide customary reasonably available information about the Company and
its Subsidiaries to Purchaser promptly following reasonable request to be used
in the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, bank
information memoranda and similar marketing documents required in connection
with the Debt Financing;

  


 

  

(iii) promptly following reasonable request, provide Purchaser with all
customary reasonably available financial information and financial data in
connection with Purchaser\'s preparation of pro forma financial information,
financial statements and other pro forma financial data of Purchaser, Blocker,
the Company and its Subsidiaries; provided that the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not be responsible in any manner for information relating
to the proposed debt and equity capitalization that is required for such pro
forma financial information;

  


 

  

(iv) execute and deliver as of the Closing any pledge and security documents,
other definitive financing documents or other certificates or documents as may
be reasonably requested by Purchaser and otherwise facilitate the pledging of
collateral;

  


 

  


 

  

 

61  

  


 

  


 

  

(v) take all corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of the Closing,
reasonably requested by Purchaser that are necessary to permit the
consummation of the Debt Financing; and

  


 

  

(vi) provide all documentation and other information about the Company and its
Subsidiaries as is required by applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations including the USA PATRIOT Act;

  


 

  

provided that such requested cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere with
the ongoing operations of Blocker, the Company or its Subsidiaries; provided,
further, that in no event shall the Equityholder Representative, Blocker,
Blocker Holdings or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives be required in connection with the cooperation contemplated by
this _Section 7.15(b)_ to bear any cost or expense, pay any fee, enter into
any definitive agreement or incur any other liability in connection with the
Debt Financing prior to the Closing. Further, such assistance shall not
include any actions that the Company reasonably believes could reasonably be
expected to (x) result in a violation of any confidentiality arrangement or
material agreement (not entered into in contemplation thereof) or the loss of
any legal or other applicable privilege or (y) cause the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, the Equityholder Representative, Blocker Holdings, Blocker or
any of their respective Affiliates or any of their respective employees,
directors, officers or managers to incur any actual or potential liability in
connection with the arranging, marketing or syndication of the Debt Financing
or such assistance (except, in the case of the Company, its Subsidiaries or
Blocker, any such liability after the Closing). Nothing in this agreement
shall require any cooperation to the extent that it would require the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, the Equityholder Representative, Blocker Holdings,
Blocker or any of their respective employees, directors, officers or managers
to (i) pay or agree to pay any commitment or other fees or pay, incur or
reimburse any expenses prior to the Closing Date (except, in each case, to the
extent subject to concurrent reimbursement by Purchaser), (ii) approve the
execution or delivery of any document, certificate, resolution or consent in
connection with the Debt Financing that is not contingent upon the Closing
(and such approvals, in the case of employees, directors, officers or
managers, shall be limited to such employees, directors, officers or managers
continuing past the Closing Date) or (iii) take any action that would conflict
with, violate or result in a breach of or default under any organization
documents of the Company or of any of its Affiliates or any material Contract
or Law.

  


 

  

Purchaser shall promptly, upon request by the Equityholder Representative,
reimburse the Equityholder Representative, Blocker Holdings, Blocker or the
Company and its Subsidiaries for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses)
incurred by them and their respective Representatives in connection with the
Debt Financing, including the cooperation contemplated by this _Section_ _
7.15(b)_, and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Equityholder
Representative, Blocker Holdings, Blocker and the Company and its Subsidiaries
and their respective Representatives from and against any and all Damages
suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of the
Debt Financing and any information used in connection therewith, in each case
other than to the extent any of the foregoing arises from intentional fraud
with respect to any Company Representations, Blocker Representations or
Blocker Holdings Representations.

  

  

  

 

62  

  


 

  

(d) The Company hereby consents to the use of its logos solely in connection
with the Debt Financing, provided that such logos are used solely in a manner
that does not, and is not intended or reasonably likely to, harm or disparage
the Company or the Company\'s reputation or goodwill and will comply with the
Company\'s usage requirements to the extent made available to Purchaser prior
to the date of this Agreement.

  


 

  

(e) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of the Debt Financing
is not a condition to the Closing and reaffirms its obligation to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and independently
of the availability of the Debt Financing, subject to fulfillment or waiver of
the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_.

  


 

  

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything herein to the contrary, the
obligations of the Equityholder Representative, Blocker, Blocker Holdings and
the Company and its Subsidiaries set forth in _Section 7.15(b)_ are the sole
obligations of the Equityholder Representative, Blocker, Blocker Holdings and
the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to the Debt Financing and such
obligations shall not be used after the Closing as a basis for any claim of
any breach by the Equityholder Representative, Blocker, Blocker Holdings or
the Company or its Subsidiaries. The obligations of Purchaser set forth in
_Section 7.15_ (other than the last paragraph of _Section 7.15(c)_ ) shall not
be used after the Closing as a basis for any claim of any breach by Purchaser.

  


 

  

Section 7.16 _Termination of Affiliate Contracts and Intercompany Balances_.
Except as set forth on Section 7.16 of the Disclosure Schedule, the Company
shall cause each Contract between Blocker, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Majority Holders or any of their
Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), on the other hand,
to be terminated as of the Closing. Except as set forth on Section 7.16 of the
Disclosure Schedule, with effect from the Closing, none of the Majority
Holders or their Affiliates, Blocker, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall have any obligation or liability in respect of any such terminated
Contract or any loans, notes, advances, receivables and payables between the
Majority Holders or their Affiliates, on the one hand, and Blocker, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, except pursuant to
_Section 1.8(e)_.

  


 

  

Section 7.17 _Restructuring Transactions_. Prior to the Closing, Blocker,
Blocker Holdings and the Company shall consummate the Restructuring
Transactions in accordance with _Exhibit A_.

  


 

  

Section 7.18 _280G Cooperation_. In the event the Company determines that any
amount could be subject to the excise tax pursuant to Section 280G of the
Code, the Company may solicit a shareholder vote intended to satisfy the
requirements of Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code, such that no portion of the
payments could constitute a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(2) of the Code, and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate in providing
information on any Purchaser payments that, as of the date of the relevant
vote, Purchaser has determined to make and that may also be considered
"parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Code on account of the
Transactions.

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Equityholder Representative and
Purchaser;

  


 

  

(b) by either of the Equityholder Representative or Purchaser:

  


 

  

(i) if the Closing shall not have been consummated on or before August 2, 2017
(such date being the " _Outside Date_ "); provided that if, as of the Outside
Date, all of the conditions set forth in _Article_ _VIII_ have been satisfied
or waived (other than the conditions set forth in _Section_ _8.1(a)_ ,
_Section_ _8.1(b)_ , _Section_ _8.2(c)_ , _Section 8.3(d)_ and those
conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied by actions taken at or
immediately prior to the Closing or which have been waived in accordance with
this Agreement), then either the Equityholder Representative or Purchaser
shall have the right,

  


 

  

 

66  

  


 

  


 

  

in its sole discretion, to extend the Outside Date by written notice to the
other party to a date no later than October 3, 2017; provided, however, that
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(b)(i)_
shall not be available to a party if the failure of the Closing to have been
consummated on or before the Outside Date was primarily due to the failure of
such party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement; or

  

  

(ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in _Section 8.1(b)_ shall be
in effect and such Restraint shall have become final and non-appealable;
provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 9.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to a party if the issuance of such
final, non-appealable Restraint was primarily due to the failure of such party
to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement or if such party shall
have failed to comply with its obligations under _Section 7.5_.

  


 

  

(c) by Purchaser if the Company, Blocker or Blocker Holdings shall have
breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure
to perform (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in
_Section 8.2(a)_ or _Section 8.2(b)_ , respectively, and (B) cannot be cured
by the Outside Date or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured
within thirty (30) days following receipt of written notice from Purchaser
stating Purchaser\'s intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 9.1(c)_ and the basis for such termination; provided that Purchaser
shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
9.1(c)_ if it is then in breach of or has failed to perform its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements hereunder, which
breach or failure to perform would give rise to the failure of a condition set
forth in _Section 8.3(a)_ or _Section 8.3(b)_ and has not been cured; or

  


 

  

(d) by the Equityholder Representative if Purchaser or Merger Sub shall have
breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure
to perform (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in
_Section 8.3(a)_ or _Section 8.3(b)_ , respectively, and (B) cannot be cured
by Purchaser or Merger Sub by the Outside Date or, if capable of being cured,
shall not have been cured within thirty (30) days following receipt of written
notice from the Equityholder Representative stating the Equityholder
Representative\'s intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 9.1(d)_ and the basis for such termination; provided that the
Equityholder Representative shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(d)_ if it, Blocker Holdings, Blocker
or the Company is then in breach of or has failed to perform its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements hereunder, which
breach or failure to perform would give rise to the failure of a condition set
forth in _Section 8.2(a)_ or _Section 8.2(b)_ and has not been cured;
provided, further, that the failure to deliver the Closing Aggregate
Consideration and the other Closing payments pursuant to _Article I_ as
required hereunder shall not be subject to cure hereunder unless otherwise
agreed to in writing by the Equityholder Representative.

  


 

  

Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in _Section 9.1_ , written notice thereof shall be given
to the other party or parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to
which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null
and void (other than the indemnification and reimbursement provisions in
_Section 7.15(c)_ , this _Section 9.2_ , and _Article XII_ (other than
_Section_

  


 

  

 

67  

  


 

  


 

  

 _12.10_ except to the extent it relates to any provisions that are stated to
survive termination of this Agreement), all of which shall survive termination
of this Agreement), and there shall be no liability on the part of Purchaser,
Merger Sub, the Equityholders, the Company, Blocker or the Equityholder
Representative or their respective managers, directors, employees, officers or
Affiliates hereunder; provided, however, that no party shall be relieved or
released from any liabilities or damages arising out of intentional fraud with
respect to any Purchaser Representations, Company Representations, Blocker
Representations or Blocker Holdings Representations or any willful breach of
this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser\'s or Merger
Sub\'s willful breach of the obligation to close the Transactions in
circumstances in which all of the closing conditions set forth in _Section
8.1_ and _Section 8.2_ have been satisfied or waived). The Confidentiality
Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms.

  


 

  

ARTICLE X

  


 

  

 _INDEMNIFICATION_

  


 

  

Section 10.1 _Survival_. The Company Representations, Blocker Representations,
Blocker Holdings Representations (and Purchaser\'s right to seek
indemnification under this _Article X_ in respect thereof) and the Purchaser
Representations (and the Equityholder Representative\'s right to seek
indemnification under this _Article X_ in respect thereof) shall continue in
full force and effect until the date that is thirteen (13) months after the
Closing Date (the " _Survival End Date_ "). The covenants and agreements of
the parties contained in this Agreement that are required to be performed
prior to the Closing shall survive the Closing and continue in full force and
effect until the Survival End Date, and the covenants and agreements of the
parties contained in this Agreement that are required to be performed after
the Closing shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
respective terms. The Company Representations, Blocker Representations,
Blocker Holdings Representations, Purchaser Representations, the covenants and
agreements of the Equityholder Representative, the Company, Blocker, Blocker
Holdings, Purchaser and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement that are
required to be performed prior to the Closing and the indemnification
provisions set forth in this _Article X_ (other than such provisions relating
to indemnification for covenants and agreements of Purchaser and Merger Sub to
be performed after the Closing) shall in each case not survive beyond the
Survival End Date and there shall be no liability in respect thereof, whether
such liability has accrued prior to or after the Closing, on the part of any
party, except in the case of any written claim for indemnification under this
_Article X_ made with reasonable specificity prior to the Survival End Date,
and then such claim (subject to the limits set forth in this Agreement) will
survive until such claim is finally resolved.

  


 

  

Section 10.2 _Indemnity Escrow Amount as Exclusive Remedy_.

  


 

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Purchaser and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that (i) from and after the Closing, the rights provided
in this _Article X_ (but subject to the limitations set forth herein) and the
rights under _Section 12.10_ (but solely as applied to covenants and
agreements that by their terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in
part after the Closing and then only with respect to any breaches occurring
after the Closing) shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy for the
Purchaser Indemnified Persons with respect to any Damages suffered in
connection with or arising from any breach or failure to be true and

  


 

  

 

68  

  


 

  


 

  

correct, or alleged breach or failure to be true and correct, of any
representation or warranty or any covenant or agreement of the Company, the
Equityholder Representative, Blocker or Blocker Holdings contained in this
Agreement or in the officer\'s certificate delivered pursuant to _Section
8.2(e)_ and (ii) (A) the balance of the Indemnity Escrow Amount deposited with
the Escrow Agent pursuant to _Section 1.8(c)(ii)_ shall be the sole and
exclusive recourse for any and all payments that may become owing to the
Purchaser Indemnified Persons pursuant to this _Article X_ , and (B) no claim
by the Purchaser Indemnified Persons shall be asserted against, and the
Purchaser Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to indemnification from,
the Equityholder Representative, the Equityholders or any of their respective
Affiliates other than by recourse to the Indemnity Escrow Amount to the extent
of funds held in the Indemnity Escrow Account; provided that none of the
foregoing shall prejudice or limit any claim or remedy under _Section 12.10_ ,
for intentional fraud with respect to any Company Representations, Blocker
Representations or Blocker Holdings Representations or, with respect to the
Equityholder Representative, liability that the Equityholder Representative
may have to Purchaser under _Section 12.2(c)_. The disposition of the
Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be governed by the terms set forth herein and in
the Escrow Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, Purchaser and Merger
Sub hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any and
all other rights, claims and causes of action (including rights of
contributions, if any) known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist
or may arise in the future, that it may have against the Equityholder
Representative, the Equityholders or any of their respective Affiliates
arising under or based upon any federal, state or local Law with respect to
the Transactions or any Damages suffered in connection with or arising from
any breach or failure to be true and correct, or alleged breach or failure to
be true and correct, of any representation or warranty or any covenant or
agreement of the Company, the Equityholder Representative, Blocker or Blocker
Holdings contained in this Agreement or in the officer\'s certificate
delivered pursuant to _Section 8.2(e)_ or otherwise in connection with the
Transactions; provided that the foregoing shall not prejudice or limit any
claim or remedy under _Section 12.10_ , for intentional fraud with respect to
the Company Representations, Blocker Representations or Blocker Holdings
Representations or, with respect to the Equityholder Representative, in
respect of liability that the Equityholder Representative may have to
Purchaser under _Section 12.2(c)_. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall be construed to limit the Purchaser
Indemnified Persons\' rights under the Representation and Warranty Insurance
Policy or the parties\' rights under the Escrow Agreement.

  


 

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Equityholder
Representative acknowledges and agrees that from and after the Closing, the
rights provided in this _Article X_ (but subject to the limitations set forth
herein) and the rights under _Section 12.10_ (but solely as applied to
covenants and agreements that by their terms apply or are to be performed in
whole or in part after the Closing and then only with respect to any breaches
occurring after the Closing) shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy
for the Equityholder Indemnified Persons with respect to any Damages suffered
in connection with or arising from any breach or failure to be true and
correct, or alleged breach or failure to be true and correct, of any
representation or warranty or any covenant or agreement of Purchaser or Merger
Sub contained in this Agreement or in the officer\'s certificate delivered
pursuant to _Section 8.3(c)_ ; provided that none of the foregoing shall
prejudice or limit any claim or remedy for intentional fraud with respect to
any Purchaser Representation.

  

  

  

 

69  

  


 

  

Section 10.3 _Indemnification_. (a) Subject to the limitations set forth in
this _Article X_ , from and after the Closing, Purchaser and its Affiliates
and their respective Representatives (the " _Purchaser Indemnified Persons_ ")
shall be indemnified from the balance of the Indemnity Escrow Amount (to the
extent of available funds) from and against any and all losses, damages,
costs, charges, expenses (including reasonable attorneys\', accountants\' and
other professionals\' fees, disbursements and expenses), settlement payments,
awards, judgments, Taxes, fines or obligations (collectively, " _Damages_ ")
incurred or suffered by the Purchaser Indemnified Persons and arising out of
or resulting from (i) any breach or inaccuracy of any Company Representations,
Blocker Representations or Blocker Holdings Representations, as applicable,
(ii) (A) any breach of any covenant or agreement of the Equityholder
Representative, the Company, Blocker or Blocker Holdings, as applicable,
contained in this Agreement solely to the extent to be performed or complied
with prior to the Closing or (B) any breach of any covenant or agreement of
the Equityholder Representative contained in this Agreement to be performed or
complied with after the Closing, or (iii) any Taxes of Blocker or the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iv) any
claim by any Equityholder arising out of or relating to any action or failure
to act by the Equityholder Representative or the allocation of the Total
Consideration among the Equityholders or (v) if applicable, the payment of any
Shortfall Amount.

  


 

  

(b) From and after the Closing, subject to any applicable time period
limitations set forth in _Section 10.1_ and _Section 10.5_ , the Purchaser
Indemnified Persons shall have the right to seek indemnification for Damages
from the Indemnity Escrow Account in respect of the indemnification provisions
of _Section 10.3(a)_ in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section
10.5_.

  


 

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but
subject in each case to _Section 10.2_ , even if a Purchaser Indemnified
Person would otherwise be entitled to recover Damages pursuant to this
_Article X_ , the Purchaser Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to (1)
indemnification under _Section 10.3(a)(i)_ for: (i) any individual Damages or
series of related Damages arising out of substantially similar facts and
circumstances unless and until the aggregate amount of all such Damages under
such Section exceeds $50,000, in which case the Purchaser Indemnified Persons
shall, subject to the other terms and provisions of this _Section 10.3(c)_ ,
be entitled to indemnification for the full amount of such Damages; provided,
however, that this clause (i) shall not apply to any claim for indemnification
arising out of any breach or inaccuracy of any of the Fundamental
Representations or any of the Tax Representations and such claims shall not
count toward such threshold or (ii) any Damages unless and until the aggregate
amount of all such Damages under _Section 10.3(a)(i)_ exceeds $5,512,500, in
which case the Purchaser Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to
indemnification only to the extent the aggregate amount of all such Damages
exceeds such amount; provided, however, that this clause (ii) shall not apply
to any claim for indemnification arising out of any breach or inaccuracy of
any of the Fundamental Representations or any of the Tax Representations and
such claims shall not count toward such threshold; (2) indemnification under
_Section 10.3(a)_ for Damages in an aggregate amount exceeding the Indemnity
Escrow Amount; and (3) indemnification under _Section 10.3(a)_ for Damages
attributable to Taxes of Blocker, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (A)
for any taxable period (or portion thereof) that is not a Pre-Closing Tax
Period except to the extent such Taxes are attributable to a breach of
representations and warranties contained in _Section 3.10(a)(vii)_ or _Section
4.6(a)(vi)_ ; (B) related to the amount, sufficiency or usability of any net
operating loss, capital loss, Tax basis or other

  


 

  

 

70  

  


 

  


 

  

Tax asset; (C) as a result of any transaction occurring on the Closing Date
after the Closing or (D) as a result of changes in Tax law occurring after the
Closing Date that have a retroactive effect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or
portion thereof). The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of
the Company, Blocker or Blocker Holdings, as applicable, and any Purchaser
Indemnified Person\'s right to indemnification with respect thereto, shall not
be affected or deemed waived by reason of any investigation made by or on
behalf of any Purchaser Indemnified Person (including by any of its
Representatives) or by reason of the fact that any Purchaser Indemnified
Person or any of its Representatives knew or should have known that any such
representation or warranty is, was or might be inaccurate or by reason of the
Purchaser Indemnified Person\'s waiver of any condition set forth in _Article
VIII_ , as the case may be. Each Purchaser Indemnified Person will pay any
Taxes with respect to which such Purchaser Indemnified Person received
indemnification payments under this _Section 10.3_ to the relevant
Governmental Authority (or, in the case of any liability for the Taxes of a
third party, to such third party or the relevant Governmental Authority on
such third party\'s behalf), or otherwise reflect such Taxes or the underlying
items that would otherwise give rise to such Taxes on an applicable Tax
Return.

  


 

  

(d) Subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article X_ , from and after
the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify the Equityholders and their Affiliates
and their respective Representatives (the " _Equityholder Indemnified Persons_
") from and against any and all Damages incurred or suffered by the
Equityholder Indemnified Persons and arising out of or resulting from (i) any
breach or inaccuracy of any Purchaser Representations or (ii) any breach of
any covenant or agreement of Purchaser or Merger Sub contained in this
Agreement. From and after the Closing, subject to any applicable time period
limitations set forth in _Section 10.1_ and _Section 10.5_ , the Equityholder
Representative (on behalf of the Equityholder Indemnified Persons) shall have
the right to seek indemnification for Damages in respect of the
indemnification provisions of this _Section 10.3(d)_ in accordance with the
procedures set forth in _Section 10.5_.

  


 

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, even
if an Equityholder Indemnified Person would otherwise be entitled to recover
Damages pursuant to this _Article X_ , the Equityholder Indemnified Persons
shall not be entitled to (i) indemnification under _Section 10.3(d)(i)_ for
(A) any individual Damages or series of related Damages arising out of
substantially similar facts and circumstances unless and until the aggregate
amount of all such Damages under such Section exceeds $50,000, in which case
the Equityholder Indemnified Persons shall, subject to the other terms and
provisions of this _Section 10.3(e)_ , be entitled to indemnification for the
full amount of such Damages; provided, however, that this clause (A) shall not
apply to any claim for indemnification arising out of any breach or inaccuracy
of any of the Purchaser Fundamental Representations and such claims shall not
count toward such threshold or (B) any Damages unless and until the aggregate
amount of all such Damages under _Section 10.3(d)(i)_ exceeds $5,512,500, in
which case the Equityholder Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to
indemnification only to the extent the aggregate amount of all such Damages
exceeds such amount; provided, however, that this clause (B) shall not apply
to any claim for indemnification arising out of any breach or inaccuracy of
any of the Purchaser Fundamental Representations and such claims shall not
count toward such threshold or (ii) indemnification under _Section 10.3(d)_
for Damages in an aggregate amount exceeding the Indemnity Escrow Amount;
provided, however, that this clause (ii) shall not apply to any claim for
indemnification arising out of any covenants or agreements of Purchaser or
Merger Sub to be performed after the

  


 

  

 

71  

  


 

  


 

  

Closing and such claims shall not count toward such cap. The representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of Purchaser or Merger Sub, and any
Equityholder Indemnified Person\'s right to indemnification with respect
thereto, shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of any investigation
made by or on behalf of any Equityholder Indemnified Person (including by any
of its Representatives) or by reason of the fact that any Equityholder
Indemnified Person or any of its Representatives knew or should have known
that any such representation or warranty is, was or might be inaccurate or by
reason of the Equityholder Indemnified Person\'s waiver of any condition set
forth in _Article VIII_ , as the case may be.

  


 

  

Section 10.4 _Indemnity Escrow Period and Release_. The escrow period for the
Indemnity Escrow Account shall terminate on the Survival End Date. Promptly
thereafter the Escrow Agent shall release to the Equityholders in accordance
with _Section 1.11(b)_ the remaining funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with the wire
transfer instructions designated in writing by the Equityholder Representative
to the Escrow Agent; provided, however, that any funds in the Indemnity Escrow
Account as of the Survival End Date necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied or
unresolved claims for Damages specified in any Claim Notice delivered to the
Equityholder Representative and the Escrow Agent in accordance with _Section
10.5(a)_ and the Escrow Agreement prior to the Survival End Date shall remain
in the Indemnity Escrow Account until such claims have been finally resolved
pursuant to _Section 10.6_.

  


 

  

Section 10.5 _Indemnification Procedures_.

  


 

  

(a) Any Indemnified Person seeking indemnification or reimbursement pursuant
to this _Article X_ shall promptly provide to the Equityholder Representative
and the Escrow Agent (if such Person is a Purchaser Indemnified Person) or to
Purchaser (if such Person is an Equityholder Indemnified Person) (i) a written
notice of any claims that it may have pursuant to this _Article X_ (a " _Claim
Notice_ ") and (ii) in the event that there be asserted against any
Indemnified Person any written claim or demand by a third-party for which such
Indemnified Person may be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
_Article X_ (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), a Claim Notice with respect thereto
within fifteen (15) days following such Indemnified Person\'s receipt of such
claim (and no fewer than ten (10) days prior to a scheduled appearance date in
a litigated matter); provided, however, that any failure by such Indemnified
Person to give such notice will not relieve any indemnification obligations
hereunder unless and only to the extent the Equityholder Representative or
Purchaser, as applicable, is prejudiced by such failure. Each Claim Notice
shall contain the amount or a good faith estimate of the potential Damages
(the " _Damage Estimate_ ") against which such Indemnified Person seeks
indemnification, to the extent then ascertainable, and a statement that such
Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Article X_
with respect to such potential Damages and a reasonable explanation of the
basis therefor. If the applicable Indemnifying Party Representative does not
notify the Indemnified Person within thirty (30) calendar days following its
receipt of a Claim Notice (other than a Third-Party Claim Notice) that the
Indemnifying Party Representative disputes such claim or lacks information to
evaluate such claim, such claim shall be conclusively deemed a liability for
which the Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification under _Section
10.3_ and the amount of such claim shall be paid to the Indemnified Person (in
the case of a Purchaser Indemnified Person, solely from the Indemnity Escrow
Account, to the extent of the funds on deposit therein), on demand, solely
with respect to Damages actually suffered or incurred prior to

  


 

  

 

72  

  


 

  


 

  

delivery of the Claim Notice and described in reasonable detail (including the
amounts of such Damages) in the Claim Notice (for the avoidance of doubt,
disregarding any Damage Estimates or unknown amounts of Damages in the Claim
Notice).

  


 

  

(b) With respect to each Third-Party Claim that is the subject of a Claim
Notice, and except with respect to a Third-Party Claim governed by _Section
11.4_ , the Indemnifying Party Representative shall be entitled, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law and subject to the limitations set forth in
_Section 10.5(c)_ , to assume and control the defense of such Third-Party
Claim, at its own expense, with counsel approved by the applicable Indemnified
Person (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned)
by notice to such Indemnified Person; provided that the Equityholder
Representative shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Third-Party
Claim if an insurer under the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy is
required to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim pursuant to the
Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy (so long as the Equityholder
Representative has consented to any provisions of or amendments to such policy
that relate to such assumption) (it being understood that the Equityholder
Representative has consented to the provisions of the Representation and
Warranty Insurance Policy as in effect on the date hereof); provided, further,
that the Indemnifying Party Representative shall not be entitled to assume the
defense of any Third-Party Claim (1) if the Third-Party Claim seeks an order,
injunction or other equitable relief or relief for other than money damages
against the Indemnified Person except where such equitable relief or other
relief is immaterial and incidental to claims for monetary damages or (2) if
the Third-Party Claim would reasonably be expected to result in indemnifiable
Damages to the Indemnified Person (not taking into account the limitations on
indemnification set forth in this _Article X_ ) in excess of (i) in the case
of any Purchaser Indemnified Person, an amount equal to two (2) times the then
available amount in the Indemnity Escrow Account (less any Damages reasonably
expected to result from then unresolved Claim Notices which were delivered to
the Equityholder Representative prior to the Claim Notice for such Third-Party
Claim) or (ii) in the case of any Equityholder Indemnified Person, an amount
equal to two (2) times the then remaining and unsatisfied applicable cap on
Purchaser\'s indemnification obligations under _Section 10.3(e)_ (less any
Damages reasonably expected to result from then unresolved Claim Notices which
were delivered to Purchaser prior to the Claim Notice for such Third-Party
Claim). The Indemnifying Party Representative may settle, compromise or offer
to settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim that it has elected to assume
the defense of but shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Person (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise
any Third-Party Claim on a basis that would result in or would reasonably be
expected to result in (A) the imposition of a consent order, injunction or
decree that would restrict the future activity or conduct of the applicable
Indemnified Person or any of its Affiliates, (B) any non-monetary condition or
obligation being imposed on the applicable Indemnified Person or any of its
Affiliates, (C) any material adverse effect on the business of the applicable
Indemnified Person or any of its Affiliates, (D) any admission of fault or
liability by any applicable Indemnified Person or any of its Affiliates, (E)
an obligation of the Indemnified Person to pay any amount that, together with
all other Damage Estimates pursuant to then unresolved Claim Notices, would
exceed the amount then in the Indemnity Escrow Account and available and
entitled to be used for the payment of Damages under this _Article X_ or the
then remaining and unsatisfied applicable cap on Purchaser\'s indemnification
obligations under _Section 10.3(e)_ , as applicable, or (F) in the case of a
Purchaser Indemnified Person, loss of coverage under the Representation and
Warranty

  


 

  

 

73  

  


 

  


 

  

Insurance Policy (so long as the Equityholder Representative has consented to
any provisions of or amendments to such policy that relate to settlements).

  


 

  

(c) In the event that the Indemnifying Party Representative notifies such
Indemnified Person that it desires to defend against a Third-Party Claim, such
Indemnified Person shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
participate in any such defense and employ separate counsel of its choosing.
Such Indemnified Person shall participate in any such defense at its own
expense unless in the reasonable opinion of outside counsel to such
Indemnified Person, (i) a conflict or potential conflict (other than by virtue
of delivery of a Claim Notice) exists or (ii) one or more defenses are
available to such Indemnified Person that are not available to the
Equityholder Representative or Purchaser, as applicable, that, in each case,
would make such separate representation advisable, in which case the
reasonable attorneys\' fees, disbursements and expenses of such separate
representation shall be indemnifiable Damages (it being understood that in
such event, the balance of the Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be the sole and
exclusive recourse for any such reimbursement of such separate counsel of such
Purchaser Indemnified Person for all Third-Party Claims); provided, however,
that no Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to reimbursement for more than
one such counsel (plus any appropriate local counsel) in connection with any
Third-Party Claim.

  


 

  

(d) In the event that the Indemnifying Party Representative has elected not to
control the defense of a Third-Party Claim or does not have a right to control
the defense of a Third-Party Claim, (i) in the case of indemnification in
favor of the Purchaser Indemnified Persons, no portion of the Indemnity Escrow
Account may be claimed with respect to, and (ii) in the case of
indemnification in favor of the Equityholder Indemnified Parties, Purchaser
shall have no liability for, a Third-Party Claim settled or compromised
without the Indemnifying Party Representative\'s consent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Subject to the
foregoing, for so long as the Indemnifying Party Representative has failed to
assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Person will have
the right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such Third-
Party Claim, in which case the reasonable attorneys\' fees, disbursements and
expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Person for any period during
which the Indemnifying Party Representative has not assumed the defense
thereof (other than during any period in which the Indemnified Person shall
have failed to give notice of the claim as provided above) may be
indemnifiable Damages if provided for in this _Article X_ (it being understood
that in such event, the balance of the Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be the
sole and exclusive recourse for any such reimbursement of such separate
counsel of a Purchaser Indemnified Person for all Third-Party Claims);
provided, however, that the Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to
reimbursement for more than one such counsel (plus any appropriate local
counsel) in connection with any Third-Party Claim.

  


 

  

(e) Purchaser, the Equityholder Representative and the Indemnified Persons
shall cooperate in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of a Third-
Party Claim, including by providing access to each other\'s relevant business
records and other documents and employees. Purchaser, the Equityholder
Representative and the Indemnified Persons shall keep each other reasonably
informed with respect to the status of such Third-Party Claim as either may
request from time to time.

(f) Any action to be taken under this _Article X_ by any Indemnified Person
may be taken by such Person\'s Indemnifying Party Representative on its
behalf. The applicable Indemnifying Party Representative shall have the right
to enforce this _Article X_ on behalf of any Purchaser Indemnified Person or
Equityholder Indemnified Person, as applicable.

  


 

  

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 10.5_ shall not apply to Tax
Contests, which shall be governed by _Section 11.4_ , or Tax disputes, which
shall be governed by _Section 11.5_.

  


 

  

Section 10.6 _Final Resolution_. A Claim Notice, any amounts claimed therein
and any other matters set forth therein shall be deemed to be "finally
resolved" for purposes of this _Article X_ when (i) such Claim Notice, amounts
and matters have been resolved by a written agreement executed by Purchaser
and the Equityholder Representative or (ii) such Claim Notice, amounts and
matters have been resolved by a final, nonappealable order, decision or ruling
of a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator with respect to such matter
in dispute, or portion thereof.

  


 

  

Section 10.7 _Calculation of Damages_.

  


 

  

(a) The amount of any Damages for which indemnification is provided under this
_Article X_ shall be calculated net of (i) any net Tax Benefit actually
realized by the Indemnified Person on account of such Damages in the taxable
year in which such Damages arise and (ii) any amounts recovered by the
Indemnified Person under any insurance policies (but in the case of
intentional fraud with respect to any Company Representations, Blocker
Representations or Blocker Holdings Representations, other than the
Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy) and any amounts recovered
pursuant to any indemnification right, claim, recovery, settlement,
reimbursement arrangement, contract or payment by or against a third party
(including any acquisition agreements of the Company and its Subsidiaries)
(collectively, " _Alternative Arrangements_ "), in each case relating to such
Damages, net of the costs and expenses incurred in seeking such collection;
provided that the amount deemed to be recovered under insurance policies will
also be net of the deductible for such policies and any increase in the
premium (and retro-premium adjustments) for such policies to the extent
arising out of or in connection with such Damages. If an indemnification
payment is received by any Indemnified Person, and such Indemnified Person
later recognizes Tax Benefits described in clause (i) above in respect of the
related Damages that were not previously accounted for with respect to such
indemnification payment when made, such Indemnified Person shall promptly
notify the Indemnifying Party Representative and, no later than ten (10)
Business Days after delivery of such notice by the Indemnified Person, pay to
the Indemnifying Party Representative an amount equal to the lesser of (A) any
such Tax Benefits not previously accounted for and (B) the actual amount of
the indemnification payments previously paid with respect to such Damages.
Subject to _Section 10.10_ , the Indemnified Persons shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to seek recovery under Alternative Arrangements covering
any Damage to the same extent as they would if such Damage were not subject to
indemnification hereunder. In the event that an insurance or other recovery is
made by any Indemnified Persons with respect to any Damage for which any such
Person has been indemnified hereunder (other than the Representation and
Warranty Insurance Policy), then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the
recovery shall be made promptly to the Equityholder Representative, on behalf
of the Equityholders, or Purchaser, as

  


 

  

 

75  

  


 

  


 

  

applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article X_ , the
parties agree that no amount shall be due under this _Article X_ to the extent
that it duplicates another amount already paid or accounted for under this
_Article X_ or in the calculation of the Final Indebtedness Amount, Final Net
Working Capital Amount, Final Transaction Expenses or amounts that would
otherwise be included the Cash Amount but were excluded as a result of the
limitation contained therein relating to customer deposits.

  


 

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article X_ , no
Indemnified Person shall be entitled to indemnification under this _Article X_
for any consequential, incidental, special (including loss of revenue, income
or profits or a multiple thereof or similar valuation) or punitive damages,
except to the extent awarded to a third party by a court of competent
jurisdiction in connection with a Third-Party Claim. For purposes of this
_Article X_ , each Company Representation, Blocker Representation, Blocker
Holdings Representation or Purchaser Representation (other than with respect
to _Section 3.6_ , clause (ii) of _Section 3.7(a)_ , _Section 3.7(b)_ (in
relation to _Section 7.1(a)(iv), (xvi) or (xviii)_ ), _Section 3.15(a),_ the
use of the defined term "Material Contract(s)" and in any instances in which
materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect qualify any lists of Contracts,
Company Plans, Company Permits or other items to be set forth on the
Disclosure Schedule (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not including instances
in which materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect qualify any
representations or warranties as to the delivery of copies of Contracts,
Company Plans, Company Permits or other items)) shall be read without regard
and without giving effect to any qualifier as to materiality, "Company
Material Adverse Effect" or similar qualification of similar import using a
derivative of the word "material" contained in such representation (as if such
qualification were deleted from such representation), both for purposes of
determining the existence of any inaccuracy in or breach of such
representation, as well as the amount of any Damages.

  


 

  

Section 10.8 _Mitigation_. Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder
shall take reasonable steps to mitigate such Person\'s Damages after becoming
aware of any event which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any
Damages that are indemnifiable or recoverable hereunder or in connection
herewith. Each of Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause each other Purchaser Indemnified Person or
Equityholder Indemnified Person, respectively, to comply with this _Section
10.8_.

  


 

  

Section 10.9 _Tax Treatment_. The parties agree that any amount paid under
this _Article X_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the Final Closing
Aggregate Consideration for Tax purposes and, except to the extent required by
applicable Law, not to take any position inconsistent with such treatment on
any Tax Return.

  


 

  

Section 10.10 _Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy_. The parties
acknowledge that Purchaser is entering into the Representation and Warranty
Insurance Policy and that, in connection therewith, a Purchaser Indemnified
Person may make claims for the same Damages or series of related Damages under
both this _Article X_ and the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy.
The parties further acknowledge and agree that the denial of any claim of any
Purchaser Indemnified Person by an insurer under the Representation and
Warranty Insurance Policy shall not be construed as, or used as evidence that,
such Purchaser Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification under
this _Article X_.

 _CERTAIN TAX MATTERS_

  


 

  

Section 11.1 _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_. The Equityholder
Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all income and franchise Tax Returns (including Schedules K-1), for the
Company and its Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods (other than
Straddle Periods) and Purchaser shall cooperate, to the extent required, in
filing such income Tax Returns. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared
reasonably consistent with the past practice of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, unless otherwise required by applicable Law. At least ten (10)
days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Returns, the Equityholder
Representative shall deliver drafts to Purchaser of any such Tax Returns, and
the Equityholder Representative shall cause such Tax Returns to reflect any
reasonable comments of Purchaser. The Equityholder Representative shall cause
the Company to make an election under Code Section 754 (and any corresponding
state Tax election) in connection with the income Tax Return of the Company
for the Tax period ending on the Closing Date. To the maximum extent permitted
by applicable Law, all Transaction Tax Deductions shall be claimed on the
federal and state income Tax Returns of the Company (or, as applicable, its
Subsidiaries or Blocker) for the Pre-Closing Tax Period ending on the Closing
Date, for which purpose the Equityholder Representative shall be permitted to
cause the Company to make the election for success-based fees set forth in IRS
Revenue Procedure 2011-29. Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and
timely file or cause to be timely filed all other Tax Returns for Blocker, the
Company and its Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods and Straddle
Periods that are due after the Closing Date. All such Tax Returns shall be
prepared reasonably consistent with the past practice of Blocker, the Company
and its Subsidiaries, as applicable. At least ten (10) days prior to the due
date for filing such Tax Returns, Purchaser shall deliver drafts to the
Equityholder Representative of any such Tax Returns showing amounts for which
Equityholders or their beneficial owners could be liable under this Agreement.
Purchaser shall cause such Tax Returns to reflect any reasonable comments of
the Equityholder Representative to the extent such comments relate to amounts
for which Equityholders or their beneficial owners could be liable under this
Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 11.2 _Filing and Amendment of Tax Returns_. Except to the extent
required under applicable Law, without the prior written consent of the
Equityholder Representative, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause Blocker, the
Company and its Subsidiaries to not: (i) except as set forth in _Section
11.1(a)_ , file or amend any Tax Return relating to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period, (ii) engage in any voluntary disclosure or similar process or initiate
communications with any Tax authority with respect to Taxes attributable to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period, (iii) extend or waive, or cause to
be extended or waived, or permit Blocker, the Company or its Subsidiaries to
extend or waive, any statute of limitations or other period for the assessment
of any Tax or deficiency related to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iv) make or
change any Tax election or accounting method that has retroactive effect to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period of Blocker, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(including any election under Section 338 or 336 of the Code or any
corresponding provision of state, local or foreign Tax Laws) or (v) otherwise
take any action directly with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period that could
result in Equityholders (or their direct or indirect owners) being liable for
any Taxes, including under this Agreement or to any taxing authority. The
Company shall not, and none of Purchaser, the Equityholder Representative or
Blocker shall cause the Company to, electively apply the U.S.

federal income tax partnership audit provisions enacted pursuant to the
Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015.

  


 

  

Section 11.3 _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use,
registration and real property transfer or gains tax, stamp tax, excise tax,
stock transfer tax and other similar Taxes with respect to the Transactions
(collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by
Purchaser and fifty percent (50%) by Equityholder Representative (solely from
the Indemnity Escrow Account) on behalf of the Equityholders. All Tax Returns
with respect to Transfer Taxes shall be filed by the party required to file
the Tax Return under applicable Law, and Purchaser and the Equityholder
Representative, as applicable, shall reimburse the filing party for any
Transfer Taxes that are borne by Purchaser or the Equityholders, respectively,
pursuant to this _Section 11.3_. Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative
shall cooperate in timely making all filings, returns, reports and forms as
necessary or appropriate to comply with the provisions of all applicable Laws
in connection with the payment of such Transfer Taxes and shall cooperate in
good faith to minimize the amount of any such Transfer Taxes payable in
connection herewith.

  


 

  

Section 11.4 _Tax Contests_. After the Closing, Purchaser shall promptly
notify the Equityholder Representative, and in any event within fifteen (15)
days after receipt by Purchaser, Blocker, the Company or its Subsidiaries or
any Affiliate thereof of written notice of any pending federal, state, local
or foreign Tax audit or examination or notice of deficiency or other
adjustment, assessment, or redetermination (each a " _Tax Contest_ ") relating
to (i) Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period
or (ii) Taxes of Blocker for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, in each case for which
Equityholders (or their direct or indirect owners) could be liable ("
_Equityholder Tax Contest_ "). The Equityholder Representative shall have the
right, at its election, to control, at its own expense, any Equityholder Tax
Contest, including any disposition of such Equityholder Tax Contest; provided,
however, that (i) Purchaser shall have the right, at its own expense, directly
or through its designated representatives, to participate fully in such
Equityholder Tax Contest, including to review in advance and reasonably
comment upon submissions made in the course of such Equityholder Tax Contest
and to attend any in-person or telephonic meetings, and (ii) Purchaser\'s
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) shall be
required for any settlement by the Equityholder Representative except any
settlement that relates only to a Tax liability that is solely the liability
of the Equityholders and would not be borne by Purchaser or its Affiliates (as
evidenced by a written confirmation to that effect from the Equityholder
Representative). With respect to all Equityholder Tax Contests that the
Equityholder Representative does not elect to control pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence, Purchaser shall have the sole responsibility
for, and shall control, at its own expense, such Equityholder Tax Contest,
including the disposition thereof; provided, however, that (i) the
Equityholder Representative shall have the right to participate fully in such
Equityholder Tax Contest at its own expense, including to review in advance
and reasonably comment upon submissions made in the course of such Tax Contest
and to attend any in-person or telephonic meetings, (ii) Purchaser shall
diligently pursue such Tax Contest in good faith as if it were the sole party
in interest (provided that failure to do so will not give rise to any
liability of any Purchaser Indemnified Person to the Equityholders or the
Equityholder Representative) and (iii) the Equityholder Representative\'s
consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or denied)
shall be required for any settlement that could affect the liability of the
Equityholders or their direct or indirect owners. Purchaser shall have the
sole right to control any Tax Contest

  


 

  

 

78  

  


 

  


 

  

relating to Blocker or the Company or its Subsidiaries that is not an
Equityholder Tax Contest. This _Section 11.4_ shall apply to Tax Contests
notwithstanding _Section 10.5_.

  


 

  

Section 11.5 _Tax Dispute Resolution_. In the event of any disagreement as to
any Tax matter covered in this Agreement, Purchaser and the Equityholder
Representative shall negotiate in good faith for a period of thirty (30) days
to resolve such dispute. In the event any such disagreement cannot be resolved
between Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative, such disagreement shall
be resolved by an accounting firm of international reputation mutually
agreeable to, and retained by, Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative
(the " _Tax Accountant_ "), and any such determination by the Tax Accountant
shall be final. The fees and expenses of the Tax Accountant shall be borne by
Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative in inverse proportion as they
may prevail on the disputed items resolved by the Tax Accountant. Such
proportional allocations shall be determined by the Tax Accountant at the time
its determination is rendered on the disputed items. If the Tax Accountant
does not resolve any differences between Purchaser and the Equityholder
Representative with respect to a Tax Return at least five (5) days prior to
the due date therefor, such Tax Return shall be filed in a manner consistent
with the position of the party responsible for filing such Tax Return pursuant
to _Section 11.2_ and, to the extent necessary and permitted under applicable
Law, amended to reflect the Tax Accountant\'s resolution. This _Section 11.5_
shall apply to Tax disputes notwithstanding _Section 10.5_.

  


 

  

Section 11.6 _Cooperation_. Following the Closing, each of Purchaser, Blocker
and the Company and its Subsidiaries agree that it shall cooperate with and
make available to the other parties hereto, during normal business hours, all
books and records, information and employees (without substantial disruption
of employment) retained and remaining in existence after the Closing that are
necessary or useful in connection with the preparation of any Tax Returns and
any Tax Contest, including the computation and verification of any amounts
paid or payable under this _Article XI_ (including any supporting workpapers,
schedules and documents). The party requesting any such books, records,
information or employees shall bear all out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including attorneys\' fees, but excluding reimbursement for salaries and
employee benefits) reasonably incurred in connection with providing such
books, records, information or employees. Following the Closing, Purchaser
shall cause the Company, Blocker and the Company\'s Subsidiaries to retain all
applicable Tax Returns, books and records, and workpapers for Pre-Closing Tax
Periods for a period of at least seven (7) years following the Closing Date.
After the Closing, the Equityholder Representative, Purchaser and the Company
and their Affiliates will use reasonable best efforts to (i) complete all
final income Tax Returns (including Schedules K-1) of the Company for Tax
periods ending on the Closing Date by February 15, 2018 and (ii) provide the
Equityholder Representative with any information or estimates reasonably
required by it or its Affiliates for tax reporting purposes promptly upon
request by the Equityholder Representative.

  


 

  

Section 11.7 _Purchase Price Allocation_. The portion of the Total
Consideration paid with respect to Units, other than Units held by Blocker
(plus any assumed liabilities and other items required to be taken into
account for such purpose) shall be allocated among the assets of the Company
(and, as applicable, any Subsidiaries treated as flow-through entities for
income Tax purposes) in accordance with the principles of Sections 743, 751,
755 and 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder pursuant to a
written allocation delivered by the Equityholder

  


 

  

 

79  

  


 

  


 

  

Representative to Purchaser within one-hundred and twenty (120) days of the
Closing Date (the " _Allocation_ "). Within sixty (60) days of the Closing
Date, the Equityholder Representative shall deliver to Purchaser a draft of
the Allocation (the " _Draft Allocation_ ") together with supporting
documentation, reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, to allow Purchaser to
review and comment on the Draft Allocation. Purchaser shall review the Draft
Allocation and provide the Equityholder Representative with comments within
forty (40) days of the date that Purchaser received the Draft Allocation. The
Equityholder Representative shall consider in good faith all of Purchaser\'s
comments to the Draft Allocation. The Allocation will not be final without the
mutual consent of Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative, which shall
not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed by either party (the
Allocation as finalized, the " _Final Allocation_ "). If the Allocation is not
finalized within one-hundred and twenty (120) days of the Closing Date, then
Purchaser and the Equityholder Representative shall finalize the Allocation
pursuant to the procedures set forth in _Section 11.5_. Except to the extent
otherwise required by applicable Law, Purchaser and the Company shall file or
cause to be filed all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the Final
Allocation and shall not make any inconsistent statement or adjustment on any
Tax Return or during the course of any Tax-related matter, or otherwise take
any Tax position inconsistent with the Final Allocation unless otherwise
required by law. If the Total Consideration is adjusted pursuant to this
Agreement, the Final Allocation shall be adjusted as appropriate and Purchaser
and the Equityholder Representative shall cooperate in good faith in making
any such adjustments.

of Blocker, the Company and its Subsidiaries, or the quality, quantity or
condition of Blocker\'s, the Company\'s or its Subsidiaries\' assets) are
specifically disclaimed by the Equityholders, Blocker, the Company and its
Subsidiaries and all other Persons (including the Representatives of Blocker,
the Company or its Subsidiaries and the Equityholders and their Affiliates and
their respective Representatives) and (f) such disavowal and disclaimer is
agreed by Purchaser and Merger Sub and Purchaser and Merger Sub agree that
they and their Affiliates are not relying on any representations and

80  

  


 

  


 

  

Transactions except the Company Representations by the Company, the Blocker
Representations by Blocker and the Blocker Holdings Representations by Blocker
Holdings. In connection with Purchaser\'s and Merger Sub\'s investigation of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, Purchaser and Merger Sub have received
certain projections, including projected statements of operating revenues and
income from operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and certain
business plan information. Purchaser and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that
there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such projections and
other forecasts and plans, that Purchaser and Merger Sub are familiar with
such uncertainties and that Purchaser is taking full responsibility for making
its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all projections and other
forecasts and plans so furnished to it, including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such projections and forecasts. Without limiting the
foregoing provisions of this paragraph, Purchaser and Merger Sub hereby
acknowledge that, other than the express representations and warranties set
forth in this Agreement or in the officer\'s certificate delivered pursuant to
_Section 8.2(e)_ , none of the Equityholders, Blocker, the Company or its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective current or former Affiliates or
Representatives is making any representation or warranty with respect to such
projections and other forecasts and plans, including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such projections and forecasts, and that Purchaser and
Merger Sub have not relied on any such projections or other forecasts or

(i) none of the Equityholders, Blocker, the Company, its Subsidiaries or any
other Person shall have or be subject to any liability to Purchaser, Merger
Sub, Blocker, the Company or any other Person resulting from the distribution
to Purchaser or Merger Sub of, or Purchaser\'s or Merger Sub\'s use of, any
such projections or forecasts or any other information, document or material
provided to or made available to Purchaser or Merger Sub or their Affiliates
or Representatives in certain "data rooms," management presentations or in any
other form in expectation of the Transactions and (ii) Purchaser and Merger

remedy for intentional fraud with respect to any Company Representations,

Escrow Account pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 2.3_ , (B) against
the Indemnity Escrow Account pursuant to and in accordance with _Article X_ or
(C) pursuant to _Section 12.10_ , Purchaser waives, on its own behalf and on
behalf of its respective Affiliates, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action it may have
against the Equityholders, Blocker, the Company, its Subsidiaries and any of
their respective current or former Affiliates or Representatives relating to
the operation of Blocker, the Company and its Subsidiaries or their respective
businesses or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, the Disclosure
Schedule or the Transactions, whether arising under or based upon any federal,
state, local or foreign statute, Law, ordinance, rule or regulation or
otherwise; provided that the foregoing shall not prejudice or limit any claim
or remedy for intentional fraud with respect to the Company Representations,
Blocker Representations or Blocker Holdings Representations. The Equityholder
Representative shall have the right to enforce this _Section 12.1_ on behalf
of any Person that would be benefitted or protected by this _Section 12.1_ if
they were a party hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything herein to
the contrary, with respect to the obligations of Blocker, Blocker Holdings and
the Company set forth in _Section 7.14_ , (i) such obligations shall not be
used as a basis for any claim of any breach by the

  


 

  

 

81  

  


 

  


 

  

Equityholders, Blocker or the Company, (ii) any breach of such obligations
shall not be deemed a breach of this Agreement or the obligations hereunder

rights (and the Equityholders, Blocker and the Company shall have no
liability) in connection with such obligations.

pursuant to the designation made pursuant to Section 7 of the Securityholders
Agreement, the Equityholders have and hereby do irrevocably constitute and
appoint the Equityholder Representative as the representative, agent, proxy,
and attorney-in-fact for each of the Equityholders for all purposes authorized
under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, including the full power and
authority on the Equityholders\' behalf (i) to consummate the Transactions;

(whether incurred on or after the date hereof), including by using funds from

Units and execute such further instruments of assignment as Purchaser may
reasonably request; (viii) to negotiate, execute and deliver on behalf of such

agreements contemplated hereby (including the Escrow Agreement), (B) to
negotiate and compromise, on behalf of such Equityholder, any dispute that may

82  

  


 

  


 

  

Agreement; and (xiv) to take any and all other actions and do any and all
other things provided in or contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary
Document to be performed by the Equityholder Representative on behalf of any
Equityholder, and each Equityholder has and hereby does expressly authorize
the Equityholder Representative to do any and all of the foregoing. Each of
the Equityholders agrees that such agency and proxy are coupled with an
interest, are therefore irrevocable and shall survive the death, incapacity,
bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of any Equityholder. All decisions and
actions by the Equityholder Representative (to the extent authorized by this
Agreement) shall be binding upon all of the Equityholders, and no Equityholder
shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the
same. The Equityholder Representative shall have the right to enforce this
Agreement and obtain remedies in respect thereof on behalf of any Equityholder
to the same extent as if such Equityholder was a party to this Agreement.

  


 

  

(c) _Authority; Indemnification_. Each Equityholder agrees that Purchaser and
the Company shall be entitled to rely on any action taken by the Equityholder
Representative, on behalf of such Equityholder, pursuant to _Section 12.2(b)_
above (an " _Authorized Action_ "), and that each Authorized Action shall be
binding on each Equityholder as fully as if such Equityholder had taken such
Authorized Action. Purchaser agrees that the Equityholder Representative (in
its capacity as such) shall have no liability to Purchaser or the Company for
any Authorized Action, except to the extent that such Authorized Action is
found by a final, non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction to
have constituted fraud or willful misconduct by the Equityholder
Representative. Each Equityholder (pro rata based on each Equityholder\'s
Residual Percentage) hereby severally, for itself only and not jointly and
severally, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Equityholder
Representative against all fees, costs, expenses (including reasonable
attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually
and reasonably incurred by the Equityholder Representative in connection with
any action, suit or proceeding to which the Equityholder Representative is
made a party by reason of the fact it is or was acting as the Equityholder
Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

  


 

  

(d) _Exculpation_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
Equityholder Representative shall not have any obligation or liability under
this Agreement except for its express obligations under this Agreement. The
Equityholder Representative shall not have by reason of this Agreement a
fiduciary relationship in respect of any Equityholder, except in respect of
amounts received on behalf of such Equityholder. The Equityholder
Representative shall not be liable to any Equityholder for any action taken or
omitted by it or any agent employed by it hereunder or under any other
document entered into in connection herewith, except that the Equityholder
Representative shall not be relieved of any liability imposed by applicable
Law for willful misconduct. The Equityholder Representative shall not be
liable to the Equityholders for any apportionment or distribution of payments
made by the Equityholder Representative in good faith, and if any such
apportionment or distribution is subsequently determined to have been made in
error the sole recourse of any Equityholder to whom payment was due, but not
made, shall be to recover from other Equityholders any payment in excess of
the amount to which they are determined to have been entitled. The
Equityholder Representative shall not be required to make any inquiry
concerning either the performance or observance of any of the terms,
provisions or conditions of this Agreement. Neither the Equityholder
Representative nor any agent employed by it shall incur any liability to any
Equityholder by virtue of the failure or refusal of the Equityholder
Representative for any reason to consummate the Transactions or relating to
the

  


 

  

 

83  

  


 

  


 

  

performance of its other duties hereunder, except for actions or omissions
constituting fraud or willful misconduct.

  


 

  

(e) _Expenses_. From time to time, the Equityholder Representative may obtain
reimbursement from the Equityholders and the Equityholder Representative
Holdback Amount for any outstanding expenses or obligations of the
Equityholders or the Equityholder Representative for which it is due
reimbursement under this Agreement and for which it has not been reimbursed
prior to such time and may distribute any or all of the remaining portion of
the Equityholder Representative Holdback Amount to the Equityholders in
accordance with _Section 1.11(b)_ , it being understood that such
reimbursement shall be the responsibility of the Equityholders only and
neither Purchaser nor Merger Sub, nor after the Closing the Surviving Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, shall have any obligation to ensure that such
distribution is, or distributions are, made. The Equityholder Representative
may, however, require Purchaser or Escrow Agent, as the case may be, when
making any payments to the Equityholders, to direct to the Equityholder
Representative sufficient funds from such payments to the Equityholders to pay
the amount of any expenses or obligations previously paid by the Equityholder
Representative on behalf of the Equityholders for which it is due
reimbursement under this Agreement and for which it has not been reimbursed
prior to such time. Such payment to the Equityholder Representative shall be
deducted from the funds otherwise being directed to the Equityholders and
allocated among the Equityholders in accordance with _Section 1.11(b)_.

  


 

  

Section 12.3 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, whether or not the Restructuring Transactions or the Transactions are
consummated, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
Transactions and this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring or
required to incur such fees or expenses; provided that with respect to any
Shared Expenses, in the event that the Transactions are not consummated, to
the extent any party actually pays any such fees and expenses in excess of the
share thereof that such party would have been required to bear if the
Transactions had been consummated, such party shall be entitled to
reimbursement from the other party (it being understood that the Equityholder
Representative, the Company, Blocker Holdings and Blocker shall be deemed the
same party for purposes of this proviso).

  


 

  

Section 12.4 _Amendment or Supplement_. At any time prior to the Closing, this
Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects, whether
before or after receipt of the Required Approval, by written agreement of the
parties hereto and delivered by duly authorized officers of the respective
parties; provided, however, that following the Required Approval, there shall
be no amendment or change to the provisions hereof which by Law would require
further approval by the Required Interest without such approval; provided,
further, that the provisions set forth in this _Section 12.4_ and _Sections
12.8_, _12.9(d)_ , _12.11_ and _12.19_ in each case may not be amended or
supplemented in a manner that is adverse in any material respect to the Debt
Financing Source Related Parties without the prior written consent of such
Debt Financing Source Related Parties.

  


 

  

Section 12.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the earlier of the Closing or the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, any party may (on
its own behalf only), subject to applicable Law (to the extent such party is
the beneficiary of the applicable representation, warranty, obligation, act,
agreement or condition which is set forth in the following

exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement
on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

  


 

  

Section 12.6 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any
purported assignment not permitted under this _Section 12.6_ shall be null and
void.

  


 

  

Section 12.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts
(each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement) and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered (by electronic communication, facsimile or otherwise) to
the other parties.

  


 

  

Section 12.8 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,
including the Disclosure Schedule and the exhibits hereto, together with the
other instruments referred to herein, including the Confidentiality Agreement,

Consideration at and following the Closing, (ii) the right of the Company

shall be determined by reference to the total amount that would have been
recoverable by the Unitholders and Blocker Holdings if all such Unitholders
and Blocker Holdings brought an action against Purchaser and Merger Sub and
were recognized as intended third party beneficiaries hereunder, which right
is hereby acknowledged and agreed by Purchaser and Merger Sub, (iii) the
rights of the Non-Recourse Parties under _Section 12.16_ , (iv) the rights of
Retained Counsel under _Section 12.17,_ (v) the rights of the Equityholders\'
respective Affiliates and Representatives under _Section 12.1_, (vi) the
rights of Debt Financing Source Related Parties under _Section 12.4_, this
_Section 12.8_, _Section 12.9(d)_, _Section 12.11_ and _Section 12.19_ , (vii)

Section 12.9 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

  


 

  


 

  

 

85  

  


 

  


 

  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict
of laws provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware.

  


 

  

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that, other than in connection
with any post-Closing adjustments to the Closing Aggregate Consideration
(which shall be addressed in accordance with the procedures set forth in
_Article II_ ) (i) all actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to
this Agreement shall be heard and determined exclusively in the Chancery Court
of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom sitting in
New Castle County in the State of Delaware (or, if the Chancery Court of the
State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter,
any state or federal court within the State of Delaware), (ii) it shall not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court and (iii) a final judgment in any action
or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions
by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

  


 

  

(c) Each party irrevocably consents to the service of process outside the
territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in this _Section 12.9_ in
any such action or proceeding by mailing copies thereof by registered or
certified United States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to
its address as specified in or pursuant to this _Article XII_. However, the
foregoing shall not limit the right of a party to effect service of process on
the other party by any other legally available method.

  


 

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the
parties hereto agrees that (i) it will not bring or support any action, suit,
claim or proceeding, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third party claim
of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract
or tort or otherwise against the Debt Financing Sources arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of relating in
any way to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in any forum other
than a court of competent jurisdiction located within the Borough of Manhattan
in the City of New York, New York, whether a state or federal court, (ii)
except as specifically set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, all claims or
causes of action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) against any of the Debt Financing Source Related Parties in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions, the Debt Commitment
Letter or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby,

Section 12.10 _Specific Enforcement_. The parties agree that immediate,
extensive and irreparable damage would occur for which monetary damages would
not be an adequate remedy in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are
otherwise breached. Accordingly, the parties agree that, if for any reason
Purchaser, Merger Sub, Blocker Holdings, Blocker or the Company shall have
failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement or otherwise breached

nonperforming party under this Agreement shall be entitled to specific
performance and the issuance of immediate injunctive and other equitable

  

  

  

 

86  

  

  

relief without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a
remedy, and the parties further agree to waive any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any such
injunctive or other equitable relief, this being in addition to and not in
limitation of any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

  


 

  

Section 12.11 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE

WITH THE DEBT FINANCING, THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER OR THE PERFORMANCE
THEREOF.

phrase shall not mean simply "if". As used in this Agreement "willful breach"
shall mean a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement set forth in this Agreement that is a consequence of an act or
failure to act by a party with the actual knowledge that the taking of such
act or failure to act would cause, or would reasonably be expected to result
in, a breach. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have such defined
meanings when used in any document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless
otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are
applicable to the

  


 

  

 

110  

  


 

  


 

  

singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as
well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any statute defined
or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to
herein means such statute as from time to time amended, modified or
supplemented, including by succession of comparable successor statutes and
references to the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. References to
a Person are also to its permitted assigns and successors. For purposes of
this Agreement, if the Company or a Person acting on its behalf posts a
document to the online data room hosted on behalf of the Company at
www.intralinks.com, such document shall be deemed to have been "delivered",
"furnished" or "made available" (or any phrase of similar import) to Purchaser
and Merger Sub by the Company. References to a "manager" or "managers" of the
Company or its Subsidiaries in this Agreement means, with respect to the
Company, a "Manager" as defined in the Company LLC Agreement or, with respect
to such a Subsidiary, a director or manager of such Subsidiary, as applicable.
The "parties" to this Agreement are: the Company, Purchaser, Merger Sub,
Blocker, Blocker Holdings and the Equityholder Representative.

  


 

  

(b) The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement and, in the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as jointly
drafted by the parties hereto and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement. The specification of any dollar amount or the
inclusion of any item in the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule or Exhibits attached hereto is not
intended to imply that the amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the items
so included, or other items, are or are not required to be disclosed
(including whether such amounts or items are required to be disclosed as
material or threatened) or are within or outside of the ordinary course of
business, and no party shall use the fact of the setting of the amounts or the
fact of the inclusion of any item in this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule
or Exhibits in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether
any obligation, item or matter not described or included in this Agreement or
in the Disclosure Schedule or any Exhibit is or is not required to be
disclosed (including whether the amount or items are required to be disclosed
as material or threatened) or is within or outside of the ordinary course of
business for purposes of this Agreement. The information contained in this
Agreement and in the Disclosure Schedule and Exhibits hereto is disclosed
solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained herein or
therein shall be deemed to be an admission by any party hereto to any third
party of any matter whatsoever (including any violation of Law or breach of
contract). The Disclosure Schedule sets forth, among other things, items the
disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either in response to an
express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an
exception to one or more representations or warranties contained in _Article
III_ , _Article IV_ , _Article V_ or to one or more of the covenants contained
in _Article VII_ , except that any information set forth in one Section of the
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to apply to all other Sections or
subsections thereof to the extent that the applicability of such information
is reasonably apparent.

  


 

  

Section 12.16 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
or otherwise, the parties to this Agreement agree on their own behalf and on
behalf of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates that no Non-Recourse
Party of a party to this Agreement shall have any liability relating to this
Agreement or any of the Transactions except to the extent agreed to in writing
by such Non-Recourse Party; provided that this _Section 12.16_ shall not
prejudice or limit

  


 

  

 

111  

  


 

  


 

  

any claim or remedy for intentional fraud with respect to any Company
Representations, Blocker Representations or Blocker Holdings Representations
or, with respect to the Equityholder Representative, any liability that the
Equityholder Representative may have to Purchaser under _Section 12.2(c)_.

  


 

  

Section 12.17 _Provision Respecting Legal Representation_. It is acknowledged
by each of the parties hereto that the Company, Blocker, certain Equityholders
and the Equityholder Representative have retained Kirkland and Ellis LLP (and
its affiliated entity Kirkland and Ellis International LLP) (collectively, the "
_Retained Counsel_ ") to act as their counsel in connection with the
Transactions and that the Retained Counsel has not acted as counsel for any
other party hereto in connection with the Transactions and that none of the
other parties hereto has the status of a client of the Retained Counsel for
conflict of interest or any other purposes as a result thereof. Purchaser,
Blocker and the Company and its Subsidiaries hereby agree, on their own behalf
and on behalf of their respective managers, directors, equityholders, members,
partners, officers, employees and Affiliates, that, in the event that a
dispute arises after the Closing between Purchaser, Blocker, the Company,
and/or its Subsidiaries on the one hand, and the Equityholder Representative
or any Equityholder or any of their Affiliates, on the other hand, (i) the
Retained Counsel may represent the Equityholder Representative and any
Equityholder (and any of their Affiliates) in such dispute even though the
interests of the Equityholder Representative or any Equityholder (or any of
their Affiliates) may be directly adverse to Purchaser, Blocker, the Company
or its Subsidiaries, and even though the Retained Counsel may have represented
Blocker, the Company or its Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to
such dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for Purchaser, Blocker, the
Company or any of their Subsidiaries and (ii) no party to such dispute may
retain Covington in connection therewith. Purchaser further agrees that, as to
all communications among the Retained Counsel, Covington and Burling, LLP ("
_Covington_ "), Equityholders, Blocker, the Company and/or any of their
respective Affiliates that relate in any way to the Transactions, the
attorney-client privilege (as it relates to both Covington and the Retained
Counsel) and the expectation of client confidence belongs to the Equityholder
Representative and shall not pass to or be claimed by Purchaser, Blocker, the
Company or any of their Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that a dispute arises between Purchaser, Blocker, the Company or any of
their Subsidiaries and a third party (other than a party to this Agreement or
any of their respective Affiliates) after the Closing, Blocker, the Company
and its Subsidiaries may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent
disclosure of confidential communications by the Retained Counsel or Covington
to such third party or the use thereof by the Retained Counsel or Covington in
connection with its representation of a party in such dispute; provided,
however, that neither Blocker, the Company nor its Subsidiaries may waive such
privilege without the prior written consent of the Equityholder
Representative. The Retained Counsel shall be third-party beneficiaries of
this _Section 12.17_.

  


 

  

Section 12.18 _Delivery by Electronic Transmission_. This Agreement and any
signed agreement entered into in connection herewith or contemplated hereby,
and any amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by
means of a facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar
attachment to electronic mail, shall be treated in all manner and respects as
an original contract and shall be considered to have the same binding legal
effects as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person.
At the request of any party hereto or to any such contract, each other party
hereto or thereto shall re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to
all other parties. No party hereto or to any such contract shall raise the use
of

  


 

  

 

112  

  


 

  


 

  

a facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to
electronic mail to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or
contract was transmitted or communicated through the use of facsimile machine
or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to electronic mail as a
defense to the formation of a contract and each such party forever waives any
such defense.

  


 

  

Section 12.19 _Lender Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, (a) Blocker Holdings, Blocker, the Equityholder
Representative, the Company and its Subsidiaries, and its and their respective
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers,
members and stockholders shall not have any rights or claims against any Debt
Financing Source Related Party, in any way relating to this Agreement, the
Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt Financing or any of the Transactions, or in
respect of any document or transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or in
respect of any oral or written representations made or alleged to have been
made in connection herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of
or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance
thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise, and (b) no Debt Financing Source Related Party
shall have any liability (whether in contract, in tort or otherwise) to any of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, and its and their respective Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers, members,
representatives and stockholders for any obligations or liabilities of any
party hereto under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or
by reason of, the Transactions or in respect of any oral or written
representations made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith,
including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt
Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated
thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise; provided
that, notwithstanding clauses (a) and (b) above, the foregoing shall not apply
to or otherwise be binding upon, Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, and its and
their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners,
managers, members and stockholders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Debt Financing Source Related Parties are
intended third-party beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to the
protections of, this provision.
