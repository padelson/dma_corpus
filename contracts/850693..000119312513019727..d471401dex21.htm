1 AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this
Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

 

THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

1.1 _The Offer_.

(a) As promptly as practicable (and in any event within seven Business Days)
after the date hereof, the Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser
to) commence, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
(the " _Exchange Act_ "), the Offer to purchase all the outstanding Shares at
the Offer Price, subject to: (i) there being validly tendered in the Offer and
not properly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date that number of Shares
which, together with the number of Shares (if any) then owned of record by
Parent or the Purchaser or with respect to which Parent or the Purchaser
otherwise has, directly or indirectly, sole voting power, represents at least
a majority of the Shares then outstanding (determined on a fully diluted
basis assuming conversion or exercise of all derivative securities regardless
of the conversion or exercise price, the vesting schedule or other terms and
conditions thereof) (the " _Minimum Condition_ "); and (ii) the satisfaction,
or waiver by Parent or the Purchaser, of the other conditions set forth herein
and in Annex I.

(b) Subject to the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction,
or waiver by Parent or the Purchaser, of the other conditions set forth herein
and in Annex I, the Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to)
accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as promptly as practicable after Purchaser is
legally permitted to do so under applicable Law. The Offer Price payable in
respect of each Share validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer shall be paid net to the seller in cash, without interest.

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") that describes the terms and conditions of the Offer in
accordance with this Agreement, including the Minimum Condition and the other
conditions set forth in Annex I. Parent and the Purchaser expressly reserve
the right to increase the Offer Price or to make any other changes in the
terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that unless
otherwise contemplated by this Agreement or as previously approved by the
Company in writing, the Purchaser shall not (i) decrease the Offer Price, (ii)
change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (iii) reduce the
maximum number of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, (iv) amend or
waive the Minimum Condition, (v) amend any of the other conditions to the
Offer set forth in Annex I in a manner adverse to the holders of Shares or
(vi) extend the Expiration Date in a manner other than in accordance with this
Agreement.

(d) Unless extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Offer
shall expire at midnight (New York City time) on the date that is 20 Business
Days from and including the date of the commencement of the Offer (the "
_Initial Expiration Date_ ") or, if the Initial Expiration Date has been
extended in accordance with this Agreement, the date on which the Offer has
been so extended (the Initial Expiration Date, or such later date to which the
Initial Expiration Date has been extended in accordance with this Agreement,
the " _Expiration Date_ ").

(e) If at the scheduled Expiration Date, all of the conditions to the Offer
(including the Minimum Condition and the other conditions and requirements set
forth herein and in Annex I) have not been satisfied, or waived by Parent or
the Purchaser, and if this Agreement shall not have been terminated in
accordance with Article 7, the Purchaser may (in its sole discretion, without
consent of the Company) and, to the extent requested by the Company in writing
prior to such scheduled Expiration Date, shall (and Parent shall cause
the Purchaser

 



2  to) extend the Offer for successive periods of up to 20 Business Days each,
the length of each such period to be determined by Parent in its sole
discretion, in order to permit the satisfaction of such conditions;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchaser shall not be required to extend
the Offer if any condition to the Offer has not been satisfied on or prior to
May 22, 2013 (the " _Outside Date_ "), beyond the Outside Date. In addition,
if this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Article 7,
the Purchaser shall extend the Offer for any period or periods required by
applicable Law or applicable rules, regulations, interpretations or positions
of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or its staff.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if necessary to obtain sufficient Shares
(including Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option) to reach
the Short Form Threshold, the Purchaser may, in its sole discretion (and
Parent may cause the Purchaser to), provide for a "subsequent offering
period" (and one or more extensions thereof) in accordance with Rule 14d-11
under the Exchange Act of up to 10 Business Days, the length of the initial
"subsequent offering period" and each extension thereof to be determined by
the Purchaser in its sole discretion. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and the Offer, the Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause the
Purchaser to) immediately accept for payment, and pay for, all Shares that
are validly tendered pursuant to the Offer during such "subsequent offering
period". The Offer Documents will provide for the possibility of a "subsequent
offering period" in a manner consistent with the terms of this  _Section
1.1(f)_.

(g) The Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled
Expiration Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except if
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article 7_. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Article 7_ , the Purchaser shall (and Parent shall
cause the Purchaser to) promptly (and in any event within 24 hours of such
termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer. If the
Offer is terminated or withdrawn by the Purchaser, or this Agreement is
terminated prior to the purchase of Shares in the Offer, the Purchaser shall
promptly return, and shall cause any depositary acting on behalf of the
Purchaser to return, in accordance with applicable Law, all tendered Shares to
the registered holders thereof.

 

(h) As soon as practicable on the date of the commencement of the Offer,
Parent and the Purchaser shall file with the SEC, in accordance with Rule
14d-3 under the Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with
respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits
thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ "). The Schedule TO shall include, as exhibits,
the Offer to Purchase, a form of letter of transmittal and a form of summary
advertisement (collectively, together with any amendments and supplements
thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). Parent and the Purchaser agree to cause
the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares, as and to the
extent required by the Exchange Act. The Company shall promptly provide Parent
and the Purchaser in writing, for inclusion in the Offer Documents, all
information concerning the Company that is required under the Exchange Act to
be included in the Offer Documents. Parent and the Purchaser, on the one hand,
and the Company, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Offer Documents, if and to the extent that it
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise
required by applicable Law, and Parent and the Purchaser agree to cause the
Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated
to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the
Exchange Act. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents before they
are filed with the SEC, and Parent and the Purchaser shall give due
consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by the Company and its counsel. In addition, Parent and the Purchaser
shall provide the Company and its counsel with copies of any written
comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that Parent, the
Purchaser or their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents promptly after
receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. The
Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any
such written responses, and Parent and the Purchaser shall give due
consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by the Company and its counsel.

 



3 1.2 _Company Actions_.

 

(a) On the date the Offer is commenced, the Company shall, in a manner that
complies with Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, file with the SEC a Tender
Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to
the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the
" _Schedule 14D-9_ ") that shall, subject to the provisions of _Section
5.3(d)_, contain the Company Board Recommendation. The Company shall also
include in the Schedule 14D-9, and represents that it has obtained all
necessary consents of the Company Financial Advisor to permit the Company to
include in the Schedule 14D-9, in its entirety, the Fairness Opinion, together
with a summary thereof in accordance with Item 1015(b) of Regulation M-A under
the Exchange Act (regardless of whether such item is applicable). The Company
hereby consents to the Offer and to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of a
description of the Company Board Recommendation and the Fairness Opinion. The
Company further agrees to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to
holders of Shares, as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Each of
Parent and the Purchaser shall promptly provide the Company in writing, for
inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9, all information concerning Parent and the
Purchaser that is required under the Exchange Act to be included in the
Schedule 14D-9. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and the Purchaser, on
the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information provided by it for
use in the Schedule 14D-9, if and to the extent that it shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by
applicable Law, and the Company agrees to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so
corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares,
in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Parent, the
Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC, and the
Company shall include all additions, deletions or changes thereto suggested
by Parent and its legal counsel that the Company reasonably determines to be
appropriate. In addition, the Company shall provide Parent, the Purchaser and
their counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of
any oral comments, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to
time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly
after receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto.
Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel shall be given the opportunity to
review any such written responses, and the Company shall give due
consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel.

(b) The Company shall promptly furnish or cause to be furnished to the
Purchaser mailing labels, security position listings, non-objecting
beneficial owner lists and any other listings or computer files containing the
names and addresses of the record or beneficial holders of the Shares as of
the most recent practicable date, and shall promptly furnish Purchaser with
such information (including, but not limited to, updated lists of holders of
the Shares and their addresses, mailing labels, security position listings and
non-objecting beneficial owner lists) and such other assistance and
information as the Purchaser or its agents may reasonably request in
communicating with the record and beneficial holders of Shares.

1.3 _Directors_.

(a) After the Purchaser accepts for payment Shares tendered and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (the " _Acceptance Time_ "), and at all times
thereafter, Parent shall be entitled to elect or designate such number of
directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board as is
equal to the product of the total number of directors on the Company Board
(giving effect to the directors elected or designated by Parent pursuant to
this sentence) multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate number
of Shares beneficially owned by Parent, the Purchaser or any of their
respective Subsidiaries bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding.
After the Acceptance Time, the Company shall, upon Parents request, take all
actions as are necessary or desirable to enable Parents designees to be so
elected or appointed to the Company Board, including but not limited to
promptly filling vacancies or newly created directorships on the Company
Board, promptly increasing the size of the Company Board (including by
amending the Company Bylaws if necessary to increase the size of the Company
Board) or promptly securing the resignations of such number of its incumbent
directors, and shall cause Parents designees to be so elected or appointed
at such time. After the Acceptance

 



4  Time, the Company shall also, upon Parents request, cause the directors
elected or designated by Parent to the Company Board to serve on and
constitute the same percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) as is on
the Company Board of (i) each committee of the Company Board, (ii) each board
of directors (or similar body) of each Company Subsidiary and (iii) each
committee (or similar body) of each such board, in each case to the extent
permitted by applicable Law and the Marketplace Rules of The NASDAQ Global
Market (the " _Nasdaq_ "). After the Acceptance Time, the Company shall also,
upon Parents request, take all action necessary to elect to be treated as a
"controlled company" as defined by Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5615(c)(1) and make
all necessary filings and disclosures associated with such status. The
provisions of this _Section 1.3(a)_ are in addition to and shall not limit
any rights that Parent, the Purchaser or any of their respective affiliates
may have as a record holder or beneficial owner of Shares as a matter of
applicable Law with respect to the election of directors or otherwise. 

(b) The Companys obligations to appoint Parents designees to the Company
Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions required
pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations
under this  _Section 1.3(b)_, including mailing to stockholders (together
with the Schedule 14D-9) any information required by Section 14(f) and Rule
14f-1 to enable Parents designees to be elected or designated to the Company
Board at the time or times contemplated by this _Section 1.3_. Parent shall
supply or cause to be supplied to the Company any information with respect to
Parent, the Purchaser, their respective officers, directors and affiliates and
proposed designees to the Company Board required by Section 14(f) and Rule
14f-1.

(c) After Parents designees are elected or appointed to, and constitute a
majority of, the Company Board pursuant to _Section 1.3(a)_, and prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Company Board to maintain at least
three directors who are members of the Company Board on the date hereof, each
of whom shall be an "independent director" as defined by Rule 5605(a)(2) of
the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules and eligible to serve on the Companys audit
committee under the Exchange Act and Nasdaq rules and, at least one of whom
shall be an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of
Regulation S-K and the instructions thereto (the " _Continuing Directors_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that if any Continuing Director is unable to serve
due to death, disability or resignation, the Company shall take all necessary
action (including creating a committee of the Company Board) so that the
remaining Continuing Director or Continuing Directors shall be entitled to
elect or designate another Person that satisfies the foregoing independence
requirements to fill such vacancy, and such Person shall be deemed to be a
Continuing Director for purposes of this Agreement. After Parents designees
are elected or designated to, and constitute a majority of, the Company Board
pursuant to _Section 1.3(a)_, and prior to the Effective Time, in addition to
any approvals of the Company Board or the stockholders of the Company as may
be required by the Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws or applicable Law,
subject to the terms hereof, the affirmative vote of a majority of the
Continuing Directors shall be required (i) for the Company to terminate
this Agreement or amend this Agreement, (ii) for the Company to exercise or
waive any of the Companys rights, benefits or remedies under this Agreement,
(iii) except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, to amend the
Company Certificate or the Company Bylaws or (iv) to take any other action of
the Company Board under or in connection with this Agreement, in each case, if
such termination, amendment, exercise, waiver or other action would reasonably
be expected to adversely affect in any material respect the holders of Shares
(other than Parent or the Purchaser); _provided_ , _however_ , that if there
shall be no Continuing Directors as a result of such Persons deaths,
disabilities or resignations, then such actions may be effected by majority
vote of the entire Company Board.

Corporation_ "). The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable

certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. The
officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, from and
after the Effective Time, shall continue as the officers of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective

their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

(d) If at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall

record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest
in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the
Company or the Purchaser acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to

Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of either the Company or the Purchaser, all such deeds, bills of sale,
instruments of conveyance, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in
the name and on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such
other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or
confirm any and all right, title or interest in, to and under such rights,
properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out
this Agreement.

(the "Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m., Pacific time, on a date to be
specified by the parties (the "Closing Date"), such date to be no later than
the second Business Day after satisfaction or waiver of all of the
conditions set forth in Article 6 (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or
waiver of those conditions at the Closing), at the offices of Gibson, Dunn and
Crutcher LLP, 3161 Michelson Drive, Irvine, California unless another time,
date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. On the Closing
Date, or on such other date as Parent and the Company may agree to in writing,
Parent, the Purchaser and the Company shall cause an appropriate certificate
of ownership and merger or certificate of merger, as applicable (in either
case, the "Certificate of Merger") to be executed and filed with the Secretary

shall have been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware or such other date and time as is agreed upon by the parties and
specified in the Certificate of Merger, such date and time hereinafter
referred to as the "Effective Time".

 



6 1.6 _Meeting of Stockholders to Approve the Merger_.

 

(a) If required by applicable Law in order to consummate the Merger, the
Company shall prepare a proxy statement or information statement for the
Special Meeting (together with any amendments and supplements thereto and any
other required proxy materials, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") relating to the
Merger and this Agreement, with the intention that the Proxy Statement be in
a form ready, if necessary, to file with the SEC, print and mail to the
stockholders of the Company as soon as practicable following the Acceptance
Time. Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review the Proxy Statement before it is filed with the SEC,
and the Company shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, the Purchaser and their
counsel. The Company shall include the Company Board Recommendation and the
Fairness Opinion, together with a summary thereof in accordance with Item
1015(b) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act (regardless of whether such
item is applicable), in the Proxy Statement. The Company, on the one hand,
and Parent and the Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement, if and to the
extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect
or as otherwise required by applicable Law, and the Company agrees to cause
the Proxy Statement, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and, if any
such correction is made following the mailing of the Proxy Statement, mailed
to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the
Exchange Act. The Company shall provide Parent, the Purchaser and their
counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral
comments, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement promptly after the
Companys receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto.
Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel shall be given the reasonable
opportunity to review any such written responses and the Company shall give
due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel.

 

(b) If approval of the stockholders of the Company is required under
applicable Law to consummate the Merger, the Company, acting through the
Company Board, shall, in accordance with and subject to the requirements of
applicable Law: (i) as promptly as practicable after the Acceptance Time, in
consultation with Parent, duly set a record date for, call and give notice of
a special meeting of its stockholders (the " _Special Meeting_ ") for the
purpose of considering and taking action upon this Agreement (with the record
date to be set in consultation with Parent for a date after the Acceptance
Time); (ii) promptly after the Acceptance Time, file the Proxy Statement with
the SEC, cause the Proxy Statement to be printed and mailed to the
stockholders of the Company and convene and hold the Special Meeting; and
(iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from its stockholders
proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and secure any
approval of stockholders of the Company that is required by applicable Law to
effect the Merger.

(c) At the Special Meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof, Parent
shall vote, or cause to be voted, all of the Shares then owned of record by
Parent or the Purchaser or with respect to which Parent or the Purchaser
otherwise has, directly or indirectly, sole voting power in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement and approval of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger, and to deliver or provide, in its capacity as a
stockholder of the Company, any other approvals that are required by
applicable Law to effect the Merger. 

1.7 _Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders_. Notwithstanding the terms of
Section 1.6, if after the Acceptance Time and, if applicable, the expiration
of any "subsequent offering period" provided by the Purchaser in accordance
with this Agreement and the exercise of the Top-Up Option, Parent and the
Purchaser shall then own, in the aggregate, at least 90% of the outstanding
shares of each class of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote on the
adoption of this Agreement under applicable Law (the " _Short Form Threshold_
"), the parties hereto agree to take all necessary and appropriate action to
cause the Merger to become effective as promptly as practicable without a
meeting of stockholders of the Company in accordance with Section 253 of the
DGCL.

 



7 1.8 _Top-Up Option_.

 

(a) The Company hereby irrevocably grants to the Purchaser an option (the "
_Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable only upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this _Section 1._8, to purchase at a price per share
equal to the Offer Price an aggregate number of Shares (the " _Top-Up Option
Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of Shares that, when added to the
number of Shares owned by Parent and the Purchaser at the time of such
exercise, shall constitute one share more than 90% of the Shares then
outstanding (after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option
Shares);  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Top-Up Option shall not be
exercisable unless, (i) the Minimum Condition shall have been satisfied and
(ii) immediately after such exercise and the issuance of Shares pursuant
thereto, the Purchaser reasonably believes that the Short Form Threshold
would be reached (assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares);
_provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall the Top-Up Option be
exercisable for a number of Shares in excess of the Companys then total
authorized and unissued Shares, excluding any Shares that are reserved or
otherwise committed for issuance. Upon Parents request, the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its transfer agent to certify in
writing to Parent the number of Shares issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option and after giving effect
to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares. The Purchaser shall pay
the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Option
Shares in cash for the amount equal to the aggregate par value of the Top-Up
Option Shares, with the balance payable by delivery of a non- negotiable and
non-transferable promissory note (the " _Promissory Note_ "). The Promissory
Note shall be secured by the Top-Up Option Shares, be full recourse against
Parent and the Purchaser, be due one year from the date the Top-Up Option
Shares are issued and bear interest at the rate of 5% per annum and may be
prepaid without premium or penalty.

(b) Provided that no applicable Law shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up
Option or the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares pursuant thereto, or
otherwise make such exercise or issuance illegal, the Purchaser may exercise
the Top-Up Option on one or more occasions, in whole or in part, after the
Acceptance Time and prior to the earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time
and (ii) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

(c) Each time that the Purchaser wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, the
Purchaser shall send to the Company a written notice (a " _Top-Up Exercise
Notice_ ") specifying the denominations of the certificate or certificates
evidencing the Top-Up Option Shares that the Purchaser wishes to receive, and
the place, time and date for the closing of the purchase and sale pursuant to
the Top-Up Option (the " _Top-Up Closing_ "). The Company shall, promptly
after receipt of the Top-Up Exercise Notice, deliver a written notice to the
Purchaser confirming the number of Top-Up Option Shares and the aggregate
purchase price therefor (the " _Top-Up Notice Receipt_ "). At the Top-Up
Closing, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Company the consideration required
to be delivered in exchange for the Top-Up Option Shares in an aggregate
amount equal to the purchase price specified in the Top-Up Notice Receipt,
and the Company shall cause to be issued and delivered to the Purchaser a
certificate or certificates representing the Top-Up Option Shares. Such
certificates may include any legends that are required by applicable Law.
Parent and the Purchaser acknowledge that the Top-Up Option Shares which
Parent or the Purchaser may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option shall
not be registered under the Securities Act, and shall be issued in reliance
upon an exemption for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent
and the Purchaser agree that the Top-Up Option, and the Top-Up Option Shares
to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, if any, are being and shall
be acquired by the Purchaser for the purpose of investment and not with a
view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within
the meaning of the Securities Act).

 



8 ARTICLE 2

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER

2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Purchaser, the
Company or the holders of any of the following securities:

 

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Shares to be cancelled in
accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and other than Dissenting Shares, shall be
converted into the right to receive the Offer Price (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "), payable net to the holder in cash, without interest, upon
surrender of the certificate formerly representing such Shares in accordance
with _Section 2.2_.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All Shares that
are held in the treasury of the Company or owned of record by any Company
Subsidiary, and all Shares owned of record by Parent, the Purchaser or any of
their respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease
to exist, with no payment being made with respect thereto.

(c) _Purchaser Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of the Purchaser (the " _Purchaser Common Stock_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one newly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate
a reputable bank or trust company to act as the paying agent for purposes of
effecting the payment of the Merger Consideration in connection with the
Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "). At or promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent or the Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Paying Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of Shares
shall be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement, together
with the aggregate Option Payments, and RSU Payments. Such funds shall be
invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent, in its sole discretion,
pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the Shares.
Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of
Parent, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of
Shares.

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of
a certificate or certificates that represented Shares (the " _Certificates_
") or non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_
"), in each case, which Shares were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement: (i) a
letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form
and have such other provisions as Parent or the Paying Agent may reasonably
specify, and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration.
Upon surrender of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to the
Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent,
and upon delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and in
proper form, with respect to such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, the
holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive
the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such
Certificates and for each Book-Entry Share. Any Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
any surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent
of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required
by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than
the registered holder of the Certificate

 



9  so surrendered and shall have established to the satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not
required to be paid. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to
Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-
Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
in cash as contemplated by this Agreement, without interest thereon.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records
of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
and Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as
otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

 

(d) _Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. At any time
following the first anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any
funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made available to
the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to
the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger
Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares and compliance with the procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_, without
interest. If, prior to six years after the Effective Time (or otherwise
immediately prior to such time on which any payment in respect hereof would
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), any holder of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares has not complied with the procedures in
_Section 2.2(b)_ to receive payment of the Merger Consideration to which such
holder would otherwise be entitled, the payment in respect of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(e) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the relevant Offer Price, Merger Consideration, Option Payment,
and RSU Payment otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Shares, Company Options, or Company RSUs, as applicable, such amounts that
Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any provision of state, local or non-United States Tax Law
or under the terms of any Company Benefit Plan. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld and remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of Shares, Company Options, or Company RSUs, as
applicable, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ hereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as
it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.

 



10 2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held
by a holder who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal for
such Shares in accordance with, and who complies in all respects with, Section
262 of the DGCL (such Shares, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and shall instead
represent the right to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting
Shares in accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the
DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or
loses his right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or other applicable
Law, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such
Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to
have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into and shall be exchangeable
solely for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest.
The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the
Company relating to rights to be paid the fair value of Dissenting Shares,
and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or
compromise, any such demands, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands,
or agree to do any of the foregoing. The parties hereby agree and acknowledge
that in any appraisal proceeding with respect to the Dissenting Shares and to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in any appraisal proceeding
under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to Dissenting Shares,
the Surviving Company shall not assert that the exercise of the Top-Up
Option, any issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares or any delivery by the
Purchaser of the Promissory Note to the Company in payment for the Top-Up
Option Shares should be considered in connection with a determination of the
fair value of the Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262(h) of the
DGCL.

2.4 _Treatment of Company Options; Restricted Stock; Company RSUs; Stock
Plans_.

(a) _Treatment of Company Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate
resolutions and take all other actions necessary and appropriate (including
amendment of any equity plan or award agreement evidencing the grant of a
Company Option, accelerating the vesting of any Company Option, and providing
advance notice and an opportunity to exercise any Company Option) to provide
that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each unexpired and unexercised
option to purchase Shares (the " _Company Options_ "), under any stock option
plan of the Company, including the 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan, 2005 Equity
Incentive Plan or the 2007 Equity Award Plan, or any other plan, agreement or
arrangement (the " _Company Stock Option Plans_ "), whether or not then
exercisable or vested, shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor,
each former holder of any such cancelled Company Option shall, subject to its
delivery to the Company of a duly executed option termination agreement with
respect to Company Options granted under the 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan, be
entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such Company
Option and in full settlement therefor, a payment in cash (subject to any
applicable withholding or other Taxes or other amounts required by applicable
Law to be withheld in accordance with  _Section 2.2(e)_) of an amount equal
to the product of (i) the total number of Shares previously subject to such
Company Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over
the exercise price per Share previously subject to such Company Option;
provided, that if the exercise price per share under any such Company Option
is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, then such Company Stock
Option shall be cancelled without any cash payment being made in respect
thereof (such amounts payable hereunder being referred to as the " _Option
Payments_ "). From and after the Effective Time, any such cancelled Company
Option shall no longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall
only entitle such holder to the payment of the Option Payment.

(b) _Treatment of Restricted Stock_. Prior to the Effective Time, in
accordance with the terms of the Company Stock Option Plans, each unvested
Share subject to forfeiture restrictions, repurchase rights or other
restrictions under the Company Stock Option Plans (" _Restricted Stock_ ")
shall vest in full and all restrictions (including forfeiture restrictions or
repurchase rights) otherwise applicable to such Restricted Stock shall lapse

 



11  and the Restricted Stock shall be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without interest, as provided in _Section 2.1(a)_,
subject to any withholding of Taxes or other amounts required to be withheld
by applicable Law in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_.

(c) _Treatment of Company RSUs_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate
resolutions and take all other actions necessary and appropriate under the
Company Stock Option Plans to provide that, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock unit awarded pursuant to any
Company Stock Option Plan (the " _Company RSUs_ "), whether or not then
vested, shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of
any such cancelled Company RSU shall be entitled to receive, in consideration
of the cancellation of such Company RSU and in full settlement therefor, a
payment in cash (subject to any applicable withholding or other Taxes
required by applicable Law to be withheld in accordance with _Section
2.2(e)_) of an amount equal to the product of (i) the total number of Shares
previously subject to such Company RSU and (ii) the Merger Consideration (such
amounts payable hereunder being referred to as the " _RSU Payments_ "). The
holders of all canceled Company RSUs shall, as of the Effective Time, cease to
have any further right or entitlement to acquire Shares under their canceled
Company RSUs.

(d) _Termination of Company Stock Option Plans_. After the Effective Time, all
Company Stock Option Plans shall be terminated and no further Company Options
or other rights with respect to Shares shall be granted thereunder.

2.5  _Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. The current offerings in
progress as of the date hereof under the Companys Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (the " _ESPP_ ") shall continue, and the shares of Company Common
Stock shall be issued to participants thereunder on the next currently
scheduled purchase dates thereunder occurring after the date hereof as
provided under, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the ESPP. In
accordance with the terms of the ESPP, any offering in progress as of the
Effective Time shall be shortened, and the " _Exercise Date_ " (as defined in
the ESPP) shall be the business day immediately preceding the Effective Time.
Each then outstanding option under the ESPP shall be exercised automatically
on such Exercise Date. Notwithstanding any restrictions on transfer of stock
in the ESPP, the treatment in the Merger of any stock under this provision
shall be in accordance with _Section 2.1(a)_. The Company shall terminate
the ESPP as of or prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall promptly
after the date hereof amend the ESPP as appropriate to avoid the commencement
of any new offering of options thereunder at or after the date hereof
and prior to the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the
Effective Time.

therein to the extent they are predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in
nature), (ii) the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent and
the Purchaser prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company
Disclosure Schedule_ "), which identifies items of disclosure by reference to
a particular Section or Subsection of this Agreement or (iii) any other part
of the Company Disclosure Schedule where it is reasonably apparent from the

12  incorporation or organization and has all requisite corporate or
organizational, as the case may be, power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted. The Company and each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified to
do business in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of
its properties or assets or the conduct of its business requires
such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) The Company has made available to Parent and the Purchaser true and
complete copies of the currently effective amended and restated certificate
of incorporation of the Company (the " _Company Certificate_ ") and amended
and restated bylaws of the Company (the " _Company Bylaws_ "), and the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or equivalent organizational or
governing documents, of each Company Subsidiary. The Company is not in
violation of the Company Certificate or Company Bylaws, and, except as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, the Company Subsidiaries are not in
violation of their respective organizational or governing documents.

complete list of the Company Subsidiaries, together with the jurisdiction of
organization or incorporation, as the case may be, of each Company

3.2 _Capitalization_.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 100,000,000

Registered Intellectual Property and Material Intellectual Property owned by
the Company have been timely and duly filed, prosecution for such applications

been properly calculated and timely paid (after giving effect to any

the validity of issued Patents within either the Company Registered
Intellectual

 



24  Property or the Material Intellectual Property owned by the Company, and to
maintain the effectiveness of the Company Registered Intellectual Property and
Material Intellectual Property owned by the Company. The Company and each
Company Subsidiary represent that written assignment of invention agreements
have been executed with officers, subcontractors, independent contractors and
employees of the Company and each Company Subsidiary who contributed to the
creation of the Company Registered Intellectual Property, Material
Intellectual Property owned by the Company or such Company Subsidiary, or
Company-Owned Intellectual Property using the applicable Company Form IP
Contract or equivalent agreement or as set forth on Section 3.17(h) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, as applicable. The Company and each Company
Subsidiary has taken all reasonable steps necessary or appropriate to ensure
that written confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements have been executed
with officers, subcontractors, independent contractors and employees of the
Company and each Company Subsidiary who had access to the Trade Secrets owned
by the Company that are material to the Business, using the applicable
Company Form IP Contract or equivalent agreement or as set forth on Section
3.17(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, as applicable.

has been no misappropriation of any Trade Secret owned by the Company by any
Person; (ii) to the Knowledge of the Company, no employee, independent
contractor or agent of the Company or any Company Subsidiary has
misappropriated any Trade Secret of any other Person in the course of
performance as an employee, independent contractor or agent creating
or contributing to the Company Registered Intellectual Property, Material
Intellectual Property, or Company-Owned Intellectual Property; and (iii) to
the Knowledge of the Company, no employee, independent contractor or agent of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is in default or breach of any term of
any employment agreement, nondisclosure agreement, assignment of invention
agreement or similar agreement or Contract relating in any way to the
protection, ownership, development, use or transfer of the Company-Registered
Intellectual Property, Material Intellectual Property, or Company-Owned
Intellectual Property. No funding, facilities, or Personnel of any
Governmental Entity or educational institution were used, directly
or indirectly, to develop or create, in whole or in part, any of the Company-
Registered Intellectual Property, Material Intellectual Property, or Company-
Owned Intellectual Property. To the Knowledge of the Company, no inventions by
current and former employees or consultants of the Company made or otherwise
conceived prior to their beginning employment or consultation with the Company
have been or will be incorporated into any of the Company-Registered
Intellectual Property, Material Intellectual Property, or Company-Owned
Intellectual Property, the Levadex Product or the Tempo Device, except to the
extent that such employees or their employers, or consultants have granted the
Company a license under or other rights with respect to such inventions in
connection therewith pursuant to an express written agreement identified on
Schedule 3.17(f) or pursuant to an express written assignment. Neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has made any submission or suggestion
to, and is not subject to any agreement with, standards bodies or other
similar entities that would obligate the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
grant licenses to or otherwise impair its control of the Company-Registered
Intellectual Property, Material Intellectual Property, or Company-Owned
Intellectual Property.

employee, consulting or independent contractor agreement containing assignment
of or licenses under Intellectual Property Rights and Technology or any
confidentiality provision; and (ii) confidentiality or nondisclosure

describes the manner in which Company Form IP Contracts executed by the
Company deviate in any material respect from the corresponding standard form
agreement provided to Parent.

audits, assessments or other actions for or relating to any liability in
respect of Taxes of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, subject to
exceptions for proceedings that, if resolved in a manner unfavorable to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

regarding any invalidation or cancellation of any Insurance Policy that has
not been renewed in the ordinary course without any lapse in coverage.

party, (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside counsel, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal
and (iii) after consultation with its outside counsel, the Company Board
determines in good faith that the failure to take such actions would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Law, then the Company may take the following actions: (A)
furnish information with respect to the Company and any Company Subsidiary to
the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and (B) participate in discussions
or negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal
regarding such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that the Company (x) shall
not, and shall not allow any Company Subsidiary or any Company Representative
to, disclose any information to such Person without first entering into an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, and (y) shall promptly provide to
Parent any information concerning the Company or any Company Subsidiary
provided to such other Person which was not previously provided to Parent.

 

(d) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withhold,
withdraw or qualify (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent) the approval,
recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Company Board or any such
committee of this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby, (ii) adopt, approve, recommend or otherwise declare
advisable the adoption of any

 



36  Acquisition Proposal, (iii) submit any Acquisition Proposal or any matter
related thereto to the vote of the stockholders of the Company or (iv) resolve
or agree to take any such actions (each such action set forth in this
_Section 5.3(d)_ being referred to as a " _Change of Board Recommendation_
").

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company
Board may, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, make a Change of Board
Recommendation for a reason unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal (it being
understood and agreed that any Change of Board Recommendation proposed to be
made in relation to an Acquisition Proposal may only be made pursuant to and
in accordance with the terms of _Section 5.3(f)_) if the Company Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that, in light of facts, events and/or circumstances that have developed since
the Agreement Date and prior to the Acceptance Time and of which the Company
Board did not, as of the date hereof, have knowledge and that were not
reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of or immediately prior to the
date hereof after due inquiry of the Companys executive management team
(an " _Intervening Event_ ") and taking into account the results of any
negotiations with Parent as contemplated by subsection ii. below and any offer
from Parent contemplated by subsection iii below, the failure to take such
action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties owed by the Company Board to the stockholders of the Company under
applicable Law (it being agreed that, for the avoidance of doubt, the approval
by the FDA of NDA Number 202-363 (or any resubmission of such NDA or any
other NDA relating to the Levadex Product) shall be deemed not to constitute
an Intervening Event); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board may not
withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board Recommendation in a manner
adverse to Parent pursuant to the foregoing unless:

i. the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
three Business Days in advance (the " _Intervening Event Notice Period_ ") of
the Companys intention to make a Change of Board Recommendation (it being
understood that the delivery of such notice and any amendment or update
thereto and the determination to so deliver such notice, update or amendment
shall not, by itself, constitute a Change of Board Recommendation or otherwise
give rise to a Triggering Event), which notice shall specify the Company
Board reason for proposing to effect such Change of Board Recommendation
pursuant to this _Section 5.3(e)_;

ii. prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation, the Company shall,
and shall cause the Company Representatives to, during the Intervening Event
Notice Period negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent
desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement in such a manner that would obviate the need for the Company
Board to effect such Change of Board Recommendation; and 

iii. Parent shall not have, within the aforementioned three Business Day
period, made a written, binding and irrevocable (through the expiration of
such period) offer to modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement, which
is set forth in a definitive written amendment to this Agreement delivered to
the Company and executed on behalf of Parent and the Purchaser, that the
Company Board has in good faith determined (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and its financial advisor) would obviate the need for
the Company Board to effect such Change of Board Recommendation.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Article 5_ ,
if the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and its
financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal, after giving effect to
all of the adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement that have
been delivered to the Company by Parent in writing during the Notice Period
provided pursuant to this _Section 5.3(f)_, that are binding and have been
irrevocably committed to by Parent in writing, and provided that such
Acquisition Proposal did not result from or arise in connection with a
material breach by the Company or any of its Representatives of this _Section
5.3_, the Company Board may at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, if the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel, that the failure to take such actions would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties owed by the Company Board to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Law, take the following action: (y) effect a Change of Board
Recommendation with respect to such Superior Proposal or (z) terminate this
Agreement to

 



37  enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to the foregoing clause (z), and any purported termination pursuant
to the foregoing clause (z) shall be void and of no force or effect, unless in
advance of or concurrently with such termination the Company pays the Breakup
Fee and otherwise complies with the provisions of _Sections 7.1(f)_ and _7.2_
; and _provided_ _further_ that the Company Board may not withdraw, modify or
amend the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent pursuant
to the foregoing clause (y) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the
foregoing clause (z) unless:

i. the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
three Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), of the Companys
intention to take such action with respect to such Superior Proposal (it being
understood that the delivery of such notice and any amendment or update
thereto and the determination to so deliver such notice, update or amendment
shall not, by itself, constitute a Change of Board Recommendation or otherwise
give rise to a Triggering Event), which notice shall specify the material
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, (including the identity of the
party making such Superior Proposal) and shall have contemporaneously provided
a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party making
such Superior Proposal, including the definitive agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal; and

ii. prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation or terminating this
Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company Representatives to,
during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent
Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases
to constitute a Superior Proposal. In the event of any material revisions to
the Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written
notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this _Section 5.3(e)_
with respect to such new written notice ( _provided_ that the Notice Period
for any subsequent notice shall be shortened from three Business Days to one
Business Day). The Company agrees that any violation of the restrictions set
forth in this  _Section 5.3_ by any of the Company Representatives shall be
deemed to be a material breach of this Agreement (including this _Section
5.3_) by the Company.

 

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_ shall prohibit the Company Board
from (i) disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the
stockholders of the Company that the Company Board determines to make in good
faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) in order to fulfill
its fiduciary duties under, or in order to otherwise comply with, Applicable
Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the content of any such disclosure shall
be governed by the terms of this Agreement; and _provided_ , _further_ , that
any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" communication or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under
the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Change of Board Recommendation
unless the Company Board expressly reaffirms its recommendation to its
stockholders in favor of the Offer and Merger in such disclosure.

 

(h) The Company agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 5.3 by any Company Representative, whether or not such Person is
purporting to act on behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company.

(i) The Company shall not, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries not to,
enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the
date of this Agreement that would restrict the Companys ability to comply
with any of the terms of this _Section 5.3_, and represents that neither it
nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any such agreement.

 

5.4 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

(a) The Company and Parent shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
(i) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action and do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under

 



38  applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, (ii)
obtain from any Governmental Entities any consents, licenses, permits,
waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders required to be obtained by Parent
or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or to avoid any action
or proceeding by any Governmental Entity (including those in connection with
the HSR Act), in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein,
including the Offer and the Merger and (iii) as promptly as
reasonably practicable, and in any event within 10 Business Days after the
date hereof, make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other
required submissions, and pay any fees due in connection therewith, with
respect to this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger required under (A) the
Exchange Act, and any other applicable federal or state securities Laws, (B)
the HSR Act and (C) any other applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Company
and Parent shall cooperate with each other in connection with (x) preparing
and filing the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9, the Proxy Statement and
any Other Filings, (y) determining whether any action by or in respect of, or
filing with, any Governmental Entity is required, in connection with the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger and (z) seeking any such actions,
consents, approvals or waivers or making any such filings. The Company and
Parent shall furnish to each other all information required for
any application or other filing under the rules and regulations of any
applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(b) The Company and Parent shall give (or shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and use, and cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use, their commercially reasonable efforts to
timely obtain any third party consents, (i) necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) required to
be disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, as applicable; __provided_ , _however__ , that neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall commit to the payment of any fee, penalty or
other consideration in excess of $10,000 or make any other material
concession, waiver or amendment under any Contract in connection with
obtaining any consent without the prior written consent of Parent.

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
5.4_, each party hereto shall: (i) give the other parties prompt notice of the
making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or
legal proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (ii) keep the other parties informed as to the status of any such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding; and (iii)
promptly inform the other parties of any communication to or from the Federal
Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or any other Governmental Entity
regarding the Offer or the Merger. Each party hereto will consult and
cooperate with the other parties and will consider in good faith the views of
the other parties in connection with any filing, analysis, appearance,
presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or
submitted in connection with the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, except as may be
prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any Law, in connection with any
such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding, each party
hereto will permit authorized representatives of the other parties to be
present at each meeting or conference relating to such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or legal proceeding and to have access to and be
consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or
submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or legal proceeding.

(d) Each of Parent, the Purchaser and the Company shall (i) cooperate and
coordinate with the other in the making of any filings or submissions that
are required to be made under any applicable Competition Laws or requested to
be made by any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) supply the other or its outside counsel
with any information that may be required or requested by any Governmental
Entity in connection with such filings or submissions, (iii) supply any
additional information that may be required or requested by the Federal Trade
Commission, the Department of Justice or other Governmental Entities in which
any such filings or submissions are made under any applicable Competition Laws
as promptly as practicable, (iv) use their commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the expiration or

 



39  termination of the applicable waiting periods under any applicable
Competition Laws as soon as reasonably practicable and (v) take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated hereby. In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of
the parties contained in this _Section 5.4_, if any objections are asserted
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any Competition Law
or if any suit is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the Federal
Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or other Governmental Entities
or any private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby
as violative of any Competition Law or that would otherwise prevent materially
impede or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, each of Parent, the Purchaser and the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any such objections or suits so as
to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent
decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition
of any non-material assets or business of the Company or its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole and (ii) otherwise taking or committing to take any actions
that after the Closing would not materially limit the freedom of action of
Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) with respect
to, or its ability to retain, one or more of its or its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporations) businesses, material product lines or
assets, in each case as may be required in order to resolve such objections or
suits by the Expiration Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates shall be obligated to, and the Company shall not without Parents
prior written consent, become subject to, or consent or agree to or
otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement, condition,
understanding, agreement or order of a Governmental Entity to sell, hold
separate, dispose of any assets or conduct or change its business unless such
requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or order is binding on the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or on Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates, as the case may be, only in the event the Closing occurs.

 

(e) Subject to the obligations under _Section 5.4(d)_, (i) if any
Governmental Entity issues an order, decree, injunction or ruling or takes
any other action enjoining or otherwise preventing the consummation of the
Offer or the Merger, or (ii) if any other administrative or judicial action or
proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental
Entity or private party that challenges, or seeks to prohibit, prevent or
restrict the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated hereby,
then (x) at their sole cost and expense, Parent and the Purchaser shall (1)
use commercially reasonable efforts to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any such order, decree, injunction or ruling and (2) defend,
contest and resist any such action or proceeding, and (y) each of Parent, the
Purchaser and the Company shall cooperate in a commercially reasonable manner
with each other in connection therewith.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or the Purchaser, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the Company prior
to the consummation of the Offer. Prior to the consummation of the Offer, the
Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its operations.

5.5 _Certain Notices_.

 

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, each
party hereto shall promptly notify the other party hereto of (i) the
occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that would be likely to cause any
condition to the obligations of any party to effect the Offer, the Merger or
any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied
or (ii) the failure of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to comply
with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which would reasonably be expected
to result in any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the
Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement not
to be satisfied; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this Section 5.5 shall not cure any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or otherwise limit
or affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

 



40 (b) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the
Company agrees to provide Parent with: (i) advance written notice of the
Companys intent to submit a major amendment to or resubmission of (as those
terms are used in 21 C.F.R. 314.60) NDA Number 202-363 (a " _Major Amendment_
") at least 20 Business Days prior to the date that the Company submits such
Major Amendment to the extent such Major Amendment is reasonably expected to
delay the timeline for FDA review of the NDA in accordance with 21 C.F.R.
314.60; (ii) a copy of such Major Amendment at least five Business Days prior
to submission to the FDA; (iii) except as may be prohibited by any
Governmental Entity or by any Law, any communications with the FDA with
respect to the Levadex Product that may reasonably be deemed to impact or
potentially impact, in any material respect, the Levadex Product or the FDA
Approval, including any communication that is reasonably expected to delay the
timeline for FDA review of the NDA in accordance with 21 C.F.R. 314.60; and
(iv) a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any Major Amendment
(such review and comment to occur within the five Business Day period after
Parents receipt of such Major Amendment as contemplated in clause (ii)) and
on any communication or proposed response to any communication with the FDA
referenced in clause (iii).

(c) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the
Company agrees to provide Parent with advance written notice of the Companys
intent to enter into or amend any material supply or manufacturing Contracts
at least ten Business Days prior to entering into or amending such Contracts.

5.6 _Public Announcements_. Each of the Company, Parent and the
Purchaser agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the
prior written consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as such release or announcement may
be required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable
United States securities exchange or regulatory or governmental body to which
the relevant party is subject, in which case the party required to make the
release or announcement shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow
each other party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in
advance of such issuance. The Company, Parent and the Purchaser agree that
the press release announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement
shall be a joint release of, and shall not be issued prior to the approval of
each of, the Company and Parent.

 

5.7 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

(a) From and after the Closing Date, and subject to the provisions of this
_Section 5.7_, Parent shall provide Company Employees who remain employed by
Parent following the Closing Date compensation opportunities and types of
benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate (excluding equity-
based compensation) to those provided to similarly situated employees of
Parent, pursuant to compensation and benefit plans sponsored by Parent or its
affiliates (" _Parent Benefit Plans_ "). Except as expressly provided herein,
nothing herein is intended to limit the right of Parent, Purchaser, or the
Surviving Corporation to (A) terminate the employment of any Company Employee
at any time, (B) change or modify any incentive compensation or employee
benefit plan or arrangement at any time and in any manner, or (C) change or
modify the terms or conditions of employment for any of their employees.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 5.7(a)_ to the contrary, the Company
shall, upon Parents written request delivered not less than fifteen days
before the Closing Date, terminate the Companys qualified defined
contribution retirement plan (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") effective as of
the day before the Closing Date (the " _Plan Termination Date_ "). In the
event of such request, (i) the Company shall amend the Company 401(k) Plan
and/or take such other action as is necessary so that the account balances of
affected participants shall become fully vested and non-forfeitable to the
extent required under applicable Law as of the Plan Termination Date, (ii) all
employee and employer contributions under the Company 401(k) Plan shall cease
of the Plan Termination Date, and (iii) the trustee of the Company 401(k)
plan shall not accept contributions to the Company 401(k) Plan other than
contributions made on behalf of participants that are based on compensation
earned prior to the Plan Termination Date and repayments of participant
loans. In the event the Company terminates the

 



41  Company 401(k) Plan pursuant to Parents written request, Parent agrees to
accept the individual employee-requested rollovers of 401(k) account balances
(including outstanding loans) from Company Employees into Parents defined
contribution retirement plan.

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, recognize all
service of the Company Employees with the Company or a Company Subsidiary for
purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate, and level of benefits under
all Parent Benefit Plans in which such Company Employees may be eligible to
participate after the Closing Date, including, but not limited to accrual of
vacation using Parents vacation policy, _except that_ prior service with the
Company or a Company Subsidiary shall not be recognized for purposes
of eligibility to receive the employer contribution (other than any employer
matching contributions) into the defined contribution retirement plan or
tuition reimbursement sponsored by Parent. In addition, for purposes of each
Parent Benefit Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision
benefits, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements (except for life, disability and accidental
death and dismemberment insurances) of such Parent Benefit Plan to be waived
for the Company Employees and their covered dependents, and Parent shall cause
any eligible expenses incurred by any Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents prior to such Covered Employees participation in the
corresponding Parent Benefit Plan to be taken into account under such Parent
Benefit Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible and maximum out-of-
pocket requirements for the applicable plan year, in each case as permitted by
the terms and conditions of the Parent Benefit Plans.

(d) From and after the Acceptance Time, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, will, and Parent will cause the Company or the
Surviving Corporation to, honor, in accordance with their terms, all
individual employment, severance and change of control agreements between the
Company and any Company Employee, including bonuses and/or incentive
compensation in existence on the date hereof, unless such agreements are
superseded by agreements with Parent.

(e) This _Section 5.7_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 5.7_,
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person (including
but not limited to Company Employees) any rights or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 5.7_.

 

(f) If the Company enters into additional Company Compensation Arrangements
after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, in compliance with the
terms of this Agreement, the Compensation Committee of the Company Board shall
promptly approve each Company Compensation Arrangement as an "employment
compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement" within the
meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under the Exchange Act and take all other action
necessary to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe-harbor with
respect to such Company Compensation Arrangements in accordance with
Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act.

5.8 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless all past and
present directors, officers and employees of the Company to the same extent
such Persons are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the Company
pursuant to applicable Law, the Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws
and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this
Agreement with any directors, officers and employees of the Company arising
out of acts or omissions in their capacity as directors, officers or employees
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall advance expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in the defense of any
claims, action, suit, proceeding or investigation with respect to the matters
subject to indemnification pursuant to this _Section 5.8(a)_ in accordance
with the procedures set forth in the Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws
and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the

 



42  director, officer or employee of the Company to whom expenses are advanced
undertakes to repay such advanced expenses to Parent and the Surviving
Corporation within five Business Days if it is ultimately determined that
such director, officer or employee is not entitled to indemnification pursuant
to this _Section 5.8(a)_.

(b) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
to contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors, officers and
employees of the Company for periods at or prior to the Effective Time than
are currently set forth in the Company Certificate and the Company
Bylaws. Parent shall cause the indemnification agreements, if any, in
existence on the date of this Agreement with any of the directors, officers or
employees of the Company to continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms following the Effective Time.

(c) For six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain for the benefit of the Companys directors
and officers, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Effective Time,
an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events
occurring prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is
substantially equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the
aggregate than the Companys existing policy (true and complete copies which
have been previously provided to Parent) or, if substantially equivalent
insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an
annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the last annual
premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement. The provisions of the
immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if
prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, which
policies provide such directors and officers with coverage for an aggregate
period of six years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
occurred on or before the Effective Time, including in respect of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If such prepaid policies have
been obtained prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue
to honor the obligations thereunder.

 

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper
provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or
entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.8_.

(e) The obligations under this _Section 5.8_ shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this
_Section 5.8_ applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee (it
being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this _Section 5.8_
applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.8_).

 

5.9 _State Takeover Laws_. The Company and the Company Board shall take no
action to cause any "control share acquisition", "fair price", "business
combination" or other anti-takeover Law to become applicable to the Company,
Parent, the Purchaser, the Offer, the Merger, the Top-Up Option or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and, if any such Law
becomes or is deemed to be applicable to the Company, Parent or the Purchaser,
the Offer, the Merger, the Top-Up Option or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the acquisition of Shares pursuant
thereto, or the Support Agreements or any other transaction contemplated by
this Agreement, then the Company and the Company Board shall take all action
necessary to render such Law inapplicable to the foregoing. 

5.10 _Parent Agreement Concerning the Purchaser_. Parent agrees to cause the
Purchaser to comply with its obligations under this Agreement.

5.11 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board, or
an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a
resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so

 



43  that the disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a
covered Person of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder (" _Section 16_ ") of Shares or
Company Options pursuant to this Agreement, and the Offer and the Merger shall
be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16\.

requisite vote of the stockholders of the Company, if required by applicable
Law.

(b) The Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall

set forth in this Agreement or based on fraud.

termination fee of $36,000,000 (the " _Breakup Fee_ "). 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
7.1(g)_, and prior to the date of termination of this Agreement an

management of the Company or the Company Board, and on or prior to the first
anniversary of the termination of this Agreement (i) such Acquisition Proposal
is consummated, (ii) the Company enters into a definitive written agreement
providing for the consummation of such Acquisition Proposal and
such Acquisition Proposal is subsequently consummated (whether consummated
before or after such anniversary), or (iii) the Company Board recommends or
submits an Acquisition Proposal to its stockholders for adoption and such
transaction is subsequently consummated (whether consummated before or after
such anniversary), which, in the cases of clauses (i) through (iii), need not
be the same Acquisition Proposal that shall have been made, publicly disclosed
or communicated prior to termination hereof, then, concurrent with such
consummation, the Company shall pay Parent the Breakup Fee (provided, that for
purposes of this _Section 7.2(c)_, the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have
the meaning assigned to such term in _Section 8.4_, except that the

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) without these agreements,
Parent, the Purchaser and the Company would not enter into this Agreement and

reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and the Purchaser in the
circumstances in which such Breakup Fee is payable for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise
be impossible to calculate with precision. If the Company fails promptly to
pay the amounts due pursuant to this _Section 7.2_, and in order to obtain
such payment, Parent or its designee commences a suit that results in a
judgment against the Company for all or a portion of the Breakup Fee, the
Company shall pay to Parent or its designees interest on such amount or
amounts from the date such payment was required to be made until the payment
date at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A., in effect on the date such payment
was required to be made.

7.3 _Amendment_. Subject to Section 1.3(c), this Agreement may be amended by
the Company, Parent and the Purchaser by action taken by or on behalf of their
respective Boards of Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time;

Companys stockholders, no amendment may be made which, by Law or in
accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange, requires further
approval by such stockholders, without the approval of such stockholders in
accordance with applicable Law. This Agreement may not be amended except by
an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.

7.4  _Waiver_. Subject to _Section 1.3(c)_, at any time prior to the
Effective Time, Parent and the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand, may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other, (ii) waive any uncured breaches of
the representations and warranties of the other contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance by the other
with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that after any approval of this Agreement by the Companys
stockholders, there may not be any extension or waiver of this Agreement
which 

 



46  decreases the Merger Consideration or which adversely affects the rights of
the Companys stockholders hereunder without the approval of such
stockholders. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound
thereby, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict
compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.

of this Agreement.

8.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in

 



56  good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

8.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits, Parent
Disclosure Schedules and Company Disclosure Schedules and the other documents
delivered pursuant hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the
entire agreement of the parties and supersede all prior agreements and
undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof and, except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, are not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights
or remedies hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the purpose of
clarification, nothing in this Agreement is intended, nor shall it be deemed
or construed, to modify or affect the provisions of that certain Collaboration
Agreement or that certain Co-Promotion Agreement, each among Parent,
the Company and Allergan USA, Inc., and dated January 28, 2011.

8.9 _Assignment_. The Agreement shall not be assigned by any party by
operation of Law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other
parties, provided that Parent or the Purchaser may assign any of their
respective rights and obligations to any direct or indirect Subsidiary of
Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent or the Purchaser, as the
case may be, of its obligations hereunder.

8.10 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective successors and
assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement except for the individuals
referenced in _Section 5.8_.

8.11 _Mutual Drafting; Interpretation_. Each party hereto has participated in
the drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of
extensive negotiations between the parties. If an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the
singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine gender
shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender
shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall
include masculine and feminine genders. As used in this Agreement, the words
"include" and "including," and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be
terms of limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this
Agreement to "Sections," "Exhibits," "Annexes" and "Schedules" are intended
to refer to Sections of this Agreement and Exhibits, Annexes and Schedules to
this Agreement. All references in this Agreement to "$" are intended to refer
to U.S. dollars. Unless otherwise specifically provided for herein, the term
"or" shall not be deemed to be exclusive.

8.12 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury_.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to laws that may be
applicable under conflicts of laws principles (whether of the State of

Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware (or another Delaware State court if the
Court of Chancery lacks jurisdiction), or Federal court of the United States
of America, sitting in Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, in
any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
agreements delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating
thereto, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i)
agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding except in such courts,
(ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be
heard and determined in such

 



57  Delaware State court or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal
court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do
so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue
of any such action or proceeding in any such Delaware State or Federal court
and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any
such Delaware State or Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a
final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to
service of process in the manner provided for notices in _Section 8.3_.
Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement
to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
8.12(c)_.

 

8.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

8.14 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware (or another Delaware State court if the Court of Chancery
lacks jurisdiction), or Federal court of the United States of America, sitting
in Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.

8.15 _Non-Recourse_. Any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of,
or related to this Agreement may only be brought against Persons that are
expressly named as parties hereto, and then only with respect to the specific
obligations set forth herein. No former, current or future direct or indirect
equity holders, controlling Persons, stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, agents, affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners
or assignees of the Company, Parent or the Purchaser or any of their
respective affiliates shall have any liability or obligation for any of the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements, obligations or liabilities
of the Company, Parent or the Purchaser under this Agreement or of or for any
action, suit, arbitration, claim, litigation, investigation, or proceeding
based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby

liability, other Laws or otherwise and whether by piercing the corporate veil,
by a claim by or on behalf of a party hereto or another Person or otherwise.
