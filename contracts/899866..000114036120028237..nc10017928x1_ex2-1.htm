Section 2.05 __

 

 _Surrender and Payment_.

 


 

 

(a)

 

Prior to the First Effective Time, Parent and Bidco shall appoint a commercial
bank or trust company reasonably  acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange
Agent_ ") and enter into an exchange agent agreement with the Exchange Agent
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ ") for
the purpose of exchanging (i) Certificates  or (ii) Uncertificated Shares for
the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock. As of the First Effective Time, in consideration of and in exchange for
the issuance to Parent by Bidco of 1,900 shares of common  stock of Bidco and
the Cancellation, Parent shall allot Parent Ordinary Shares which may be
represented in uncertificated form in CREST or American depositary receipts
evidencing (or evidence of Parent ADSs in book-entry form representing) the 
Parent ADSs issuable pursuant to _Section 2.03(a)_. As of the First Effective
Time, Parent (in the case of (x)) and Parent or Bidco (in the case of (y))
shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, for the
benefit of the  holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in
accordance with this _Section 2.05_ through the Exchange Agent, (x) American
depositary receipts evidencing (or evidence of Parent ADSs in book-entry form
representing) the Parent  ADSs issuable pursuant to _Section 2.03(a)_ __ in
exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and (y) cash
sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration payable pursuant to
_Section 2.03(a)_. Parent agrees to make  available, directly or indirectly,
to the Exchange Agent from time to time as needed additional cash sufficient
to pay any dividends or other distributions to which such holders are entitled
pursuant to _Section 2.05(f)_ and cash in lieu of  any fractional Parent ADSs
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.09_. Promptly after
the First Effective Time (and in no event more than two Business Days
following the Closing Date), Parent shall send, or shall cause the  Exchange
Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company Common Stock at the First
Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall be in a
form reasonably acceptable to the Company and substantially finalized prior to
the  First Effective Time and which shall specify that (A) delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only on proper delivery of
the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange
Agent) for use in such  exchange and (B) each holder of shares of Company
Common Stock may elect to receive a number of Parent Ordinary Shares in lieu
of Parent ADSs as Share Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.05(g)_. All
certificates (or evidence of Parent ADSs  in book-entry form) and cash
deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this _Section 2.05_ shall be
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Exchange Fund_ ". Parent shall cause,
or shall procure that Bidco cause, the Exchange Agent to  deliver the Merger
Consideration contemplated to be issued or paid pursuant to this _Article II_
out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the  Exchange
Fund as directed by Parent or Bidco; _provided_ , that such cash shall only be
invested in the manner provided in the Exchange Agent Agreement; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect  the
Merger Consideration payable to holders of Company Common Stock entitled to
receive such consideration or cash in lieu of fractional interests and, to the
extent necessary to pay the Merger Consideration, Parent shall promptly cause,
or shall  procure that Bidco cause, to be provided additional funds to the
Exchange Agent for the benefit of holders of Company Common Stock entitled to
receive such consideration in the amount of any such losses. Any interest and
other income resulting  from such investments shall be the property of, and
paid to, Parent on termination of the Exchange Fund.

 

 

23  

(b)

 

Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into
the right to receive the Merger  Consideration shall be entitled to receive,
on (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a
properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of
an "agent's message" by the Exchange Agent (or such  other evidence, if any,
of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a
book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in
respect of each share of the Company Common Stock represented by such 
Certificate or Uncertificated Share (including cash in lieu of any fractional
Parent ADSs and any dividends and distributions with respect to the Share
Consideration as contemplated by _Section 2.05(f)_ and _Section 2.09_ ). The
Parent  ADSs constituting the Share Consideration, at Parent's option, shall
be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical American depository
receipt evidencing such Parent ADSs is requested by a holder of shares of
Company Common Stock or is  otherwise required under Applicable Law.

 


 

 

(c)

 

If any portion of the Merger Consideration (or cash in lieu of any fractional
Parent ADSs or any dividends and  distributions with respect to the Share
Consideration as contemplated by _Section 2.05(f)_ and _Section 2.09_ ) is to
be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated  Share is registered, it shall
be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such
Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the  Person
requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any stamp duty, stamp
duty reserve tax, transfer or similar Taxes required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated  Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such stamp duty, stamp duty reserve tax, transfer or similar Taxes have
been paid or are not payable.

 


 

 

(d)

 

From and after the First Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company  Common Stock thereafter on
the records of the Company. If, after the First Effective Time, Certificates
or Uncertificated Shares are presented to Parent, the First Surviving
Corporation, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent for any reason, 
they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration (and cash
in lieu of any fractional Parent ADSs and any dividends and distributions with
respect to the Share Consideration as contemplated by _Section 2.05(f)_ and
_Section     2.09_ ) with respect thereto in accordance with the
procedures set forth in, or as otherwise contemplated by, this _Article II_
(including this _Section 2.05_ ).

 

 

24  

(e)

 

Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock 12 months  following the Closing Date shall be
delivered to Parent or as otherwise instructed by Parent, and any such holder
who has not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this _Section 2.05_ prior  to that time
shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration
(and cash in lieu of any fractional Parent ADSs and any dividends and
distributions with respect to the Share Consideration as contemplated by
_Section  2.05(f)_ and _Section 2.09_ ), without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and its Subsidiaries (including Bidco,
the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries) shall not be liable to any holder
of shares of Company  Common Stock for any amounts properly paid to a public
official in compliance with applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common
Stock immediately prior to such time  when the amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to
the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear
of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled  thereto.

 


 

 

(f)

 

Following the surrender of any Certificates, along with the delivery of a
properly completed and duly executed letter  of transmittal, or the transfer
of any Uncertificated Shares, in each case as provided in this _Section 2.05_
, Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, without interest, to the Person in
whose name the Parent ADSs constituting the Share  Consideration have been
registered, (i) in connection with the payment of the Share Consideration, (x)
the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares to which such
Person is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.09_ , and (y) the  aggregate amount
of all dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such Parent
ADSs, with a record date on or after the First Effective Time that were paid
prior to the time of such surrender or transfer, and (ii) at the appropriate 
payment date after the payment of the Merger Consideration, the amount of all
dividends or other distributions payable with respect to whole Parent ADSs
constituting the Share Consideration with a record date on or after the First
Effective Time  and prior to the time of such surrender or transfer and with
a payment date subsequent to the time of such surrender or transfer. No
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent ADSs constituting the
Share Consideration, and no cash  payment in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to _Section 2.09_ , shall be paid to the holder of any Certificates
not surrendered or of any Uncertificated Shares not transferred until such
Certificates are surrendered and the holder thereof  delivers a properly
completed and duly executed letter of transmittal or such or Uncertificated
Shares are transferred, as the case may be, as provided in this _Section
2.05_.

 


 

 

(g)

 

Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 2.05_ to the contrary, Parent shall
cooperate with the Exchange Agent  and ADS Depository, as necessary, to
provide for (i) the ability of holders of Company Common Stock to elect to
receive Parent Ordinary Shares in lieu of Parent ADSs and (ii) the delivery of
such Parent Ordinary Shares in lieu of Parent ADSs as the  Share
Consideration (and in satisfaction of such obligation) to the extent elected
by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section
2.05(a)_. The number of Parent Ordinary Shares to be delivered in lieu of
Parent ADSs  shall be the number of underlying Parent Ordinary Shares
represented by such Parent ADSs, subject to the delivery of cash in lieu of
fractional Parent Ordinary Shares in accordance with this _Section 2.05_ and
_Section 2.09_ which  sections shall be applied mutatis mutandis with respect
to those holders of Company Common Stock that elect to receive Parent Ordinary
Shares in lieu of Parent ADSs.

 

 

25  

Section 2.06 __

 

 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock  that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the First Effective Time and that are held by a
stockholder who is entitled to demand, and properly demands, appraisal of such
shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the  provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL (such stockholders, the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ "
and, such shares of Company Common Stock, the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall
not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the  Merger
Consideration, but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the
fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL (and, at the First Effective Time, such Dissenting
Shares shall no  longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled
and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting
Shares in accordance with the  provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL), unless
and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
waived, withdrawn or lost rights to appraisal under the DGCL. If any
Dissenting Stockholders shall have failed to perfect  or shall have
effectively waived, withdrawn or lost such rights, the Dissenting Shares held
by such Dissenting Stockholder shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted into, as of the First Effective Time, and shall thereafter represent
only  the right to receive, the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section
2.03(a)_ (and cash in lieu of any fractional Parent ADSs and any dividends and
distributions with respect thereto as contemplated by _Section 2.05(f)_ and
_Section     2.09_ ), without interest, and immediately following such
cancellation shall be automatically cancelled and cease to exist. The Company
shall give Parent prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any
shares of Company Common Stock,  attempted withdrawals of such demands and
any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company
relating to stockholders' rights of appraisal in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, and Parent the  opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to all such
demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to, settle or offer or agree to settle
any such  demands. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to
the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.05_ to pay for shares of Company
Common Stock for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned
to Parent (or to  Bidco if Parent so directs) on demand.

 


 

 

Section 2.07

 

_Company Equity Awards._

 


 

 

(a)

 

_Company Stock Options_. At the First Effective Time, each compensatory option
to purchase shares of Company  Common Stock granted under any Company Stock
Plan that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the First
Effective Time (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ "), whether or not vested
shall, by virtue of the First Merger and without  further action on the part
of the holder thereof, be cancelled in consideration for the right to receive,
within five Business Days following the First Effective Time, the Merger
Consideration, without interest and less applicable withholding  Taxes, in
respect of each Net Option Share subject to such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the First Effective Time. For purposes of this Agreement,
" _Net Option Share_ " means, with respect to a Company Stock Option, the
quotient  obtained by dividing (i) the product obtained by multiplying (A)
the excess, if any, of the value of the Merger Consideration over the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the  First Effective Time by (B) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to
the First Effective Time by (ii) the value of the Merger Consideration. For
purposes of the preceding sentence, the  value of the component of the Merger
Consideration that consists of Parent ADSs shall equal the product of (x) the
Exchange Ratio and (y) the Parent ADS Price.

 

 

26  

(b) __

 

 _Company Restricted Stock Units_. At the First Effective Time, each
restricted stock unit award with respect to  shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding under any Company Stock Plan that vests solely based on the
passage of time (each, a " _Company RSU Award_ ") shall be treated as set
forth in this _Section 2.07_.

 


 

 

 

 

(i)

 

At the First Effective Time, each Company RSU Award held by a non-employee
director shall, by virtue of the First Merger and without further action on
the part of the  holder thereof, become fully vested and cancelled and
converted into the right to receive, within five Business Days following the
First Effective Time, the Merger Consideration, without interest and less
applicable withholding Taxes, with  respect to each share of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company RSU Award (or portion thereof) immediately prior
to the First Effective Time; _provided_ , that if  application of this
_Section 2.07(b)(i)_ to any such Company RSU Award (or portion thereof) would
result in the imposition of a penalty under Section 409A of the Code, then
such Company RSU Award (or portion thereof) shall instead be  converted into
an Assumed RSU Award in accordance with _Section 2.07(b)(ii)_.

 

 


 

 

 

 

 

(ii)

 

At the First Effective Time, each Company RSU Award (or portion thereof) that
is not covered by _Section 2.07(b)(i)_ shall be assumed by Parent and shall
be  converted into a restricted unit award (each, an " _Assumed RSU Award_ ")
that settles in a number of Parent ADSs equal to the number of shares of
Company Common Stock underlying  the Company RSU Award (or portion thereof)
_multiplied by_ the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest
whole number of shares. Each Assumed RSU Award shall  continue to have, and
shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the
corresponding Company RSU Award immediately prior to the First Effective Time
(including any terms and conditions relating to accelerated vesting on a 
termination of the holder's employment in connection with or following the
Merger).

 

 

 


 

 

(c)

 

_Company Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units_. At the First Effective
Time, each restricted stock unit  award with respect to shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding under any Company Stock Plan that vests based on the
achievement of performance goals (each, a " _Company PSU Award_ ") shall, by
virtue of the First Merger and without further  action on the part of the
holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and converted into a restricted unit
award (each, an " _Assumed PSU Award_ ") that settles in a number of Parent
ADSs equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common  Stock
underlying the Company PSU Award (with such number of shares determined by
deeming the applicable performance goals to be achieved at the greater of (i)
the target level and (ii) the actual level of achievement through the latest
practicable  date prior to the First Effective Time as determined by the
Leadership and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company
prior to the First Effective Time), subject to a limit of 175% of target for
Company PSU Awards granted in  2019 and subject to a limit of 150% of target
for Company PSU Awards granted in 2020 _multiplied by_ the Equity Award
Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole number of shares. Each Assumed

other similar anti-takeover laws and regulations of the State of Delaware,
including Section 203 of the DGCL, inapplicable to any Third Party or any
Company Acquisition Proposal.

 

 

70  

(b)

 

The foregoing notwithstanding, if at any time prior to the receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval (the " _Company     Approval Time_ "), the
Board of Directors of the Company receives a bona fide written Company
Acquisition Proposal made after the date of this Agreement that has not
resulted from a violation of this _Section     6.02_ , the Board of
Directors of the Company, directly or indirectly through its Representatives,
may (i) contact the Third Party that has made such Company Acquisition
Proposal in order to ascertain facts or clarify terms for the sole purpose 
of the Board of Directors of the Company informing itself about such Company
Acquisition Proposal and such Third Party and (ii) if the Board of Directors
of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisor and  outside legal counsel, that such Company Acquisition Proposal is
or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Superior Proposal, (A)
subject to compliance with this _Section 6.02_ , engage in negotiations or
discussions with such Third  Party and (B) furnish to such Third Party and
its Representatives and financing sources non-public information relating to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement
that (1) does not contain any provision that  would prevent the Company from
complying with its obligation to provide disclosure to Parent pursuant to this
_Section 6.02_ and (2) contains confidentiality and use provisions that, in
each case, are no less favorable in the aggregate to the  Company than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , that all such non-
public information (to the extent that such information has not been
previously provided or made available to Parent) is provided or made
available  to Parent, as the case may be, substantially concurrently with the
time it is provided or made available to such Third Party. Nothing contained
herein shall prevent the Board of Directors of the Company from (x) taking and
disclosing to the  stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under
the 1934 Act, or (y) making any required disclosure to the stockholders of the
Company if the Board of Directors of  the Company determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with Applicable Law;
_provided_ , that any such action or disclosure  that constitutes a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change shall be made in compliance with the applicable
provisions of this _Section 6.02_. A "stop, look and listen" disclosure
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the 1934 Act in connection with  a tender or
exchange offer shall not constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

 


 

 

(c)

 

The Company shall notify Parent as promptly as practicable (but in no event
later than 24 hours) after receipt by the  Company (or any of its
Representatives) of any Company Acquisition Proposal or any request for
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, to the
knowledge of the Company, has been or is reasonably likely to have been made 
in connection with any Company Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall be
provided in writing and shall identify the Third Party making, and the
material terms and conditions of, any such Company Acquisition Proposal or
request. The Company shall  thereafter (i) keep Parent reasonably informed,
on a reasonably current basis, of any material changes in the status and
details (or any changes to the type and amount of consideration) of any such
Company Acquisition Proposal or request and  (ii) as promptly as practicable
(but in no event later than 24 hours after receipt) provide to Parent copies
of any material written correspondence, proposals or indications of interest
relating to the terms and conditions of such Company  Acquisition Proposal or
request provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as written
summaries of any material oral communications relating to the terms and
conditions of any Company Acquisition Proposal).

 

 

71  

(d)

 

Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, prior to the
Company Approval Time, in response to a  Company Acquisition Proposal that
the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith constitutes a
Company Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company may, subject
to compliance with this _Section 6.02(d)_ , (i) make a  Company Adverse
Recommendation Change and/or (ii) terminate this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 10.01(d)(iii)_ ; _provided_ , that (A) the Company shall first notify
Parent in writing at least four Business Days before taking such  action that
the Company intends to take such action, which notice shall include an
unredacted copy of such proposal and a copy of any financing commitments (in
the form provided to the Company) relating thereto (and, to the extent not in
writing,  the material terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the
person making any such proposal), (B) the Company shall make its
Representatives reasonably available to negotiate with Parent and its
Representatives during such four Business Day  notice period, to the extent
Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose revisions to the terms
of this Agreement such that it would cause such Company Superior Proposal to
no longer constitute a Company Superior Proposal, (C) upon the  end of such
notice period, the Board of Directors of the Company shall have considered in
good faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement committed to in
writing by Parent, and shall have determined that the Company Superior
Proposal would  nevertheless continue to constitute a Company Superior
Proposal if the revisions committed to in writing by Parent were to be given
effect and (D) in the event of any change, from time to time, to any of the
financial terms or any other material  terms of such Company Superior
Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent an
additional notice consistent with that described in clause (A) of this proviso
and a new notice period under clause (A) of this proviso shall  commence each
time, except each such notice period shall be three Business Days (instead of
four Business Days), during which time the Company shall be required to comply
with the requirements of this _Section 6.02(d)_ anew with respect to  each
such additional notice, including clauses (A) through (D) above of this
proviso.

 


 

 

(e)

 

Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, at any time prior
to the Company Approval Time, the Board  of Directors of the Company may
effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response or relating to a
Company Intervening Event if the Board of Directors of the Company determines
in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal  counsel, that the
failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; _provided_ , that (i) the Company
shall first notify Parent in writing at least four Business Days  before
taking such action of its intention to take such action, which notice shall
include a reasonably detailed description of such Company Intervening Event,
(ii) if requested by Parent, the Company shall make its Representatives
reasonably  available to negotiate with Parent and its Representatives during
such four Business Day period following such notice regarding any proposal by
Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement in response to such Company
Intervening Event, and (iii) the  Board of Directors of the Company shall not
effect any Company Adverse Recommendation Change involving or relating to a
Company Intervening Event unless, after the four Business Day period described
in the foregoing clause (ii), the Board of  Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and taking into account any written commitment by Parent to amend the terms of
this Agreement during such four Business Day period, that the  failure to
take such action would continue to be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.

 

 

72  

(f)

 

The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and  its Subsidiaries' Representatives
to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing
discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party conducted prior to
or ongoing as of the date of this Agreement with respect to any  actual or
potential (including if such discussions or negotiations were for the purpose
of soliciting any) Company Acquisition Proposal or with respect to any
indication, proposal or inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Company  Acquisition Proposal and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause any such Third Party (and any of its Representatives) in possession of
confidential information about the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that was
furnished by or on behalf  of the Company in connection with such discussions
or negotiations to return or destroy all such information.

Agreement) or any other third party debt financing necessary or incurred by
Parent, any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or any Merger Sub to consummate

case that is customary for such offering or as otherwise necessary  to permit
the Company's independent accountants and/or auditors to issue customary
"comfort letters" to Parent's Financing Sources in connection with such
offering, including as to customary negative assurances required to consummate

(v)

three Business Days prior thereto);  provided that (A) neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have any obligation to make any payment in
respect of the foregoing unless and until the Closing occurs and it being
understood that at the Closing, Parent and its  Subsidiaries shall provide
the Company and its Subsidiaries with the funds necessary for the Company to
actually effect such payoff and termination and (B) no such action shall be
required unless it can be and is conditioned on the occurrence of  the
Closing, and

 

 


 

 

 

 

 

(viii)

Debt Financing effective prior to the Closing, pass resolutions or consents to
approve or authorize the execution of the Debt Financing, execute or deliver
any certificate, document, instrument or agreement  or agree to any change or
modification of any existing certificate, document, instrument or agreement,
in each case, that is effective prior to the Closing, or that would be

of its Subsidiaries to pay any commitment or other similar fee prior to the
Closing or incur any other expense, liability or obligation in connection with
the Debt  Financing prior to the Closing; (D) could reasonably be expected to
cause any director, officer or employee or stockholder of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to incur any personal liability in their capacity as such;
(E) conflict with the  organizational documents of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or any Applicable Law; or (F) could reasonably be expected to

or other obligor with respect to the Debt Financing.

 


 

 

(c)

 

Parent and Merger Subs shall, on a joint and several basis, promptly on
written request by the Company, reimburse the  Company for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees) incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with
the Debt Financing or satisfying its obligations under this _Section    
6.03_ , whether or not the Mergers are consummated or this Agreement is
terminated (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the costs of the
preparation of any annual or quarterly financial statements of the Company to
the extent prepared in the  ordinary course of its financial reporting
practice). Parent and Merger Subs shall, on a joint and several basis,
indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives from and against any and all  losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, reasonable out-of-pocket costs, reasonable out-of-pocket
attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement

information provided by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives in writing for use in connection with the Debt

reasonable out-of-pocket costs reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys' fees,
judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement  (including all
interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or
in respect of any thereof) arise out of or result from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Company or its Subsidiaries in fulfilling their 
obligations pursuant to this _Section 6.03_.

 

 

75  

(d)

 

Anything to the contrary in this Agreement notwithstanding,(i) the parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that the  provisions contained in this _Section
6.03_ represent the sole obligation of the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives with respect to cooperation in connection with the
arrangement of any financing (including the  Debt Financing) to be obtained
by Parent, Bidco or either Merger Sub with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and no other provision of this Agreement
(including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto) shall be deemed to expand or 
modify such obligations; (ii) the Company's breach of any of the covenants
required to be performed by it under this _Section 6.03_ shall not be
considered in determining the satisfaction of the condition set forth in
_Section 9.02(a)_   unless such breach is the primary cause of, or primarily
resulted in, Parent being unable to consummate the Mergers; and (iii) the
receipt and availability of any funds or financing is not a condition to
Closing under this Agreement nor is it a  condition to Closing under this
Agreement for Parent to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing or any
other financing.

 


 

 

(e)

 

All confidential information provided by Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives shall be kept  confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, except that Parent shall be permitted to disclose
such information as applicable to any number of Financing Sources as would be
reasonable and customary in connection with any  financing; _provided_ , that
all confidential information shared with Financing Sources shall be kept
confidential and otherwise treated in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement or other confidentiality obligations that are  substantially
similar to those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (which, with
respect to the Financing Sources, may be satisfied by the confidentiality
provisions applicable thereto under the Bridge Facility Agreement or other
customary  confidentiality undertakings in the context of customary
syndication practices from Financing Sources not party to the Bridge Facility
Agreement).

exchange offer shall not constitute a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change.

 


 

 

(c)

 

Parent shall notify the Company as promptly as practicable (but in no event
later than 24 hours) after receipt by  Parent (or any of its Representatives)
of any Parent Acquisition Proposal or any request for information relating to
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that, to the knowledge of Parent, has been
or is reasonably likely to have been made in  connection with any Parent
Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall be provided in writing and shall
identify the Third Party making, and the material terms and conditions of, any
such Parent Acquisition Proposal or request. Parent shall  thereafter (i)
keep the Company reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis, of any
material changes in the status and details (or any changes to the type and
amount of consideration) of any such Parent Acquisition Proposal or request
and  (ii) as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than 24 hours
after receipt) provide to the Company copies of any material written
correspondence, proposals or indications of interest relating to the terms and
conditions of such Parent  Acquisition Proposal or request provided to Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as written summaries of any material oral
communications relating to the terms and conditions of any Parent Acquisition
Proposal).

 

 

79  

(d)

 

Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, prior to the
Parent Approval Time, in response to a  Parent Acquisition Proposal that the
Board of Directors of Parent determines in good faith constitutes a Parent
Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of Parent may, subject to compliance
with this _Section 7.02_ , make a Parent Adverse  Recommendation Change;
_provided_ , that (A) Parent shall first notify the Company in writing at
least four Business Days before taking such action that Parent intends to take
such action, which notice shall include an unredacted copy of such  proposal
and a copy of any financing commitments (in the form provided to Parent)
relating thereto (and, to the extent not in writing, the material terms and
conditions thereof and the identity of the person making any such proposal),
(B) Parent  shall make its Representatives reasonably available to negotiate
with the Company and its Representatives during such four Business Day notice
period, to the extent the Company wishes to negotiate, to enable the Company
to propose revisions to the  terms of this Agreement such that it would cause
such Parent Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Parent Superior
Proposal, (C) upon the end of such notice period, the Board of Directors of
Parent shall have considered in good faith any  revisions to the terms of
this Agreement committed to in writing by the Company, and shall have
determined that the Parent Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue to
constitute a Parent Superior Proposal if the revisions committed to in 
writing by the Company were to be given effect and (D) in the event of any
change, from time to time, to any of the financial terms or any other material
terms of such Parent Superior Proposal, Parent shall, in each case, have
delivered to the  Company an additional notice consistent with that described
in clause (A) of this proviso and a new notice period under clause (A) of this
proviso shall commence each time, except each such notice period shall be
three Business Days (instead of  four Business Days), during which time
Parent shall be required to comply with the requirements of this _Section
7.02(d)_ anew with respect to each such additional notice, including clauses
(A) through (D) above of this proviso.

 


 

 

(e)

 

Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, at any time prior
to the Parent Approval Time, the Board  of Directors of Parent may effect a
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change in response or relating to a Parent
Intervening Event if the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the  failure
to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; _provided_ , that (i) Parent shall
first notify the Company in writing at least four Business Days before taking
such  action of its intention to take such action, which notice shall include
a reasonably detailed description of such Parent Intervening Event, (ii) if
requested by the Company, Parent shall make its Representatives reasonably
available to negotiate  with the Company and its Representatives during such
four Business Day period following such notice regarding any proposal by the
Company to amend the terms of this Agreement in response to such Parent
Intervening Event, and (iii) the Board of  Directors of Parent shall not
effect any Parent Adverse Recommendation Change involving or relating to a
Parent Intervening Event unless, after the four Business Day period described
in the foregoing clause (ii), the Board of Directors of Parent  determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and taking into
account any written commitment by the Company to amend the terms of this
Agreement during such four Business Day period, that the failure to take
such  action would continue to be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.

 


 

 

(f)

 

Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and its  Subsidiaries' Representatives
to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing
discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party conducted prior to
or ongoing as of the date of this Agreement with respect to any actual  or
potential (including if such discussions or negotiations were for the purpose
of soliciting any) Parent Acquisition Proposal or with respect to any
indication, proposal or inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Parent Acquisition  Proposal and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause any such Third Party (and any of its Representatives) in possession of
confidential information about Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that was
furnished by or on behalf of Parent in  connection with such discussions or
negotiations to return or destroy all such information.

Section 7.04 __

 

 _Director and Officer Liability_.

 


 

 

(a)

 

For a period of not less than six years from the First Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the First Surviving  Corporation and the Surviving Company or any
applicable Subsidiary thereof (collectively, the " _D andO Indemnifying
Parties_"), to the fullest extent each such DandO Indemnifying Party is
authorized or permitted by Applicable Law, to:  (i) indemnify and hold
harmless each person who is at the date of this Agreement, was previously, or
during the period from the date of this Agreement through the date of the
First Effective Time will be, serving as a director or officer of the 
Company (in the case of indemnification by the First Surviving Corporation and
the Surviving Company) or any of its Subsidiaries (in the case of
indemnification by such applicable Subsidiary) or, at the request or for the
benefit of the Company or  any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, as a
director, trustee or officer of any other entity or any benefit plan
maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be
(collectively, the " _D andO Indemnified Parties_"),     as now or hereafter
in effect, in connection with any DandO Claim and any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, Claim Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in
settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid  or
payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) relating to or
resulting from such DandO Claim; and (ii) promptly advance to such DandO
Indemnified Party any Claim Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a
witness with respect to  or otherwise participating with respect to any DandO
Claim in advance of the final disposition of such DandO Claim, including payment
on behalf of or advancement to the DandO Indemnified Party of any Claim Expenses
incurred by such DandO  Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any
rights with respect to such indemnification and/or advancement, in each case
without the requirement of any bond or other security, but subject to the DandO
Indemnifying Party's receipt of a  written undertaking by or on behalf of
such DandO Indemnified Party to repay such Claim Expenses if it is ultimately
determined under Applicable Law that such DandO Indemnified Party is not
entitled to be indemnified. All rights to  indemnification and advancement
conferred hereunder shall continue as to a Person who has ceased to be a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the date
of this Agreement and shall inure to the benefit of such Person's  heirs,
successors, executors and personal and legal representatives. As used in this
_Section 7.04_ : (x) the term " _D andO Claim_" means any threatened, asserted,
pending or completed claim, action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or 
investigation, whether instituted by any party hereto, any Governmental
Authority or any other Person, whether civil, criminal, administrative,
investigative or other, including any arbitration or other alternative dispute
resolution mechanism,  arising out of or pertaining to matters that relate to
such DandO Indemnified Party's duties or service (A) as a director, officer or
employee of the Company or the applicable Subsidiary thereof at or prior to
the First Effective Time (including  with respect to any acts, facts, events
or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement, the
Mergers or the consummation of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the consideration and approval  thereof and the process
undertaken in connection therewith and any DandO Claim relating thereto) or (B)
as a director, trustee, officer or employee of any other entity or any benefit
plan maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (for  which such
DandO Indemnified Party is or was serving at the request or for the benefit of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) at or prior to the First Effective
Time; and (y) the term " _Claim Expenses_ " means reasonable out-of-pocket 
attorneys' fees and all other reasonable out-of-pocket costs, expenses and
obligations (including experts' fees, travel expenses, court costs, retainers,
transcript fees, legal research, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as
well as  telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in
connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating
in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness in
or participate in  (including on appeal) any DandO Claim for which
indemnification is authorized pursuant to this _Section 7.04(a)_ , including
any action relating to a claim for indemnification or advancement brought by a
DandO Indemnified Party. No  DandO Indemnifying Party shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any actual or threatened DandO Claim in
respect of which indemnification has been sought by such DandO Indemnified Party
hereunder unless such  settlement, compromise or judgment includes an
unconditional release of such DandO Indemnified Party from all liability arising
out of such DandO Claim, or such DandO Indemnified Party consents thereto. Parent
shall guarantee the foregoing  obligations of the DandO Indemnifying Parties.

 

 

81  

(b)

 

Without limiting the foregoing, Parent agrees that all rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and  exculpation from liabilities
for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the First Effective Time now
existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers or employees of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as provided in the  Company
Organizational Documents, similar organizational documents of the Company's
Subsidiaries and indemnification agreements of the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall survive the Mergers and shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance  with their terms. For a period of not less than six
years from the First Effective Time, Parent shall cause the organizational
documents of the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions
no less favorable with respect to  indemnification, advancement of expenses
and limitations on liability of directors and officers than are set forth in
the Company Organizational Documents, which provisions shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified for a period of at  least six years from the
First Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights
thereunder of any individuals who, at or prior to the First Effective Time,
were directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its 
Subsidiaries. The Company may purchase (and pay in full the aggregate premium
for) a six-year prepaid "tail" insurance policy (which policy by its express
terms shall survive the Mergers) of at least the same coverage and amounts and
containing  terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the covered
individuals as the Company's and its Subsidiaries' existing directors' and
officers' insurance policy or policies with a claims period of six years from
the First Effective Time for  DandO Claims arising from facts, acts, events or
omissions that occurred on or prior to the First Effective Time; _provided_ ,
that the premium for such tail policy shall not exceed three hundred percent
of the aggregate annual amounts  currently paid by the Company and its
Subsidiaries for such insurance (such amount being the " _Maximum Premium_ ").
If the Company fails to obtain such tail policy prior to the First Effective
Time, Parent or the Surviving Company shall obtain  such a tail policy;
_provided_ , that the premium for such tail policy shall not exceed the
Maximum Premium; _provided_ , _further_ , that if such tail policy cannot be
obtained or can be obtained only by paying aggregate annual  premiums in
excess of the Maximum Premium, Parent, the Company or the Surviving Company
shall only be required to obtain as much coverage as can be obtained by paying
an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium. Parent and the Surviving
Company  shall cause any such policy (whether obtained by Parent, the Company
or the Surviving Company) to be maintained in full force and effect, for its
full term, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to honor all its
obligations thereunder.

 


 

 

(c)

 

If any of Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or  merges with or into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving company, partnership or
other Person of such consolidation or merger or (ii) liquidates, dissolves or
winds-up, or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of  its properties
and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company,
as applicable, assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.04_.

 


 

 

Section 7.05

 

_Employee Matters_.

 


 

 

(a)

 

From the Closing Date through the date that is 12 months following the Closing
Date (the " _Benefits Continuation  Period_ "), the Surviving Company shall
provide, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to provide, to each
individual who is employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the First Effective Time, while such  individual continues to be
employed by the Surviving Company, Parent or any of Parent's Subsidiaries
(including Subsidiaries of the Surviving Company) during the Benefits
Continuation Period (collectively, the " _Affected Employees_ ") (i) a  base
salary or wage rate that is not less than the base salary or wage rate
provided to such Affected Employee immediately prior to the First Effective
Time, (ii) cash and equity incentive compensation opportunities that are in
the aggregate no  less favorable than the aggregate cash and equity incentive
compensation opportunities provided to such Affected Employee immediately
prior to the First Effective Time, and (iii) employee benefits that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate  to the employee benefits provided
to such Affected Employee under the Company Employee Plans immediately prior
to the First Effective Time; _provided_ , however, that no retention, change-
in control or other special or non-recurring  compensation or benefits
provided prior to the First Effective Time shall be taken into account for
purposes of this covenant.

 


 

 

(b)

 

With respect to any employee benefit plan in which any Affected Employee first
becomes eligible to participate on or  after the First Effective Time (the "
_New Company Plans_ "), Parent shall: (i) use commercially reasonable efforts
to waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements  applicable to such
Affected Employee under any New Company Plan that is a health or welfare plan
in which such Affected Employee may be eligible to participate after the First
Effective Time to the extent satisfied or waived under a comparable  Company
Employee Plan, (ii) recognize service of Affected Employees (to the extent
credited by the Company or its Subsidiaries in any comparable Company Employee
Plan) accrued prior to the First Effective Time for all purposes under (but
not for  the purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension
plan) any New Company Plan in which such Affected Employees may be eligible to
participate after the First Effective Time, _provided_ , _  however_ , that
in no event shall any credit be given to the extent it would result in the
duplication of benefits for the same period of service, and (iii) if
applicable, use commercially reasonable  efforts to cause to be credited, in
any New Company Plan that is a health plan in which Affected Employees
participate, any deductibles or out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such
Affected Employee and such Affected Employee's beneficiaries and  dependents
during the portion of the calendar year in which such Affected Employee first
becomes eligible for the New Company Plan that occurs prior to such Affected
Employee's commencement of participation in such New Company Plan with the 
objective that there be no double counting during the first year of
eligibility of such deductibles or out-of-pocket expenses.

 

 

82  

(c)

 

The Company may provide to each employee who, immediately prior to the First
Effective Time, is employed by the  Company or a Subsidiary thereof and is
eligible to participate in an annual bonus program of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries a pro-rated portion of the annual bonus with respect to the
portion of the year of the Closing that occurs prior to  the Closing, which
bonus shall be determined based on actual performance through the latest
practicable date prior to the Closing Date, as determined by the Company prior
to the First Effective Time.

 


 

 

(d)

 

Nothing contained in this _Section 7.05_ or elsewhere in this Agreement,
express or implied (i) shall cause  either Parent or any of its Affiliates to
be obligated to continue to employ any Person, including any Affected
Employees, for any period of time following the First Effective Time, (ii)
shall prevent Parent or its Affiliates from revising,  amending or
terminating any Company Employee Plan, Parent Employee Plan or any other
employee benefit plan, program or policy in effect from time to time, (iii)
shall be construed as an amendment of any Company Employee Plan, Parent
Employee Plan  or any other employee benefit plan, program or policy in
effect from time to time, or (iv) shall create any third-party beneficiary
rights in any director, officer, employee or individual Person, including any
present or former employee, officer,  director or individual independent
contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including any
beneficiary or dependent of such individual).

(a)

 

Each of Parent, Bidco and each Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts,
and shall cause their respective  Subsidiaries to use reasonable best
efforts, to take or shall cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause
to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to maintain the
commitments under and to consummate the Debt Financing and obtain  the
proceeds thereof (including for the avoidance of doubt, the Bridge Facility
Agreement or any replacement financing ( _provided_ , that (i) the conditions
to the availability of any such replacement financing shall not be materially
less  favorable to Parent than those of the Bridge Facility Agreement and
(ii) the other terms of such replacement financing shall not be materially
less favorable to Parent than those of the Bridge Facility Agreement in any
manner that materially  adversely affects the ability or likelihood of
Parent, Bidco or either Merger Sub from timely consummating the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement)) in an amount sufficient, together with other
funds available to the Parent and its  Subsidiaries, to enable Parent or
Bidco to pay in cash the Required Financing Amount at the Closing.

 

 

83  

(b)

 

(i) From time to time, upon the written request of the Company, Parent shall
inform the Company in reasonable detail  on the status of its efforts to
arrange the Debt Financing and (ii) Parent shall give the Company prompt
written notice of (A) any termination of the Bridge Facility Agreement (other
than any termination in connection with a replacement financing  thereof),
(B) the receipt of any notice or other communication from any Financing Source
with respect to such Financing Source's failure or anticipated failure to fund
its commitments under any definitive agreements relating to the Debt
Financing  (other than in connection with a replacement lender assuming the
commitments of a defaulting lender pursuant to the documentation related to
the applicable Debt Financing), (C) any material default or material breach by
any party to the Debt  Financing of which Parent, Bidco or either Merger Sub
has become aware (other than in connection with a replacement lender assuming
the commitments of a defaulting lender pursuant to the documentation related
to the applicable Debt Financing) and  (D) any condition precedent of the
Debt Financing as to which Parent, Bidco or either Merger Sub believes will
not be satisfied at Closing.

 


 

 

(c)

 

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent, Bidco, and
each Merger Sub acknowledge and agree  that the receipt and availability of
any funds or financing is not a condition to Closing under this Agreement nor
is it a condition to Closing under this Agreement for Parent to obtain all or
any portion of the Debt Financing or any other  financing.

 


 

 

Section 7.07

 

_CVR Agreement_. From and after the First Effective Time, Parent shall
expressly assume in writing all of the  First Surviving Corporation's

agreement and  Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-8 for avoiding the
recognition of gain). In rendering such opinion, Company Tax Counsel may rely
on the Parent Tax Certificate, the Company Tax Certificate and such other
information provided to it by Parent  and/or the Company for purposes of

sole and exclusive remedy of the receiving party against the paying party and
its Subsidiaries and their respective former, current or future partners,
equityholders, managers, members, Affiliates and  Representatives, and none
of the paying party, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
former, current or future partners, equityholders, managers, members,
Affiliates or Representatives shall have any further liability or obligation,
in  each case relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) if (A) Parent, Bidco or either

this Agreement and thereafter  Parent receives a Company Payment pursuant to
this _Section 10.03_ or (B) the Company receives any payments from Parent,

thereafter the Company receives the Parent  Termination Payment, the amount
of such Company Termination Payment or such Parent Termination Payment, as
applicable, shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of such payments made by
the party paying the Company Payment or the Parent Termination  Payment, as
applicable, in respect of any such breaches (in each case, after taking into
account any Parent Additional Amounts or Company Additional Amounts, as
applicable). The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
_Section  10.03_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
hereby, that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this

constitute a  penalty. Accordingly, if any party fails to promptly pay any
Company Payment or the Parent Termination Payment due pursuant to this
_Section 10.03_ , such party shall also pay any out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (together with any  irrecoverable VAT incurred thereon, and
including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by the party entitled
to such payment in connection with a legal action to enforce this Agreement
that results in a judgment for such amount against the  party failing to
promptly pay such amount. Any Company Payment or Parent Termination Payment
not paid when due pursuant to this _Section 10.03_ shall bear interest from
the date such amount is due until the date paid at a rate equal to the  prime
rate as published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition in effect on the
date of such payment.

(h)

 

The Parent Termination Payment and the Company Termination Payment (in each
case if any) shall be VAT inclusive.

 


 

 

(i)

 

The parties hereto intend that any payment of a Parent Termination Payment,
being compensatory in nature, shall not  be treated (in whole or in part) as
consideration for a supply for the purposes of VAT and, accordingly, Parent
shall:

 


 

 

 

 

(i)

 

file its relevant VAT return on the basis that the payment of any such Parent
Termination Payment falls outside the scope of VAT; and

 

 


 

 

 

 

 

(ii)

 

pay the full amount of any such Parent Termination Payment free and clear of
any deduction or adjustment on account of VAT,

 

 

 


 

 

it being understood and agreed that if it is finally determined that the
Parent Termination Payment is (in whole or in part) consideration for a
supply  for the purposes of VAT then:

 


 

 

 

 

(A)

 

Parent shall (1) subject to having received the relevant amount from the
Company as provided in sub-clause (C) below, promptly account for and pay to
HMRC such VAT  together with any associated interest and penalties; and (2)
use its reasonable best efforts to recover (by refund, credit or otherwise)
any such VAT at the residual recovery rate generally applied by Parent in
respect of input VAT incurred on  its overheads from time to time;

 

 


 

 

 

 

 

(B)

 

the amount of the Parent Termination Payment payable by Parent shall be
reduced so that the sum of (1) the Parent  Termination Payment (as so
reduced) and (2) any VAT reverse charge thereon that Parent certifies acting
in good faith that it is not entitled to recover (by way of credit or
repayment) as input tax (together with any related interest or penalties  in
respect of such VAT reverse charge but excluding any interest or penalties
arising as a result of the unreasonable delay or default of Parent), is equal
to the amount of the Parent Termination Payment that would be payable but for
this  subclause (B) (the amount of such reduction being the " _Adjustment
Amount_ "); and

 

 


 

 

 

 

 

(C)

 

the Company covenants to pay to Parent on written demand and  on an after-Tax
basis an amount equal to the Adjustment Amount save to the extent that such
Adjustment Amount has previously been adjusted by way of refund of such part
of the Parent Termination Payment, the due date for payment of which shall
be  five Business Days after the date such written demand is received by the
Company.

 

 


 

 

 

This section 10.03(i) is subject to the provisions of Section 10.03(i) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule.

 


 

 

(j)

 

Any reference in _Section 10.03(i)_ or _Section 10.03(i)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule to Parent  shall where applicable be regarded as
referring to the representative member of any VAT group of which Parent is a
member, and " _finally determined_ " shall mean determined by HMRC or, if such
determination is appealed, a court or tribunal in a  decision or judgment in
respect of which no right of appeal exists (or in relation to which any
periods for appeal have expired) or, whether or not such determination is
appealed, as provided in a binding agreement made with HMRC.

 


 

 

(k)

 

The parties anticipate that any Company Payment shall be outside the scope of
UK VAT and not otherwise subject to  VAT.

 

 

101  

(l)

 

For the purposes of _Section 10.03(i)(ii)(C)_ , and Section 10.03(i) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, a  covenant or indemnity being given on an
"after-Tax basis" means that the amount payable (the " _Payment_ ") pursuant
to such covenant or indemnity (as applicable) shall be calculated in such a
manner as will ensure that, after taking into  account: (A) any Tax required
to be deducted or withheld from the Payment (save to the extent that Parent
has not provided a W-8BEN-E when it was entitled to do so, and provision of a
W-8BEN-E would have prevented such deduction or withholding  being required)
and any additional amounts required to be paid by the payer of the Payment in
consequence of such withholding; (B) the amount and timing of any additional
Tax which becomes (or would become, but for the use of any credit or other 
relief which would otherwise have been available to reduce the Tax liabilities
of any member of the recipient's Group) payable by the recipient of the
Payment as a result of the Payment's being chargeable to Tax in the hands of
that person; and (C)  the amount and timing of any Tax benefit which is
obtained by the recipient of the Payment (or any member of the recipient's
Group) to the extent that such Tax benefit is attributable to the matter
giving rise to the obligation to make the Payment  or the receipt of the
Payment, the recipient of the Payment is in the same position as that in which
it would have been if the matter giving rise to the obligation to make a
Payment under this _Section 10.03(l)_ had not occurred, provided  that if any
party to this Agreement shall have assigned or novated the benefit of this
Agreement in whole or in part or shall, after the date of this Agreement, have
changed its Tax residence or the permanent establishment to which the rights
under  this Agreement are allocated then no Payment to that party shall be
increased by reason of the operation of clauses (A) through (C) (inclusive) to
any greater extent than would have been the case had no such assignment,
novation or change taken  place. In this _Section 10.03(l)_ , references to
"Tax" shall exclude "VAT" and references to a "W-8BEN-E" shall mean a properly
completed IRS Form W-8BEN-E, on which the Company is entitled to rely,
claiming the benefits of, and establishing  an exemption to withholding
under, the income tax treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom
prior to such Payment.

 


 

 

(m)

 

None of the Financing Sources shall have any liability to the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any Person that is  an Affiliate of the Company prior to
giving effect to the Mergers relating to or arising out of this Agreement or
the Debt Financing, whether at law, or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, and neither the Company nor any Person that is an  Affiliate of
the Company prior to giving effect to the Mergers shall have any rights or
claims directly against any of the Financing Sources hereunder or thereunder.
The foregoing shall not impair, supplement, or otherwise modify any of the 
commitments and other obligations that the Financing Sources have under any
definitive agreement related to the Debt Financing to Parent, Bidco or either
Merger Sub or any of the rights of Parent, Bidco or either Merger Sub against
any of the  Financing Sources under any definitive agreement related to the
Debt Financing.

Section 11.03 __

 

 _Amendments and Waivers_.

 


 

 

(a)

 

Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the First
Effective Time if, but only if, such  amendment or waiver is in writing and
is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in
the case of a waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be
effective; _provided_ , that after the Company  Stockholder Approval or the

Company or the shareholders of Parent under Applicable Law without  such
approval having first been obtained.

 


 

 

(b)

 

No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver  thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the

of this Agreement specifically refers to the Company Disclosure  Schedule or
the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as applicable. The parties hereto further
agree that disclosure of any item, matter or event in any particular section
or subsection of either the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent

reference to such other section or subsections.

Forward-Looking Statements", "Special Note Regarding Forward Looking
Statements" or "Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements" or any other 
disclosures in any Company SEC Document or Parent SEC Document that are
cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature be deemed to be an
exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of or otherwise qualify) any
representations and warranties of  any party contained in this Agreement.

other party hereto, except that Parent may transfer or assign its rights and
obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part, to
one or more of its wholly owned Subsidiaries at any time or any  other Person
after the Closing; _provided_ , that such transfer or assignment by Parent
shall not relieve Parent of its obligations hereunder or otherwise alter or
change any obligation of any other party hereto or delay the consummation of

Section 11.07 __

 

 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all disputes, claims, actions, suits or
proceedings based upon, arising  out of or related to this Agreement or the

exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court
therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, solely if the Delaware Court of

hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits with regard to any such action
or proceeding for itself and in  respect of its property to the personal
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any
action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in any court other than the aforesaid  courts. Each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of
motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding

subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts, (b) any claim that it
or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or
from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of
notice, attachment  prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of
judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent
permitted by Applicable Law, any claim that (i) the suit, action or proceeding
in such court is brought in an  inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such
suit, action or proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject
matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. To the fullest extent
permitted by Applicable Law, each of the  parties hereto hereby consents to
the service of process in accordance with _Section 11.01_ ; _provided_ , that
nothing herein shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in
any other manner permitted by Applicable Law.

 

 

106  

Section 11.09 __

 

 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS  AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY  ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGERS OR THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO THE FINANCING SOURCES). EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY
OF ANY  OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER, (B) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS
WAIVER, (C) EACH PARTY  MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) EACH PARTY HAS
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL

Section 11.10

 

_Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in any number of
counterparts, including by  facsimile, by email with .pdf attachments, or by
other electronic signatures (including, DocuSign and AdobeSign), each of which
shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and
hereto were upon the same instrument. This  Agreement shall become effective
when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed and
delivered (by electronic communication, facsimile or otherwise) by all of the
other parties hereto. Until and unless each party has  received a counterpart
hereof signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect,
and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue
of any other oral or written agreement or other communication).

 


 

 

Section 11.11 __

 

 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement between  the parties with respect to the
subject matter thereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings,
both oral and written, between the parties with respect to the subject matter

Section 11.12 __

 

 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of  competent jurisdiction or other Governmental
Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected,  impaired or invalidated so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon
such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to  modify
this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely
as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

 

 

107  

Section 11.13 __

 

 _Specific Performance_. The parties' rights in this _Section 11.13_ are an
integral part of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable harm would occur and that the
parties would not have any adequate remedy at law (a) for any breach of any of
the provisions of this Agreement or (b) in  the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms. It is accordingly agreed that (except where this Agreement is
validly terminated in accordance with _Section 10.01_ ) the  parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, without proof of actual damages, and each party
further  agrees to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any
bond in connection with such remedy. The parties further agree that (x) by
seeking the remedies provided for in this _Section 11.13_ , a party shall not
in any respect waive  its right to any other form of relief that may be
available to a party under this Agreement, including, subject to _Section
10.03(g)_ , monetary damages in the event that the remedies provided for in
this _Section 11.13_ are not  available or otherwise are not granted, and (y)
nothing contained in this _Section 11.13_ shall require any party to institute
any proceeding for (or limit any party's right to institute any proceeding
for) specific performance under this _Section      11.13_ before
exercising any termination right under _Section 10.01_ (and/or pursuing
damages), nor shall the commencement of any action pursuant to this _Section
11.13_ or anything contained in this _Section 11.13_ restrict  or limit any
party's right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of
_Section 10.01_ or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be
available then or thereafter. In no event shall the Company or Parent be 
entitled to both (i) specific performance to cause the other party to
consummate the Closing and (ii) the payment of the Parent Termination Payment
or the Company Termination Payment, as applicable.

 


 

 

Section 11.14 __

 

 _Financing Provisions_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Company on behalf of  itself, its Subsidiaries and each of its
controlled Affiliates hereby: (a) agrees that, except as specifically set
forth in the documents relating to the Debt Financing, any proceeding, whether
in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or  otherwise, involving
the Financing Sources, arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, the Debt
Financing or any of the agreements entered into in connection with the Debt
Financing or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or  the
performance of any services thereunder shall be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any federal or state court in the Borough of Manhattan, New
York, New York, so long as such forum is and remains available, and any
appellate court thereof  and each party hereto irrevocably submits itself and
its property with respect to any such proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction
of such court, (b) agrees that, except as specifically set forth in the
documents relating to the Debt Financing,  any such proceeding shall be
governed by the laws of the State of New York (without giving effect to any
conflicts of law principles that would result in the application of the laws
of another state), except as otherwise provided in the documents  relating to
the Debt Financing, (c) agrees not to bring or support or permit any of its
controlled Affiliates to bring or support any proceeding of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise,  against any Financing Source in any way arising out of or
relating to, this Agreement, the Debt Financing and the documents relating
thereto or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the
performance of any services thereunder in  any forum other than any federal
or state court in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, (d) agrees
that service of process on the Company or its Subsidiaries in any such
proceeding shall be effective if notice is given in accordance with
_Section     11.01_ , (e) irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent that
it may effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such proceeding in any such court, (f) knowingly, intentionally
and voluntarily waives to the  fullest extent permitted by applicable law
trial by jury in any proceeding brought against the Financing Sources in any
way arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, the Debt Financing and the
documents relating thereto, or any of the  transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder, (g) agrees that none
of the Financing Sources shall have any liability to the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of its controlled Affiliates (in each  case, other than
Parent and its Affiliates) relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the
Debt Financing and the documents relating thereto, __ or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any
services  thereunder, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise and (h) agrees that the Financing Sources are express Third
Party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, any of the provisions of _Section
10.3(k)_ and this _Section     11.14_ , and that such provisions shall not
be amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified in any way adverse to
the Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the Financing
Sources.
