<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Section</B><B></B><B>&nbsp;9.1</B> <B>Confidential Data</B>.<B> </B>The Paying Agent, Parent and the Stockholders&#146; Agent acknowledge
that during the course of this Agreement, the parties hereto may make confidential data available to each other or may otherwise obtain proprietary or confidential information regarding the Company, the Holders or other rights owners, or the Paying
Agent (collectively, hereinafter &#147;<B>Confidential Data</B>&#148;). Confidential Data includes all information not generally known or used by others and which gives, or may give the possessor of such information an advantage over its competitors
or which could cause Parent, Stockholders&#146; Agent or the Paying Agent injury, loss of reputation or loss of goodwill if disclosed. Such information includes, but is not necessarily limited to, data or information which identifies past, current
or potential customers, Holders, business practices, financial results, research, development, systems and plans; and/or certain information and material identified by the Company, Parent or the Paying Agent as &#147;Proprietary&#148; or
&#147;Confidential&#148;; and/or data the Paying Agent furnishes to Parent from the Paying Agent&#146;s database; and/or data received from the Company or Parent and enhanced by the Paying Agent. Confidential Data may be written, oral, recorded, or
maintained on other forms of electronic media. Because of the sensitive nature of the information that Parent or the Paying Agent and its employees or agents may obtain as a result of this Agreement, the intent of the parties is that these
provisions be interpreted as broadly as possible to protect Confidential Data. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Section</B><B></B><B>&nbsp;9.2</B> <B>Relief</B>.<B>
</B>The Paying Agent acknowledges that all Confidential Data furnished by the Company, Stockholders&#146; Agent or Parent is considered proprietary and strictly confidential. The Paying Agent also acknowledges that the unauthorized use or disclosure
of any Confidential Data may cause irreparable harm to the Company or Parent. Accordingly, the Paying Agent agrees that the Company or Parent shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief, in addition to all other remedies
available at law for any threatened or actual breach of this agreement or any threatened or actual unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Data. Parent agrees that the provisions and remedies of this section shall also apply to Confidential
Data received by the Company or Parent relating to the Paying Agent. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Section</B><B></B><B>&nbsp;9.3</B> <B>Security Measures</B>.
<B></B>The Paying Agent will employ the same security measures to protect Confidential Data received from the Company or Parent that it would employ for its own comparable confidential information (but in no event less than a reasonable degree of
care in handling Confidential Data). Without limiting the foregoing, the Paying Agent further agrees, subject to applicable law and regulations, that: (i)&nbsp;Confidential Data shall not be distributed, disclosed, or conveyed to any third party
except by prior written approval of the Parent; (ii)&nbsp;no copies or reproductions shall be made of any Confidential Data, except as needed to provide the services described in this Agreement; and (iii)&nbsp;the Paying Agent shall not use any
Confidential Data for its own benefit or for the benefit of any third party. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Section</B><B></B><B>&nbsp;9.4</B> <B>Subpoena, Summons
or Legal Process</B>.<B> </B>Except as prohibited by applicable law or regulation, the Paying Agent shall promptly notify Parent and Stockholders&#146; Agent in writing of any subpoena, summons or other legal process served on the Paying Agent for
the purpose of obtaining Confidential Data (i)&nbsp;consisting of a Holder list, such as an identified class of Holders, or (ii)&nbsp;relating to significant regulatory action or litigation that would have a material effect on the performance of the
Paying Agent. In such cases, Parent and Stockholders&#146; Agent shall have a reasonable opportunity to seek appropriate protective measures; provided, however, that this subsection shall not require the Paying Agent to notify Parent and
Stockholders&#146; Agent of its receipt of any subpoena, summons or other legal process seeking Confidential Data for a single Holder or group of related Holders in connection with routine tax levies or other routine third party litigation involving
a Holder or if the Paying Agent is prohibited by law or regulation from making such disclosure. </P>
