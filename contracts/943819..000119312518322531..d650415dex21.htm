- 19 \- 

    

(c) No options to purchase the Company Common Stock (the " _Company Options_
") shall be assumed by Parent in the Transaction. All outstanding Company
Options that would otherwise be outstanding at or immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether or not then vested, shall be cancelled and

Agent is designated to serve in the capacity set forth in  _Section_ __ _
2.11_ and (ii) such Stockholder agrees to the indemnification obligations set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.2_.

 

2.7 _Preparation of Closing Date Balance Sheet; Determination of Merger
Consideration_.

 

(a) The Company shall deliver to Parent at least three Business Days prior to
the Closing, a certificate executed by an executive officer of the Company
setting forth the Companys good faith estimates of (i) the Closing Date
Balance Sheet and, based thereon, the Net Working Capital, and (ii) a closing
statement (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ ") setting forth each
Stockholders calculation of the Merger Consideration (the " _Estimated Merger
Consideration_ "), which shall be determined in accordance with this Agreement
and take into account, and set forth as separate line items, all provisions
establishing the basis for such calculation set forth in _Sections
2.3(a)-(f)_. The Companys calculation of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and
the Net Working Capital (and all components thereof) shall be determined as
of the Reference Time and pursuant to the Working Capital Methodology. The
Company shall provide Parent access to the supporting documents and work
papers used or prepared in the preparation of the Estimated Closing Statement
to the extent reasonably necessary for Parent to review the Companys
calculation of the Estimated Closing Statement.

 



- 20 \- 

    

(b) As promptly as practicable, but in any event within 90 days following the
Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to Stockholders Agent:

(i) the Net Working Capital; and

 

(ii) a closing statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth Parents
calculation of the Merger Consideration, which shall be determined in
accordance with this Agreement and take into account, and set forth as
separate line items, all provisions establishing the basis for such
calculation set forth in _Sections 2.3(a)-(f)_. Parents calculation in the
Closing Statement of Net Working Capital shall be determined as of the
Reference Time and pursuant to the Working Capital Methodology.

 

(c) Parent shall provide Stockholders Agent reasonable access during normal
business hours to relevant supporting documents and work papers used in the
preparation of the Closing Statement and the calculation of the Net Working
Capital to the extent reasonably necessary for the Stockholders Agent to
review the matters and calculations delivered by Parent pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 2.7(b)_ and any dispute relating thereto.

(d) Stockholders Agent may dispute any amounts reflected on the calculation
of the Net Working Capital and/or the Closing Statement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Stockholders Agent shall have notified Parent in writing of
each disputed item (collectively, the " _Disputed Items_ "), specifying the
amount thereof in dispute and setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis
for such dispute (a " _Protest Notice_ "), within 45 days of Stockholders
Agents receipt of all of the deliverables specified in _Section_ __ _
2.7(b)_. To the extent Stockholders Agent provides a Protest Notice within 45
days of Stockholders Agent receipt of the deliverables specified in 
_Section_ __ _ 2.7(b)_, all items that are not Disputed Items shall be final,
binding and non-appealable for all purposes hereunder, in each case, absent
fraud in connection with the matters contemplated by this _Section_ __ _
2.7_. In the event Stockholders Agent does not provide a Protest Notice to
Parent within 45 days of Stockholders receipt of the deliverables specified
in  _Section_ __ _ 2.7(b)_, Stockholders Agent shall be deemed to have
accepted in full the Closing Statement (which sets forth the calculation of
the Merger Consideration and the components thereof) and the Net Working
Capital, which shall then be deemed final, binding and non-appealable for all
purposes hereunder, in each case, absent fraud in connection with the matters
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.7_. After receipt by Parent of a
timely Protest Notice, Parent and Stockholders Agent shall meet by telephone,
or at a mutually agreeable location, to discuss and attempt to reconcile their
differences with respect to, and the amounts in respect of, the Disputed
Items. If Stockholders Agent and Parent are unable to reach a resolution
within 30 days after receipt by Parent of the Protest Notice, Parent and
Stockholders Agent shall within 30 days thereafter jointly submit
the remaining Disputed Items for resolution to the New York office of Ernst and
Young (or, if such firm declines to act, to another nationally recognized
public accounting firm mutually agreed upon by Parent and Stockholders Agent)
(the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ "), which shall be instructed by Parent
and Stockholders Agent to determine and report to Parent and Stockholders
Agent upon the resolution of such remaining Disputed Items within 30
days after such submission; _provided_ ,

 



- 21 \- 

    

  _however_ , that the scope of the Independent Accounting Firms engagement
shall be limited to the resolution of the Disputed Items and shall be based
solely on (i) the written submissions by each of Parent and Stockholders
Agent and (ii) the definitions and terms contained in this Agreement and shall
not be by independent review. Each of Parent and Stockholders Agent will be
afforded the opportunity to present to the Independent Accounting Firm any
material such Party deems relevant to the Independent Accounting Firms
determination. Parent and Stockholders Agent shall each furnish to the
Independent Accounting Firm such work papers and other documents and
information relating to the remaining Disputed Items as the Independent
Accounting Firm may request. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
with respect to its determination of each Disputed Item, the
Independent Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any Disputed Item
greater than the greatest value for such Disputed Item claimed by Parent or
Stockholders Agent or less than the lowest value for such Disputed Item
claimed by Parent or Stockholders Agent. The Independent Accounting Firm
shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator in performing the duties
assigned to it by the Parties under this Agreement (but shall be subject to
the privileges and immunities of arbitrators). The fees and disbursements of
the Independent Accounting Firm shall be allocated between Parent, on the one
hand, and Stockholders and Company Option Holders (in accordance with their
Escrow Pro Rata Share), on the other hand, in the same proportion that the
aggregate amount of such remaining Disputed Items so submitted to the
Independent Accounting Firm that is unsuccessfully disputed by Parent or
Stockholders Agent (as applicable) (as finally determined by the Independent
Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of such remaining Disputed Items so
submitted. For example, if it is Parents position that the adjustment owed is
$300, it is Stockholders Agents position that the adjustment owed is $100
and the Independent Accounting Firms finding is that the adjustment owed is
$250, then Parent shall pay 25% (300-250 / 300-100) of the
Independent Accounting Firms fees and expenses and Stockholders and Company
Option Holders (in accordance with their Escrow Pro Rata Share) shall pay 75%
(250-100 / 300-100) of the Independent Accounting Firms fees and expenses.

(e) The items set forth on the Closing Statement and the final Net
Working Capital shall be deemed final for the purposes of this _Section_ __ _
2.7_ upon the earlier of (i) the failure of Stockholders Agent to notify
Parent of a dispute within 45 days of Stockholders Agents receipt of the
deliverables specified in _Section_ __ _ 2.7(b)_ (as such period may be
extended), (ii) the resolution of all Disputed Items pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 2.7(d)_ by Parent and Stockholders Agent and (iii) the resolution of all
remaining Disputed Items pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7(d)_ by the
Independent Accounting Firm (which shall constitute an arbitral award that is
final, binding and non-appealable and upon which a judgment may be entered by
a court having jurisdiction thereover). The final determinations of such
matters shall be non-appealable and incontestable by the Parties and each of
their respective Affiliates and successors and assigns and not subject to
collateral attack for any reason other than fraud in connection with the
matters contemplated by this  _Section_ __ _ 2.7_.

(f) In the event that the final Merger Consideration as finally determined in
accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 2.7_ is more than the Estimated Merger
Consideration as determined on the Closing Date, then promptly after such
final determination (but, in any event, within three Business Days thereof),
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay (i) (a) with
respect to each Stockholder who shall have delivered to the Paying Agent, the
Company or Surviving Corporation, as applicable, on or prior to such date, a
completed Letter of Transmittal, the portion of such difference attributable
to such Stockholder to the Paying Agent and the Paying Agent shall distribute
such amount to the account designated in such Stockholders Letter of
Transmittal or (b) 

 



- 22 \- 

    

 with respect to each Stockholder who has not delivered a completed Letter of
Transmittal to the Paying Agent, the Company or Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, on or prior to such date, the portion of such difference
attributable to such Stockholder to the Paying Agent for the benefit of such
Stockholder and the Paying Agent shall pay such Stockholder in accordance with
the Paying Agent Agreement and (ii) the portion of such difference
attributable to the Company Option Holders to the Surviving Corporation for
prompt payment to the Company Option Holders. If the Merger Consideration as
finally determined in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.7_ is less than
the Estimated Merger Consideration as determined on the Closing Date, then
promptly after such final determination (but, in any event, within three
Business Days thereof), Stockholders Agent and Parent shall deliver a joint
written instruction to the Escrow Agent to release an amount of the General
Escrow Fund equal to such difference to Parent, or at Parents direction, to
the Surviving Corporation from the General Escrow Fund. If the General Escrow
Fund is insufficient to cover the amount of such shortfall resulting from the
Merger Consideration being less than the Estimated Merger Consideration, then
the Escrow Agent shall distribute all of the General Escrow Fund to Parent, or
at Parents direction, to the Surviving Corporation. Parents sole and
exclusive recourse to receive any shortfall amount pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 2.7(f)_ shall be with respect to the General Escrow Fund. All payments
contemplated by this  _Section_ __ _ 2.7(f)_ shall be made by wire transfer
in immediately available funds to the applicable payee.

(g) The Parties agree that the Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Closing
Statement (and the items reflected thereon) and the estimates thereof
delivered pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7(a)_ shall be prepared, and this
Agreement shall otherwise be interpreted, so that the Company and its
Subsidiaries are presented on a consolidated basis (but, for the avoidance of
doubt, Stockholder shall be deemed third parties) and no asset, liability,
Loss, or other item is double-counted against any Party hereunder and shall
not include any changes in assets or liabilities resulting from purchase
accounting adjustments or other changes arising from or resulting as a
consequence of the transactions contemplated hereby or the financing
thereof. 

(h) To the extent permitted by Law, the Parties shall treat any payments made
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.7_ (including amounts released from the
General Escrow Fund pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.7_) as an adjustment to
the Merger Consideration for all purposes (including Tax purposes), and the
Parties agree to file, or cause to be filed, their Tax Returns consistently
with such characterization.

2.8 _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Paying Agent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, the Stockholders Agent and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the cash otherwise deliverable under this Agreement,
and from any other payments otherwise required pursuant to this Agreement,
to any Stockholder or Company Option Holder such amounts as Parent, Paying
Agent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Stockholders Agent or the
Escrow Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to any such
deliveries and payments under the Code or any applicable provision of state,
local, provincial or foreign Tax law; _provided_ that Parent, Paying Agent or
Escrow Agent shall give Stockholders Agent written notice of any such
withholding (other than withholding on payments to Company Option Holders)
with respect to any payment deliverable under this Agreement at least five
Business Days prior to the Closing Date. The Stockholders Agent, on the one
hand, and Parent, the Paying Agent or the Escrow Agent, on the other, agree
to cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any
anticipated withholding Tax imposed in connection with the Transactions

 



- 23 \- 

    

 contemplated herein. To the extent that amounts are so deducted, withheld
and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority, such deducted and withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made. The applicable withholding agent shall pay such withheld amounts to the
appropriate Taxing Authority and shall provide the Stockholders Agent with a
receipt or other reasonable proof of such payment.

2.9 _Escrow_. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited
(a) an amount equal to the sum of $7,500,000 (the " _General Escrow Amount_ ")
in immediately available funds into an escrow account to be established and
maintained by Wilmington Trust, N.A. (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") pursuant to an
escrow agreement, substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_
(with such modifications as may be required by the Escrow Agent and agreed to
by Parent and Stockholders Agent) (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), to be
entered into on the Closing Date by Parent, Stockholders Agent and the Escrow
Agent (such deposit, together with any interest accruing thereon, to
constitute an escrow fund, the " _General Escrow Fund_ ") and (b) an amount
equal to the sum of $20,000,000 (the " _Special Escrow Amount_ ", and together
with the General Escrow Amount, the " _Escrow Amount_ ") in immediately
available funds into an escrow account to be established and maintained by
the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement (such deposit, together with
any interest accruing thereon, to constitute an escrow fund, the " _Special
Escrow Fund_ ", and together with the General Escrow Fund, the " _Escrow
Funds_ "). __

2.10 _Release of Escrow_.

 

(a) On the General Escrow Survival Date, any portion of the General Escrow
Amount remaining following any payment to Parent and not otherwise subject to
pending claims pursuant to with _Section_ __ _ 2.7(f)_ or _Section_ __ _
9.2_ shall be released by the Escrow Agent (and Parent and the Stockholders
Agent shall issue joint written instructions to release) in accordance with
the Escrow Agreement to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the Stockholders
in accordance with their Escrow Pro Rata Share and to the Surviving
Corporation for prompt payment to the Company Option Holders in
accordance with their Escrow Pro Rata Share (such released General Escrow
Amount, and deductions pursuant to this Agreement, the " _Released General
Escrow Amount_ "). With respect to each Stockholder who shall have delivered
to the Paying Agent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable,
on or prior to such date, a completed Letter of Transmittal, the Escrow Agent
shall pay to the Paying Agent for the benefit of such Stockholder the portion
of the Released General Escrow Amount attributable to such Stockholder with
respect to the Escrow Pro Rata Share of such Stockholder and the Paying Agent
shall promptly pay such Stockholder such amount which shall be payable by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in such
Stockholders Letter of Transmittal. With respect to each Stockholder who has
not delivered a completed Letter of Transmittal to the Paying Agent, the
Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, on or prior to such
date, the Escrow Agent shall pay the portion of the Released General Escrow
Amount attributable to such Stockholder, with respect to the Escrow Pro Rata
Share of such Stockholder, to the Paying Agent for the benefit of such
Stockholder and the Paying Agent shall promptly pay such Stockholder in
accordance with the Paying Agent Agreement. With respect to each Company
Option Holder, the Escrow Agent shall pay the portion of the Released General
Escrow Amount attributable to such Company Option Holder, with respect to the
Escrow Pro Rata Share of such Company Option Holder, to the Surviving
Corporation for the benefit of such Company Option Holder and the Surviving
Corporation shall promptly pay such Company Option Holder.

 



- 24 \- 

    

(b) On the Special Escrow Survival Date any portion of the Special Escrow
Amount remaining following any payment to Parent and not otherwise subject to
pending claims pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(v)_ shall be released by the
Escrow Agent (and Parent and the Stockholders Agent shall issue joint
written instructions to release) in accordance with the Escrow Agreement to
the Paying Agent for the benefit of the Stockholders in accordance with their
Escrow Pro Rata Share and to the Surviving Corporation for prompt payment to
the Company Option Holders in accordance with their Escrow Pro Rata Share
(such released Special Escrow Amount, and deductions pursuant to this
Agreement, the " _Released Special Escrow Amount_ "). With respect to each

the Paying Agent for the benefit of such Stockholder and the Paying Agent
shall promptly pay such Stockholder in accordance with the Paying Agent

2.11 _Stockholders_ __ _Agent_.

 

(a) _Stockholders  Agent Reimbursement Amount_. At Closing, Parent shall

performing its duties pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(b) _Appointment and Acceptance_. The Stockholders and Company Option Holders
hereby appoint Stockholders Agent for the purposes and upon the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth, and each Stockholder and Company Option
Holder shall be irrevocably bound by any action taken by Stockholders Agent
in accordance herewith. The Stockholders Agent hereby accepts
such appointment and agrees to act as Stockholders Agent of each Stockholder
and Company Option Holder in accordance with the terms hereof and the
applicable terms of the Escrow Agreement and Paying Agent Agreement. The
appointment, rights and powers of Stockholders Agent hereunder are
irrevocable and coupled with an interest. The appointment, rights, powers and
obligations of Stockholders Agent under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement
and the Paying Agent Agreement are exclusive and no Stockholder or Company
Option Holder shall have the right to assert any such right or power granted
to Stockholders Agent hereunder.

 



- 25 \- 

    

(c) _Duties of Stockholders  Agent_. The Stockholders Agent shall have
full power and authority to represent the Stockholders and Company Option
Holders, to (i) consummate the Transactions in accordance with the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, (ii) pay each Stockholder and Company
Option Holders expenses (whether incurred on or after the date hereof)
incurred in connection with the negotiation and performance of this Agreement,
(iii) receive, receipt and disburse any funds received hereunder on behalf of
or to each Stockholder or Company Option Holder, give and receive notices and
communications, (iv) holdback from disbursement to all of the Stockholders and
Company Option Holders collectively any such funds to the extent it reasonably
determine may be necessary or required under the terms and conditions of this
Agreement or applicable Law, (v) to execute and deliver on behalf of the
Stockholders and Company Option Holders, all documents contemplated herein,
and any amendment or waiver hereto, (vi) authorize Parent to release the
payment of cash out of the Escrow Funds in satisfaction of claims by Parent or
any Parent Indemnitee, (vii) assert any claims or pursue any remedies under
this Agreement, (viii) commence, defend or settle any suits, actions, claims
or other legal or equitable proceedings, (ix) agree to arbitrate any dispute
arising out of this Agreement; (x) waive the right to a jury trial and any and
all procedural defenses, (xi) approve, dispute, settle or compromise the
Closing Certificate or any other matters set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.7_ and
(xii) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of
Stockholders Agent for the interpretation of this Agreement and
accomplishment of the foregoing. Such agency may be changed by the holders of
a majority in interest of the Escrow Funds from time to time upon prior
written notice to Parent. No bond shall be required of Stockholders Agent,
and Stockholders Agent shall receive no compensation for its services.
Notices or communications to or from Stockholders Agent after the Closing
shall constitute notice to or from each of the Stockholders and Company
Option Holders.

(d) The Stockholders Agent shall not be liable for any act done or omitted
hereunder or under any ancillary agreements hereto as Stockholders Agent
while acting in good faith and without willful misconduct or gross negligence
and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be
conclusive evidence of such good faith. The Stockholders and Company Option
Holders shall severally (based on each such Stockholders or Company Option
Holders Escrow Pro Rata Share) indemnify and hold the Stockholders Agent
harmless against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, penalties,
fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs or expenses (including the fees and
expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense of document
location, duplication and shipment) (collectively, " _Representative Losses_
") arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of
its duties hereunder and any ancillary agreements hereto, in each case as such
Representative Loss is suffered or incurred;  _provided_ that in the event
that any such Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly
caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Stockholders
Agent, the Stockholders Agent will reimburse the Stockholders and Company
Option Holders the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss to the
extent attributable to such gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not
paid directly to the Stockholders Agent by the Stockholders or
Company Option Holders, any such Representative Losses may be recovered by
the Stockholders Agent from (i) the funds in the Stockholders Agent
Reimbursement Amount and (ii) the amounts in the Escrow Funds at such time as
remaining amounts would otherwise be distributable; _provided_ that while
this _Section_

 



- 26 \- 

    

  _2.11(d)_ allows the Stockholders Agent to be paid from the Stockholders
Agent Reimbursement Amount, and the Escrow Funds, this does not relieve the
Stockholders or Company Option Holders from their obligation to promptly pay
such Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it
prevent the Stockholders Agent from seeking any remedies available to it at
law or otherwise. In no event will the Stockholders Agent be required to
advance its own funds on behalf of the Stockholders or Company Option Holders
or otherwise. The Stockholders and Company Option Holders acknowledge and
agree that the foregoing indemnities will survive the resignation or removal
of the Stockholders Agent or the termination of this Agreement.

(e) The Stockholders Agent shall have reasonable access to information about
the Surviving Corporation and the reasonable assistance of the Surviving
Corporations officers and employees for purposes of performing its duties and
exercising its rights hereunder, _provided_ that the Stockholders Agent
shall treat confidentially and not disclose any nonpublic information from or
about the Surviving Corporation to anyone (except on a need to know basis to
its Representatives who agree or are obligated to treat such information
confidentially or as required by law).

(f) Parent acknowledges that the Stockholders Agent may have a conflict
of interest with respect to its duties as Stockholders Agent, and in such
regard the Stockholders Agent has informed Parent that it will act in the

(g) Stockholders Agent shall be entitled to receive reimbursement from any
Stockholders Agent Reimbursement Amounts held by it, for any and all
expenses, charges and liabilities, including attorneys fees, incurred by it
in the performance or discharge of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement. The Stockholders Agent Reimbursement Amount shall only be
used for the payment of such expenses, charges and liability or as otherwise
permitted by this Agreement. The Stockholders and Company Option Holders will
not receive any interest or earnings on the Stockholders Agent Reimbursement

Company Option Holders to the Surviving Corporation for further distribution
to the Company Option Holders based on such Company Option Holders Escrow Pro
Rata Share. For tax purposes, the Stockholders Agent Reimbursement Amount
shall be treated as having been received and voluntarily set aside by the
Stockholders and Company Option Holders at the time of Closing. In the event
that any amount is owed to the Stockholders Agent, whether for fees, expense
reimbursement or indemnification, that is in excess of the Stockholders
Agent Reimbursement Amount, the Stockholders Agent shall be entitled to be

Company Option Holders as to any such owed amount, including a reasonably
detailed description as to such owed amount, the Stockholders and Company
Option Holders shall promptly deliver to the Stockholders Agent full payment
of his, her or its Escrow Pro Rata Share of such owed amount.

 

(h) _Actions of the Stockholders_ __ _Agent_. A decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Stockholders Agent shall constitute a decision of all
Stockholders and Company Option Holders for whom the Merger Consideration
otherwise payable to them is set aside and held by Parent as part of the
Escrow Funds and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each
such Stockholder and Company Option Holders, and Parent may rely upon any
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders Agent as being the
decision, act, consent or instruction of each and every such Stockholder and
Company Option Holder.

(i) Each of Parent (on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates), Merger
Sub and the Company acknowledges that no claim shall be brought by or on
behalf of Parent or any of its Affiliates or, after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries against the Stockholders Agent (in
its capacity as such) with respect to this Agreement or the agreements or
Transactions or any certificate, opinion, instrument or other document
delivered hereunder (with it being understood that any covenant or agreement
of or by the "parties" or "each of the parties" shall not be deemed to

covenant or the Stockholders Agent expressly so agrees in writing, but
the Stockholders Agent shall receive the benefit of any provision of the
"parties" or "each of the parties" including with respect to the miscellaneous
provisions set forth in _Article XI_ ).

 

(j) In the event that Stockholders Agent becomes unable to perform the
Stockholders Agents responsibilities or resigns from such position, a
majority-in-interest (based on Escrow Pro Rata Share) of the Stockholders and
Company Option Holders shall select another representative to fill
such vacancy and such substituted representative shall (i) be deemed to be
the Stockholders Agent for all purposes of this Agreement and (ii) exercise
the rights and powers of, and be entitled to the indemnity, reimbursement and
other benefits of, the Stockholders Agent.

2.12 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
outstanding Common Stock that is held by a Stockholder who shall have not
voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing or executed an
enforceable waiver of appraisal rights to the extent permitted by applicable
Law and who shall have properly demanded appraisal for such shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting

date hereof. In addition, Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, honor all advancement obligations owed by it and
its Subsidiaries to any DandO Indemnified Party under this  _Section_ __ _
6.2_, to the extent required by the certificates of incorporation or
formation, bylaws or limited liability company agreements and to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable law governing such entities as of the
Effective Time, _provided_ that the Person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances to the extent required by
applicable Law and applicable certificates of incorporation or formation,
bylaws or limited liability company agreements.

(b) Each of the Company and the DandO Indemnified Party shall cooperate, and
cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense of any Claim
and shall provide access to properties and individuals as reasonably requested
and furnish or cause to be furnished records, information and testimony, and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals,
as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

(c) At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase and pay for an
extended reporting period endorsement ("run-off" policy) under the Companys

Companys and its Subsidiaries directors and officers that shall provide such
directors and officers with coverage for six years following the Effective
Time (including with respect to acts or omissions occurring in connection
with this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions).

(d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or the surviving
company or entity of such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall assume all of the obligations thereof set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.2_.

(e) The obligations under this  _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any DandO Indemnified Party
to whom this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ applies without the consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed) of such DandO Indemnified Party
(it being expressly understood that (i) the DandO Indemnified Parties to whom
this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.2_ and shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained
herein and (ii) the rights set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ are in
addition to, and not in substitution of, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any DandO Indemnified Party may have).

6.3 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Subject to any limitations or requirements imposed by Law, for the 12
months immediately following the Closing Date, Parent shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates and the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, provide
to those individuals who were employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing Date and who remain employed
immediately after the Closing (the " _Company Employees_ "), (i) base salary
or hourly wage rates (such payment method to be determined at the Parents
discretion) and cash incentive compensation opportunities that, in each case,
are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent, and (ii) employee benefits (other than equity-
based compensation or Change of Control Payments) that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent.

(b) Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to: (i) give full credit for purposes of eligibility, vesting and the
calculation of benefit accruals (including for purposes of vacation and notice
of termination or pay in lieu and severance) under any employee benefit plans
or

 



- 57 \- 

    

 arrangements maintained by Parent, its Affiliates, the Surviving Corporation
or its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Parent Plans_ ") for such Company
Employees service with, or credited by, the Company and its Subsidiaries to
the same extent recognized by the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) waive all
limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions, waiting periods,
actively at work requirements and evidence of insurability with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Company Employees
under any Parent Plan that is a welfare benefit plan that such employees may
be eligible to participate in after the Closing Date and (iii) provide credit
under any such welfare plan for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket
expenditures for the remainder of the coverage period during which any
transfer of coverage occurs; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such service
shall be recognized or credit given to the extent such recognition or credit
would result in the duplication of benefits.

(c) Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ shall prohibit Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or their respective Affiliates and subsidiaries from amending,
modifying or terminating any Employee Benefit Program or other employee
benefit plan, pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms thereof. Nothing
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ shall be construed as requiring the
continued employment or engagement of any employee or other service provider
after the Closing Date. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ shall (i) create
a third-party beneficiary relationship or otherwise confer any benefit,
entitlement, or right upon any Person other than the Parties hereto, including
any right to employment or continued employment for any specified period, of
any nature or kind whatsoever under this  _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ or (ii) be
deemed an amendment or modification of, or waiver under, any Employee Benefit
Program. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require duplicate
benefits to be paid or provided to or with respect to any employee under any
Employee Benefit Program for the same period of service.

6.4 _Documents and Information_. From and after the Closing, Parent will, and
will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives to, provide Stockholders Agent and its authorized
Representatives with reasonable access (including examining and copying),
during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice and in such a manner so
as to not unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the business,
to the personnel and books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries
with respect to periods or occurrences prior to the Closing Date that are
reasonably necessary in connection with Tax or financial reporting
obligations. Unless otherwise consented to in writing by the Stockholders
Agent, Parent shall not permit the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, for a period of six years following the Closing Date, to
destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any documents of any kind relating to
Taxes or the preparation of any Tax Return relating to periods prior to the
Closing Date without first giving reasonable prior written notice to the
Stockholders Agent and offering to surrender to Stockholders Agent such
books and records or such portions thereof. Following notice of
such destruction, alteration or disposition, if the Stockholders Agent so
requests, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
permit the Stockholders Agent to take possession of such books and records.

 

6.5 _Termination of Plans_. Effective as of no later than the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date, the Company shall terminate any and all Employee
Benefit Programs intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (each,
a " _401(k) Plan_ "), unless Parent provides written notice that such 401(k)
Plan(s) shall not be terminated, which notice shall be provided not less than
three Business Days prior to the Closing Date. Unless Parent provides such
written notice

 



- 58 \- 

    

 to the Company no later than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such 401(k) Plan(s) have
been terminated effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date pursuant to resolutions of the board of directors of the Company. The
form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to review by Parent.
To the extent a 401(k) Plan is so terminated, and to the extent permitted
under the 401(k) Plan(s), Parent shall take all action necessary to provide
that a tax-qualified defined contribution plan maintained by Parent or one of
its Affiliates (a " _Parent DC Plan_ ") shall, at the election of any
participant in such 401(k) Plan, accept a rollover contribution that includes
promissory notes reflecting outstanding loans under such 401(k) Plan, except,
in any case, to the extent the Parent DC Plans recordkeeper prohibits the
acceptance of rollover contributions include promissory notes.

6.6 _Solicitation of 280G Approval_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
solicit a Section 280G parachute payment waiver from each Person listed on
_Schedule 6.6_ who will receive a 280G Payment (as defined below) (each such
Person who signs such waiver, a " _Waiving Disqualified Individual_ "). To
the extent that there are any Waiving Disqualified Individuals, then, no later
than one Business Day prior to the Closing, the Company shall submit to the
Company Stockholders for approval (in a manner intended to comply with the
approval procedures set forth in Section 280G of the Code and the regulations
thereunder, subject to the reasonable review and approval by Parent), by such
number of Company Stockholders as is required by the terms of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, any payment and/or benefits to be received by such
Waiving Disqualified Individuals that may, separately or in the aggregate,
constitute "parachute payments" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code
(including payments and benefits to be provided by Parent and its Affiliates
only to the extent such payments and such benefits have been communicated to
the Company as of the date hereof) (" _280G Payments_ ") (which determination
shall be made by the Company and shall be subject to review and approval by
Parent (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed)), such that all such payments and benefits shall not be deemed to be
280G Payments, and prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent
evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent that a Company stockholder vote on
behalf of the Waiving Disqualified Individuals was solicited in
conformance with Section 280G and the regulations promulgated thereunder (the
" _280G Approval_ ") and that (i) such requisite 280G Approval was obtained
with respect to any payments or benefits that were subject to the stockholder
vote, or (ii) that the 280G Approval was not obtained and as a consequence,
that such payments or benefits shall not be made or provided to the extent
they would cause any amounts to constitute 280G Payments, pursuant to the
waivers of those payments or benefits, which were executed by the Waiving
Disqualified Individuals prior to the vote of the Company Stockholders
pursuant to this Section 6.6.

 

Article VII

Neither Parent, Company nor any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall make
an election under Code Section 338 or Code Section 336 with respect to the
purchase of the Shares.

 



- 59 \- 

    

(b) _Transfer Taxes_. Parent shall bear and pay when due, any transfer,
documentary, sales, use, registration, stamp, or other similar Taxes payable
by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or attributable
to the sale, transfer or delivery of the Shares under this Agreement (other
than income or capital gains tax of Stockholder or its members) (" _Transfer
Taxes_ "). The Stockholders Agent and Parent shall cooperate in a timely
manner making all filings, returns, reports and forms as necessary or
appropriate to comply with the provisions of all applicable Laws in
connection with the payment of such Transfer Taxes, and shall reasonably
cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the fullest extent possible under such
Laws, the amount of any such Transfer Taxes payable in connection therewith.

(c) _Tax Returns_.

 

(i) Parent shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Surviving Corporation, the
Company or any Subsidiary after the Closing Date with respect to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period. Any such Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
past practice of the Company and the Subsidiaries (unless otherwise required
by Law). All Transaction Tax Deductions shall be treated as properly allocable
to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, except as otherwise required by
applicable Law, and will not be treated as subject to the "next day" rule
under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B). The parties agree:
(A) to file a federal income Tax Return of the Company for the Companys
taxable year ending on the Closing Date pursuant to Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-76(c); and (B) to deduct the Transaction Tax Deductions on the
Tax Returns of the Company for the taxable period that ends on the Closing
Date.

(ii) Parent shall provide the Stockholders Agent with drafts of all such Tax
Returns prepared by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)(i)_ no later
than 25 calendar days prior to the due date thereof (taking into account any
extensions thereof) and shall permit the Stockholders Agent to review and
comment on such Tax Returns. Parent shall reflect any reasonable comments with
respect to any such Tax Return made by the Stockholders Agent in writing no
later than 14 days following the receipt of such Tax Return by the
Stockholders Agent. Parent shall cause any amounts shown to be due on such
Tax Returns to be timely remitted to the applicable Taxing Authority no later
than the date on which such Taxes are due.

 

(d) _Straddle Period_. Taxes for any Tax period of Company or any Subsidiary
that includes but does not end on the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ ")
shall be allocated for all purposes of this Agreement (i) to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period for the portion of the Tax period up to and including the Closing
Date and (ii) to the Post-Closing Tax Period for the portion of the Tax
period subsequent to the Closing Date. For that purpose, (A) real, personal
and intangible property Taxes and any other Taxes levied on an annual or other
periodic basis (" _Per Diem Taxes_ ") for a Straddle Period shall be
allocated between the periods described in clauses (i) and (ii) of the
preceding sentence on a per diem basis based on the number of days during the
Straddle Period ending with and including the Closing Date and number of days
during the Straddle Period commencing on the day after the Closing Date, and
(B) Taxes that are not Per Diem Taxes, including income Taxes and any
transactional Taxes such as Taxes based on sales, revenue or payments of
Company for a Straddle Period shall be allocated between the periods described
in

 



- 60 \- 

    

 clauses (i) and (ii) of the preceding sentence as if such Tax period ended
as of the end of the Closing Date. "Pre-Closing Tax Period" means any Tax
period ending on or before the Closing Date and the portion through the end of
the Closing Date of any Tax period which begins before the Closing Date but
ends after the Closing Date. "Post-Closing Tax Period" means, with respect to
a Straddle Period, the portion of such period beginning on the day after the
Closing Date and ending on the end of the Straddle Period.

 

(e) _Cooperation_. Subject to the other provisions of this _Section_ __ _
7.1_, Parent, the Company and Stockholders Agent shall cooperate in good
faith, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in
connection with the preparation and filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with
respect to Taxes and the computation and verification of any amounts paid or
payable under this Agreement (including any supporting work papers, schedules
and documents). Such cooperation shall include (upon the other Partys
request) the provision of records and information within such Partys control
which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other
proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. The Company and the Surviving Corporation shall retain all books
and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company or its
Subsidiaries relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Periods during the applicable
statute of limitations for that Tax period and shall abide by all record
retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and shall give
Stockholders Agent reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records prior to the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations for that Tax period, and if
Stockholders Agent so requests, the Surviving Corporation shall allow
Stockholders Agent to take possession of such books and records rather than
destroying or discarding such books and records.

 

(f) _Records_. At the request of Stockholders Agent, Parent shall deliver to
Stockholders Agent copies of all filed Tax Returns relating to Pre-Closing
Tax Periods.

Claim. Each Indemnification Notice shall specify the facts and circumstances
upon which the claim is based, the basis on which indemnification is sought

faith estimate of the amount of its Losses and, in the case of a Third Party
Claim to the extent known by the Indemnitee, shall contain (by attachment or
otherwise) all related documentation (e.g., claim letters, etc.);  _provided_
, _however_ , that the failure to provide such notice or related information
or documentation shall not release the Indemnitor from any of its obligations
under this Agreement except to the extent (and only to the extent)
the Indemnitor is actually prejudiced by such failure, and provided further
that notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary a claim for
indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(v)_ shall not require any breach
of a representation, warranty of covenant herein for such claim to be made
under and in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 9_. The Indemnitee shall
provide written notice as soon as reasonably practicable to the Indemnitor of
all material developments and documentation relating to the related
Indemnification Claim and any material changes in Indemnitees good faith
estimate of the amount of its Losses. The Indemnitee shall provide the
Indemnitor with reasonable access, upon reasonable prior notice and during
normal business hours, in a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere in any
material respect with the normal business operations, to its books and
records, properties and personnel relating to the Indemnification Claim.

(b) If the Indemnification Claim involves a Third Party Claim, the provisions
set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 9.5_ shall be applicable, in addition to those
set forth above. For the purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 9.4_ and _Section_
__ _ 9.5_, the Stockholders Agent shall be permitted to make or receive any
Indemnification Notice on behalf of any or all Stockholders or Company Option
Holders.

(c) Upon delivery to the Stockholders Agent of an Officers Certificate for
an Indemnification Claim by Parent under _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(v)_ against
the Special Escrow Amount, the Stockholders Agent shall not unreasonably
delay its response to such Indemnification Claim. If Stockholders Agent
accepts such Indemnification Claim, Parent and the Stockholders Agent shall
promptly execute and deliver a Joint Release Instruction (as defined in the
Escrow Agreement) directing the Escrow Agent to disburse such accepted amount
of Special Escrow Funds. If Stockholders Agent disputes all or any part of
such Indemnification Claim, it shall provide to Parent a description or basis
for such dispute in reasonable detail and Parent and the Stockholders Agent
shall cooperate in good faith to resolve such dispute; _provided_ , that, if
Stockholders Agent only disputes part of such Indemnification Claim, then
Parent and the Stockholders Agent shall promptly execute and deliver a Joint
Release Instruction directing the Escrow Agent to disburse any undisputed
amounts from Special Escrow Funds pending resolution of such dispute.

9.5 _Third Party Claims_. Subject to the limitations set forth in the rest of
this  _Article IX_ , without limiting the other limitations and exceptions of
this Agreement, the obligations and liabilities of the Parties hereunder with
respect to a Third Party Claim for which an Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _Article IX_ shall be subject to the
following terms and conditions:

(a) The Indemnitor shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assume
entire control and direction of the defense of any such Third Party Claim and
any related Proceeding, at the Indemnitors expense and with counsel of the
Indemnitors own choosing, such choice to be reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnitee and made by written notice to the Indemnitee within 20 calendar
days after the Indemnifying Party has received notice of the Third-Party
Claim. Such assumption of the conduct and control of the defense shall not be
(or require as a condition) an admission or assumption of liability by the
Indemnitor. If the Indemnitor elects to assume the defense of a Third Party
Claim pursuant to, and in accordance with, the first sentence of this 
_Section_ __ _ 9.5(a)_, the Indemnitee may participate in such defense with
counsel of its own choosing, at its own expense, and the Indemnitor shall not
be liable to the Indemnitee under this _Article IX_ for any fees of other
counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of such Proceeding
incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense of such Proceeding (
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnitor shall pay all reasonable costs
and expenses of counsel for the Indemnitee if both the Indemnitor and the
Indemnitee are named parties to the Proceeding and representation of both
parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to a conflict of
interest between them on one or more material issues). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnitor shall not be entitled to control and direct the
defense of such Third Party Claim in the event that (i) the Indemnification
Claim is in respect of any matter involving criminal liability, (ii) the
matter that is the subject of the Indemnification Claim seeks as its primary
cause of action the imposition of an equitable or injunctive remedy that is
binding upon the Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates other than equitable or
injunctive remedies that would be immaterial or (iii) the matter that is the
subject of the Indemnification Claim is a matter under _Section_ __ _
9.2(a)(v)_, in which case the Parent shall control and direct the defense of
such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that Indemnitor may
participate in such defense with counsel of its own choosing, at its own
expense, and the Indemnitee shall not be liable to the Indemnitor under this 
_Article IX_ for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect
to the defense of such Proceeding incurred by the Indemnitee in connection
with the defense of such Proceeding. Each Party shall provide, and shall cause
its Representatives (including, in the case of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to provide, as applicable, the other Party
and its counsel with reasonable access, upon reasonable prior notice and
during normal business hours, in a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere
in any material respect with its normal business operations, to its records
and personnel and shall otherwise reasonably cooperate in the investigation,
defense or settlement thereof. With respect to a Third Party Claim under this
_Article IX_ , neither the Indemnitor nor the Indemnitee shall, without the
prior written consent of the other party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) consent to entry of any judgment
or settlement or otherwise settle such claim. With respect to a Third Party
Claim under _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(v)_, in the event that Parent wishes to
settle such Third Party Claim and the Stockholders Agent does not consent
to such settlement or otherwise agree with Parent on acceptable settlement
parameters within 10 days after notice of such settlement proposal from
Parent, then Parent and the Stockholders Agent agree to submit such dispute
to binding arbitration by a mutually determined third party independent
arbitrator

 



- 67 \- 

    

 under mutually agreed arbitration procedures, and suchs arbitrator decision
as to a reasonable settlement amount or range for such Third Party Claim shall
be binding and final on both parties; provided, however, that in no event
shall any non-monetary settlement terms for such Third Party Claim be
submitted to or decided by arbitration.

 

(b) If the Indemnitor elects to assume control of the defense of any Third
Party Claim hereunder and fails to conduct the defense in an active and
diligent manner, withdraws from such defense, the Third Party Claim is
reasonably deemed likely to exceed the Stockholder Cap or Parent Cap, as
applicable, or is otherwise not permitted to conduct the defense pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 9.5(a)_, the Indemnitee shall then have the right to undertake
the defense of such claim with counsel of its own choosing, with Indemnitor
responsible for the reasonable costs and expenses of such defense
thereafter as indemnifiable Losses to the extent such matter is ultimately
determined to be subject to indemnification by Indemnitor (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, subject to any limitations on Indemnitors indemnity
obligations and associated Losses under this Agreement).

9.6 _Indemnification Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. Except with respect to claims
for specific performance of covenants, following the Closing, indemnification
pursuant to this _Article IX_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Parties and any parties claiming by or through any Party (including the Parent
Indemnitees) related to or arising from any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in, or otherwise pursuant to, this
Agreement and none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Stockholder
shall have any other rights or remedies in connection with any breach of this
Agreement or any other liability arising out of the negotiation, entry into or
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except in the
case of matters arising out of Fraud.

 

9.7 _Insurance Recoveries_. To the extent that insurance (including the RandW
Insurance Policy) covers amounts of indemnifiable Loss that may be claimed by
Parent Indemnitees hereunder, Parent Indemnitees shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to recover such Loss thereunder, and amounts recovered from
insurance for such indemnifiable Loss shall be deducted from
amounts otherwise recoverable under _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ (net of the expense
associated with such efforts). Pursuit of insurance recoveries shall not be a
condition precedent to any Parent Indemnitees right to make a claim
for indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ or to any right to recovery
under _Section_ __ _ 9.2_; provided, that recovery under _Section_ __ _ 9.2_
shall not relieve the Parent Indemnitees duty to use commercially reasonable
efforts to recover insurance proceeds, and any recoveries of Loss from
insurance that follow such payment shall be remitted to Stockholders and
Company Option Holders (in the manner provided in  _Section_ __ _ 2.7(f)_).
Parent Indemnitees obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 9.7_ shall not
apply to the extent that Parent Indemnitees covered losses exceed or may
exceed the policy limits in question.

11.7 _Choice of Law/Consent to Jurisdiction_. All disputes, claims or
controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement (in contract, tort
or otherwise), or the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its
rules of conflict of laws. Each of the Company, Merger Sub, Parent and
Stockholders Agent hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit
to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the State of
Delaware, _provided_ that if (and only after) such courts determine that they
lack subject matter jurisdiction over any such legal action, suit or
Proceeding, such legal action, suit or Proceeding shall be brought in the
Federal courts of the United States located in the State of Delaware (in such
order, the " _Chosen Courts_ "), for any litigation arising out of or relating
to this Agreement (in contract, tort or otherwise) or the
negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (and agrees not to commence any litigation relating
thereto except in such courts), waives any objection to the laying of venue of
any such litigation in the Chosen Courts and agrees not to plead or claim in
any Chosen Court that such litigation brought therein has been brought in any
inconvenient forum. Each of the Parties hereto hereby agrees not to commence
any such litigation other than before one of the Chosen Courts. Each Party
agrees that a final, non-appealable judgment in any action or Proceeding so
brought shall be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment in any
court of competent jurisdiction, or in any other manner provided by Law. Each
Party agrees that service of summons and complaint or any other process that
might be served in any action or Proceeding may be made on such Party by
sending or delivering a copy of the process to the Party to be served at the
address of the Party and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in
_Section_ __ _ 11.1_. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 11.7_, _however_ ,
shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other
manner permitted by Law.

11.8 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT

TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY OR THE NEGOTIATION, VALIDITY OR
PERFORMANCE HEREOF OR THEREOF.

11.9 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing Date, the Parties
hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties
hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
the other Party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto
and (c) waive compliance by the other Party with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party hereto to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of the Party against which such waiver or
extension is to be enforced. Neither the failure nor any delay by any Party in
exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement or the
documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such
right, power, or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such
right, power, or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such
right, power, or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power, or
privilege. Waiver of any term or condition of this Agreement by a Party shall
not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or waiver of the same
term or condition by such Party, or a waiver of any other term or condition
of this Agreement by such Party.

11.10 _No Agreement Until Executed_. Irrespective of negotiations among the
Parties or the exchanging of drafts of this Agreement, this Agreement shall
not constitute or be deemed to evidence a Contract or other arrangement or
understanding among the Parties hereto unless and until this Agreement
is executed and delivered by all of the Parties hereto.

 



- 72 \- 

    

11.11 _Mutual Drafting_. The Parties hereto are sophisticated and have been
represented by attorneys throughout the transactions contemplated hereby who
have carefully negotiated the provisions hereof. As a consequence, the Parties
do not intend that the presumptions of Laws or rules relating to the
interpretation of contracts against the drafter of any particular clause
should be applied to this Agreement or any agreement or instrument executed in
connection herewith, and therefore waive their effects.

 

11.12 _Specific Performance_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the
Stockholders Agent acknowledge and agree that the rights of each Party to
consummate the Transactions are unique and recognize and affirm that a Party
would be irreparably harmed and such Party would not have any adequate remedy
at law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed by Parent, the Surviving Corporation (after the Closing) or
Merger Sub, in the case of the Company (prior to the Closing) and the
Stockholders Agent, or the Company (prior to the Closing) and the
Stockholders Agent, in the case of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
Merger Sub, in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Accordingly, the Parties agree that any Party shall be entitled to
seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which such Party is entitled at law or in
equity.

 

11.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, which together shall constitute a single agreement. Delivery of
an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile,
.pdf or electronic mail intended to preserve the original graphic and
pictorial appearance of the signature shall be effective as delivery of a
manually executed original counterpart of this Agreement.

11.14 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the sole benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, and nothing herein, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable
benefit, claim, cause of action, remedy or right of any kind, except as set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.2_, _Article IX_ and _Section_ __ _ 11.18_ which
shall inure to the benefit of the Persons expressly referenced therein and
benefiting therefrom, who are intended to be third-party beneficiaries
thereof, and none of such Sections may be amended, modified or waived in
manner adverse to such applicable third-party beneficiary thereof without the
consent of such third-party beneficiary.

 

11.15 _Time of Essence_ __. With regard to all dates and time periods set
forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

11.16 _ResMed Inc. Guarantee_. ResMed Inc. hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably guarantees to the Company and Stockholders Agent, as primary
obligor and not merely as surety, the due, punctual and complete discharge of
all payment and performance obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under this
Agreement, and all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Company and
Stockholders Agent in connection with their enforcement, if applicable, of
the payment obligations of Parent , Merger Sub and ResMed Inc. under this
Agreement (collectively, the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ "). To the fullest
extent permitted by law, ResMed Inc. hereby

 



- 73 \- 

    

 expressly and unconditionally waives (a) any and all rights to require the
Company and Stockholders Agent, as a condition of payment or performance of
ResMed Inc. to proceed against the Parent or Merger Sub or pursue any other
remedies whatsoever and (b) any defenses or benefits that may be derived from

sureties, except to the extent that any such defense is available to the
Parent. ResMed Inc. may not assign its obligations under this _Section_ __ _
11.16_ without the prior written consent of the Stockholders Agent. ResMed
Inc. agrees to the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 11.1_, _Section_ __ _
11.7_ and _Section_ __ _ 11.8_ as if it were a party thereto.

 

11.17 _Exclusivity of Representations and Warranties_.

 

(a) Except for the representations and warranties made by the Company in
_Article III_ (as modified by the Schedules thereto) and the Officers
Certificate deliverable under _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)_, the Company makes no
other representation or warranty of any kind or nature, express or implied, at
law or in equity, in respect of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective businesses, assets, liabilities, operations, prospects or
condition (financial or otherwise), or the Transactions, and the Company
disclaims any other representations or warranties, whether made by the Company
or any of its Affiliates, officers, directors, managers, equityholders,
employees, agents or Representatives. Except for the representations and
warranties contained in _Article III_ (as modified by the Schedules hereto) or
the other Transaction Documents, the Company hereby disclaims any other

statement or information made, communicated or furnished orally or in writing)
of any kind or nature, express or implied, to Parent and Merger Sub or their
Affiliates or Representatives (including as may be contained in any opinion,

in any opinion, information, projection or advice that may have been or may
be provided to the Company by any director, officer, manager, equityholder,
employee, agent, consultant or representative of Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates). The Company specifically disclaims that it is
relying upon or has relied upon any such other representations or warranties
that may have been made by Parent. The Company is entering into this
transaction subject only to the specific representations and warranties set
forth in _Article IV_ , the Officers Certificate deliverable under _Section_
__ _ 8.2(c)_ or in any Transaction Documents and subject to the
specifically bargained-for exclusive remedies as set forth in _Article IX_.

11.18 _No Recourse Against Non-Parties_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, (i) all claims
or causes of action (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise) that may be
based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation,

theory that seeks to impose liability of an entity party against its owners or
Affiliates) for any obligations or liabilities arising under, in connection
with or related to this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of
or by reason of this Agreement or its negotiation or execution, and each
party hereto waives and releases all such liabilities, claims and obligations
against any such Non-Party Affiliates. Non-Party Affiliates are expressly
intended as third-party beneficiaries of this provision of this Agreement.

 

11.19 _Legal Representation_. Parent and the Company (and the Surviving
Corporation after the Effective Time) hereby agree, on their own behalf and

and Affiliates, and each of their successors and assigns (all such parties,
the " _Waiving Parties_ "), that Sidley and BandL (or any successor) may
represent (a) any or all of the Company and the Stockholders or any of their
respective managers, directors, members, partners, officers, employees or
Affiliates, or (b) the Stockholders Agent, in each case in connection with
any dispute, litigation, claim, proceeding or obligation arising out of or

courier. 

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

Holder and delivered in original form to, and able to be authenticated by, the
Paying Agent in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 4.8_. 

---|---|--- 
 



5

         | (c) |

Paying Agent shall have no responsibility or liability for any losses or
damages of any nature that may arise from any action taken or not taken by
Paying Agent in reliance on a Wire Instruction, as a result of Holders
reliance upon or use of any particular method of delivering a Wire Instruction
to Paying Agent, including the risk of interception of such instruction and
misuse by third parties. 

---|---|--- 



     | (d) |

The parties hereby agree that if the Wilmington Trust FASTTRACK website is
used to deliver the Wire Instruction to Paying Agent, the following security
procedures shall be used: User I.D., password and other authentication factors
that Paying Agent may require, from time to time, in order to access
Wilmington Trust FASTTRACK. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (e) |

The parties acknowledge and agree that given their particular circumstances,
including the nature of its business, the size, type and frequency of its
instructions, transactions and files, internal procedures and systems, the
alternative security procedures offered by Paying Agent (e.g., in-person
delivery of the Wire Instruction to Paying Agent) and the security procedures
in general use by other customers and banks similarly situated, the security
procedures set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 4.8_ are a commercially
reasonable method of verifying the authenticity of a payment order in the
Wire Instruction. 

---|---|--- 



     | (f) |

Paying Agent is authorized to execute, and Parent and the Stockholders Agent
expressly agrees to be bound by any payment order in the Wire Instruction
issued in Holders (or his, her or its authorized representatives) name (and
associated funds transfer) (i) that is accepted by Paying Agent in accordance
with the security procedures set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 4.8_, whether
or not authorized by Holder and/or (ii) that is authorized by or on behalf of
Holder or for which Holder is otherwise bound under the law of agency, whether
or not the security procedures set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 4.8_ were
followed, and to debit any relevant account at Paying Agent for the amount of
the payment order amount. Notwithstanding anything else, Paying Agent shall be
deemed to have acted in good faith and without gross negligence or willful
misconduct if Paying Agent is authorized to execute the payment order under
this _Section_ __ _ 4.8_. Any action taken by Paying Agent pursuant to this
paragraph prior to Paying Agents actual receipt and acknowledgement of a
notice of revocation, cancellation or amendment of Wire Instruction shall not
be affected by such notice. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (g) |

The security procedures set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 4.8_ are intended to
verify the authenticity of a payment order in a Wire Instruction provided to
Paying Agent and are not designed to, and do not, detect errors in the
transmission or content of any payment order. Paying Agent is not responsible
for detecting an error in a payment order, regardless of whether any party
believes the error was apparent, and Paying Agent is not liable for any
damages arising from any failure to detect an error. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (h) |

When instructed to credit or pay a recipient account and/or recipient bank by
both name and a unique numeric or alpha-numeric identifier (e.g. account
number and ABA number), Paying Agent, and any other banks participating in the
funds transfer, may rely solely on the numerical or alpha-numeric identifier,
even if it identifies a recipient and/or recipient bank that is different
than the recipient or recipient bank named. Parent and Stockholders Agent
agree to be bound by the rules of any funds transfer network used in
connection with any payment order accepted by Paying Agent hereunder.  

---|---|--- 
 



6

         | (i) |

Paying Agent shall not be obliged to make any payment requested in a Wire
Instruction if it is unable to validate the authenticity of the request by
the security procedures set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 4.8_. Paying Agents
inability to confirm a payment order may result in a delay or failure to act
on that payment order. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement,
Paying Agent shall not be required to treat a payment order as having been
received until Paying Agent has authenticated it pursuant to the security
procedures in this  _Section_ __ _ 4.8_ and shall not be liable or
responsible for any losses or liability arising in connection with such delay
or failure to act. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (j) |

the Paying Agent is authorized to obtain confirmation of such funds transfer
instructions by means of a telephone call-back to one of the Authorized
Company Representatives at the telephone number(s) listed in _Section_ __ _
8.4_ below. The Paying Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone
purporting to be that Authorized Company Representative at the telephone
number(s) listed. The persons and telephone numbers designated for call-backs
may be changed only in a writing executed by Authorized Representatives of
the applicable party and actually received by Paying Agent via facsimile or as
a PDF attached to an email. No funds will be disbursed until an Authorized
Company Representative is able to confirm such instructions by
telephone callback. The Paying Agent and the beneficiarys bank in any funds
transfer may rely solely upon any account numbers or similar identifying
numbers provided by the parties and confirmed by an Authorized Company
Representative.

As part of the Letter of Transmittal process, the Paying Agent will solicit an
IRS Form W-9 or W-8 from each Holder as part of the Letter of Transmittal
process. 

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

The Paying Agent will solicit any additional information in connection with
IRS Form W-8 as the Paying Agent may require or deem necessary pursuant to
Chapters 3 and 4 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended and effective, and
the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder;  

---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

The Parent and the Stockholders Agent agree and acknowledge that the Paying
Agents duties are purely ministerial and upon the express written direction
of the Parent and is not the "Payor", "Middleman" or "Broker" on behalf of the
Parent as defined in Chapters 3, 4, 24 and 61 of the Code, Title 26, United
States Code, but is instead an agent on behalf of the Parent to report
payments from the Payment Fund on behalf of the Parent in accordance with this
Agreement. The 

---|---|--- 
 



7

         |  Paying Agent will apply federal and state backup withholding as
required by federal and state law and regulations on the applicable reportable
date for any Holder who has not provided a TIN or certified TIN, as required,
for the solicitations under _Section_ __ _ 5.1_ above; 
---|--- 



     | (d) |

The Parent hereby directs that the Paying Agent report, and the Paying Agent
shall timely report, as indicated:  

---|---|--- 



     | (1) |

Payments to Holders shall be prepared and transmitted on IRS Form 1099-B for
any US persons (actual or presumed). The Parent hereby directs the Paying
Agent to apply the cost basis reporting information set forth in _Schedule_ __
_ A_ for securities that are identified as "covered". The Paying Agent may
prepare 1099-B based on the information set forth in _Schedule_ __ _ A_ and
the Paying Agent shall have no responsibility whatsoever to independently
verify the accuracy of such information. In the case of any securities listed
on _Schedule_ __ _ A_ that are not identified as "covered" securities, as
defined in Section 6045(g) of the Code and as to which _Schedule_ __ _ A_
does not include all necessary information required to report accurate cost
basis, such securities shall be treated as non-covered securities
when reported. 

---|---|--- 



     | (2) |

Payments of Additional Amounts will be reported as directed jointly in writing
by Parent and the Stockholders Agent. 

---|---|--- 



     | (3) |

Parent and Paying Agent acknowledge that, pursuant Code Section 865(a)(2),
merger consideration paid on account of corporate shares is sourced to the
residency of the selling shareholder. As such, merger consideration, when paid
to NRA holders, is characterized as foreign source gross proceeds. The Paying
Agent and Parent acknowledge that foreign source gross proceeds are not
subject to withholding and reporting under Chapter 3 of the Code. The Paying
Agent and Parent further acknowledge that such payments may be considered
gross proceeds from the sale of assets that could produce U.S. source fixed,
determinable, annual, or periodic ("FDAP") income, and that, in accordance
with Reg. 1.1473-1(a) and Notice 2015-66, 2014-41 I.R.B. 541, such payments
are subject to withholding and reporting on Form 1042-S beginning January 1,
2019. In consideration of the preceding authority, Parent and Paying Agent
acknowledge that payments of gross proceeds to NRA holders, as determined
through the submission of adequate Form W-8 documentation upon which the
Paying Agent may rely to establish foreign beneficial ownership, are not
subject to withholding or reporting on Form 1042-S so long as the payment is
made prior to January 1, 2019.

Holders) and in its capacity as the Stockholders Agent, not in its

harmless from and against any tax, late payment, interest, penalty or other
cost or expense that may  

---|---|--- 
 



8

         |  be assessed against the Paying Agent arising out of or in
connection with the performance of the Paying Agents obligations under the
terms of this _Article_ __ _ V_ unless such tax, late payment, interest,
penalty or other expense was directly caused by the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Paying Agent, provided that such indemnification for
any tax, late payment, interest, penalty or other cost or expense shall be
borne one half by the Parent and one half by the Stockholders Agent (solely
on behalf of the Holders) and in its capacity as the Stockholders Agent, not
in its individual capacity). The indemnification provided by this section is

ARTICLE IX

 

Section 9.1 Confidential Data. The Paying Agent, Parent and the Stockholders
Agent acknowledge that during the course of this Agreement, the parties
hereto may make confidential data available to each other or may otherwise
obtain proprietary or confidential information regarding the Company, the
Holders or other rights owners, or the Paying Agent (collectively,
hereinafter "Confidential Data"). Confidential Data includes all information
not generally known or used by others and which gives, or may give the
possessor of such information an advantage over its competitors or which
could cause Parent, Stockholders Agent or the Paying Agent injury, loss of
reputation or loss of goodwill if disclosed. Such information includes, but is
not necessarily limited to, data or information which identifies past,
current or potential customers, Holders, business practices, financial
results, research, development, systems and plans; and/or certain information
and material identified by the Company, Parent or the Paying Agent as
"Proprietary" or "Confidential"; and/or data the Paying Agent furnishes to
Parent from the Paying Agents database; and/or data received from the Company
or Parent and enhanced by the Paying Agent. Confidential Data may be written,
oral, recorded, or maintained on other forms of electronic media. Because of
the sensitive nature of the information that Parent or the Paying Agent and
its employees or agents may obtain as a result of this Agreement, the intent
of the parties is that these provisions be interpreted as broadly as possible
to protect Confidential Data.

Section 9.2 Relief. The Paying Agent acknowledges that all Confidential Data
furnished by the Company, Stockholders Agent or Parent is considered
proprietary and strictly confidential. The Paying Agent also acknowledges that
the unauthorized use or disclosure of any Confidential Data may cause
irreparable harm to the Company or Parent. Accordingly, the Paying Agent
agrees that the Company or Parent shall be entitled to equitable relief,
including injunctive relief, in addition to all other remedies available at
law for any threatened or actual breach of this agreement or any threatened or
actual unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Data. Parent agrees that
the provisions and remedies of this section shall also apply to
Confidential Data received by the Company or Parent relating to the Paying
Agent.

Section 9.3 Security Measures. The Paying Agent will employ the same security
measures to protect Confidential Data received from the Company or Parent that
it would employ for its own comparable confidential information (but in no
event less than a reasonable degree of care in handling Confidential Data).
Without limiting the foregoing, the Paying Agent further agrees, subject to
applicable law and regulations, that: (i) Confidential Data shall not be
distributed, disclosed, or conveyed to any third party except by prior
written approval of the Parent; (ii) no copies or reproductions shall be made
of any Confidential Data, except as needed to provide the services described
in this Agreement; and (iii) the Paying Agent shall not use any Confidential
Data for its own benefit or for the benefit of any third party.

undersigned does not own or have any right to any other option, restricted

By submitting this Option Cancellation Agreement, the undersigned acknowledges

required under Section 11.2(iv) of the Option Plan. If the Options are not
exercised prior to [ ], 2018, and this Option Cancellation
Agreement is not timely signed and returned, the Options will be cancelled for
no consideration.

cancelled Company Options may be entitled, subject to the effectiveness
and irrevocability of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement, to the Closing Option Consideration Per Share set forth in

document(s) evidencing Options to be cancelled pursuant to this Option
Cancellation Agreement (the " _Option Documents_ "), or any other agreement
to which the Company and the undersigned are parties that in any way conflicts
with or otherwise prohibits or restricts the transactions contemplated by this
Option Cancellation Agreement or the Merger Agreement or the treatment of the
undersigneds Options hereunder or thereunder; and (iii) waives any and all
rights to any notice that may be required in connection with the Merger,
whether pursuant to the Option Plan, any of the Option Documents or any
other agreement to which the Company and the undersigned are parties. The
undersigned acknowledges that neither the Company nor any other party to the

deliver such documents and take such action reasonably deemed by the Company
to be necessary or desirable to effectuate the purposes and objectives of this
Option Cancellation Agreement, including the cancellation of
the undersigneds Options.

The undersigned hereby expressly acknowledges and agrees that the undersigned
shall _not_ have any right or ability to exercise the undersigneds Options
following the date of this Option Cancellation Agreement.

If the undersigned currently resides in California, the undersigned
acknowledges and agrees that he or she is familiar with Section 1542 of the
Civil Code of the State of California ("Section 1542"), which provides as
follows:

OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE,
WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."

Having read and understood section 1542, the undersigned hereby waives the
provisions of said section or any other similar provision of any jurisdiction
and assumes all risks for claims heretofore or hereinafter arising, known or
unknown, against any of the released parties relating to, arising out of or
in connection with any facts or circumstances that existed on or prior to the
effective time, whether known or unknown, to the undersigned, to the extent
otherwise addressed by this Option Cancellation Agreement and except as

irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court located in Wilmington,

or the Merger.

If any term or other provision of this Option Cancellation Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any requirement of Law,
rule, regulation or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Option Cancellation Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in a manner adverse to any party. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Option Cancellation Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest
extent possible.

THE UNDERSIGNED HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.

thereof), Stockholders Agent and Parent shall deliver a Joint Release
Instruction to the Escrow Agent to release an amount of the Escrow Funds equal
to such difference to Parent, or at Parents direction, to the Surviving
Corporation from the Escrow Funds. If the Escrow Funds are insufficient to
cover the amount of such shortfall resulting from the Merger Consideration
being less than the Estimated Merger Consideration, then the Escrow Agent
shall distribute all of the Escrow Funds to Parent, or at Parents direction,
to the Surviving Corporation.

(ii) An Authorized Officer of Parent may make a written claim or claims

Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 1.3(a)(iii). Any amounts retained in the
Escrow Funds to satisfy any pending but unresolved or unsatisfied claims under
the Merger Agreement shall be released to Stockholders Agent or Parent, as
applicable, upon final resolution of all such claims and upon Escrow Agents
receipt of (A) Joint Release Instruction or (B) Final Determination

 

(vi) All payments of any part of the Escrow Funds shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds pursuant to instructions as set forth
in _Schedule I_.

(b) In the event that Escrow Agent makes any payment to any other party
pursuant to this Escrow Agreement and for any reason such payment (or any
portion thereof) is required to be returned to the Escrow Account or another
party or is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or
preferential, set aside and/or required to be repaid to a receiver, trustee
or other party under any bankruptcy or insolvency law, other federal or state
law, common law or equitable doctrine, then the recipient shall repay within
five (5) Business Days to the Escrow Agent upon written request the amount
so paid to it.

 



3

    

(c) The Escrow Agent shall comply with a Final Determination with respect to
the Escrow Funds, including without limitation any attachment, levy or
garnishment. If the Escrow Agent complies with any such Final Determination,
then it shall not be liable to any Party or any other person by reason of such
compliance.

 

(d) In the event that a Party gives funds transfer instructions (other than in
writing at the time of execution of this Escrow Agreement), whether in
writing, by telecopier or otherwise, the Escrow Agent is authorized to seek
confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to the authorized
person or persons of such Party, and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the
confirmations of anyone purporting to be the person or persons so designated
provided no call back is required if the Escrow Agent receives original
instructions. The persons and telephone numbers for callbacks may be changed
only in a writing received and acknowledged by the Escrow Agent. The Parties
agree that such security procedure is commercially reasonable.

(e) The Escrow Agent will furnish monthly statements to the Parties setting
forth the activity in the Account.

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) "Final Determination" shall mean a
final non-appealable order of any Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction (including any arbitral award), which may be issued, together
with (A) a certificate of the prevailing Party to the effect that such
judgment is final and non-appealable and from a Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction having proper authority and (B) the written payment
instructions of the prevailing Party; and (ii) "Joint Release Instruction"
means the joint written instruction of the Parent and the Stockholders Agent,
which is executed by the Parent and the Stockholders Agent, to the Escrow
Agent directing the Escrow Agent to disburse all or a portion of the Escrow
Funds from the Escrow Account.

 

Section 1.4. _Security Procedure for Funds Transfer_. Concurrent with the
execution of this Escrow Agreement, the Parties shall deliver to the Escrow
Agent authorized signers forms in the form of _Exhibit B-1_ and _Exhibit B-2_
to this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall confirm each funds transfer
instruction received in the name of Parties by confirming with an authorized
individual as evidenced in _Exhibit B-1_ and _Exhibit B-2_. Once delivered to
the Escrow Agent, _Exhibit B-1_ or _Exhibit B-2_ may be revised or rescinded
only in writing signed by an authorized representative of the Party. Such
revisions or rescissions shall be effective only after actual receipt and
following such period of time as may be necessary to afford the Escrow Agent a
reasonable opportunity to act on it. If a revised _Exhibit B-1_ or _Exhibit
B-2_ or a rescission of an existing _Exhibit B-1_ or _Exhibit  B-2_ is
delivered to the Escrow Agent by an entity that is a successor-in-interest to
either party, such document shall be accompanied by additional documentation
satisfactory to the Escrow Agent showing that such entity has succeeded to the
rights and responsibilities of the Parties. The Parties understand that the
Escrow Agents inability to receive or confirm funds transfer instructions
may result in a delay in accomplishing such funds transfer, and agree that the
Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any loss caused by any such delay.

 

Section 1.5. _Income Tax Allocation and Reporting_.

 

(a) The Parties agree that, for tax reporting purposes, all interest and other
income from investment of the Escrow Amount shall, as of the end of each
calendar year and to the extent required by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended thereunder (the "Code"), be reported as having been earned by the
Parent, whether or not such income was disbursed during such calendar year.
The Escrow Agent shall be deemed the payor of any interest or other income
paid upon investment of the Escrow

 



4

    

 Funds for purposes of performing tax reporting. With respect to any other
payments made under this Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agents shall not be
deemed the payor and shall have no responsibility for performing tax
reporting. The Escrow Agents function of making such payments is solely
ministerial and upon express direction of the Parties.

 

(b) If IRS imputed interest rules apply to any disbursement of Escrow Funds,
the Parties shall jointly provide the Escrow Agent with all imputed interest
calculations. The Escrow Agent shall rely solely on such provided calculations
and information and shall have no responsibility for the accuracy or
completeness of any such calculations or information or for the failure of
the Parties to provide such calculations or information, provided that, for
purposes of clarity, the Parties shall be responsible solely for the accuracy
and completeness of the imputed interest calculations. The Escrow Agent shall
report the imputed interest on the applicable IRS Form 1099 (or IRS Form
1042-S) as required pursuant to the Code.

 

(c) Prior to closing, the Parties shall provide the Escrow Agent with
certified tax identification numbers by furnishing appropriate forms W-9 or
W-8 and such other forms and documents that the Escrow Agent may request. The
Parties understand that if such tax reporting documentation is not provided
and certified to the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent may be required by the
Code, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, to withhold a portion of any
interest or other income earned on the investment of the Escrow Funds.

 

(d) To the extent that the Escrow Agent becomes liable for the payment of any
taxes in respect of interest or other income derived from the investment of
the Escrow Funds, the Escrow Agent shall satisfy such liability to the extent
possible from the Escrow Funds. The Parties, jointly and severally, shall
indemnify, defend and hold the Escrow Agent harmless from and against any tax,
late payment, interest, penalty or other cost or expense that may be assessed
against the Escrow Agent on or with respect to the Escrow Funds and the
investment thereof unless such tax, late payment, interest, penalty or other
expense was directly caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
the Escrow Agent; provided, that if any Party is required to pay to the Escrow
Agent more than such Partys share, then each underpaying Party shall promptly
reimburse the overpaying Parties for such excess amount.

Section 1.6. _Termination_. Upon the disbursement of all of the Escrow Funds,
this Escrow Agreement shall terminate automatically without further action of
the Parties and be of no further force and effect.

ARTICLE 2

6

    

Section 3.3. _Resignation or Removal_. The Escrow Agent may resign by
furnishing written notice of its resignation to the Parties, and the Parties

the case may be, shall be effective thirty (30) calendar days after the

the Escrow Agent or in accordance with a court order. If the Parties

Agreement; provided, however, that in the event that the conditions for the
disbursement of funds under this Escrow Agreement are not fulfilled, or the
Escrow Agent renders any service not contemplated in this Escrow Agreement, or
there is any assignment of interest in the subject matter of this Escrow
Agreement, or any material modification hereof, or if any material controversy
arises hereunder, or the Escrow Agent is made a party to any litigation
pertaining to this Escrow Agreement or the subject matter hereof, then the
Escrow Agent shall be compensated for such extraordinary services and
reimbursed for all costs and expenses, including reasonable and documented
attorneys fees and expenses, occasioned by any such delay,
controversy, litigation or event. If any amount due to the Escrow Agent
hereunder is not paid within thirty (30) calendar days of the date due, the

conclusively rely upon an opinion of counsel to the effect that such order is
final, non-appealable and from a court of competent jurisdiction. Escrow Agent
