thereto calculated in accordance with Clause 4.1 and the term "Base
Cash Price" shall be construed to be such reduced amount;

the Vendors.

   9.4 | Operatorship 
---|--- 

Nothing in this Agreement shall transfer or be deemed to transfer
operatorship, or shall be interpreted as any assurance by the Vendors that
the Purchaser will be able to serve as operator with respect to any of the
WCBU Assets in which interests are held by Third Parties, whether or not such
WCBU Assets are presently operated by the Vendors. The Vendors shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to assist the Purchaser in seeking to obtain
operatorship with respect to any of the WCBU Assets operated by Vendors in
which interests are held by Third Parties, and such obligation shall survive
Closing, but shall otherwise have no liability to the Purchaser for any
Purchasers Losses and Liabilities as a result of the Purchaser not being
designated as the operator of the WCBU Lands, WCBU Major Facilities and
Pipelines or WCBU Tangibles operated by the Vendors prior to Closing.

---|--- 

The Vendors acknowledge and agree that the Purchaser will not have any

---|--- 



   (a) | The Vendors shall, at their sole cost and expense, prepare and
provide all Conveyance Documents required to convey the Vendors interest in
any WCBU Assets, and shall cooperate with the Purchaser to prioritize those
Conveyance Documents required for execution and delivery at Closing or as soon

the Vendors to assume or incur any obligation, or to provide any
representation or warranty, beyond that contained in this Agreement. To the
extent possible, the Vendors shall provide the Purchaser with draft copies of
Conveyance Documents for the Purchasers review as they become available. The
Parties shall be entitled to execute such documents utilizing electronic

cooperate with the Purchaser as reasonably required to secure execution of
such documents by such Third Parties thereafter. The Purchaser shall execute
and promptly return to the Vendors at least one copy of each such document and
the Vendors shall use reasonable efforts to obtain timely execution
and return of such documents by Third Parties wherever required. 
---|--- 



   (b) | The Vendors shall promptly after Closing and subject to Clause
14.2, register in the applicable registry all registerable transfers and
conveyances of the WCBU Assets (including pressure vessel registrations) and
shall make application to all applicable Governmental Authorities to change
the recorded name of all WCBU Wells, WCBU Tangibles and WCBU Major Facilities
and Pipelines forming part of the WCBU Assets. For registrable transfers which
are to be submitted electronically, the Vendors shall prepare and
electronically submit an application to the applicable Governmental Authority
for the licence transfer of the WCBU Wells, WCBU Tangibles and WCBU Major
Facilities and Pipelines, and the Purchaser shall electronically ratify and
sign such application. If the applicable Governmental Authority rejects any
licence transfer because of mis-description or other minor deficiencies in the
application, the Vendors shall as soon as practicable following receipt of
the rejection notice correct the application and amend and re-submit an
application for the licence transfers and the Purchaser shall electronically
ratify and sign such application. Purchaser will provide all emergency
response services post closing as if they were the recognized license holder
immediately upon Closing.

Interests described in paragraphs 1.1(ppppppppp)(v), 1.1(ppppppppp)(vi) and

---|---

trust declarations and agreements in respect of the White Map Area or portion
thereof, and the Parties shall enter into such Conveyance Documents as are
necessary to effect the transfer of such obligations to the Purchaser
effective as the Effective Time. 



   11.3 | Pipeline Licences 
---|--- 



   (a) | Upon execution of this Agreement, the Vendors shall: 
---|--- 



     | (i) | provide the Purchaser access to all Pipeline Records in the
Vendors possession; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | use commercially reasonable efforts to commence and obtain
prior to Closing, Pipeline Engineering Assessments for each and every Operated
Pipeline using the guidelines set forth in the "Pipeline Assessment Template"
contained in the folder indexed as item 1.10.5 in the Data Room Information. 
---|---|--- 



   (b) | In respect of Operating Pipelines, the evaluation criteria for
fitness for purpose and service shall be consistent with the current use of
such Operating Pipeline. In respect of an Operated Pipeline which is not
an Operating Pipeline, the evaluation criteria for fitness for purpose and
service shall be that of suspension or abandonment. The Parties agree that the
provision by Vendors of a Pipeline Engineering Assessment completed by Vendors
shall be an acceptable substitute in lieu of the rectification of any
deficiency in the Pipeline Records, in order for both Parties to make the
declarations required to comply with the regulatory requirements to transfer
the Operated Pipeline licences pursuant to the Pipeline Rules. To the extent
that the Vendors provide a Pipeline Engineering Assessment for an Operated
Pipeline, the Parties shall make such declarations as are required to effect
the Operated Pipeline transfer. 
---|--- 
 



   (c) | If a Pipeline Engineering Assessment in respect of an Operated
Pipeline provided by the Vendors does not demonstrate that the subject
Operated Pipeline is fit for its current purpose and service
("Deficient Pipeline Engineering Assessment"), then Vendors will disclose the
Deficient Pipeline Engineering Assessment to the appropriate Governmental
Authorities to the extent required under Applicable Laws, and the Parties
shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in rectifying any
deficiency, so as to expeditiously make the declarations required to effect
the Operated Pipeline transfer. If Vendors determine in their sole and
absolute discretion that they are reasonably able to rectify the deficiency
noted in any Deficient Pipeline Engineering Assessment prior to Closing,
Vendors shall take such steps to rectify such deficiency, subject to Clause
11.3(e). The existence of or determination that an Operated Pipeline is
a Deficient Pipeline following receipt of a Pipeline Engineering Assessment
shall constitute grounds to delay the transfer of the pipeline licences for
such Operated Pipelines until the deficiency is rectified to the mutual
satisfaction of the Parties, acting reasonably.

Assessments are provided, deficiencies identified in Deficient Pipeline
Engineering Assessments are rectified, and transfers of the licences thereof
from Vendors to the Purchaser are registered with the appropriate Governmental
Authority. Vendors shall hold licences for such Operated Pipelines in trust
pursuant to a trust agreement to be entered into by the Parties at Closing on
terms and conditions acceptable to the Parties, acting reasonably, which
agreement shall include a term that it automatically terminates in respect of
any Operated Pipeline held pursuant thereto being transferred in
accordance with the Pipeline Rules. 
---|---|--- 



   (e) | All costs incurred in the preparation of such Pipeline
Engineering Assessments before Closing shall be borne solely by the Vendors
and all costs incurred in the either the preparation of a Pipeline
Engineering Assessment after Closing or the rectification of a Deficient
Pipeline Engineering Assessment, whether rectified prior to or after Closing,
shall be borne solely by the Purchaser provided that Closing occurs, and there

the Vendors assignment to an operator approved by both the Purchaser and the
working interest owners in accordance with the WCBU Title and Operating
Document governing such WCBU Asset.

     | (i) | whether or not the Purchaser requested prior determination
of the relevant Governmental Authority transfer conditions under this Clause
11.4, if for any reason the relevant Governmental Authority requires a Party
to make a deposit in order to approve the licence or authorization transfer,
such Party shall and covenants to immediately make such deposit;

and the Vendors shall comply with such instruction, to undertake all
reasonable action in order to effect the transfer of the operating licence for

represents a fair and equitable allocation of the risks and liabilities that
each Party has agreed to assume in connection with the subject matter hereof
and is not an agreement within the provision of subsection 7(2) of the
Limitations Act (Alberta). 
---|--- 



   (c) | No Party shall make an indemnification claim or be entitled to
recover hereunder with respect to a breach of any warranty, covenant or

Agreement unless and until the aggregate amount of the liability for all
Claims or Losses and Liabilities to indemnified Persons hereunder exceeds
[***] US Dollars (USD $[***]) (converted into Canadian Dollars in accordance

Purchaser shall be recoverable from COPCO and the Vendors and all Losses and
Liabilities of COPCO and Vendors shall be recoverable from the Purchaser, as
applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, the Vendors shall be treated as one
Party for the purpose of applying the monetary limits or thresholds in this
