</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of July&nbsp;30, 2006 (this &#147;Agreement&#148;), by and among
SanDisk Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the &#147;Parent&#148;), Project Desert Ltd., an Israeli company
and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent (&#147;Merger Sub&#148;), and msystems Ltd., an Israeli

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. The Parent and the Company intend to enter into a transaction whereby Merger Sub will merge
(the &#147;Merger&#148;) with and into the Company by way of a court approved arrangement between the Company
and its shareholders and (if applicable) creditors, in accordance with Sections&nbsp;350 and 351 of the
Companies Law 5759-1999 of the State of Israel (the &#147;Companies Law&#148;), following which Merger Sub
will cease to exist and the Company will become a direct wholly owned Subsidiary (as defined in
Section&nbsp;8.7(g)) of the Parent, and the Company Shares (as defined in Section&nbsp;1.3(b)) will be
exchanged for shares of Parent Common Stock (as defined in Section&nbsp;1.3(b)), all in accordance with
this Agreement and the Companies Law.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. The board of directors of the Company has: (i)&nbsp;determined that this Agreement, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the &#147;Transactions&#148;) are
fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its shareholders, and that, considering the
financial position of the merging companies, no reasonable concern exists that the Surviving
Company will be unable to fulfill the obligations of the Company to its creditors; (ii)&nbsp;approved
this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions; and (iii)&nbsp;determined to recommend to the
shareholders of the Company the approval of this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. The board of directors of each of the Parent and Merger Sub has approved this Agreement,
the Merger and the other Transactions, and the board of directors of Merger Sub has determined
that, considering the financial position of the merging companies, no reasonable concern exists
that the Surviving Company will be unable to fulfill the obligations of Merger Sub to its
creditors.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and as a condition to and inducement of
the Parent&#146;s willingness to enter into this Agreement: (i)&nbsp;the directors, officers and shareholders
of the Company set forth on Schedule&nbsp;A are entering into voting undertakings in substantially the
form attached as Exhibit&nbsp;A (the &#147;Voting Undertakings&#148;); (ii)&nbsp;the Chief Executive Officer of the
Company is entering into a noncompetition agreement with the Parent (the &#147;Noncompetition

forth on Schedule&nbsp;B who may be deemed to be affiliates of the Company within the meaning of Rule
145 promulgated under the United States Securities Act of 1933 (the &#147;Securities Act&#148;) are entering
into affiliate agreements in substantially the form attached as Exhibit&nbsp;B (the &#147;Affiliate
Agreements&#148;); (iv)&nbsp;the Chief Executive Officer of the Company is entering into a market stand-off
agreement in substantially the form attached as Exhibit&nbsp;C (the &#147;Lock-Up Agreement&#148;); and (v)&nbsp;the
directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries set forth on
