 _AGREEMENT_  

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements set forth herein the parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: 

   

ARTICLE 1 
 THE MERGER 

   

 Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver (where permissible) of the conditions set forth in Article 6, at the Effective Time, (a) Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (sometimes referred to as the "Surviving Company") and shall become a direct wholly owned Subsidiary of the Parent and shall succeed to and assume all of the rights, properties and obligations of Merger Sub; and (b) all Company Shares will be converted into the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.3, all in accordance with the provisions of the Court Approval (as defined in Section 5.2(a)), the Companies Law and this Agreement. 

  

 Section 1.2 _Closing Date_. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver (where permissible) of the conditions set forth in Article 6, the closing of the Transactions, including the Merger (the "Closing"), shall take place at the offices of Naschitz, Brandes and Co., 5 Tuval Street, Tel Aviv, Israel (or at such other place as may be mutually designated by the parties), at a time and on a date to be mutually designated by the parties (the date or time upon which the Closing actually occurs is referred to as the "Closing Date" or the "Effective Time," as applicable), which shall be no later than the second Business Day (as defined in Section 8.7(b)) (or such other period of time mutually agreed to by the parties) following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 6 (other than those conditions which by their terms are to be satisfied or waived as of the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at such time), including the receipt of the Court Approval. 

  

 Section 1.3 _Effect on Capital Stock_. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver (where permissible) of the conditions set forth in Article 6, at the Closing Date, subject to the provisions of the Court Approval, the following shall occur: 

   ##### 

  

   

 (a) Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the Surviving Company. 

   

 (b) Each Ordinary Share, NIS 0.001 par value per share, of the Company (the "Company Shares"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any Company Shares owned by any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Company or dormant shares of the Company, shall automatically be converted into and represent solely the right to receive (the "Per Share Consideration") 0.76368 (the "Exchange Ratio") of a validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of the Common Stock, $ 0.001 par value per share, of the Parent (together with the related Parent Rights (as defined below), the "Parent Common Stock"), subject to the provisions of Sections 1.3(e) and 1.3(f), payable to the holder of such Company Share upon surrender of the certificate representing such Company Share in the manner provided in Section 1.4 (or in the case of a lost, stolen, destroyed or unissued certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit and bond in the manner provided in Section 1.6). As of the Effective Time, all of the Company Shares shall automatically be owned by the Parent, and will be registered in its name in the shareholders registry of the Company. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.3(b), at the Effective Time, each Company Share that is a dormant share or owned by any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding, shall not be converted under Section 1.3(b) and no Per Share Consideration shall be delivered with respect thereto. 

   

 (d) At the Effective Time: 

  

 (i) all options to purchase Company Shares ("Company Share Options") and all stock appreciation rights with respect to Company Shares ("Company SARs") then outstanding under the Companys Omnibus 2003 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Incentive Plan and 1996 Section 102 Stock Option Plan (in their original form and as they may have been amended and/or restated prior to the date hereof, collectively, the "Company Option Plans"), and under any agreement with the Company described in Section 2.3 of the Company Disclosure Letter (as defined in Article 2), in each case, whether vested or unvested, and the Company Option Plans itself, shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 5.10 hereof, be assumed by the Parent in accordance with Section 5.10; and 

  

 (ii) all of the Companys Convertible Notes (as defined in Section 2.3(a)) shall be treated as set forth in Section 5.11. 

   

 (e) Without derogating from any other provision of this Agreement, the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any forward or reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Shares), cash dividends, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or 

   ##### 

  

   

other like change with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock or Company
Shares occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective
Time. 

   

 (f) No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of Company Shares who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that would otherwise be received by such holder) shall, upon surrender of such holders Certificates (as defined in Section 1.4(c)), or affidavit and the posting of a bond in the manner provided in Section 1.6, receive from the Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the product of (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the average closing price of one share of Parent Common Stock for the five consecutive trading days that the Parent Common Stock has traded ending on and including the second trading day immediately prior to the Effective Time, as reported on The NASDAQ Stock Market ("Nasdaq"). 

  

 Section 1.4 _Surrender of Certificates_. 

   

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Parent shall select ComputerShare Trust Company or another bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") to receive the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable under Section 1.3. 

   

 (b) At or as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for exchange in accordance with this Article 1, the shares of Parent Common Stock, issuable pursuant to Section 1.3 in exchange for outstanding Company Shares. In addition, the Parent shall make available from time to time, if and as necessary after the Effective Time, cash in an amount sufficient for payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.3(f) and for payment of any dividends or distributions to which holders of Company Shares may be entitled pursuant to Section 1.4(d). Such funds shall be held in trust by the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the applicable holders of Company Shares. 

   

 (c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of the Effective Time) of one or more certificates (the "Certificates") which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Company Shares, whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Per Share Consideration pursuant to Section 1.3 (or Company Shares held in book-entry form): (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall contain customary provisions with respect to delivery of an "agents message" with respect to Company Shares in book-entry form), (ii) a declaration form in which the holder of record states whether the holder is a resident of Israel as defined in the Income Tax Ordinance of Israel [New Version], 1961 (the "Ordinance"), and (iii) instructions in customary form for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Company Shares in book-entry form in exchange for the Per Share Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation or delivery of an "agents message" to 

   ##### 

  

   

the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by the
Parent, together with such letter of transmittal and such declaration form,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, the holders of such Certificates or Company Shares in book-entry
form shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Per Share
Consideration into which their the Company Shares were converted at the
Effective Time (rounded to the nearest whole share after aggregating all
Company Shares held by such holder), and the Certificates or book-entry
Company Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest shall
accrue or be paid on the amounts payable pursuant to Section 1.3 upon
the surrender of any Certificate for the benefit of the holder of such
Certificate or upon or delivery of an "agents message" for the benefit of
the holder of book-entry shares. Until so surrendered, outstanding
Certificates will be deemed from and after the Effective Time for
all corporate purposes to evidence only the right to receive the Per Share
Consideration into which such Company Shares have been converted and, if
applicable, an amount of cash in lieu of the issuance of any fractional
shares in accordance with Section 1.3(f) and any dividends or distributions
payable pursuant to Section 1.4(d). Until an "agents message" is
delivered, book-entry positions will be deemed from and after the Effective
Time for all corporate purposes to evidence only the right to receive the Per
Share Consideration into which such Company Shares have been converted and,
if applicable, an amount of cash in lieu of the issuance of any fractional

determination, notification, advisory and/or opinion letter, as applicable,

Companys Knowledge, there has been no event, condition or circumstance that
has adversely affected or is likely to adversely affect such qualified
status, except such events, conditions or circumstances which could be
corrected without the Company incurring a material liability. No Company
Employee Plan provides health benefits that are not fully insured through an
insurance contract. 

   

 (f) No Company Employee Plan provides, or reflects or represents any liability material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to provide post-termination life, health or other welfare benefits to any person for any reason, except as may be required by Section 601 through 608 of ERISA or other applicable statute.

 (h) No work stoppage or labor strike against the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is pending, threatened or reasonably anticipated. The Company does not know of any activities or proceedings of any labor union to organize any Employees. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in any unfair labor practices within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company is presently, nor has it been in the past, a party to, or bound by, any collective bargaining agreement or union contract with respect to Employees and no collective bargaining agreement is being negotiated by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company. 

   

 (i) Each International Employee Plan has been established, maintained and administered in material compliance with its terms and conditions and with the requirements prescribed by any and all Legal Requirements that are applicable to such International Employee Plan. Furthermore, no International Employee Plan has unfunded liabilities, that as of the Effective Time, will not be offset by insurance or fully accrued. Except as required by Legal Requirement, no condition exists that would prevent the Surviving Company, its Subsidiaries or the Parent from terminating or amending any International Employee Plan at any time for any reason without liability to the Surviving Company or its ERISA Affiliates (other than ordinary administration expenses or routine claims for benefits). 

   

 (j) Solely with respect to Employees who reside or work in Israel ("Israeli Employees"): (i) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company is a party to any collective bargaining contract, collective labor agreement or other contract or 

   ##### 

  

    

arrangement with a labor union, trade union or other organization or body

contributions to appropriate insurance funds or accrued on the Companys
financial statements; and (iv) the Company and the Subsidiaries of the
Company are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable legal
requirements and contracts relating to employment, employment practices,
wages, bonuses and other compensation matters and terms and conditions
of employment related to its Israeli Employees, including The Prior Notice to
the Employee Law 2002, The Notice to Employee (Terms of Employment) Law 2002,
the Prevention of Sexual Harassment Law (5758-1998), and The Employment by
Human Resource Contractors Law 1996. The Company and the Subsidiaries of the
Company have not engaged any employees whose employment would require special
Approvals, and there are no unwritten Company policies or customs which, by
extension, could entitle Israeli Employees to benefits in addition to what
they are entitled by law. "Israeli Employee" shall be construed to include
consultants, sales agents and other independent contractors who would be
deemed to be employees for purposes of Israeli labor laws. All of the Israeli
Employees are terminable by the Company on 30 days notice or less.

the Companys shareholders under applicable Legal Requirements; (iv) the

Whenever any event occurs which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any such document or filing, the Company or the Parent, as the case may be, shall promptly inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the applicable Government Entity, such amendment or supplement. 

   

 (e) As soon as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the Parent shall cause its Israeli counsel to prepare and file with the Israeli Securities Authority an application for an exemption from the requirements of the Israeli Securities Law (1968) concerning the publication of a prospectus in respect of the exchange of the Company Options for the Assumed Options, pursuant to Section 15D of the Securities Law of Israel. The Company shall cooperate with the Parent in connection with the preparation and filing of such application and in the preparation of any written or oral submissions that may be necessary, proper or advisable to obtain such exemption. 

  

 Section 5.5 _Confidentiality; Access to Information_. 

   

 (a) Upon reasonable notice, except (i) as the Company reasonably determines (after consultation with Parent and receiving and considering the advice of the Companys outside counsel), is required by applicable Legal Requirements, or (ii) as would be reasonably expected to violate or result in a loss or impairment of any 

   ##### 

  

    

attorney-client or work-product privilege (it being understood that the
parties shall use reasonable best efforts to cause such information to be
provided in a manner that does not result in such violation, loss or
impairment, which reasonable best efforts shall include entering into one or
more joint defense or community of interest agreements on customary terms if
counsels to the parties reasonably conclude that such agreements are likely to
preserve the privilege (the "Privilege Exception")), the Company shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the Parent and to its
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours during the
period prior to the Effective Time to all its properties, books,
contracts, commitments, personnel and records so that the Parent may obtain
all information concerning the business as its may reasonably request
(including the status of product development efforts and, to the extent
available to the Company after reasonable inquiry, summaries of fees and
expenses incurred or paid or reasonably expected to be incurred or paid by
the Company or its Subsidiaries to legal, accounting and other professional
service advisors in connection with the Transactions (including the Restated
Financials and the Options Matters)) (provided that Parent and its
representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company), and
during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to the Parent (i) a copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it during
such period pursuant to the requirements of U.S. or Israeli federal or state
securities laws and (ii) all other information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as the Parent may reasonably request (including the
Companys outside accountants work papers). 

   

 (b) Any information obtained by either party pursuant to this Section 5.5 shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement dated June 29, 2006, between the Parent and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall not, and shall each use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause its representatives not to, use information obtained pursuant to this Section 5.5 for any purpose unrelated to consummation of the Transactions. No review or information obtained pursuant to this Section 5.5 shall limit the Parents or Merger Subs reliance on or the enforceability of any representation or warranty made by the Company herein. 

  

 Section 5.6 _No Solicitation_. 

   

 (a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time or termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article 7, and except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries will not, nor will they authorize or knowingly permit any of their respective officers, directors, controlled affiliates or employees or any of their respective investment bankers, attorneys or other advisors or representatives to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, or take an action intended to encourage or induce the making, submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal; (ii) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than any officer, director, controlled 

    ##### 

 

    

affiliate or employee of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any
investment banker, attorney or other advisor or representative of the Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries) regarding, or furnish to any Person any
information with respect to, or take any other action intended to facilitate
any inquiries or the making of, any proposal that constitutes or may
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal; (iii) approve,
endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal; or (iv) enter into any letter
of intent or similar document or any contract, agreement or commitment
contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Transaction.
Notwithstanding the above, prior to the approval of this Agreement and the
Merger by the Companys shareholders at the Company General Meeting and (if
applicable) by the Companys creditors at the creditors meetings, nothing
contained in this Agreement (including this Section 5.6) shall prohibit the
board of directors of the Company, in response to an unsolicited Acquisition
Proposal that is not withdrawn, from engaging or participating in discussions
or negotiations with and furnishing information to the party making such
Acquisition Proposal, _provided_ that the board of directors of the Company:
(A) in good faith after consultation with the Companys financial advisors,
concludes that the offer constitutes or could reasonably be expected to
result in or lead to a Superior Proposal, and (B) determines in good faith
after consultation with its outside legal counsel that such action is required
in order for the board of directors of the Company to comply with its
fiduciary obligations to the Companys shareholders under applicable Legal
Requirements; and _provided further_ that (x) concurrently with furnishing
any such information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with,
such party, the Company gives the Parent written notice of the identity
of such Person or group and of the Companys intention to furnish information
to, or enter into discussions or negotiations with, such party and (y) the
Company receives from such party an executed confidentiality agreement at
least as restrictive as the Confidentiality Agreement; and (z) prior to or
contemporaneously with furnishing any such information to such party,
the Company furnishes such non-public information to the Parent (to the
extent such information has not been previously furnished by the Company to
the Parent). The Company and its Subsidiaries will immediately cease any and
all existing discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. 

   

 For purposes of this Agreement: (i) "Acquisition Proposal" means any offer or proposal (other than an offer or proposal by the Parent or Merger Sub) relating to an Acquisition Transaction; (ii) "Acquisition Transaction" shall mean any transaction or series of related transactions other than the Transactions involving: (A) any acquisition or purchase from the Company by any Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) of more than a 15% interest in the total outstanding voting securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) beneficially owning 15% or more of the total outstanding voting securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any merger, consolidation, business combination, arrangement or similar transaction involving the Company pursuant to which the shareholders of the Company immediately preceding such transaction hold less than 85% of the equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction; (B) any sale, lease, exchange, transfer, license or 

   ##### 

  

 

disposition (other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice) of more than 15% of the consolidated assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or of the consolidated assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries to which 15% or more of the Companys and its
Subsidiaries revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable;
or (C) any liquidation, dissolution, recapitalization or other significant
corporate reorganization of the Company; and (iii) "Superior Proposal" shall
mean any bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal to acquire at
least 75% of the outstanding voting securities of the Company or all
or substantially all of the assets of the Company: (A) with respect to which
the board of directors of the Company shall have in good faith determined
(taking into account the advice of the Companys financial advisors) that the
acquiring party is capable of consummating such proposed
Acquisition Transaction on the terms proposed; and (B) the board of directors
of the Company shall have in good faith determined (taking into account the
advice of the Companys financial advisors) that the proposed Acquisition
Transaction, taking into account all the terms and conditions of
such Acquisition Proposal including the reasonably expected time for the
consummation of such Acquisition Transaction, is more favorable to the
shareholders of the Company, from a financial point of view, than the
Transactions (taking into account any proposed modifications by the Parent in
response thereto). 

    

 (b) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Section 5.6(a), the Company as promptly as practicable, and in any event within 48 hours, shall notify the Parent of: (i) any request for information in connection with, or which the Company reasonably concludes would lead to, any Acquisition Proposal; (ii) the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry with respect to or which the Company reasonably concludes would lead to any Acquisition Proposal; (iii) the material terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry; and (iv) the identity of the Person or group making any such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall keep the Parent informed in all material respects of the status and details (including material amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. In addition to the foregoing, the Company shall: (i) provide the Parent with at least 48 hours prior written notice (or such lesser prior notice as provided to the members of the board of directors of the Company) of any meeting of the board of directors of the Company at which the board of directors of the Company is reasonably expected to consider an Acquisition Proposal; and (ii) provide the Parent with at least three Business Days prior written notice (or such lesser prior notice as provided to the members of the board of directors of the Company) of any meeting of the board of directors of the Company at which the board of directors of the Company is reasonably expected to recommend a Superior Proposal to its shareholders and together with such notice a copy of drafts of definitive documentation relating to such Superior Proposal. 

   

 (c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the board of directors of the Company from taking and disclosing to the Companys shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or Section 329 of the Companies Law or any other applicable Legal Requirements; _provided, however_ , that, except as contemplated by Section 5.2(e), neither the board of directors of the Company nor any committee 

   ##### 

  

    

thereof shall withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a
manner adverse to the Parent, its recommendation in favor of the approval of
this Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions or recommend an
Acquisition Proposal. In addition, it is understood and agreed that, for all
purposes of this Agreement, a factually accurate public statement by
the Company that describes the Companys receipt of an Acquisition Proposal
and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto, or any "stop, look
and listen" communication by the Board of Directors of the Company pursuant
to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act or any other applicable Legal
Requirements, or any similar communication to the shareholders of the
Company, shall not constitute a Triggering Event or a withdrawal or
modification or supplement, or proposal by the board of directors of the
Company to withdraw or modify or supplement, such boards recommendation of
this Agreement or the Transactions, or an approval or recommendation with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal. 

  

 Section 5.7 _Public Disclosure_. The Parent and the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to consult with each other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review any press release or other public statements with respect to the Merger and the other Transactions, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as either party may determine is required by applicable Legal Requirements, the SEC or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or national trading system (in which case reasonable efforts to consult with the other party will be made prior to any such release or public statement). Each of Parent and the Company may make any public statement in response to specific questions by the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences or financial analyst conference calls, so long as such statements are substantially similar to previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by the Parent or the Company in accordance with this Section 5.7. The parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the Transactions shall be a joint release in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties. 

  

 Section 5.8 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Regulatory Filings_. 

   

 (a) Subject to Section 5.2(e), Section 5.6, Section 5.9 and the last sentence of this Section 5.8, the parties hereto will use their respective reasonable best efforts to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby and to cause the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article 6 to be satisfied, including using their respective reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or non-actions, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities necessary in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the making of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Entities) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity necessary in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions to be performed or consummated by such party in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, including seeking to 

   ##### 

  

    

have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other
Governmental Entity vacated or reversed and (iii) the execution and delivery
of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and other
transactions to be performed or consummated by such party in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement and to fully carry out the purposes of
this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto shall promptly make its respective
filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions under the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 (b) Each of the parties hereto will furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with the preparation of any required governmental filings or submissions and will cooperate in responding to any inquiry from a Governmental Entity, including as promptly as practicable informing the other party of such inquiry and consulting with the other party in advance before making any presentations or submissions to a Governmental Entity. Each of the Company and the Parent shall notify the other promptly upon the receipt of any comments or other communication from any government officials and of any request by any government officials for amendments or supplements to any filing with any applicable Governmental Entity, or for additional information and shall supply the other with copies of all correspondence between such party or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and any government officials, on the other hand, with respect to any such filing. Each of the Parent and the Company shall provide the other with a reasonable opportunity to review and provide comments on any such filings, correspondence or communications. Whenever any event occurs which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any such filing pursuant hereto, the Company or the Parent, as the case may be, shall promptly inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with any government officials, and/or mailing to the shareholders or (if applicable) creditors of the Company, such amendment or supplement (and shall provide the other with a reasonable opportunity to review and provide comments on any such amendment or supplement). For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the Privilege Exception, the filings, correspondence and communications referenced in this Section 5.8(b) shall include all filings, correspondence and communications by the Company with the SEC or any other Governmental Entity with respect to the Restated Financials and the Options Matters. 

   

 (c) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree to use their reasonable best efforts (which shall include vigorous litigation on the merits) to (i) avoid or eliminate each and every impediment and obtain all consents under any applicable Antitrust Law that may be required by any U.S. or foreign federal, state or local antitrust or competition Governmental Entity, in each case with competent jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties to close the Transactions as promptly as practicable or to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of or vacate or lift, any decree, order, ruling, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or other similar order that would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) ensure that (A) no requirement for any non-action, consent or approval of the United States Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of 

   ##### 

  

    

Justice, any authority enforcing applicable Antitrust Law, any State Attorney
General or other Governmental Entity, (B) no decree, judgment, injunction,
temporary restraining order or any other order in any suit or proceeding, and
(C) no other matter relating to any antitrust or competition Law would, in
each case under this clause (ii), preclude consummation of the Merger by the
End Date (without giving effect to Section 7.1(b)(y) hereof), including (in
the case of Parent under clauses (i) and (ii)) by agreeing (by consent decree
or otherwise) to a reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing policy with
respect to its and its Subsidiaries (and the Surviving Companys) patents (a
"Licensing Policy"). To the extent practicable and permitted by regulatory
officials, Parent shall provide the Company and its counsel with
reasonable opportunity to attend meetings with regulatory officials relating
to the matters set forth in this Section 5.8. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Parent shall have the right to direct and control any litigation, negotiation
or other action relating to the antitrust matters set forth in this Section
5.8(c) with counsel of its own choosing. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall require the
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company (and the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, agree) to: (i) to dispose of or transfer or
cause any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of or transfer any assets, or to
commit to cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of or
transfer any assets; (ii) to discontinue or cause any of its Subsidiaries to
discontinue offering any product or service, or to commit to cause the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to discontinue offering any product or
service; (iii) subject to any Licensing Policy, to license or otherwise
make available, or cause any of its Subsidiaries to license or otherwise make
available, to any Person, any technology, software or other proprietary
asset, or to commit to cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
license or otherwise make available to any Person any technology, software or
other proprietary asset; (iv) to hold separate or cause any of its
Subsidiaries to hold separate any assets or operations (either before or
after the Closing Date), or to commit to cause the Surviving Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to hold separate any assets or operations; or (v) subject
to the undertakings required by Section 5.4 and the commitments herein
regarding a Licensing Policy, to make or cause any of its Subsidiaries to make
any commitment (to any Governmental Entity or otherwise) regarding its future
operations or the future operations of the Surviving Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or that would affect its discretion in determining the terms of
any Contract or relationship with any Person. 

  

 Section 5.9 _Third Party Consents_. As soon as practicable following the date hereof, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any consents, waivers and approvals under any of its or its Subsidiaries respective Contracts (including those Contracts set forth or required to be set forth in Section 2.5(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter) required to be obtained in connection with the consummation of the Transactions; provided that the Company shall not be required to (i) make any material financial accommodation or (ii) pay or commit to pay to any such Person whose consent is being solicited any material amount of cash or other consideration, or make any commitment to incur any other material liability or other obligation due to such Person. 

  

 Section 5.10 _Share Options, SARs and Employee Benefits_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Share Option and Company SAR under the Company Option Plans or under any agreement disclosed in Section 2.3 of the Company Disclosure Letter, whether or not vested, shall by virtue of the Transaction be assumed by the Parent. Except as set forth in Section 5.10(e), each Company Share Option and Company SAR so assumed by the Parent under this Agreement will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions of such options immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any repurchase rights or vesting provisions and provisions regarding the acceleration of vesting on certain transactions), except that: (i) each Company Share Option will be solely exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of Company Shares that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Share Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Share Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per Company Share at which such Company Share Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent; (iii) each Company SAR will be solely exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) with respect to that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of Company Shares that were subject to such Company SAR immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; and (iv) the per share exercise price with respect to such assumed Company SAR will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per Company Share at which such Company SAR was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. The Parent shall comply with the terms of all such Company Share Options and Company SARs and use its reasonable best efforts to ensure, to the extent required by, and subject to the provisions of, the Company Option Plans and permitted under the Code or other relevant Legal Requirements that any Company Share Options that qualified for tax treatment under Section 422 of the Code prior to the Effective Time and that any Company Share Options that qualified for tax treatment under Section 102 of the Ordinance prior to the Effective Time continue to so qualify, with the same rights, after the Effective Time. The Parent shall take all corporate actions necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of the Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of all Company Share Options and Company SARs pursuant to the terms set forth in this Section 5.10(a). Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this Section 5.10(a). 

   

 (b) The Company shall terminate, effective as of the day immediately preceding the Effective Time, any and all Company Employee Plans intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (the "401(k) Plans") unless the Parent provides notice to the Company that such 401(k) Plan(s) shall not be terminated. Prior to the Closing Date, the Parent shall receive from the Company evidence that the 401(k) Plans have been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the relevant entitys 

   ##### 

  

    

board of directors (the form and substance of such resolutions shall be
subject to review and approval of the Parent), effective as of the day
immediately preceding the Effective Time. 

   

 (c) On and for one year after the Effective Time, the Parent and/or any of the Parents Subsidiaries shall arrange for each employee who resides in the United States of America and was participating in any of the Company Employee Plans immediately before the Effective Time, to participate in any counterpart benefit plans in the United States of America in which employees of the Parent participate (the "U.S. Counterpart Plans"), in accordance with the eligibility criteria thereof, _provided that_ : (i) such participants shall receive full credit for years of service with any one or more of the Company, any the Company Subsidiary and prior employers to the extent such service is taken into account under such the Company Employee Plans and to the extent such service credit does not result in the duplication of benefits and (ii) such participants shall participate in the U.S. Counterpart Plans on terms no less favorable than those offered by the Parent to its similarly situated employees. Provided that the Company or the applicable employee timely provides the Parent and/or its Subsidiaries with the information necessary to comply with this provision, the Parent and/or its Subsidiaries shall give credit under those of its U.S. Counterpart Plans that are welfare benefit plans for all amounts credited toward deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums, and time accrued against applicable waiting periods, by employees (in each case including their eligible dependents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in respect of the applicable plan year in which the Effective Time occurs. With respect to its medical plans, the Parent and/or its Subsidiaries shall waive all requirements for evidence of insurability and pre-existing conditions otherwise applicable to employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under the U.S. Counterpart Plans in which employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries become eligible to participate on or following the Effective Time (to the extent that such conditions were covered under the Company Employee Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time). Notwithstanding the forgoing, the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries may continue one or more of the Company Employee Plans, in which case the Parent and its Subsidiaries shall have satisfied their obligations hereunder with respect to the benefits so provided. Nothing in this Section 5.10(d) shall be construed to entitle any employee to continue his or her employment for any period of time or prevent the Parent from amending any of the U.S. Counterpart Plans or the Company employee benefit plans at any time;  _provided, however,_ that no such amendment shall be made or given effect within one year after the Effective Time to the extent that such amendment would result in persons employed with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective Time having benefits, in the aggregate, that are less favorable than the benefits provided to similarly-situated employees of the Parent. 

   

 (d) Without limiting the generality of Section 8.9(b), nothing in this Agreement is intended to confer any rights or remedies on any employee, former employee, dependent or beneficiary. 

   

 (e) (i) Effective on the Closing Date, the Company Share Options and Company SARs granted to individuals who are employees of the Company as of the 

   ##### 

  

    

Closing Date ("Employee Holders") shall be amended to provide that during the
two year period beginning on the Closing Date, the vesting of any and all
such options shall accelerate to the extent set forth below upon (x) the
involuntary termination of the employment of the Employee Holder, other than
for Cause, by the Parent or (y) upon the voluntary termination of the
employment of the Employee Holder due to Good Reason. "Cause" shall mean, as
reasonably determined by the Parent based on the information available to it
after due inquiry, (1) "Misconduct," as defined in the Parents Amended and
Restated 2005 Incentive Plan as in effect on the date hereof, or (2) the
material failure of the Employee Holder to carry out the duties of his or her
employment position, as determined pursuant to the performance
standards generally applicable to, and in a manner not more stringent than
generally applied to, employees of the Parent; provided that Cause shall not
exist under clause (2) of this definition if the action(s) and/or omission(s)
of the Employee Holder that would otherwise constitute Cause are curable in
all material respects, unless the Employee Holder fails to cure such action(s)
and omission(s) in all material respects within 30 days of receiving written
notice from the Parent of its intent to terminate the employment of the
Employee Holder for Cause absent such cure and specifying in reasonable
detail the failures to comply deemed by Parent to constitute Cause.
If requested by the Employee Holder, Parent will meet with the Employee
Holder to discuss the failures to comply and curative actions. "Good Reason"
shall mean, as reasonably determined by the Parent, the Employees demotion,
without the Employees consent, to a job classification materially below the
Employees job classification prior to the Effective Time; provided, however,
that (i) Good Reason shall not be deemed to exist merely as a result of any
changes to the Employees title, authorities, or responsibilities occurring
as a result of the Company becoming a business unit of Parent in the Merger,
or (ii) any change to the Employees title, authorities, or responsibilities
that does not constitute a demotion according to the job classifications
generally applicable to employees of Parent. The vested percentage of
the Company Share Options and Company SARs of an Employee Holder who becomes
entitled to such accelerated vesting shall be determined by (x) crediting
such Employee Holder with two years of additional service if the termination
of employment occurs during the period commencing on the Closing Date and
ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, or (y) crediting
such Employee Holder with one year of additional service if the termination
of employment occurs during the period commencing on the day after the first
anniversary of the Closing Date and ending on the second anniversary of the
Closing Date. 

  

 (ii) Notwithstanding Section 5.10(e)(i), effective on the Closing Date, the vesting of any and all Company Share Options and Company SARs held by the individuals listed on Section 5.10(e)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter will vest in accordance with the provisions set forth on such Section 5.10(e)(ii) of the Company Disclosure. Letter 

  

 Section 5.11 _Convertible Notes_. The Parent shall take all such action as may be necessary so that from and after the Effective Time, the Parent and the Surviving Company shall comply with the terms of the Senior Indenture, dated as of March 23, 2005 by and among msystems Finance Inc., the Company, as guarantor, and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Indenture"), including execution of a 

   ##### 

  

 

supplemental indenture as provided in Section 6.01 of the Indenture. The
Parent shall take all corporate actions necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of the Parent Common Stock for delivery upon
conversion of Convertible Notes in accordance with the terms of this Section
5.11 and the Indenture. 

   

 Section 5.12 _Form S-8_. Within ten Business Days following the Effective Time, the Parent shall, if no registration statement is in effect covering such shares of the Parent Common Stock, file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) with respect to the shares of the Parent Common Stock subject to any Company Share Options and Company SARs held by current employees to the extent registrable on Form S-8 (or any successor form) and shall use all reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such options or stock appreciation rights remain outstanding. 

  

 Section 5.13 _Notification_.

The place of any Investment Closing shall be at the offices of Parent, and the time of the Investment Closing shall be 10:00 a.m. (California Time). At the Investment Closing, Parent shall deliver cash in the aggregate amount set forth above, and simultaneously therewith the Company shall deliver to Parent a certificate or certificates representing the Investment Shares, which shares shall be free and clear of all liens, claims, charges and encumbrances of any kind whatsoever (other than restrictions under securities Legal Requirements or restrictions under paragraph (b)). Each of Parent and the Company agrees to use 

   ##### 

  

    

reasonable best efforts to cooperate with and provide information to the
other, for the purpose of any required notice or application for approval to
any Governmental Entity in connection with the Investment. Consummation of
the Investment shall constitute conclusive evidence that this Agreement has
been validly terminated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall be
entitled to reduce, in its discretion, the number of Investment Shares to
be purchased by the Parent. 

   

 (b) With respect to the Investment Shares, the Parent shall not, for a period of two years after the Investment Closing (the "Lock-Up Period"), (i) directly or indirectly, sell, offer, contract or grant any option to sell (including without limitation any short sale), pledge, transfer, establish an open "put equivalent position" within the meaning of Rule 16a-1(h) under the Exchange Act or otherwise dispose of any Investment Shares, (ii) publicly announce an intention to do any of the foregoing, or (iii) enter into any swap or other agreement or any transaction that transfers, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, the economic consequences of ownership of the Investment Shares, whether any such swap or transaction is to be settled by delivery of Investment Shares or other securities, in cash or otherwise. After the expiration of the Lock-Up Period, except in connection with a sale pursuant to an effective registration statement, the Parent shall not (x) sell, offer, contract or grant any option to sell (including without limitation any short sale) or transfer ("Transfer") to any Person (or to Persons who, to the knowledge of Parent, are acting as a "group" as such term is defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act, but excluding in any case underwriters and selling group members with respect to a bona fide public offering of Company Shares), in one or a series of transactions, an aggregate number of Company Shares equal to 4.9% of the outstanding Company Shares at the time of any such Transfer; or (y) Transfer Company Shares to any Person (excluding in any case underwriters and selling group members with respect to a bona fide public offering of Company Shares) if, to the knowledge of the Parent after reasonable inquiry of the proposed transferee and doing a reasonable search of the SECs EDGAR database, such Transfer would result in the transferee beneficially owning more than 4.9% of the outstanding Company Shares. With respect to the Investment Shares, the Parent hereby agrees, for so long as it owns any such shares, to vote the Investment Shares in the same proportion as the other shareholders of the Company vote on all matters that are presented to the shareholders of the Company for their approval. For the purpose of clarity, the Parent acknowledges that, with respect to the Investment Shares, the Parent will not be entitled to appoint any directors to the board of directors of the Company and the Parent will not be entitled to rights not generally available to the shareholders of the Company. 

   

 (c) Until the expiration of the Lock-Up Period, neither the Parent nor any of the Parents subsidiaries or representatives shall, without the prior written consent of the Company or its board of directors (or a duly empowered committee thereof): (i) acquire, publicly offer to acquire, or agree to acquire, directly or indirectly, by purchase or otherwise any shares of any class of Voting Securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, or other direct or indirect rights to acquire, any shares of any class of Voting Securities of the Company, or any assets of the Company or any subsidiary or division thereof; (ii) make, or in any way participate, directly or 

   ##### 

  

    

indirectly, in any "solicitation" of "proxies" to vote (as such terms are used
in the rules of the SEC), or seek to advise or influence any Person or entity
with respect to the voting of any Voting Securities of the Company; (iii)
make any public announcement with respect to, or publicly submit a proposal
for or offer of (with or without conditions) any extraordinary transaction
involving the Company or any of its securities or assets; (iv) form, join or
in any way participate in a "group" as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the
Exchange Act, in connection with any of the foregoing; (v) otherwise publicly
act or publicly seek to control or influence the management, board of
directors or policies of the Company; or (vi) publicly request the Company or
any of its representatives, directly or indirectly, to amend or waive any
provision of this paragraph. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the restrictions set forth in clauses (i) through (vi) of the
foregoing sentence (collectively, the "Standstill Obligations") shall cease
to apply in the event any Person or "group" as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of
the Exchange Act, unaffiliated with Parent, makes a bona fide, public,
unsolicited proposal to acquire 40% or more of the outstanding Voting
Securities of the Company; _provided_  that the Standstill Obligations shall
again apply in the event of the public withdrawal of such proposal; _provided
further_ that nothing herein shall be construed to toll in any way the two-
year Lock-Up Period during which the Standstill Obligations apply. "Voting
Securities" shall mean at any time shares of any class of capital stock of
the Company which are then entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors. 

   

 (d) The Companys right to receive the Investment in the circumstances provided in paragraph (a) is the exclusive remedy available to the Company for any failure of the Merger and other Transactions to be consummated in those circumstances (regardless of whether the Company exercises its option to receive the Investment), and the Parent shall have no further liability with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions, except in the event of willful breach of this Agreement or pursuant to Section 8.11; _provided however_ that if the Parent fails to consummate the Investment as promptly as practicable after delivery of the Investment Option Notice, then the Parent shall (in addition to the Investment) pay to the Company its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with enforcing such obligation, together with interest on the amount of the Investment at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made. 

  

 Section 7.3 _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_. Any termination of this Agreement under Section 7.1 above will be effective immediately upon (or, if the termination is pursuant to Section 7.1(e), Section 7.1(f), Section 7.1(g) or Section 7.1(j) and in each case the proviso therein is applicable, thirty days after) the delivery of written notice of the terminating party to the other parties hereto specifying the provision of this Agreement on which such termination is based. If this Agreement is terminated by either the Company or the Parent as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of the Parent or the Company, except (i) to the extent that such termination results from the willful breach by a party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding the foregoing, Section 7.1, 

   ##### 

  

 

Section 7.2 and this Section 7.3 and Article 8 shall survive any termination
of this Agreement. No termination of this Agreement shall affect the
obligations of the parties contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of
which obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement in accordance
with their terms. 

   

ARTICLE 8 
 GENERAL PROVISIONS 

   

 Section 8.1 _Nonsurvival of Representations and Warranties_. None of the representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time.

 Section 8.2 _Fees and Expenses_. 

   

 (a) Except as set forth in this Section 8.2 and, with respect to Termination Fees, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses whether or not the Merger is consummated. 

   

 (b) Whether or not the Transactions are consummated, the Parent and the Company shall share equally all fees and expenses, other than attorneys and accountants fees and expenses, incurred in relation to the obtaining of the Court Approval and any fees paid under the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws. 

  

 Section 8.3 _Amendment_. Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed by each of the Parent and the Company.

Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party (except for deemed waivers provided under Section 6.3(d)). The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

 Section 8.9 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter (a) constitutes the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and (b) except for the provisions of Section 5.14 are not intended to confer upon any Person, other than the parties, any rights or remedies. 

  

 Section 8.10 _Severability_.

 Section 8.11 _Other Remedies; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled (without any requirement to post a bond or other security) to seek one or more injunction or other equitable remedies to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE STATE OF NEW YORK;
_PROVIDED, HOWEVER_ , THAT (I) MATTERS INVOLVING THE INTERNAL CORPORATE
AFFAIRS OF THE PARENT, MERGER SUB OR THE COMPANY, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE
LAWS OF THE JURISDICTION IN WHICH SUCH CORPORATION OR COMPANY IS ORGANIZED,

GOVERNED.

EACH OF THE PARENT, MERGER SUB, AND THE COMPANY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE NEGOTIATION OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF OR THE TRANSACTIONS. Each party to this Agreement hereby agrees that in connection with any such action process may be served in the same manner as notices may be delivered under Section 8.5 and irrevocably waives any defenses or objections it may have to service in such manner. 

  

 Section 8.14 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties. No duties under this Agreement may be delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties. Any assignment or delegation in violation of the preceding sentence shall be void. Subject to the preceding two sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
