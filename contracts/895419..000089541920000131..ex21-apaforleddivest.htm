account of matters that occurred prior to or concurrent with the Closing;

(j) intercompany payables among any Seller Entity and any of its Affiliates;

Section 2.6 Unassignable Rights

(a) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document to the contrary, to the extent that the assignment or
attempted assignment to the Buyer or its designated Affiliate of any Acquired
Asset (including any Contract or Seller Authorization) or any claim, right or benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom, is prohibited by any Law or
Contract, or would require any consent, approval, waiver, authorization,
notice or novation by a Governmental Entity or another Person and such
consent, approval, waiver, authorization, notice or novation has not been
obtained or made prior to the Closing, or with respect to which any attempted
assignment would be ineffective or would materially and adversely affect the
rights of any Seller Entity or the Buyer or its designated Affiliate
thereunder (collectively, the "Unassignable Rights"), then neither this
Agreement nor any other Transaction Document will constitute an assignment or
attempted assignment thereof unless and until a consent, approval, waiver,
authorization, notice or novation reasonably acceptable to the Buyer shall
have been obtained. After the Closing, the Buyer and the Seller will each use
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly obtain, or to cause their
respective Affiliates to promptly obtain, all consents, approvals, waivers,
authorizations or novations that have not been obtained prior to the Closing
in connection with the Unassignable Rights and to provide all notices required
in connection with the Unassignable Rights.

(b) Until such consent, approval, waiver, authorization, notice or novation
that is necessary for the effective assignment to the Buyer or any designated
Affiliate of the Buyer of any Unassignable Right is obtained, provided and to
the extent that the Seller can (or can cause another Seller Entity to) do so
without breaching the terms of such Unassignable Right, the Seller shall (or
shall cause the applicable Seller Entity to) use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide the Buyer or its designated Affiliate, in all material
respects, with, and the Seller shall (or shall cause the applicable Seller
Entity to) hold in trust for the exclusive benefit of the Buyer or its
designated Affiliate, all the economic (taking into account all burdens to the
Seller and its Affiliates (including the amount of any related Tax costs
imposed on the Seller or any of its Affiliates)), operational and other
benefits of such Unassignable Right, to the extent permitted, as if such
consent, approval, waiver, authorization, notice or novation, as the case may
be, had been obtained. Without limitation of and subject to the foregoing, at
the Buyer's request, Seller shall (or shall cause the applicable Seller Entity
to) (i) cooperate, in all reasonable respects, in any lawful and commercially
reasonable arrangement proposed by the Buyer under which the Buyer or its
designated Affiliate would obtain the economic, operational and other benefits
thereunder and would assume any related economic burden thereunder (including
the amount of any related Tax costs imposed on the Seller or any of its
Affiliates), (ii) enforce for the benefit of the Buyer or its designated
Affiliate and as directed by the Buyer such Seller Entity's rights under such
Unassignable Right as if such Unassignable Right had been sold, conveyed,
assigned and delivered to the Buyer or its designated Affiliate, including in
the name of the Seller Entity party to such Unassignable Right or otherwise as
the Buyer shall specify, including the right to terminate in accordance with
the terms thereof, and (iii) permit the Buyer or its designated Affiliate to
enforce any rights arising with respect thereto; provided, however, that, (1)
the Buyer hereby agrees to promptly reimburse the Seller for reasonable
expenses (including the amount of any related Tax costs imposed on the Seller
or any of its Affiliates) incurred by each Seller Entity in complying with the
Buyer's or its designated Affiliate's requests described above and agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Entities to the full extent permitted
by Laws from and against the Buyer of its designated Affiliate practicing,
exercising or enforcing any rights or failing to perform any Liabilities
arising from or in connection with such Unassignable Rights or otherwise in
connection with carrying out any instruction or direction provided by the
Buyer or its designated Affiliate in connection with the activities
contemplated in this Section 2.6, and (2) if such Seller Entity or its
Affiliate provides the Buyer or its designated Affiliate, in all material
respects, with, and any Seller Entity or its Affiliate holds in trust for the
exclusive benefit of the Buyer or its designated Affiliates, all the economic,
operational and other benefits of such Unassignable Right in accordance with
this Section 2.6, the Buyer or its designated Affiliate shall assume the
related economic burden (including the amount of any related Tax costs imposed
on the Seller or any of its Affiliates) and, from and after the Closing, the
Buyer or its designated Affiliate shall, as agent or subcontractor for the
applicable Seller Entity or its Affiliate pay, perform and discharge fully as
and when required the Liabilities of such Seller Entity with respect to such Unassignable Rights. The Seller Entity party to such Unassignable Right will
promptly pay to the Buyer or its designated Affiliate all income, proceeds and
other monies received by such Seller Entity from third parties to the extent
related to the Buyer's or its designated Affiliate's intended rights under
such Unassignable Right, as contemplated by this Section 2.6(b). The Parties
will cooperate in good faith to eliminate or otherwise minimize any Taxes that
may be imposed on the Seller or any of its Affiliates with respect to the
Unassignable Rights.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of the
Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to pay compensation to any
third party, commence or participate in any Action or offer or grant any
accommodation (financial or otherwise, including any accommodation or
arrangement to remain secondarily liable or contingently liable for any
Assumed Liability) to any third party in connection with the Seller's and its
Affiliates' obligations under this Section 2.6. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (i) at any time upon the Buyer's request, the
Seller agrees to assign (or cause the applicable Seller Entity to assign) any
Unassignable Right to the Buyer or its designated Affiliate for no additional
consideration and (ii) once any consent, approval, waiver, authorization or
novation referenced in this Section 2.6 is obtained or notice is properly
made, the Seller or its applicable Affiliate shall assign the applicable
Unassignable Right to the Buyer or its designated Affiliate for no additional
consideration and, for the avoidance of doubt, such Unassignable Right shall
thereafter be treated as an Acquired Asset for all purposes hereunder.

(d) To the extent that the right and ability to enforce any confidentiality or
use restrictions relating to any Assigned Intellectual Property and other
technology to the extent provided for in the Intellectual Property Assignment
and License Agreement or any non-solicitation restrictions directly benefiting
the Business are not validly transferred to the Buyer or its designated
Affiliate pursuant to the Intellectual Property Assignment and License
Agreement or this Agreement, at and following the Closing, Seller, on its own
behalf and on behalf of the other Seller Entities, (i) hereby authorizes the
Buyer to enforce such restrictions to protect its rights and interests,
including any trade secret rights, with respect to such Assigned Intellectual
Property or such other restrictions, (ii) if requested by the Buyer, agrees to
use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce such restrictions as reasonably
directed by the Buyer, at the Buyer's expense, and (iii) agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide such cooperation, assistance and
information in connection with any such enforcement as reasonably requested by
the Buyer, at the Buyer's expense.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 2.6, to
the extent a consent, approval, waiver, authorization, notice or novation
acceptable to the Buyer shall not have been obtained with respect to any of
the Contracts set forth on Schedule 2.2(d) prior to the Closing, Seller shall,
or shall cause its designated Affiliates to, (i) remit any and all payment
owed to the Seller Entities or their applicable Affiliates pursuant to any
such Contract to the Buyer or its designated Affiliate within five (5)
Business Days of receipt thereof, (ii) not amend or agree to amend any such
Contract in any manner adverse to any Seller Entity (or any of its applicable
Affiliates) or the Buyer and its designated Affiliates, (iii) if requested by
the Buyer, use commercially reasonable efforts at the Buyer's expense to
enforce, for the benefit of the Buyer and its designated Affiliates and as
reasonably directed by the Buyer or its designated Affiliate, such Seller
Entity's or its applicable Affiliate's rights under any such Contract and (iv)
within three (3) Business Days of receipt, provide to the Buyer notice and the
contents (including, in the case of written communication, copies) of any
written or verbal communication received by a Seller Entity or its applicable Affiliate from any counter-party to any such Contract
concerning any such Contract.

Section 2.7 Closing

Subject to any earlier termination of this Agreement, the closing of the
Transactions (the "Closing") will take place remotely via the electronic
exchange of documents and signatures on the third (3rd) Business Day after the
satisfaction or, to the extent permitted, waiver of all conditions to the
obligations of the Parties to complete the Transactions (other than conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing) or such other date
or time or in such other manner as the Parties may mutually determine (the
actual date on which the Closing occurs being the "Closing Date"); provided
that (i) the transfer of title to any Transferred Interests or Acquired Assets
and the assumption of any Assumed Liabilities, in each case, in any
jurisdiction in which such transfer or assumption is required to be made
pursuant to a Local Agreement shall only be transferred by the applicable
Local Agreement and (ii) the "Closing" with respect to any such transfer or
assumption shall mean the consummation of such transfer or assumption pursuant
to such Local Agreement. The Closing will be effective as of 11:59 p.m. U.S.
Eastern Time on the Closing Date. Documents may be delivered at the Closing by
facsimile or other electronic means, provided that executed documents with
original signatures to the extent required for any regulatory filings
contemplated by this Agreement will be delivered as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Closing. All actions to be taken and all documents to be
executed or delivered at the Closing will be deemed to have been taken,
executed and delivered simultaneously upon mutual release by the Parties, and
no action will be deemed taken and no document will be deemed executed or
delivered until all have been taken, delivered and executed, except in each
case to the extent otherwise stated in this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document.

Section 2.8 Purchase Price

In consideration for the Acquired Assets and the Transferred Interests, (a) at
the Closing, the Buyer Parties shall (i) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to
the Seller the Purchase Price Note, (ii) pay to the Seller an aggregate amount
equal to the Closing Payment by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to one or more accounts designated in writing by the Seller no later than five
(5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, and (iii) assume the Assumed
Liabilities, and (b) on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
Section 2.11, the Buyer shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, a contingent
amount up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $125,000,000, payable to
the Seller in the form of the Earnout Note, as additional consideration.

Section 2.9 Cash Purchase Price Adjustment

(a) Estimated Cash Purchase Price. No later than five (5) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, the Seller shall deliver to the Buyer a certificate of
the Seller reasonably acceptable to the Buyer and executed by an authorized
officer of the Seller that sets forth in reasonable detail the Seller's
reasonable good faith estimate of the Adjustment Amount (the "Estimated
Adjustment Amount") and each component thereof for purposes of calculating the
Closing Payment to be paid in connection with the Closing (which such
calculations shall include reasonable supporting schedules). The Buyer shall
have the right to receive and review such supporting documentation or data as
the Buyer may reasonably request relating thereto and to discuss them with the
Seller; provided, however, that any review of such information shall not delay
the Closing; and provided, further, that the acceptance by the Buyer of the
Estimated Adjustment Amount at the Closing, or the consummation of the
Closing, shall not limit or otherwise affect the Buyer's rights under this Agreement, including pursuant
to Section 10.1, or constitute an acknowledgment or agreement by the Buyer of
the accuracy thereof. For the sake of clarity, the Buyer's acceptance of the
Seller's calculation of the Estimated Adjustment Amount is not a condition to
Closing.

(b) Calculation. No later than ninety (90) days following the Closing Date,
the Buyer shall, at its expense, (i) cause to be prepared a statement (the
"Closing Date Adjustment Amount Schedule") setting forth in reasonable detail
the Buyer's calculation of the Adjustment Amount (and each component thereof,
including any adjustments to the Target Net Working Capital Amount required by
Schedule 1.1(d)) and (ii) deliver the Closing Date Adjustment Amount Schedule
to the Seller, including reasonable supporting schedules.

(c) Review; Disputes.

(i) From and after the delivery of the Closing Date Adjustment Amount
Schedule, the Buyer shall provide the Seller and any accountants or advisors
retained by the Seller with reasonable access, during normal business hours,
to the relevant books and records of the Buyer and its Affiliates used by the
Buyer in the preparation of, or otherwise reasonably relevant to, the Closing
Date Adjustment Amount Schedule for the purposes of enabling the Seller and
its accountants and advisors to calculate, and to review the Buyer's
calculation of, the Adjustment Amount. The fees and expenses of any such
accountants and advisors retained by the Seller shall be paid by the Seller.

(ii) If the Seller disputes the calculation of the Adjustment Amount set forth
in the Closing Date Adjustment Amount Schedule, then the Seller shall deliver
a written notice (an "Adjustment Dispute Notice") to the Buyer at any time
during the thirty (30)-day period commencing upon receipt by the Seller of the
Closing Date Adjustment Amount Schedule (the "Review Period"). The Adjustment
Dispute Notice shall set forth the basis for the dispute of any such
calculation in reasonable detail.

(iii) If the Seller does not deliver an Adjustment Dispute Notice to the Buyer
prior to the expiration of the Review Period, the Buyer's calculation of the
Adjustment Amount set forth in the Closing Date Adjustment Amount Schedule
shall be deemed final and binding on the Parties for all purposes of this
Agreement.

(iv) If the Seller delivers an Adjustment Dispute Notice to the Buyer prior to
the expiration of the Review Period, then the Seller and the Buyer shall
negotiate in good faith to reach agreement on the Adjustment Amount. If the
Seller and the Buyer are unable to reach agreement on the Adjustment Amount
within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Adjustment Dispute Notice (or
such longer period as shall be mutually agreed to by the Buyer and the
Seller), either Party shall have the right to refer such dispute to a
nationally recognized independent accounting firm jointly selected by the
Seller and the Buyer (or if they cannot agree on such an accounting firm, a
nationally recognized accounting firm without a business relationship with the
Buyer or the Seller that is selected by an accounting firm designated by the
Seller and an accounting firm designated by the Buyer) (such firm, or any
successor thereto, being referred to herein as the "Accounting Firm") after
such thirtieth (30th) day for resolution. In connection with the resolution of
any such dispute by the Accounting Firm: (A) each of the Buyer and the Seller
shall have a reasonable opportunity to meet with the Accounting Firm to
provide its views as to any disputed issues with respect to the calculation of
the Adjustment Amount provided, that (1) each Party will provide the other Party with a copy of all materials provided
to, and communications with, the Accounting Firm and (2) no Party will engage
in any ex parte communication with the Accounting Firm at any time with
respect to the Adjustment Amount, (B) the Accounting Firm shall determine the
Adjustment Amount, including resolution of any issues relating to the
application or requirements of the Working Capital Accounting Principles in
connection therewith, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement within
thirty (30) days of such referral and upon reaching such determination shall
deliver a written copy of its determination to the Seller and the Buyer, and
(C) the determination made by the Accounting Firm of the Adjustment Amount
shall be conclusive, final and binding on the Parties for all purposes of this
Agreement, absent Fraud or manifest error. In calculating the Adjustment
Amount, the Accounting Firm shall be limited to (x) addressing any particular
disputes referred to in the Adjustment Dispute Notice and will not make any
other determination, including any determination as to whether any undisputed
items on the Closing Date Adjustment Amount Schedule are correct or whether
the initial amount of the Target Net Working Capital Amount is correct, and
(y) choosing with respect to any particular item in dispute the Buyer's
position, the Seller's position or a position in between the Seller's position
and the Buyer's position. If the Accounting Firm's final determination is in
full agreement with the Buyer, then the Seller shall bear the fees and
expenses of the Accounting Firm. If the Accounting Firm's final determination
is in full agreement with the Seller, then the Buyer shall bear the fees and
expenses of the Accounting Firm. Otherwise, the fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm for such determination will be borne by the Seller, on the one
hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand, in inverse proportion to the manner in
which such Person prevails on the items resolved by the Accounting Firm, which
proportionate allocation will be calculated on an aggregate basis based on the
relative dollar values of the amounts in dispute and will be computed by the
Accounting Firm at the time of its determination of the Adjustment Amount.

(d) Payment Upon Final Determination of Adjustments.

(i) Subject to Section 10.5(e), if the Adjustment Amount, as finally
determined in accordance with Section 2.9(c), is less than the Estimated
Adjustment Amount, then the Seller shall pay to the Buyer the amount of such
difference (i.e., (A) the Estimated Adjustment Amount minus (B) the Adjustment
Amount, as finally determined) by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designated by the Buyer, no later than five (5) Business Days
after such determination.

(ii) If the Adjustment Amount, as finally determined in accordance with
Section 2.9(c), is greater than the Estimated Adjustment Amount, then the
Buyer shall pay to the Seller the amount of such difference (i.e., (A) the
Adjustment Amount, as finally determined, minus (B) the Estimated Adjustment
Amount) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the Seller, no later than five (5) Business Days after such
determination.

Section 2.10 Allocation of Purchase Price

(a) No later than ninety (90) days after the Adjustment Amount has been
finally determined pursuant to Section 2.9, the Buyer shall prepare and
deliver to the Seller a proposed schedule allocating the Purchase Price among
the Acquired Assets, the Transferred Interests and the non-competition and
non-solicitation provisions in Section 6.1, which allocation shall be made in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder (the "Post-Closing Purchase Price Allocation"). The
Post-Closing Purchase Price Allocation as prepared by the Buyer shall include
an allocation, consistent with the allocation to the Transferred Interests of the
JV Company under the preceding sentence, among the assets of the JV Company
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder. If the Seller notifies the Buyer at any time on or
prior to the date that is fifteen (15) days after the Adjustment Amount has
been finally determined pursuant to Section 2.9 that the Seller is requesting
the Buyer to make an election under Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to
the purchase and sale of the Transferred Interests of the Acquired Subsidiary,
then the Post-Closing Purchase Price Allocation as prepared by the Buyer shall
include in the Buyer's proposed schedule delivered pursuant to this Section
2.10(a) an allocation of the "aggregate deemed sale price," within the meaning
of Treasury Regulations Section 1.338-4 and consistent with the allocation to
the Transferred Interests of the Acquired Subsidiary under the preceding
sentences, among the assets of the Acquired Subsidiary made in accordance with
Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.

(b) The Seller shall have thirty (30) days after the Seller's receipt of the
Buyer's proposed schedule describing the Post-Closing Purchase Price
Allocation in which to deliver comments to the Buyer with respect to the Post-
Closing Purchase Price Allocation. The Buyer and the Seller agree to use
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve in good faith any differences with
respect to the Post-Closing Purchase Price Allocation. If the Buyer and the
Seller are unable to reach such agreement within thirty (30) days following
the delivery of comments to the Post-Closing Purchase Price Allocation by the
Seller to the Buyer (or such longer period as shall be mutually agreed to by
the Buyer and the Seller), each of the Buyer and the Seller shall have the
right to refer any disputed elements of the Post-Closing Purchase Price
Allocation to an internationally recognized independent accounting firm, with
sufficient international merger and acquisition experience, jointly selected
by the Seller and the Buyer (or if they cannot agree on such an accounting
firm, an internationally recognized accounting firm without a business
relationship with the Buyer or the Seller that is selected by an accounting
firm designated by the Seller and an accounting firm designated by the Buyer)
(such firm, or any successor thereto, being referred to herein as the
"Allocation Accounting Firm") for resolution. In connection with the
resolution of any such dispute by the Allocation Accounting Firm, (i) each of
the Buyer and the Seller shall have a reasonable opportunity to meet with the
Allocation Accounting Firm to provide its views as to the disputed elements of
the Post-Closing Purchase Price Allocation; provided, that (1) each Party will
provide the other Party with a copy of all materials provided to, and
communications with, the Allocation Accounting Firm and (2) no party will
engage in any ex parte communication with the Allocation Accounting Firm at
any time with respect to the Post-Closing Purchase Price Allocation; (ii) the
Allocation Accounting Firm shall determine the disputed elements of the Post-
Closing Purchase Price Allocation in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder within thirty (30) days of
such referral and upon reaching such determination shall deliver a written
copy of its determination to the Seller and the Buyer; and (iii) the
determination made by the Allocation Accounting Firm of the disputed elements
of the Post-Closing Purchase Price Allocation shall be conclusive, final and
binding on the Parties for all purposes of this Agreement, absent Fraud or
manifest error. In determining the Post-Closing Purchase Price Allocation, the
Allocation Accounting Firm shall be limited to (x) addressing any particular
disputes referred to the Allocation Accounting Firm by the Buyer or the Seller
and will not make any other determination, including any determination as to
whether any undisputed items in the Post-Closing Purchase Price Allocation are
correct, and (y) choosing with respect to any particular item in dispute the
Buyer's position, the Seller's position or a position in between the Seller's
position and the Buyer's position. If the Allocation Accounting Firm's final
determination is in full agreement with the Buyer, then the Seller shall bear
the fees and expenses of the Allocation Accounting Firm. If the Allocation
Accounting Firm's final determination is in full agreement with the Seller,
then the Buyer shall bear the fees and expenses of the Allocation Accounting
Firm. Otherwise, each of the Seller and the Buyer shall pay one-half of the
fees and expenses of the Allocation Accounting Firm for such determination; provided that if the Allocation
Accounting Firm determines that one Party has adopted one or more positions
with respect to the Post-Closing Purchase Price Allocation that are frivolous
or clearly without merit, the Allocation Accounting Firm may, in its
discretion, assign a greater portion of any such fees and expenses to such
Party.

(c) The Buyer Parties and the Seller agree to, and to cause their Affiliates
to, (i) prepare and file each of their respective Tax Returns, and make all
necessary final determinations for Transfer Tax purposes pursuant to Section
6.4(a), on a basis consistent with the Post-Closing Purchase Price Allocation
as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.10 and (ii) take no position
inconsistent with the Post-Closing Purchase Price Allocation on any applicable
Tax Return or in any Audit before any Governmental Entity, in each case except
to the extent otherwise required by Law.

(d) If the Purchase Price is adjusted pursuant to this Agreement, the Post-
Closing Purchase Price Allocation shall be adjusted as appropriate, and the
Buyer Parties and the Seller shall reasonably cooperate in making any such
adjustments.

the Earnout Consideration within thirty (30) days after delivery of the
Earnout Dispute Notice (or such longer period as shall be mutually agreed to
by the Buyer and the Seller) (the "Earnout Dispute Resolution Period"), (A)
the Seller may, within fifteen (15) Business Days following the expiration of
the Earnout Dispute Resolution Period, deliver an Earnout Audit Notice to the
Buyer invoking the audit procedures set forth in Section 2.11(f), and (B)
either Party shall have the right to refer such dispute to the Accounting Firm
after such thirtieth (30th) day for resolution (provided that if the Buyer
refers such dispute to the Accounting Firm, the Seller may, within five (5)
Business Days of being notified of such referral, submit an Earnout Audit
Notice to the Buyer and invoke the audit procedures set forth in Section
2.11(f) in lieu of engaging the Accounting Firm). In connection with the
resolution of any such dispute by the Accounting Firm: (A) each of the Buyer
and the Seller shall have a reasonable opportunity to meet with the Accounting
Firm to provide its views as to any disputed issues with respect to the
calculation of the Revenue Earnout Consideration, the Gross Profit Earnout
Consideration and the Earnout Consideration provided that (1) each Party will
provide the other Party with a copy of all materials provided to, and communications with, the Accounting Firm and (2) no Party will engage in any
ex parte communication with the Accounting Firm at any time with respect to
the Revenue Earnout Consideration, the Gross Profit Earnout Consideration and
the Earnout Consideration, (B) the Accounting Firm shall determine the Revenue
Earnout Consideration, the Gross Profit Earnout Consideration and the Earnout
Consideration, including resolution of any issues relating to the application
or requirements of the Earnout Accounting Principles or any adjustments to the
Target Revenue Amount or Target Gross Profit Amount in connection therewith,
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement within thirty (30) days of such
referral and upon reaching such determination shall deliver a written copy of
its determination to the Seller and the Buyer, and (C) the determination made
by the Accounting Firm of the Revenue Earnout Consideration, the Gross Profit
Earnout Consideration and the Earnout Consideration shall be conclusive, final
and binding on the Parties for all purposes of this Agreement, absent Fraud or
manifest error. In calculating the Revenue Earnout Consideration, the Gross
Profit Earnout Consideration and the Earnout Consideration, the Accounting
Firm shall be limited to (x) addressing any particular disputes referred to in
the Earnout Dispute Notice and will not make any other determination,
including any determination as to whether any undisputed items on the Earnout
Statement are correct, and (y) choosing with respect to any particular item in
dispute the Buyer's position, the Seller's position or a position in between
the Seller's position and the Buyer's position. If the Accounting Firm's final
determination is in full agreement with the Buyer, then the Seller shall bear
the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm. If the Accounting Firm's final
determination is in full agreement with the Seller, then the Buyer shall bear
the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm. Otherwise, the fees and expenses
of the Accounting Firm for such determination will be borne by the Seller, on
the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand, in inverse proportion to the
manner in which such Person prevails on the items resolved by the Accounting
Firm, which proportionate allocation will be calculated on an aggregate basis
based on the relative dollar values of the amounts in dispute and will be
computed by the Accounting Firm at the time its determination of the Revenue
Earnout Consideration, the Gross Profit Earnout Consideration and the Earnout
Consideration.

(f) Earnout Audit.

(i) If the Seller properly submits an Earnout Audit Notice pursuant to Section
2.11(e), the Seller shall have the right to have a nationally recognized
independent accounting firm jointly selected by the Seller and the Buyer (or
if they cannot agree on such an accounting firm, a nationally recognized
accounting firm without a business relationship with the Buyer or the Seller
that is selected by an accounting firm designated by the Seller and an
accounting firm designated by the Buyer) (such firm, or any successor thereto,
being referred to herein as the "Earnout Auditor"), to conduct an audit of the
books and records of the Buyer Parties and their respective Affiliates for the
sole purpose of confirming the Revenue Earnout Consideration, the Gross Profit
Earnout Consideration and the Earnout Consideration, including the application
or requirements of the Earnout Accounting Principles or any adjustments to the
Target Revenue Amount or Target Gross Profit Amount in connection therewith
(the "Earnout Audit"). From and after the delivery of the Earnout Statement,
the Buyer Parties shall provide the Seller, the Earnout Auditor and their
respective representatives with reasonable access, during normal business
hours, to the relevant books and records of the Buyer Parties used by the
Buyer Parties in the preparation of, or otherwise reasonably relevant to, the Earnout Statement for the purposes of
enabling the Accounting Firm to conduct the Earnout Audit.

(ii) Each of the Seller and the Buyer will be entitled to receive a report of
the Earnout Auditor with respect to its findings (the "Earnout Audit Report").
If either the Seller or the Buyer disagrees with the calculation of the
Revenue Earnout Consideration, the Gross Profit Earnout Consideration or the
Earnout Consideration set forth in the Earnout Audit Report, then the
disputing Party shall, at any time during the thirty (30)-day period
commencing upon receipt by the Seller and the Buyer of the Earnout Audit
Report (the "Earnout Audit Review Period") deliver to the other Party (A) a
written notice setting forth in reasonable detail the basis of such Party's
disagreement with the Earnout Audit Report and resulting calculation of the
Revenue Earnout Consideration, the Gross Profit Earnout Consideration or the
Earnout Consideration (an "Earnout Audit Dispute Notice"). If neither the
Seller nor the Buyer delivers an Earnout Audit Dispute Notice to the other
prior to the expiration of the Earnout Audit Review Period, the Earnout
Auditor's calculation of the Revenue Earnout Consideration, the Gross Profit
Earnout Consideration and the Earnout Consideration set forth in the Earnout
Audit Report shall be deemed final and binding on the Parties for all purposes
of this Agreement.

(iii) If the Seller or the Buyer delivers an Earnout Audit Dispute Notice to
the other prior to the expiration of the Earnout Audit Review Period, then the
Seller and the Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to reach agreement
regarding the Earnout Audit Report and the resulting Revenue Earnout
Consideration, Gross Profit Earnout Consideration and Earnout Consideration.
If the Seller and the Buyer are unable to reach agreement regarding the
Earnout Audit Report and the resulting Revenue Earnout Consideration, Gross
Profit Earnout Consideration and Earnout Consideration within sixty (60) days
after receipt by the Seller and the Buyer of the Earnout Audit Report (or such
longer period as shall be mutually agreed to by the Buyer and the Seller),
either the Seller or the Buyer may after such sixtieth (60th) day have the
right to refer such dispute to the Accounting Firm for resolution pursuant to
the procedures set forth in Section 2.11(e)(iv).

(iv) The Seller will bear the full cost of the Earnout Auditor; provided
however that, in the event the final determination of the aggregate Earnout
Consideration, whether by agreement of or acceptance by the Parties under this
Section 2.11(f) or resolution of any Earnout Audit Dispute Notice pursuant to
the procedures set forth in Section 2.11(e)(iv), results in a calculation of
the aggregate Earnout Consideration that is less than ninety percent (90%) of
the aggregate Earnout Consideration as set forth by the Buyer in the Earnout
Statement, the Buyer Parties shall bear the full cost of the Earnout Auditor.

(g) Freedom to Operate. Subject to compliance with the Buyer Parties'
obligations under Section 2.11(h) and 6.1, the Buyer Parties and their
Affiliates shall have absolute and sole discretion as to how to manage and/or
restructure the Business after the Closing (including during the Earnout
Period), including the absolute and sole discretion to add or remove (or
modify the terms of their agreements with) customers, suppliers or
distributors of the Business or to add, change or discontinue any products or
product lines in the Business (including the Business Products). Irrespective
of whether the Seller believes any actions taken by any of the Buyer Parties
or their Affiliates (or omitted to be taken by any of the Buyer Parties or
their Affiliates) after the Closing have reduced the Earnout Consideration,
the Buyer shall have no obligation to credit or restore any such reduction or
potential reduction to the Earnout Consideration or, except as expressly
provided in Section 2.11(i), reduce any of the Threshold Revenue Amount, the Target Revenue Amount, the Threshold Gross Profit Amount or the
Target Gross Profit Amount.

(h) Earnout Covenants. Following the Closing and until the expiration of the
Earnout Period, the Buyer Parties shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates and any assignees or successors in interest of any of the foregoing
to:

(i) maintain separate books and records for the Business to the extent
necessary for the determination of the Revenue Earnout Consideration, the
Gross Profit Earnout Consideration and the Earnout Consideration; and

(ii) operate the Business in good faith and not take any action the primary
purpose of which is to reduce or impair the Earnout Consideration or the
achievement thereof.

(i) Target Readjustment Events. In the event, between the Closing and the end
of the Earnout Period, of (i) the direct or indirect sale, assignment,
disposition or other transfer of any material portion of the Business or the
Acquired Assets not in the Ordinary Course of Business or (ii) any
restructuring or reorganization of the Business involving a discontinuation of
any product lines of the Business, termination by the Buyer or an Affiliate of
the Buyer of any material sales collaborations or strategic partnerships, or
exit of any markets or industries to or for which Business Products are, as of
the Closing Date, sold, offered for sale, or provided to third parties in the
Business (any such event, a "Target Readjustment Event"), the Target Revenue
Amount and the Target Gross Profit Amount shall each be reduced by the average
of (x) the Revenue or Gross Profit, as applicable, achieved by such assets or
in such markets or industries in the fiscal quarter immediately prior to the
Target Readjustment Event and (y) 95% of the forecasted Revenue or Gross
Profit, as applicable, for such assets or in such markets or industries in the
remaining fiscal quarters of the Earnout Period, in each case ((x) and (y))
extrapolated from the date of the Target Readjustment Event through the end of
the Earnout Period.

Section 2.12 Withholding.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Buyer Parties
(or their respective designees) shall be entitled to withhold and deduct, or
cause to be withheld and deducted, from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts of Tax as are required to be deducted
and withheld under Laws. The Parties acknowledge that the Buyer Parties intend
to withhold from the payments made for the Transferred Subsidiary Interests
Taxes required to be deducted and withheld under the Laws of the PRC. The
Buyer Parties will provide notice to the Seller at least ten (10) days prior
to the Closing Date of any other amounts that the Buyer Parties believe are
required to be withheld and the Parties will cooperate in good faith to
eliminate or otherwise minimize such withholding amounts. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted or withheld and remitted to the appropriate taxing
authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.



ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLER



The Seller represents and warrants to the Buyer Parties that the following
representations and warranties are true and correct as of the Agreement Date
and as of the Closing Date except as disclosed in the Seller Disclosure
Schedule; provided that, except with respect to the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3.1(c) and 3.1(d), all representations and warranties
with respect to the JV Company (including, for the avoidance of doubt, by
inclusion in the Acquired Entities) are made only to the Knowledge of the
Seller, regardless of whether any Knowledge qualifier is specifically included
in any such representations and warranties:

Section 3.1 Organization, Standing and Power; Matters Relating to the Acquired
Entities

(a) Each Seller Entity and each Acquired Entity is an entity duly organized
and in good standing or existence, as the case may be, under the Laws of its
respective jurisdiction of formation or organization, as applicable. Each
Seller Entity and each Acquired Entity has the requisite organizational power
and authority to own, license or use the Acquired Assets or such Acquired
Entity's assets, as applicable, and to carry on the Business as now owned,
licensed or used and being conducted by such Seller Entity or Acquired Entity,
as applicable. Each Seller Entity and each Acquired Entity is duly qualified
to do business and is in good standing or existence, as the case may be, in
each jurisdiction (other than its jurisdiction of organization) in which the
ownership or leasing of the Acquired Assets or the applicable Acquired
Entity's assets, as applicable, or the conduct of the Business by such Seller
Entity or Acquired Entity, as applicable, requires such qualification, except
where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing or in existence would
not reasonably be expected to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The Seller has made available to the Buyer Parties correct and complete
copies of the articles of incorporation or bylaws or other governing documents
of each Seller Entity and each Acquired Entity (each as amended to date), and
each Acquired Entity is in compliance with such governing documents.

(c) The capitalization of each Acquired Entity (which shall include the total
authorized and outstanding capital stock or other ownership interests of each
Acquired Entity and the beneficial and holder of record of all of the
outstanding shares, membership interests or other equity interest of such
Acquired Entity) is set forth in Section 3.1(c) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule. All of the Transferred Interests are duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable. The full amount of the registered
capital of the Acquired Subsidiary established in the PRC has been fully and
timely contributed in compliance with all Laws and its articles of
association. There are no outstanding or authorized options, warrants,
convertible securities, rights (including preemptive rights), agreements or
commitments to which any Acquired Entity or any Seller Entity is a party or
which are binding upon any Acquired Entity or any Seller Entity providing for
the issuance, disposition or acquisition of any equity interests in any
Acquired Entity. There are no outstanding or authorized stock appreciation,
phantom stock, profit participation or similar rights with respect to any
Acquired Entity. There are no agreements, voting trusts, proxies or other
Contracts with respect to the voting or registration of any securities of any
Acquired Entity. With respect to the JV Company, there are no: (i) dividends
which have been accrued or declared, but not yet paid, or (ii) obligations,
contingent or otherwise, to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire all or
part of its shares. All dividends (if any) or distributions (if any) declared,
made or paid by the JV Company have been declared, made, paid, repurchased or
redeemed, as applicable, in accordance with its constitutional documents and
all Laws.

(d) All of the Transferred Interests are owned of record and beneficially by a
Seller Entity or the Acquired Subsidiary, and the applicable Seller Entity or
the Acquired Subsidiary has good and valid title to the Transferred Interests,
free and clear of any Liens, Contractual restriction or covenant, option or
other adverse claim (whether arising by Contract or by operation of Law), and,
at the Closing, the Buyer will acquire, either directly or indirectly, from a
Seller Entity good and valid title to the Transferred Interests, free and clear of any Liens (other than restrictions on transfer
arising under applicable securities Laws).

(e) Except for the Transferred Interests, the Acquired Assets do not include,
and no Acquired Subsidiary has, any direct or indirect equity participation or
similar interest in any corporation, partnership, limited liability company,
joint venture, trust or other business association or entity.

(f) All returns, particulars, resolutions and documents which the JV Company
was required under the Companies Ordinance (Chapter 622 of the Laws of Hong
Kong) or other Laws of relevant jurisdictions to be filed, notarized or
registered have been properly made up and duly filed, notarized and
registered, and due compliance has in all respects been made with all relevant
Laws.

(g) There is no outstanding arrangement between the JV Company and any of its
creditors or circumstances that exist to the Knowledge of the Seller that
would entitle any Person to present a petition for the winding up or
administration of the JV Company or to appoint a receiver of the whole or any
part of its undertakings or assets.

Section 3.2 Authority

Each Seller Entity has all requisite organizational power to execute, deliver
and perform this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is
a party and to complete the Transactions. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which the
applicable Seller Entity is a party and the completion of the Transactions
have been duly authorized by all requisite organizational action, and no other
action on the part of any Seller Entity is necessary to authorize the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents to which such Seller Entity is a party or to complete the
Transactions. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
Seller, and assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by
the Buyer Parties, constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Seller, enforceable against the Seller in accordance with its terms except as
enforceability may be limited by (a) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or other similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors'
rights generally, including the effect of statutory and other Laws involving
fraudulent conveyances and preferential transfers, and (b) the limitations
imposed by general equitable principles, regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in any Action, whether at Law or in equity
(collectively, the "Bankruptcy and Equity Principles"). Upon the execution and
delivery by the applicable Seller Entity of the other Transaction Documents to
which it is a party, and assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery thereof by the other parties thereto, such other Transaction
Documents will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of such
Seller Entity, enforceable against such Seller Entity in accordance with their
terms except as enforceability may be limited by the Bankruptcy and Equity
Principles.

Section 3.3 Consents and Approvals; No Violation

Except as described under Schedule 5.1(b), the execution and delivery by the
Seller of this Agreement and by each Seller Entity of the other Transaction
Documents to which it is a party and the performance of each such Seller
Entity's obligations hereunder and thereunder will not (a) violate or conflict
with any provision of the articles of incorporation or bylaws or similar
governing documents of such Seller Entity or any Acquired Entity; (b) violate
or conflict with any Law which any Seller Entity or Acquired Entity is
subject; (c) conflict with, result in a breach of, constitute (with or without
due notice or lapse of time or both) a default under, result in the
acceleration of obligations under, create in any party the right to terminate, modify or cancel, or require any notice, consent or
waiver under, any Material Business Contract, (d) result in the imposition of
any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) on any Acquired Asset or asset of any
Acquired Entity, or (e) require any filing with, or permit, consent or
approval of, or the giving of any notice to, any Governmental Entity, other
than the Mandatory Regulatory Approvals, except in the case of each of clauses
(b)-(e) as would not reasonably be expected to be material to the Business,
taken as a whole.

Section 3.4 Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities

(a) Attached to Section 3.4(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule are true,
complete and correct copies of the unaudited pro forma consolidated summary
balance sheet and consolidated summary statement of income of the Business as
of and for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2020 (collectively, the "Financial
Statements"). The Financial Statements are derived from the Files and Records
of the Seller and its direct and indirect Subsidiaries. The Financial
Statements were prepared in good faith and fairly present in all material
respects the financial condition and results of operations of the Business as
of such respective times and for such respective time periods referred to
therein; provided, however, that (i) the Seller Entities do not maintain
separate financial statements of the Business and (ii) the Financial
Statements are presented on a carve-out basis and may differ materially from
financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, including in that they
do not include all year-end adjustments, audit adjustments, carve-out
adjustments or footnote disclosures and other presentation items required for
the presentation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP.

(b) None of the Seller Entities (with respect to the Business) nor the
Acquired Subsidiary has any Liabilities that would be required by GAAP to be
presented on the face of a balance sheet, other than (i) Liabilities accrued
or reserved against in the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the
Business as of June 28, 2020 (the "Latest Seller Balance Sheet Date")
(together with the notes and schedules thereto, if any, the "Latest Seller
Balance Sheet"), (ii) the Excluded Liabilities, (iii) Liabilities of the type
reflected on the Latest Seller Balance Sheet that have arisen after the Latest
Seller Balance Sheet Date in the Ordinary Course of Business, (iv) Liabilities
resulting from the obligations of a Seller Entity or the Acquired Subsidiary
under this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents that will be borne by
the Seller Entities, (v) Liabilities pursuant to any Contract to which a
Seller Entity or the Acquired Subsidiary is a party which did not result from
any default, tort or breach of contract, (vi) Liabilities that are included as
current liabilities in the final Closing Net Working Capital Amount, and (vii)
other Liabilities that do not exceed, individually or in the aggregate,
$[****].

(c) The Files and Records of each Seller Entity (to the extent related to the
Business) and the Acquired Subsidiary have been maintained in accordance with
sound business practices. Each of the Seller Entities (to the extent related
to the Business) and the Acquired Subsidiary maintains accurate books of
account and other financial records reflecting its assets and liabilities and
maintains proper and effective internal control over financial reporting that
is designed to provide reasonable assurance (i) that transactions are executed
with management's authorization, (ii) that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements of the Business
and to maintain accountability for the assets of the Business in accordance
with GAAP, (iii) that access to the assets of the Business is permitted only
in accordance with management's authorization and (iv) regarding unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of assets of the Business that could have a
Seller Material Adverse Effect on the Financial Statements. Each of the Seller
Entities and the Acquired Subsidiary maintains effective controls and
procedures that are designed to ensure that all material information
concerning the Business is made known on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for the
preparation of the Financial Statements.

(d) The Seller has provided to the Buyer certain forecasted quarterly
financial information regarding the Business (including quarterly Revenue and
Gross Profits), which such forecasted financial information regarding the
Business is set forth in Section 3.4(d) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the
"Financial Projections"). The Financial Projections were prepared in good
faith and based on assumptions believed by the Seller's management to be
reasonable at the time, it being acknowledged and agreed by the Buyer Parties
that the Financial Projections are not to be viewed as facts, actual results
may differ materially from the Financial Projections, and any differences
between actual results and the Financial Projections shall not be deemed to
create a presumption that the Financial Projections were not prepared in good
faith and that the assumptions on which the Financial Projections were based
were unreasonable at the time the Financial Projections were prepared.

(e) This Section 3.4 is qualified by the fact that the Business has not
operated as a separate "stand alone" entity within the Seller; in certain
operational areas, the Business is dependent upon centralized functional
activities of the Seller, the costs of which have not been historically
allocated to the Business; and the Financial Statements are presented on a
carve-out basis and may differ materially from financial statements presented
in accordance with GAAP, in that they do not include all year-end adjustments,
audit adjustments, carve-out adjustments, or footnote disclosures and other
presentation items required for the presentation of financial statement in
conformity with GAAP. As a result, the Business has been allocated certain
internal charges and credits for purposes of the preparation of the Financial
Statements. Such allocations of charges and credits have been made in good
faith with the intent of accurately presenting to the extent practicable the
financial condition and results of operations of the Business for the time
periods covered by the Financial Statements, but may not necessarily reflect
the amounts that would have resulted from arms-length transactions or the
actual costs that would be incurred if the Business operated as an independent
enterprise.

Section 3.5 Absence of Certain Changes

Since the Latest Seller Balance Sheet Date, (i) the Business has been
conducted in the Ordinary Course of Business in all material respects and (ii)
there has not been any Seller Material Adverse Effect. Without limiting the

Section 3.6 Litigation

(a) As of the Agreement Date, there are no Actions by any Person pending or,
to the Knowledge of the Seller, threatened against any Seller Entity, any
Acquired Entity, any of their respective Affiliates or any of their respective
officers, directors, managers or persons holding similar positions of
authority (in each case relating to or affecting the Business, the Acquired
Assets or any Acquired Entity), at law or in equity or before or by any
Governmental Entity, or which challenge or seek to prevent, enjoin, alter or
materially delay the Transactions.

(b) There are no Orders (whether rendered by a court, administrative agency or
other Governmental Entity, by arbitration or otherwise) that are outstanding
against or involve any Seller Entity (with respect to the Business or the
Acquired Assets), any Acquired Entity, any Acquired Assets, or any assets

(c) There are no Actions by a Seller Entity (with respect to the Business or
the Acquired Assets) or any Acquired Entity pending, or which any Seller
Entity (with respect to the Business or the Acquired Assets) or any Acquired
Entity has commenced preparations to initiate, against any other Person with

Section 3.7 Governmental Authorization

Each of the Seller Entities and the Acquired Entities possesses, and since
[****] has possessed, all consents, Permits, grants, or other authorizations
of, or has made all filings with, Governmental Entities that are required for
its respective operation of the Business or the holding of any interest it
holds in the Transferred Interests, Acquired Assets or the assets of the
Acquired Entities (the "Seller Authorizations"). Section 3.7 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a correct and complete list of all material
Seller Authorizations held by each Seller Entity (with respect to the
Business) or the Acquired Subsidiary and such Seller Authorizations (i)
constitute all Seller Authorizations necessary for the operation of the
Business as currently conducted or for the ownership or use of the Transferred
Interests, the Acquired Assets or the assets of the Acquired Entities, and
(ii) are valid and in full force and effect. Since [****], each Seller Entity
and Acquired Entity has been in compliance in all material respects with all
Seller Authorizations, and no Action has been filed or commenced, or to the
Knowledge of the Seller, threatened alleging any default under or non-
compliance with any such Seller Authorizations or that any additional material
Seller Authorization is required. To the Knowledge of the Seller, no
Governmental Entity intends to modify in any material respect, cancel,
terminate, revoke or not renew any Seller Authorization. Section 3.8 Title to Property; Sufficiency

(a) A Seller Entity has good and marketable title to, or a valid leasehold
interest or license in, all of the Acquired Assets, free and clear of all
Liens other than Permitted Liens, and each Acquired Entity has good and
marketable title to, or a valid leasehold interest or license in, all of the
properties, rights or assets owned or leased by it. The Acquired Assets,
together with the assets owned by the Acquired Entities, constitute all assets
reflected on the Latest Seller Balance Sheet (other than assets sold,
transferred, used or consumed since the Latest Seller Balance Sheet Date in
the Ordinary Course of Business and the Excluded Assets). Upon the sale,
transfer, assignment and delivery of the Acquired Assets pursuant to the terms
of the Transaction Documents, and assuming receipt of all necessary approvals,
authorizations and consents and the filing of all notices and granting and
issuances of all licenses, Orders, waivers and permits by any necessary
Persons or Governmental Entities, the Buyer or its designated Affiliate will

Section 3.13 Seller Benefit Plans

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement or other Transaction
Documents by the Seller Entities and the consummation of the Transactions will
not result in any obligation or Liability (with respect to accrued benefits or

benefit of any current or former employee of any Seller Entity with respect to
the Business or Acquired Subsidiary Employees.

(c) Each Seller Benefit Plan has been maintained and administered in all
material respects in compliance with its terms and with the requirements
prescribed by Law, including ERISA and the Code. With respect to the Seller

Acquired Entities reasonably would be expected to be subject to any material
Liability under ERISA, the Code or any other Law. To the Seller's Knowledge,
there are no pending Actions (other than routine benefit claims and
proceedings with respect to qualified domestic relations orders) that have
been asserted or instituted by, against or relating to, any Seller Benefit
Plan (including any such Action against any fiduciary of any such Seller
Benefit Plan) by or on behalf of any Business Employee or any Acquired
Subsidiary Employee. All contributions, reserves or premium payments required
to have been made or accrued, or that are due, with respect to the Seller Benefit Plan as it
relates to the Business Employees or the Acquired Subsidiary Employees have
been timely made or accrued.

(d) All the Seller Benefit Plans that are intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code have received determination (or opinion or
advisory) letters from the IRS to the effect that such plans are qualified and
the plans and trusts related thereto are exempt from U.S. federal Income Taxes
under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, and such letters
remain applicable to the plans, and to the Seller's Knowledge, no event has
occurred that would adversely affect such qualified status.

(e) No Business Employee or Acquired Subsidiary Employee or beneficiary
thereof is entitled to receive any welfare benefits from any Seller Entity or
the Acquired Entities, including death or medical benefits (whether or not
insured) beyond retirement or other termination of employment, other than as

oral commitments inconsistent with the foregoing. None of the Seller Entities
(in each case, with respect to the Business) nor the Acquired Entities has any
policy, plan or program of paying severance pay or any form of severance
compensation in connection with the termination of any Business Employees or
Acquired Subsidiary Employees, respectively.

(f) The execution of this Agreement, the other Transactions Documents and the
consummation of the Transactions (alone or together with any other event
which, standing alone, would not by itself trigger such entitlement or
acceleration) will not accelerate the time of the payment or vesting of, or
increase the amount of, or result in the payment or forfeiture of compensation
or benefits due to or forgiveness of Indebtedness with respect to employees of
the Business under, or trigger any obligation to fund under, any Seller
Benefit Plan.

(g) With respect to each Seller Benefit Plan that is subject to the Laws of

Section 409A.

Parent SEC Filings, including any notes thereto or schedules, (i) were

Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, such disclosure controls and procedures
are reasonably designed to ensure that material information required to be
disclosed by the Buyer Parent in the reports it files or submits to the SEC

the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such
material information is accumulated and communicated to the Buyer Parent's
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.

Section 4.5 Litigation

There are no Actions by any Person pending or, to the Knowledge of the Buyer,
threatened against any Buyer Group Member or any of their respective officers,
directors, managers or persons holding similar positions of authority, at law
or in equity or before or by any Governmental Entity which (a) challenge or
seek to prevent, enjoin, alter or materially delay the Transactions or (b)
would reasonably be expected to result in Liability that, individually or in
the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse
Effect. There are no Orders (whether rendered by a court, administrative
agency or other Governmental Entity, by arbitration or otherwise) that are
outstanding against or involving any Buyer Group Member which, individually or
in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Buyer Material
Adverse Effect. Section 4.6 Financing

The Buyer has, and as of the Closing Date will have, sufficient cash on hand,
available lines of credit or other sources of immediately available funds to
enable it to pay the Closing Payment in full and to operate the Buyer Group
(including the Business) for a period of at least twelve (12) months following
the Closing.

Section 4.7 Brokers' and Finders' Fees

Section 4.8 Investment Company Act

No Buyer Group Member is registered or is required to register as an
investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Section 4.9 Solvency

Except to the extent due to the failure of any representations and warranties
of the Seller set forth in Article III to be true and correct or of the
Seller's failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents, immediately after giving effect to all of the
Transactions, each Buyer Group Member (including, following the Closing, each
Acquired Entity) will be solvent, including as defined under all Laws; and
shall (i) be able to pay its debts as they become due; (ii) own property that
has a fair saleable value greater than the amounts required to pay its debts
(including a reasonable estimate of the amount of all contingent Liabilities);
and (iii) has and will have adequate capital to carry on its business. No
transfer of property is being made and no obligation is being incurred in
connection with the Transactions with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud
either present or future creditors of any Buyer Group Member. In connection
with the Transactions, no Buyer Group Member has incurred, nor plans to incur,
debts beyond its ability to pay as they become absolute and matured. If the
Purchase Price Note had been issued on the Agreement Date, the Buyer Parent
would be in compliance, as of the Agreement Date and as of the Closing Date,
with the covenants set forth in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 of the Purchase Price
Note.

Section 4.10 Purchase for Investment

The Buyer is purchasing the Transferred Interests for investment for its own
account and not with a view to, or for sale in connection with, any
distribution thereof in violation of any securities Law. The Buyer (either
alone or together with its advisors) has sufficient knowledge and experience
in financial and business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits
and risks of its investment in the Transferred Interests and is capable of
bearing the economic risks of such investment. The Buyer acknowledges that the
Transferred Interests have not been registered under any federal, state or
foreign securities Laws and that the Transferred Interests may not be sold,
transferred, offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of
unless such transfer, sale, assignment, pledge, hypothecation or other
disposition is registered under any federal, state or foreign securities Laws
or is effected pursuant to an exemption from registration under any federal,
state or foreign securities Laws. The Buyer and each Buyer Party purchasing
Transferred Interests is an "accredited investor" as that term is defined in
Rule 501(a) as promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933. 

Section 4.11 Purchase Price Note and Earnout Note

The Purchase Price Note and the Earnout Note have been duly authorized for
such issuance and, when issued and delivered by the Buyer Parent in accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement and the terms of the applicable note,
(a) will be validly issued, (b) will not be issued in violation of any rights
of any other Person or in violation of any Contract, (c) assuming the accuracy
of the representations and warranties in Section 3.27, will not be issued in
violation of any applicable securities Laws and (d) will constitute a valid
and legally binding obligation of the Buyer Parent, enforceable against the
Buyer Parent in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may
limited by the Bankruptcy and Equity Principles.



ARTICLE V

CERTAIN PRE-CLOSING COVENANTS



The Parties agree as follows with respect to the period between the Agreement
Date and the Closing or earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance
with Section 9.1:

Section 5.1 General

(a) Subject to Section 5.2, each of the Parties shall use (and cause its
Affiliates to use) commercially reasonable efforts (subject to, and in
accordance with, Law) to take promptly, or cause to be taken promptly, all
appropriate actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done promptly, and to
assist and cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under Laws to complete and make effective the Transactions

necessary to complete the Transactions.

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Agreement Date, the Seller shall, and
shall cause the other Seller Entities and the Acquired Entities to, solicit
the consents and other Permits set forth on Schedule 5.1(b). [****], the
Seller shall, and shall cause the Seller Entities and the Acquired Entities
to, use commercially reasonable efforts, and the Buyer Parties will cooperate
at the Buyer Parties' expense in all reasonable respects with the Seller
Entities and the Acquired Entities, as applicable, to obtain prior to the
Closing all such consents and other Permits (provided that none of the Seller
Entities nor the Acquired Entities will be required to pay any consideration
to any third party in connection with obtaining such consents and other
Permits and provided further that the failure to obtain any such consents or
other Permits in and of itself shall not constitute a breach of this Section
5.1(b)).

Section 5.2 Regulatory Approvals

(a) Each Party shall use (and cause its Affiliates to use) its reasonable best
efforts (subject to, and in accordance with, Law) to take promptly, or cause
to be taken promptly, all actions, and do promptly, or cause to be done
promptly, all things necessary, proper or advisable under Laws to obtain all
necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, permits and approvals from
Governmental Entities (collectively, the "Regulatory Approvals"), and, with
respect to the transfer of the Transferred Interests, such actions as are set
forth in relation to them on Schedule 8.2(f), including the Mandatory
Regulatory Approvals, and making all necessary or advisable notices,
registrations and filings to obtain a Regulatory Approval or waiver from, or
to avoid an Action by, any Governmental Entity. (b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Buyer Party
and, where applicable, the Seller shall make or cause to be made the
registrations, declarations and filings required of such Party and its
Affiliates under the HSR Act and any other applicable Competition Law
("Competition Filings") with respect to the Transactions as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Agreement Date (but in any event file (x) the
Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act no later than ten (10) Business
Days after the Agreement Date, and (y) all other Competition Filings no later
than twenty (20) Business Days after the Agreement Date), and such initial
filings from the Parties shall request early termination of any applicable
waiting period under the HSR Act (unless the Parties agree otherwise) and,
where available and advisable, any other applicable Competition Laws. The
Buyer and the Seller shall promptly furnish to each other all information
reasonably required for any application or other filing to be made by the
other in connection with the Transactions pursuant and subject to the rules
and regulations of any Law. Except as required or permitted by this Agreement,
the Parties shall not knowingly take any action, or knowingly refrain from
taking any action, the effect of which would be to materially delay or
materially impede the ability of the Parties to consummate the Transactions.
The filing fees for any Competition Filings shall be borne one-half by the
Buyer Parties and one-half by the Seller.

(c) Each of the Buyer Parties, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other
hand, agrees (i) not to withdraw or refile any filing (except where (A) an
initial filing (other than a filing under the HSR Act) has been rejected by
any Governmental Entity, or (B) the statutory period for review of a filing
(other than a filing under the HSR Act) has lapsed without the relevant
Governmental Entity making a decision on the filing and in either case a
refile is necessary to secure a Regulatory Approval) or extend any waiting
period with respect to any Regulatory Approval or enter into any agreement
with any Governmental Entity not to consummate the Transactions, except with
the prior written consent of the other Party, (ii) subject to Law, to furnish
to the other Party as promptly as reasonably practicable all information
required for any application or other filing to be made by the other Party
pursuant to any Law in connection with any Regulatory Approval, (iii) to
respond as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than
required by such Governmental Entity) to any inquiries received from, and
supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information or
documentation that may be requested by, the DOJ, the FTC, or any other
Governmental Entity in respect of any Regulatory Approval, this Agreement or
the Transactions, (iv) to promptly notify the other Party of any material
communication between that Party and any Governmental Entity in respect of any
Regulatory Approval or any inquiry or Action relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions and of any material communication received or given in connection
with any Action, whether pending or threatened, by a private party relating to
this Agreement or the Transactions, (v) subject to Law, to discuss with and
permit the other Party (and its counsel) to review in advance, and consider in
good faith the other Party's reasonable comments in connection with, any
filing in connection with any Regulatory Approval or communication to any
Governmental Entity or, in connection with any Action by a private party, to
any other Person, relating to any Regulatory Approval, inquiry or Action
relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, (vi) to not participate or
agree to participate in any substantive meeting, telephone call or discussion
with any Governmental Entity or other Person in respect of any Regulatory
Approval, inquiry or Action relating to this Agreement or the Transactions
without consulting with the other Party in advance and, to the extent not
prohibited by such Governmental Entity, giving the other Party the opportunity
to attend and participate in such meeting, telephone call or discussion, (vii)
subject to Law, to furnish the other Party promptly with copies of all
correspondence, filings and communications between them and their Affiliates
on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or members of their respective
staffs on the other hand, with respect to any Regulatory Approval, inquiry or
Action relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, and (viii) to act in
good faith and reasonably cooperate with the other Party in connection with
procuring any Regulatory Approval and in connection with resolving any
investigation, inquiry or Action with respect to any Regulatory Approval, this
Agreement or the Transactions. The Parties may, as they deem advisable, designate any competitively sensitive materials provided
to the other Party pursuant to this Section 5.2(c) as "outside counsel only."
Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to
outside counsel of the recipient and shall not be disclosed by such outside
counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient without the
advance written consent of the disclosing Party.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Buyer Parties
shall, and shall cause their applicable Affiliates to, use their reasonable
best efforts to (i) resolve, avoid or eliminate any and all impediments or
objections that may be asserted with respect to the Transactions in connection
with any Regulatory Approval or otherwise under any Competition Law and (ii)
avoid the entry of, effect the dissolution of, and have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any Order that would prevent, prohibit, restrict or
delay the consummation of the Transactions, in each case so as to enable the
Parties to consummate the Closing expeditiously (and in any event prior to the
Outside Date); provided, however, that nothing in this Section 5.2 shall
require any Party or any of their respective Affiliates to (x) agree to sell,
divest, license, dispose of or hold separate any assets or businesses, or
otherwise take or commit to take any action that could limit its freedom with
respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of its businesses, product
lines or assets (and no Seller Entity shall take any such action with respect
to the Business, the Acquired Assets or the Acquired Entities without the
prior written consent of the Buyer), (y) agree to the requirement of
expenditure of money by the Buyer Parties or the Seller to a third party in
exchange for any consent, or (z) litigate, pursue or defend against any Action
(including any temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction) by a
Governmental Entity challenging the Transactions as violative of the HSR Act
or any other Law so long as the applicable Party reasonably determines, in
good faith upon advice of counsel, that litigating, pursuing or defending
against such Action would not be reasonably likely to be successful or would
otherwise be inadvisable.

Section 5.3 Operation and Preservation of Business

(a) Except as required by Law or as set forth on Section 5.3(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, the Seller shall not, and shall cause the other Seller
Entities or the Acquired Subsidiary not to, directly or indirectly, engage in
any practice, take any action or enter into any agreement or transaction that,
if taken prior to the Agreement Date, would be described in Section 3.5
without the prior written consent of the Buyer, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided that the Seller shall
not take any action described in Section 3.5(k) regardless of the dollar
amount without the prior written consent of the Buyer, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Seller shall, and shall
cause each of the other Seller Entities and the Acquired Entities to, operate
the Business in the Ordinary Course of Business in all material respects and
use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve (i) its existing relationships
with suppliers, customers, licensors, employees and officers of the Business
and (ii) the Acquired Assets and the assets of the Acquired Entities in the
Ordinary Course of Business. Prior to the Closing, the Seller Entities and the
Acquired Entities shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, complete control over the Business. Without limitation of the
foregoing, (i) the Seller shall not, and shall cause the other Seller Entities
and the Acquired Entities not to, (A) abandon or otherwise fail to maintain
any Assigned Registered Intellectual Property, or (B) grant any licenses under
any Assigned Intellectual Property or Acquired Subsidiary Intellectual
Property, other than non-exclusive licenses granted in the Ordinary Course of
Business, and (ii) the Seller shall, and shall cause the other Seller Entities
and the Acquired Entities to, take prior to the Closing all actions necessary
to maintain any Assigned Registered Intellectual Property, which actions have
a due date on or within thirty (30) days following the Closing. Prior to the
Closing, the Seller shall provide to the Buyer (x) a list of any actions that
must be taken within ninety (90) days after the Closing for the purposes of
obtaining, maintaining, perfecting, preserving or renewing any Assigned Registered Intellectual Property, and (y) a list of any defects or
gaps in the recorded chain of title of the Assigned Registered Intellectual
Property, including cases where such Assigned Registered Intellectual Property
is not recorded in the name of a Seller Entity or the Acquired Subsidiary, and
including any missing inventor or other assignments or recordings of
assignments; provided, however, that with respect to patents and patent
applications, such list of actions shall be provided prior to the end of the
Service Term (as defined in the Transition Services Agreement) applicable to
patent prosecution, procurement and maintenance matters and as further
described in the Transition Services Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (x) nothing contained in
this Agreement shall give the Buyer Parties directly or indirectly the right
to control or direct the operations of the Business prior to the Closing, and
(y) the Seller may take any and all such actions as the Seller reasonably
concludes are necessary or appropriate to, and to cause the other Seller
Entities and the Acquired Entities to, (i) distribute cash, cash equivalents,
bank deposits, similar cash items and securities to the Seller (or its
designee); (ii) transfer to any other Seller Entity or any Affiliate of any
Seller Entity (other than the Acquired Entities) any items described as
Excluded Assets on Schedule 2.3(s), for such consideration (or no
consideration) as shall be determined by the Seller in its sole discretion,
provided such transfer does not result in any ongoing Liability or obligation
of any Acquired Entity; (iii) transfer to the Acquired Subsidiary any items
described as Acquired Assets, for such consideration (or no consideration) as
shall be determined by the Seller in its sole discretion provided such
transfer does not result in any ongoing Liability or obligation of the
Acquired Subsidiary; and (iv) cancel or otherwise resolve intercompany
accounts payable and receivable between the Acquired Entities and any Seller
Entity.

(c) The Buyer Parties shall, and shall cause each of the other Buyer Group
Members to, operate the businesses of the Buyer Group in the Ordinary Course
of Business in all material respects and use commercially reasonable efforts
to preserve (i) the Buyer Group's existing relationships with suppliers,
customers, licensors, employees and officers and (ii) the Buyer Group's
material assets in the Ordinary Course of Business. Prior to the Closing, the
Buyer Group Members shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, complete control over the businesses of the Buyer Group.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give the Seller directly or indirectly the right to control or
direct the operations of the Buyer Group. The Buyer Parent shall comply with
the covenants set forth in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 of the Purchase Price Note as
if the Purchase Price Note had been in effect on the Agreement Date.

(d) Effective as of the Closing, the Seller shall cause all payables,
receivables and Liabilities between the Acquired Entities and any Seller
Entity to be eliminated except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement.

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the actions described on Schedule
5.3(e) (the "Restructuring") to be completed prior to the Closing Date, and
the Buyer Parties shall reasonably cooperate with the Seller in connection
therewith and shall promptly take all reasonable actions requested by the
Seller to implement the Restructuring as described in Schedule 5.3(e). Without
limiting the foregoing, the Seller shall (i) provide the Buyer with drafts of
the documentation to be entered into in connection with the Restructuring
(each, a "Restructuring Document") for the Buyer's review and comment and (ii)
not amend, modify or change the Restructuring in any material respect without
the consent of the Buyer, which such consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. For the avoidance of doubt, no Restructuring Document will provide any Party or its Affiliates with any rights, or subject
any Party or any of its Affiliates to any Liabilities, that are inconsistent
with the terms of this Agreement.

Section 5.4 Exclusivity

The Seller shall, and shall cause the Seller Entities or the Acquired
Subsidiary not to, and shall not allow the Seller Representatives to, directly
or indirectly, solicit, initiate, seek, entertain, encourage, facilitate,
endorse or otherwise support any inquiry, proposal or offer from, furnish any
information to, or participate in any discussions with, any Person (other than
the Buyer Parties) regarding any Competing Transaction. The Seller shall, and
shall cause all Seller Entities and the Acquired Subsidiary to immediately
cease, and cause to be terminated, any and all contacts, discussions and
negotiations with third parties regarding any of the foregoing. If any Seller
Entity or the Acquired Subsidiary receives any inquiry, proposal or offer of
the nature described in this Section 5.4, the Seller shall promptly notify the
Buyer of such inquiry, proposal or offer and disclose to the Buyer the
material terms thereof.

Section 5.5 Full Access and Cooperation; Confidentiality

(a) The Seller will permit the Buyer Parties and the Buyer Representatives to
have reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable advance
notice, and in a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with the normal
business operations of the Seller Entities and the Acquired Subsidiary, to all
premises, properties, personnel, Files and Records (including Tax records and
patent application files), Contracts and documents used in or pertaining
primarily to the Business or any of the Acquired Assets and permit the Buyer
Parties and the Buyer Representatives to make such copies and inspections
thereof as may reasonably be requested. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Seller shall not be required to provide access to or disclose information
where such access or disclosure would jeopardize any attorney-client or other
privilege of any Seller Entity or the Acquired Subsidiary or contravene any
Law; provided, however, in each case that the Seller shall, and shall cause
the Seller Entities or the Acquired Subsidiary to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to enable such information to be disclosed, furnished or made
available to the Buyer Parties, if and as applicable, so that the Buyer
Parties and the Buyer Representatives may have access to such information
without so jeopardizing privilege or contravening such Law, including by
entering into a customary joint defense agreement or common interest agreement
with the Buyer Parties.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) neither the Buyer Parties nor any of
the Buyer Representatives shall have access to (A) personnel records of the
Business Employees the disclosure of which is prohibited by Law, (B) except as
set forth on Schedule 5.5(b), any real property of the Seller or any of its
direct or indirect Subsidiaries for purposes of conducting any environmental
sampling or testing of any environmental media (including soil, sediment,
groundwater, soil vapor, ambient air, and building material), (C) any
information that constitutes an Excluded Asset or to the extent such
information is not primarily relating to or used in the Business, or (D) any
Tax Return for any Affiliated Group of which any Seller Entity is a member or
any work papers related thereto.

(c) To the extent reasonably practicable, the Seller shall have the right to
have one or more Seller Representatives present at all times during any
inspection, interview or examination pursuant to this Section 5.5. The Buyer
Parties shall hold in confidence all information provided to it by a Seller
Entity or any Seller Representative, whether before or after the Agreement
Date, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions contained in the
Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated April 17, 2020 (as amended, restated,
supplemented or modified from time to time), between the Buyer Parent, an
Affiliate of the Buyer Parent and the Seller (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), and such information shall not be used by the Buyer Parties, any of its Affiliates or any of their respective representatives,
other than in connection with the Transactions or as otherwise expressly
permitted by the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding anything contained
in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the Closing, without the prior
written consent of the Seller (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), the Buyer Parties shall not contact, and shall
prohibit their Affiliates from contacting, any Business Employees or any
vendors or suppliers to, or customers, subcontractors or prime contractors of,
the Seller Entities or the Acquired Entities regarding the Business, this
Agreement, the Transaction Documents or the Transactions.

(d) With respect to each fiscal month of the Seller ending after the Agreement
Date, the Seller shall provide the Buyer with summary, preliminary financial
results for the Business for such completed fiscal month (or, with respect to
the last month of a fiscal quarter, the fiscal quarter), with the same level
of detail (by category) as provided to the Chief Executive Officer of the
Seller, which such results shall be provided to the Buyer no later than two
(2) Business Days following their delivery to the Chief Executive Officer.

Section 5.6 Notice of Developments

Buyer Parties of any fact, action, circumstance, breach or event (i) that
would reasonably be likely to result in the failure of any of the Buyer
Parties' conditions to Closing set forth in Article VIII to be satisfied, (ii)
that would reasonably be likely to restrict, impair or delay in any material
respect the performance of the Seller Entities' obligations under this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, (iii) the occurrence of, or the
receipt of any written notice threatening, any event or condition which would
reasonably be expected to result in a Seller Material Adverse Effect, (iv)
receipt by any Seller Entity of any material written correspondence from any

Liabilities or the Transactions.

(b) The Buyer may, but is not required, to provide written notice to the
Seller of any fact, action, circumstance, breach or event (i) that would
reasonably be likely to result in the failure of any of the Seller's

would reasonably be likely to restrict, impair or delay in any material

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS



Section 6.1 Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation

(a) For a period of [****] following the Closing Date, the Seller shall, and
the Seller shall cause its controlled Affiliates (together with the Seller,
the "Seller Restricted Parties") not to, anywhere in the world, directly or
indirectly, whether or not alone or in association or in connection with or on
behalf of any Person now existing or hereafter created (other than the Buyer
Parties and their respective Affiliates), whether or not for its own account
or for the benefit of others (other than the Buyer Parties and their
respective controlled Affiliates) engage in the Business or invest in, own,
manage, operate, control or participate in the ownership, management,
operation or control of any Person engaged in the Business; provided, however,
that a Seller Restricted Party may passively invest in the securities of any
such Person (but without otherwise participating in the activities of such
Person) if the Seller does not beneficially own (as defined Rule 13d-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act) in excess of five percent (5%) of the
outstanding equity of such Person. The foregoing shall not prevent (A) a
Seller Restricted Party from working with vendors of semiconductor components
to develop such components for use in any Seller Restricted Party's lines of

acquired pursuant to a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination or other similar transaction, (y) the acquisition by any Person of
some, a majority or all of a Seller Restricted Party's issued and outstanding
voting equity interests, or (z) the sale, lease, transfer or other disposition
of some, all or substantially all of the Seller's direct or indirect assets;
and, for the avoidance of doubt, in each case ((x), (y) and (z)), this
provision shall not restrict such acquiring Person or its Affiliates from
engaging in the Business so long as none of the Seller or any of its
Affiliates facilitates such acquired Person's engagement in the Business,
including through the provision to such Person or business of Buyer
Confidential Information, for a period of [****] following the Closing Date;
(C) the acquisition by a Seller Entity, pursuant to a merger, consolidation,
share exchange, business combination or other similar transaction, of (i)
some, a majority or all of a Person's issued and outstanding voting equity
interests or (ii) all or substantially all of a Person's assets, if such
Person engages in the Business, so long as (x) the Business constitutes less
than five percent (5%) of the annual consolidated revenue of such Person on
the date of such acquisition and (y) none of the Seller or any of its
Affiliates facilitates such acquired Person's engagement in the Business
through the provision to such Person or business of Buyer Confidential
Information or of the Intellectual Property that is included in the Acquired
Assets or is owned by any Acquired Entity or any other rights provided to the
Buyer under the Intellectual Property Assignment and License Agreement for a
period of [****] following the Closing Date, (D) any Seller Restricted Party
from investing, holding ownership interests or otherwise participating in the
management or operations of the company (including its successors and assigns)
listed on Schedule 6.1(a) provided such Seller Restricted Party shall not take
any action with respect to such company that could reasonably be expected to
materially and adversely impact the Seller's business relationship with such
company after the Closing; or (E) performance under the Supply Agreement by
any applicable Seller Restricted Party. Without limiting the remedies
available to the Buyer, the Seller agrees that damages at law would be an
insufficient remedy in the event of breach of this Section 6.1(a) by any
Seller Restricted Party and that the Buyer shall be entitled to temporary,
provisional or permanent injunctive relief or other equitable remedies in the
event of any such breach without the necessity of posting a bond or other form
of financial assurance.

1.The Seller agrees that, during the [****] period following the Closing Date,
it will not, and it will cause each other Seller Restricted Party not to,
without the prior written consent of the Buyer, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment, encourage the
resignation of, enter into any employment agreement (conditional or otherwise)
with or employ (i) any Continuing Employee, or (ii) any Business Employee who
is offered employment with the Buyer Parties under and in compliance with
Section 7.1(a) and either (A) rejects such offer of employment or (B) accepts
such offer of employment but does not commence employment with Buyer or one of
its Affiliates on the applicable Employee Transfer Date, except that the
Seller Restricted Parties shall not be precluded from hiring an employee who
has been terminated by the Buyer or its Affiliates at least six (6) months
prior to commencement of employment discussions between the applicable Seller
Restricted Party and such employee, provided such hiring is consistent with
such employee's Contractual obligations to the Buyer or its Affiliates. The
placing of an advertisement of a position by a Seller Restricted Party to
members of the public generally, such as through newspapers, radio or
television, of general mass mailing to the public, shall not itself constitute
a breach of this Section 6.1(b) provided such general methods of solicitation
are not specifically directed to the Continuing Employee.

(b) Other than in accordance with Article VII, each Buyer Party agrees that,
during the [****] period following the Closing Date, it will not, and it will
cause each of its Affiliates not to, without the prior written consent of the
Seller, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment or enter into any
employment agreement (conditional or otherwise) with or employ any employee of
the Seller or any of its Affiliates, except that the Buyer Parties and their
Affiliates shall not be precluded from hiring an employee who has been
terminated by the Seller or its Affiliates at least six (6) months prior to
commencement of employment discussions between the applicable Buyer Party or
Affiliate of a Buyer Party and such employee, provided such hiring is
consistent with such employee's Contractual obligations to the Seller and its
Affiliates. The placing of an advertisement of a position by a Buyer Party or
an Affiliate of a Buyer Party to members of the public generally, such as
through newspapers, radio or television, of general mass mailing to the
public, shall not itself constitute a breach of this Section 6.1(c) provided
such general methods of solicitation are not specifically directed to any
employee of the Seller or any of its Affiliates.

(c) In the event of a breach or threatened breach of this Section 6.1, each
Party shall be entitled, without the posting of a bond, to enforce the terms
of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance without the necessity of
proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy, including by obtaining a
temporary, preliminary or permanent injunction restraining such breach without
the necessity of posting a bond or other form of financial assurance. Nothing
herein contained shall be construed as prohibiting any Party from pursuing any
other remedy available to it for such breach or threatened breach. In the
event of an Action involving this Section 6.1, the non-prevailing party shall
reimburse the prevailing party for all costs and expenses, including
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, incurred in connection with any such
Action, including any appeal therefrom. The existence of any Action by any
Party or any of its Affiliates against any other Party or any of its
Affiliates, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, will not
constitute a defense to the enforcement by each Party of the provisions of
this Section 6.1, which such this Section 6.1 will be enforceable
notwithstanding the existence of any breach of this Agreement by any Party or
its Affiliates. In addition, the terms of this this Section 6.1 shall be
tolled until such breach or violation is cured if a court determines that any
Party or its Affiliates violated the terms of this this Section 6.1.

(e) The nature and scope of this Section 6.1 have been carefully considered by
the Parties. The Parties agree and acknowledge that the duration, scope and
geographic areas applicable to such provisions are fair, reasonable and
necessary and that adequate compensation has been received by each Party for
such obligations. If any of the provisions of this Section 6.1 are held to be
unenforceable in any jurisdiction, then, as to such jurisdiction, such
provision shall be ineffective solely to the extent of its unenforceability in such jurisdiction, without affecting the remaining
provisions of this Section 6.1 in such jurisdiction, or affecting in any other
jurisdiction the validity or enforceability of such provision or of this
Section 6.1.

Section 6.2 Press Releases and Public Announcements

Except as may be required by Law or the rules or regulations of any national
securities exchange, in each case upon the advice of counsel, none of the
Seller, the Buyer Parties or any of their respective Affiliates shall issue or
cause the publication of any press release or other public disclosure with
respect to the Transactions without the prior written consent of the Buyer
Parties and the Seller, which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; provided that no such consent shall be required in
connection with any press release, announcement or other disclosure by a Party
or an Affiliate of a Party if the contents of such press release, announcement
or other disclosure that relate to the Transactions are limited to information
that previously has been publicly disclosed in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement. Except in cases of any press release, announcement or other
disclosure for which consent of the other Party is not required pursuant to
the preceding sentence, (a) the Buyer Parties and the Seller shall cooperate
with each other in the development and distribution of all press releases and
other public disclosures with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions
and (b) shall furnish the other with drafts of any such releases and
disclosures as far in advance as reasonably practicable. Without limiting the
foregoing, each Party shall consult in good faith with the other Party on the
provisions of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to be
redacted in any filings that may be made by any Party or any of their
respective Affiliates with the SEC or as otherwise required by Law, including
any copy of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document that will be
filed with the SEC via EDGAR. Subject to the foregoing, each of the Seller and
the Buyer Parent acknowledges and agrees that the other Party will file a copy
of this Agreement with the SEC via EDGAR as required by Law.

after the Closing, the Buyer Parties shall, and shall cause the Acquired
Entities and their controlled Affiliates to, hold in trust for the benefit of
the Seller and promptly deliver to the Seller all cash, payments, other
property, mail, faxes, documents, communications, correspondence and other
deliveries received directly or indirectly by the Buyer Parties, the Acquired

to cease all usage of the Cree Name in any form or manner whatsoever except as
permitted by the Intellectual Property Assignment and License Agreement.
Subject to such fifteen (15) Business Day grace period with respect to the
Acquired Subsidiary, and except as may be permitted by the Intellectual

Section 6.4 Tax Matters

(a) All transfer (including real estate transfer and personal property
transfer), documentary, excise, consumption, sales, use, value added, stamp,
conveyance, registration, filing, recordation and other similar Taxes and fees
(including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this
Agreement or the Transactions ("Transfer Taxes") shall be borne and paid in
equal shares by the Seller and the Buyer provided that any penalties and
interest caused by the fault of either Party shall be borne solely by that
Party. The Party required by Law will, at its own expense, file, or cause to
be filed, all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to
all such Transfer Taxes, and if required by Law, the other Party will join in
the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation following review
and approval of such Tax Returns and other documentation by such other Party.

Tax Return or otherwise remit any such Transfer Taxes, such Party shall notify
the other Party of the amount of the Transfer Taxes shown to be due on such
Tax Return or that are otherwise required to be remitted and such other Party
shall pay to the notifying Party fifty percent (50%) of the amount of such
Transfer Taxes by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the notifying Party at least three (3) Business Days prior to the due date of such Tax Return (as specified in the notice provided by the

exemption as the Buyer is legally permitted to provide.

(b) All real and personal property Taxes and similar ad valorem obligations
levied with respect to the Acquired Assets ("Property Taxes") for any Straddle
Period shall be apportioned between the portion of such Straddle Period ending
on the Closing Date and the portion of such Straddle Period beginning on the
day after the Closing Date based on the relative numbers of days in such
portions of such Straddle Period. The Seller shall be responsible for and
shall pay the amount of such Property Taxes apportioned to the portion of the
applicable Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, and the Buyer shall be
responsible for and shall pay the amount of such Property Taxes apportioned to
the portion of the applicable Straddle Period beginning on the date after the
Closing Date.

(c) To the extent that the Seller pays or has paid any amounts for which the
Buyer is responsible under Section 6.4(a) or Section 6.4(b), the Buyer shall
reimburse the Seller within thirty (30) days after the Seller's written
request for reimbursement (which written request shall include such supporting
evidence as is reasonably necessary to calculate such amount to be
reimbursed). To the extent that the Buyer pays any amounts for which the
Seller is responsible under Section 6.4(a) or Section 6.4(b), the Seller shall
reimburse the Buyer within thirty (30) days after the Buyer's written request

Returns for any Affiliated Group of which the Acquired Subsidiary is a member

or cause to be prepared, and timely file, or cause to be timely filed, all
Income Tax Returns for the Acquired Subsidiary for all Tax periods ending on
or prior to the Closing Date that are due after the Closing Date (taking into
account extensions). Such Income Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with the past practice of the Seller and the Acquired Subsidiary,
unless prohibited by Law. The Seller will provide the Buyer with copies of any
such Income Tax Return for the Buyer's review and approval (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), at least thirty (30) days
prior to the due date thereof (giving effect to any extensions thereto). The
Seller shall be responsible for and pay to the Buyer any Taxes paid by the
Buyer with respect to the Tax Returns prepared by the Seller pursuant to this
Section 6.4(e) (other than to the extent included in the final determination
of the Closing Net Working Capital Amount or to the extent such Taxes are
Buyer Action Taxes) at least ten (10) days prior to the due date thereof.

(f) Subject to Section 6.4(g), the Buyer, at its own expense, will prepare, or
cause to be prepared, and timely file, or cause to be timely filed, all Tax
Returns for the Acquired Subsidiary for Straddle Periods and all Tax Returns
other than Income Tax Returns for the Acquired Subsidiary for all Tax periods
ending on or prior to the Closing Date that are due after the Closing Date
(such Tax Returns the "Buyer Prepared Returns"). Such Buyer Prepared Returns
shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the past practice of the Seller
and the Acquired Subsidiary, unless prohibited by Law. The Buyer will provide
the Seller with copies of any Income Tax Returns that are Buyer Prepared
Returns, and of any other Buyer Prepared Return with respect to which the
Buyer Indemnified Persons will seek indemnification from the Seller, for the
Seller's review and approval (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date thereof (giving
effect to any extensions thereto), accompanied by a statement setting forth and calculating

Acquired Subsidiary Taxes with respect to such Tax Return.

(g) If the Buyer does not approve any Tax Return as prepared by the Seller
under Section 6.4(e) or the Seller does not approve any Tax Return as prepared
by the Buyer under Section 6.4(f) and the Seller and the Buyer are unable to
reach agreement as to such Tax Return at least ten (10) days prior to the due
date thereof, the disputed items shall be resolved by an internationally
recognized independent accounting firm, jointly selected by the Seller and the
Buyer (or if they cannot agree on such an accounting firm, an internationally
recognized accounting firm without a business relationship with the Buyer or
the Seller that is selected by an accounting firm designated by the Seller and
an accounting firm designated by the Buyer) (such firm, or any successor
thereto, being referred to herein as the "Tax Return Accounting Firm") for
resolution. In connection with the resolution of any such dispute by the Tax
Return Accounting Firm, (i) each of the Buyer and the Seller shall have a
reasonable opportunity to meet with the Tax Return Accounting Firm to provide
its views as to the disputed elements of the subject Tax Return; provided,
that (1) each Party will provide the other Party with a copy of all materials
provided to, and communications with, the Tax Return Accounting Firm and (2)
no party will engage in any ex parte communication with the Tax Return
Accounting Firm at any time with respect to the subject Tax Return; (ii) upon
reaching its determination on the disputed elements of the subject Tax Return,
the Tax Return Accounting Firm shall deliver a written copy of its
determination to the Seller and the Buyer; and (iii) the determination made by
the Tax Return Accounting Firm regarding the disputed elements of the subject
Tax Return shall be conclusive, final and binding on the Parties for all
purposes of this Agreement, absent Fraud or manifest error. In resolving
disputes over Tax Returns, the Tax Return Accounting Firm shall be limited to
(x) addressing any particular disputes referred to the Tax Return Accounting
Firm by the Buyer or the Seller, and (y) choosing with respect to any
particular item in dispute the Buyer's position, the Seller's position or, if
applicable, a position in between the Seller's position and the Buyer's
position. If the Tax Return Accounting Firm's final determination is in full
agreement with the Buyer, then the Seller shall bear the fees and expenses of
the Tax Return Accounting Firm. If the Tax Return Accounting Firm's final
determination is in full agreement with the Seller, then the Buyer shall bear
the fees and expenses of the Tax Return Accounting Firm. Otherwise, each of
the Seller and the Buyer shall pay one-half of the fees and expenses of the
Tax Return Accounting Firm for such determination; provided that if the Tax
Return Accounting Firm determines that one Party has adopted one or more
positions with respect to the subject Tax Return that are frivolous or clearly
without merit, the Tax Return Accounting Firm may, in its discretion, assign a
greater portion of any such fees and expenses to such Party. If the Tax Return
Accounting Firm is unable to resolve any disputed items before the due date
for such Tax Return, the Tax Return shall be filed as prepared by the Party
responsible for preparing that Tax Return, in each case as adjusted to reflect
any agreed-upon items, and such Tax Return shall thereafter be amended to
reflect the Tax Return Accounting Firm's resolution of the matter.

(h) Except as required by Law, the Buyer shall not cause or permit the
Acquired Subsidiary to modify or amend any Tax Returns, to initiate any
voluntary disclosure or other communication with any Taxing authority relating
to any actual or potential Tax payment or Tax Return filing obligation, to
change any accounting period, to adopt or change any accounting method, to
surrender any right to claim a refund of Taxes, to waive or extend any statute
of limitations or to make or change any Tax election, in each case with
respect to any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date (not
including any Straddle Period), without the prior written consent of the
Seller (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided
that the Parties will negotiate in good faith any such actions proposed by
Buyer and if the Parties are unable to reach a resolution with respect to a
particular matter, then such matter shall be submitted to a nationally recognized accounting firm and
subject to the resolution process described in Section 6.4(g).

(i) From and after the Closing, the Buyer Parties shall notify the Seller in
writing within three (3) Business Days of receipt by any of the Buyer Parties
or any of their Affiliates (including the Acquired Subsidiary) of notice of
any pending or threatened federal, state, local or foreign Audit of the
Acquired Subsidiary that would reasonably be expected to give rise to an
indemnity claim under this Agreement. The Seller shall have the right to
control any such Audit that relates to any Tax period ending on or before the
Closing Date and, if the Seller chooses to control any such Audit, the Seller
shall make all decisions (including selection of counsel) with respect to such
Audit and may, in its sole discretion, pursue or forgo any and all
administrative appeals, proceedings, hearing and conferences with any
Governmental Entity in connection therewith; provided, however, that the
Seller shall keep the Buyer Parties apprised of all material developments,
including settlement offers, with respect to any such Audit and permit the
Buyer Parties to participate in the defense of the Audit at the Buyer Parties'
expense; provided, further, that the Seller shall not enter into any
settlement with respect to any such Audit without the prior written consent of
the Buyer, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.. In the event of any conflict or overlap between the provisions of
this Section 6.4(i) and Section 10.3, this Section 6.4(i) shall control.

(j) The Seller shall cause all Tax sharing agreements or arrangements with
respect to or involving the Acquired Subsidiary to be terminated prior to the
Closing Date, and after the Closing Date, the Buyer, the Acquired Subsidiary
and their Affiliates shall not be bound thereby or have any Liability
thereunder.

(k) At the Seller's request to the Buyer at any time on or prior to the date
that is fifteen (15) days after the Adjustment Amount has been finally
determined pursuant to Section 2.9, the Buyer shall (i) make an election under
Section 338(g) of the Code (and any similar election under state, local or
non-U.S. Tax law) after Closing with respect to the purchase and sale of the
Transferred Subsidiary Interests of the Acquired Subsidiary identified by the
Seller in such request or (ii) cooperate with the Seller and sign such
documents that are necessary to cause the taxable years of the Acquired
Entities to close for U.S. federal income Tax purposes. Except as provided in
the preceding sentence, the Buyer shall not make an election under Section
338(g) of the Code (or any similar election under federal, state, local or
non-U.S. Tax law) with respect to the purchase and sale of the Transferred
Interests without the prior written consent of the Seller. At the Seller's
request, the Buyer shall cause the Acquired Subsidiary to make or join with
the Seller in making any other election if the making of such election does
not have a material and adverse impact on the Buyer for any post-Closing Tax
period.

(l) The Buyer and the Seller agree that if the Acquired Subsidiary is
permitted but not required under applicable foreign, state or local Tax Laws
to treat the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period, the Buyer and
the Seller shall treat, and shall cause the Acquired Subsidiary to treat, such
day as the last day of a taxable period.

(m) The Buyer and the Seller agree to utilize, or cause their respective
Affiliates to utilize, the standard procedure set forth in Revenue Procedure
2004-53 with respect to wage reporting. The Buyer Parties and the Seller will,
and will cause their respective Affiliates to, provide each other with such
cooperation, documents and information as either of them reasonably may
request of the other in connection with the filing of any Tax Return pursuant
to this Section 6.4, the determination of any Liability for Taxes or a right
to refund of Taxes, the preparation for litigation of any Liability for Taxes
or in connection with any Audit, in each case, with respect to the Business,
the Acquired Assets or the Acquired Subsidiary. Such cooperation will include
the retention and (upon the other Party's request) the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such
Audit and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, such cooperation shall also
include promptly forwarding copies of notices and forms or other communication
received from or sent to any Governmental Entity which relate to Tax Returns
or Taxes of the Acquired Subsidiary for any taxable period beginning on or
before the Closing Date and providing copies of all relevant Tax Returns for
any taxable period beginning on or before the Closing Date, together with
accompanying schedules and related workpapers, and documents relating to
rulings and other determinations relating to Taxes or Tax Returns by
Governmental Entities, which either Party may possess. The Buyer and the
Seller will retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent
to the Acquired Subsidiary or the Business relating to any Tax period
beginning on or before the Closing Date until thirty (30) days after the
expiration of the statute or period of limitations of the respective Tax
periods. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision herein to the
contrary, in no event shall the Buyer Parties or their Affiliates be entitled
to review or otherwise have access to any Income Tax Returns, or information
related thereto, of the Seller or its Affiliates. Any information obtained
under this Section 6.4(m) will be kept confidential, except that such
information may be disclosed to any Governmental Entity or any legal or
accounting advisors of the disclosing party if such disclosure is necessary in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in
conducting an Audit.

Section 6.5 Bulk Sales

The Parties hereby waive compliance with the provisions of any bulk sales,
bulk transfer or similar Laws of any jurisdiction that may otherwise be
applicable with respect to the Transactions.

Section 6.6 Further Assurances; Delivery of Assets

(a) If at any time after the Closing any further action is necessary to carry
out the purposes of the Transaction Documents and the Transactions, each Party
shall take (or cause to be taken) such further action (including the execution
and delivery of such further instruments and documents) as any other Party
reasonably may request, all at the requesting Party's cost and expense (unless
the requesting Party is entitled to indemnification therefor under Article X).
Prior to and following the Closing, each Party agrees to (and to cause its
Affiliates to) cooperate with the other Party (and its Affiliates) and to take
such actions and execute such further instruments, documents and agreements,
and to give such further written assurances, that may be reasonably requested
by the other Party to evidence and reflect better the Transactions and to
carry into effect the intents and purposes of this Agreement.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Seller shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver, transfer and make available
the tangible Acquired Assets (except for Acquired Assets that will remain at
the Transferred Real Property or the Licensed Real Property) for pick-up by
the Buyer or the Buyer's common carrier (F.O.B. destination) no later than two
(2) Business Days after the Closing Date. The Seller shall pay the costs of
and bear the risks associated with the physical removal, shipping and transfer
of any such Acquired Assets to the Buyer; provided that the Buyer agrees to
use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with the Seller with respect to such
removal, shipping, transfer and move. The Buyer will, at its sole expense and
in accordance with the Real Estate License Agreement, cause all Acquired
Assets located on the Licensed Real Property to be removed from the premises
of the Seller Entities on or before the Real Estate Transition End Date. With
respect to the Acquired Assets that consist of tangible property or physical
embodiments or electronic files or records, the delivery requirements under
this Section 6.6(b) shall be satisfied if such Acquired Assets are on site at
the appropriate Transferred Real Property or Licensed Real Property, as
applicable, where they are to be utilized as of the Closing or such Acquired Assets that are stored
electronically are made available to the Buyer electronically as of the
Closing.

(c) Subject to Section 2.6 and Section 6.6(b), if at any time or from time to
time after the Closing Date any Party (or any Affiliate thereof) shall
discover that it is in possession of an asset or Liability that is allocated
to another Party (or any of its Affiliates) pursuant to this Agreement or any
agreement or other instrument delivered pursuant hereto, such first Party
shall promptly notify the other Party and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to deliver, transfer and make available, at such other Party's
expense, such asset or Liability to the other Party (or Affiliate thereof) to
which such asset or liability is otherwise allocated hereunder.

Section 6.7 Preservation of Records; Litigation Support

(a) The Buyer Parties shall (i) at their own expense, preserve and keep the
Files and Records constituting or relating to the Acquired Assets or the
Assumed Liabilities or that are held by the Acquired Subsidiary for a period
of not less than seven (7) years from the Closing Date, or for any longer
periods as may be required by any Governmental Entity or as may be made
prudent by the circumstances of any ongoing Audit, assessment or Action, (ii)
provide the Seller and the Seller Representatives with reasonable access to
(and the right to make copies of) the foregoing upon reasonable notice and
during normal business hours during such period, and (iii) at the Seller's
expense, furnish to the Seller such assistance relating to the Acquired
Assets, Assumed Liabilities and the Acquired Subsidiary as is reasonably
necessary for financial reporting and accounting matters, the preparation and
filing of any Tax Returns, or the defense of any Audit, assessment or Action
or providing any information in response to a requirement or request of any
Governmental Entity or securities exchange or market; provided that the Buyer
Parties may delete certain Files and Records relating to periods prior to the
Closing in accordance with the Buyer Parties' document retention policy (which
document retention policy, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to e-mails
(unless Law mandates otherwise) contemplates deletion on a rolling basis and,
with respect to other Files and Records, contemplates deletion in accordance
with Law).

(b) The Seller shall (i) at its own expense, preserve and keep the Files and
Records constituting Excluded Assets, to the extent relating to the Business,
Acquired Assets, the Acquired Subsidiary, Licensed Intellectual Property or
Assumed Liabilities, for a period of not less than seven (7) years from the
Closing Date, or for any longer periods as may be required by any Governmental

to the Acquired Assets, the Acquired Subsidiary, Licensed Intellectual
Property and Assumed Liabilities as is reasonably necessary for financial
reporting and accounting matters, the preparation and filing of any Tax
Returns, or the defense of any Audit, assessment or Action or providing any
information in response to a requirement or request of any Governmental Entity
or securities exchange or market; provided that the Seller may delete certain
Files and Records relating to periods prior to the Closing in accordance with
the Seller's document retention policy (which document retention policy, for
the avoidance of doubt, with respect to e-mails (unless Law mandates
otherwise) contemplates deletion on a rolling basis and, with respect to other
Files and Records, contemplates deletion in accordance with Law).

(c) In the event and for so long as any Party is actively contesting or
defending against any Action in connection with (i) the completion of the
Transactions or (ii) any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition,
activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act
or transaction on or prior to the Closing Date involving the Business, the Acquired Assets, the
Acquired Entities, the Assumed Liabilities or the Excluded Liabilities, the
Seller and the Buyer Parties will use reasonable best efforts to cooperate
with and otherwise assist such Party and its counsel in the contest or
defense, make reasonably available, as applicable, the Seller Representatives
and the Buyer Representatives (including Continuing Employees that are
employed by the Buyer or any Affiliate of the Buyer, including the Acquired
Entities), participate in meetings, and provide such testimony and reasonable
access to its books and records as shall be necessary in connection with the
contest or defense, all at the sole cost and expense of the contesting or
defending Party (except as otherwise provided in Section 5.2 and unless the
Parties are adverse to each other in the Action or the contesting or defending
Party is entitled to indemnification therefor under Article X); provided that
each of the Parties shall coordinate with the other Party prior to contacting,
as applicable, any Seller Representative or Buyer Representative.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Seller Entities may
retain copies of all Files and Records included in the Acquired Assets or held
by the Acquired Subsidiary and any other Files and Records and materials
included in any electronic data room or that are otherwise in the possession
or under the control of the Seller or its direct and indirect Subsidiaries
relating to the conduct of the Business, the Acquired Assets, the Assumed
Liabilities, the Acquired Entities on or before the Closing Date for any use
not inconsistent with the Transaction Documents (which such permitted use of
such Files and Records (to the extent such Files and Records do not constitute
Excluded Assets) shall not include competition with the Business or any Buyer
Party).

Section 6.8 Certain Matters Covered by Seller Insurance

(a) In the event that the Closing occurs and there shall exist or occur prior
to the Closing Date any claims, acts, omissions, events or circumstances
relating to the Business that give rise to Liabilities that constitute Assumed

to a substantially similar level of coverage under their respective insurance
policies (the "Pre-Closing Occurrences"), (i) the Buyer shall promptly give
notice to the Seller, and (ii) at the Buyer's request the Seller and its
Affiliates shall (A) use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly report

policy in effect for any period of time following the Closing or (y) restrict
the Seller or any of its Affiliates from amending any insurance policy for any
period of time following the Closing.

Buyer's written request, from and after the Closing, the Seller shall and
shall cause the Seller Entities to make claims under such policies to the
extent such coverage is available under such policies and any net insurance
proceeds received with respect thereto shall be promptly delivered to the
Buyer or its designated Affiliates as provided therein. The Seller agrees to
use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue all such claims; provided that
the Buyer shall reimburse the Seller for its out-of-pocket costs incurred in
such pursuit; and provided further that, unless Buyer is entitled to
indemnification therefor from the Seller under Article X, the Buyer shall
exclusively bear (and the Seller shall have no obligation to repay or
reimburse the Buyer for) the amount of any deductibles associated with claims
made under such policies. The Buyer and the Seller shall (at the Buyer's sole
expense) cooperate in connection with making any such claim and each shall
provide the other with all reasonably requested information necessary to make
such claim. (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.8 will (i)
obligate any Party to maintain any insurance policy in effect, (ii) restrict
any Party from amending any insurance policy or (iii) obligate any Party to
commence or maintain any Action against any insurance carrier or otherwise.

this Agreement, in the certificate delivered by the Seller pursuant to Section
8.2(d) or in any other Transaction Document, the Seller disclaims all

completeness of any information regarding any of the foregoing.

Section 6.10 Confidentiality

(a) Upon the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate (and the
Parties shall take such actions as may be necessary to cause the
Confidentiality Agreement to terminate) and be superseded by this Section 6.10
other than with respect to the Buyer's and its Affiliates' obligations of, and
the Seller's and its Affiliates' rights to, confidentiality and non-use
thereunder with respect to information (i) regarding (A) the Retained
Businesses, (B) the Excluded Assets or (C) the Excluded Liabilities or (ii)
not related to the Acquired Assets, the Licensed Intellectual Property, the
Assumed Liabilities, the Acquired Entities or the Business (all such
information, the "Seller Confidential Information"). With respect to Seller
Confidential Information, the Parties acknowledge and agree that,
notwithstanding any provision in the Confidentiality Agreement to the
contrary, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue to apply to such Seller Confidential Information, shall remain in effect for a
period of five (5) years after the Closing, and are incorporated herein by
reference. If, for any reason, the Closing does not occur, the Confidentiality
Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect in accordance with
its terms.

(b) From the Closing Date and for a period of five (5) years following the
Closing Date, the Seller agrees to, and to cause each of its controlled
Affiliates and each of its and its controlled Affiliates' respective officers,
directors, employees and agents to, (i) maintain the confidentiality of, (ii)

skills and experience in the unaided memories of the employees and agents of

Information (such information, to the extent related to the Business, the
"Buyer Confidential Information"). If the Seller or any of its controlled
Affiliates shall be required by Law to divulge any Buyer Confidential
Information, the Seller and its controlled Affiliates, as applicable, shall
provide the Buyer with prompt written notice of each request so that the Buyer
may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy, and the
Seller and its controlled Affiliates shall cooperate with the Buyer to obtain
a protective order or other remedy to maintain the confidentiality of such
information; provided that, in the event that a protective order or other
remedy is not obtained, the Seller and its controlled Affiliates may furnish

confidential treatment will be accorded any such information so disclosed.

the "Released Claims"), and (b) irrevocably agree to refrain from directly or
indirectly asserting any claim or demand or commencing (or causing to be
commenced) any Action against any Released Party based upon any Released

ARTICLE VII

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

Section 7.1 Employment

(a) Subject to Section 7.8, the Buyer Parties may, or may cause an Affiliate
to, make an offer of employment prior to the Closing to such Business
Employees (including any such Business Employees on Employee Leave) as they
may determine in their discretion, with such offers of employment to be
effective immediately upon the applicable Employee Transfer Date; provided,
however, that (i) the Buyer has previously discussed, or shall as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Agreement Date discuss, with the Seller
its intentions regarding the Business Employees with whom it intends to meet
and to whom it is considering potentially making offers of employment and (ii)
any such offer to a Business Employee shall be made no later than twenty (20)
Business Days prior to the Closing. With respect to any Business Employee who
(x) rejects the Buyer Parties' offer of employment described in the foregoing
sentence and that is in compliance with this Section 7.1(a) or (y) accepts the
Buyer Parties' offer of employment described in the foregoing sentence and
that is in compliance with this Section 7.1(a) but does not become a
Transferred Employee, the Seller Entities shall terminate the employment of
such Business Employees as of the Closing Date (or, for any such Business
Employee on Employee Leave, upon such employee's return to work with the
Seller Entities). Each such Business Employee who accepts or has accepted an
offer of employment from the Buyer and becomes an employee of the Buyer, or
one of its Affiliates, on the applicable Employee Transfer Date shall be
referred to herein as a "Transferred Employee." Each offer of employment
contemplated by this Section 7.1(a) shall be for employment "at will."
Transferred Employees and Acquired Subsidiary Employees (whose employment,
unless otherwise provided herein, including pursuant to Section 7.8, shall
automatically transfer with the Acquired Subsidiary) shall collectively be
referred to as "Continuing Employees." The initial terms of employment or
continued employment for each Continuing Employee (and the offers of
employment contemplated by this Section 7.1(a)) shall be for Equivalent Employment and
shall, in addition, provide a bonus opportunity and employee benefits that are
substantially similar in the aggregate to those provided by the applicable
Seller Entity to such Business Employee or by the Acquired Subsidiary to the
Acquired Subsidiary Employee, as the case may be, immediately prior to the
Closing. Any severance benefits for Continuing Employees shall be provided in
accordance with Section 7.2. Subject to Law, nothing herein shall require the
Buyer or any Affiliate of the Buyer to maintain any particular terms or
conditions of employment for any Continuing Employee, or to continue to employ
any Continuing Employee, for any period of time following the Closing, subject
to the obligations of the Buyer Parties to provide severance benefits under
Section 7.2 and the obligation of the Buyer Parties to comply with Section
7.7. Further, nothing herein shall be deemed to alter the at-will status of
any Continuing Employee.

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Seller shall provide the Buyer with access, upon
reasonable notice and at mutually agreed times, to meet with the applicable
Business Employees for the purpose of potentially making offers of employment
or otherwise communicating with the Business Employees in connection with such
offers of employment described in Section 7.1(a). Within a reasonable time
prior to making offers of employment to the applicable Business Employees
under this Section 7.1, the Buyer shall provide copies of such offer letters
(or a copy of the form of such offer letter with a schedule showing the terms
to be offered to each applicable Business Employee) for the Seller's review,
and the Buyer shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments by the
Seller to such offer letters. For the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer shall be
responsible for ensuring that the offer letters comply with the requirements
of this Article VII regardless of any review by the Seller. The Parties
further agree to coordinate in good faith with respect to the making of offers
to applicable Business Employees to minimize any disruption in the Business in
connection with the employment offer process contemplated by this Section 7.1.
The Seller agrees not to interfere with the Buyer's offers of employment in
Section 7.1(a) and agrees not make any statement (orally or in writing), or
engage in any conduct, that has the purpose or effect to discourage any
Business Employee from accepting such offer of employment by Buyer or any of
its Affiliates.

(c) The Seller shall take, or shall cause to be taken, all actions required to
release or cause to be released, each Continuing Employee, effective at or
before the Closing, from any Contract with, or other obligation to, any Seller
Entity to the extent (and only to the extent) such Contract or obligation
imposed by any Seller Entity limits or restricts such Continuing Employee from
being employed by or providing services to the Buyer or any of its Affiliates,
or otherwise engaging in the Business on behalf of the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates.

Section 7.2 Severance

From and after the Closing Date and continuing until the expiration of the
applicable Post-Closing Protected Period, the Buyer Parties shall, or shall
cause an Affiliate to, provide any Continuing Employee who experiences an
actual termination of employment by the Buyer or its applicable Affiliate
under circumstances that would have entitled such Continuing Employee to
severance benefits had he or she remained an employee of the Seller or one of
its Affiliates under the severance plans of the applicable Seller Entity or
the Acquired Subsidiary, as applicable, effective immediately prior to the
date hereof and set forth on Schedule 7.2 (each, a "Seller Severance Plan"),
with severance benefits no less favorable than those set forth in such
applicable Seller Severance Plan that would apply in the event of a
termination of employment "In Connection with a Change in Control" (as defined
in the applicable Seller Severance Plan), with all such severance benefits to
be conditioned upon execution by each such Continuing Employee of a valid
release of claims for the benefit of the Seller and the Buyer (or an
applicable Affiliate of the Buyer), on a form acceptable to the Seller and the
Buyer Parties. The Buyer Parties shall provide Seller with notice of all such terminations and provide
documentation of compliance with this Section 7.2, including copies of
executed releases of claims, within forty-five (45) days of each such
termination of employment.

Section 7.3 Service Credit; Welfare Payments

From and after the applicable Employee Transfer Date, and where applicable
with respect to any benefit plan or compensation arrangement of the Buyer or
any Affiliate of the Buyer, with respect to each Continuing Employee, and
without limiting the employment obligations or terms set forth above in
Section 7.1, (a) the Buyer Parties shall recognize and honor, or cause to be
recognized and honored, any service credit accrued or recognized by the Seller
or any Affiliate thereof as of such date for purposes of determining
eligibility and vesting, as well as for purposes of determining the amount of
PTO or severance to which a Continuing Employee is entitled (but not (i) to
the extent such recognition may result in duplication of benefits or was not
recognized by any Seller Benefit Plan or (ii) for purposes of determining the
amount of benefits under any benefit plan or compensation arrangement of the
Buyer or any Affiliate of the Buyer (including any equity or equity-based or
other incentive compensation plan, award, or arrangement) or with respect to
any defined benefit pension or retiree welfare plan), to the extent that such
credit would be recognized for participants generally under the analogous
Buyer plan; (b) the Buyer Parties shall recognize and honor, or cause to be
recognized and honored, PTO (to the extent included in Accrued Compensation
Obligations and included as a current liability in the final determination of
the Closing Net Working Capital Amount) that was accrued or recognized by the
Seller or any Affiliate thereof as of such date with respect to such
Continuing Employee (or, to the extent honoring such PTO in kind is limited or
prohibited by Law after commercially reasonable accommodation by the Buyer or
an Affiliate of the Buyer for employee consent or similar procedures, pay each
affected Continuing Employee the accrued value of his or her such accrued PTO
in cash); and (c) the Buyer Parties shall use, or cause to be used,
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the applicable group health plan
maintained by the Buyer or an applicable Affiliate of the Buyer to recognize
and credit amounts paid by such employees under an applicable Seller Benefit
Plan towards satisfying deductible expense requirements and out-of-pocket
expense limits during the portion of the calendar year prior to the applicable
Employee Transfer Date, for purposes of an analogous welfare benefit plan
maintained by the Buyer or any Affiliate of the Buyer in which an employee
participates, as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such Buyer
plan for the same plan year; provided that the applicable plan administrator
under each such Seller Benefit Plan shall have timely provided the Buyer with
validated information that allows the Buyer Parties to recognize and credit,
or cause to be recognized and credited, such amounts with respect to each
applicable group health plan maintained by the Buyer or its Affiliates. The
Buyer Parties and the Seller agree that, where applicable with respect to any
medical or dental benefit plan of the Buyer or an Affiliate of the Buyer, the
Buyer Parties shall use, or cause to be used, commercially reasonable efforts
to cause such Buyer plan to waive, with respect to each Continuing Employee,
any pre-existing condition exclusion to the extent such exclusion was
inapplicable, waived, or satisfied by such employee under the applicable
Seller Benefit Plan prior to such employee's Employee Transfer Date.

Section 7.4 COBRA

The Buyer Parties shall provide, or cause to be provided, continuation health
care coverage to all Continuing Employees (and their respective qualified
beneficiaries) who experience a "qualifying event" after the applicable
Employee Transfer Date while employed with the Buyer or any of its Affiliates,
in accordance with and to the extent required under the continuation health
care coverage requirements of COBRA. Except as required to be provided by the
Buyer Parties pursuant to the prior sentence, the Seller shall be responsible for providing continuation coverage and all related
notices to the extent required by Law to any Business Employee and any
Acquired Subsidiary Employee (and their respective qualified beneficiaries)
who experience a "qualifying event" under COBRA on or before the applicable
Employee Transfer Date and to whom the Seller, as of immediately prior to the
applicable Employee Transfer Date, is (a) providing COBRA coverage or (b)
under an obligation to provide such coverage at the election of such
individual (or his or her qualified beneficiary) based on a termination of
employment on or prior to the applicable Employee Transfer Date.

Section 7.5 401(k) Plan

With respect to each Transferred Employee who participates in the Cree, Inc.
401(k) plan (the "401(k) Plan"), each Buyer Party shall permit (or shall cause
its Affiliates to permit), to the extent permitted under the terms of the
401(k) plan of the Buyer Party or its Affiliates, each such Transferred
Employee to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions"
(within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code including loans) in an
amount equal to the full account balance (including loans) distributable to
such Transferred Employee from the 401(k) Plan to a 401(k) plan of the Buyer
Party or its Affiliates.

Section 7.6 Standard Procedure

pursuant to the "Standard Procedure" provided in Section 4 of Revenue
Procedure 2004 53, 2004 2 C.B. 320, (a) the Buyer Parties and the Seller shall
report, or cause to be reported, on a predecessor/successor basis as set forth
therein; (b) the Seller will not be relieved from filing a Form W 2 with
respect to any Transferred Employees; and (c) the Buyer Parties will undertake
to file (or cause to be filed) a Form W 2 for each such Transferred Employee
with respect to the portion of the year during which such Transferred Employee
is employed by the Buyer or an Affiliate of the Buyer, excluding the portion
of such year that such Transferred Employee was employed by the Seller.

Section 7.7 WARN Act and Other Laws

The Buyer Parties and the Seller shall comply, and cause their Affiliates to
comply, in all material respects with all Laws relating to the hiring of
Business Employees by the Buyer or its Affiliates, including all applicable
discrimination and leave Laws and all applicable international counterparts
thereof. The Buyer Parties shall provide, or cause to be provided, any
required notice under, and otherwise comply with, the WARN Act with respect to
employment losses of Continuing Employees that occur after the Closing Date.
In accordance with 29 U.S.C. 2101(b)(1), the Seller shall provide any required
notice under, and otherwise comply with, the WARN Act with respect to
employment losses of Business Employees or the Acquired Subsidiary Employees
that occur on or prior to the Closing Date.

Section 7.8 International Employees

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article VII, with respect
to Business Employees and Acquired Subsidiary Employees residing in
jurisdictions other than the United States (the "International Employees"),
each Buyer Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, comply with the
terms and conditions set forth on Schedule 7.8(a), in addition to the other
applicable terms and conditions of this Article VII (to the extent consistent
with Schedule 7.8(a)).

(b) In the case of any International Employees who become Continuing

or standards arising under Laws or Contracts governing the terms and conditions of their employment or severance of
employment in connection with the Transactions or otherwise to the extent any

otherwise applicable terms and conditions of this Article VII.

(c) With respect to Transferred Employees residing in the United States, each
Buyer Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, continue to provide
reasonably necessary immigration support for the United States residency of
such Transferred Employees (including obtaining or maintaining a United States
H1B or H2B Visa, green card, temporary work visa or other work permit).

Section 7.9 Outstanding Equity Awards

The Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take such actions as are
reasonably necessary so that, effective as of and contingent upon the
applicable Employee Transfer Date, all equity awards made to any Continuing
Employees outstanding as of the applicable Employee Transfer Date that would
have vested solely based on the passage of time in the twelve (12) month
period ending on the one-year anniversary of the applicable Employee Transfer
Date shall be accelerated as of immediately prior to the applicable Employee
Transfer Date and become settled, exercised or exercisable in accordance with
its terms.

Section 7.10 No Third-Party Beneficiaries

This Article VII shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of the
Buyer Parties and the Seller, and nothing in this Article VII, expressed or
implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer upon any other Person any
rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever or to establish or constitute an
amendment of any compensation or benefit plan maintained by any Seller Entity,
the Acquired Subsidiary, any Buyer Party or any of their respective Affiliates
(or an undertaking to amend any such plan). Without limiting the foregoing, no
provision of this Article VII shall create any third party beneficiary rights
in any current or former employee, director or consultant of any Seller Entity
or the Acquired Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates.

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER



Section 9.1 Termination

At any time prior to the Closing, this Agreement may be terminated:

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Buyer and the Seller;

(b) by the Seller or the Buyer by written notice to the other Party if any
Governmental Entity having competent jurisdiction has issued, enacted or
promulgated (i) a final, non-appealable Order permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the purchase and sale of the Transferred
Interests or the Acquired Assets or the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities
or (ii) any Law that is in effect and has the effect of making the Transaction
illegal or otherwise preventing the purchase and sale of the Transferred
Interests or the Acquired Assets or the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities
provided, that this right of termination shall not be available to any Party whose
failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement has been the
primary cause of, or has primarily resulted in, such Order;

(c) by the Seller or the Buyer by written notice to the other Party if the
Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to [****] (as may be extended
pursuant to this Section 9.1(c), the "Outside Date"); provided that if on the
then-applicable Outside Date all of the conditions set forth in Section 8.1,
Section 8.2 and Section 8.3 have been satisfied or waived (which waiver may be
solely for purposes of extending the Outside Date under this Section 9.1(c)),
other than (i) the conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by
actions to be taken at Closing, each of which is then capable of being
satisfied, (ii) obtaining the Mandatory Regulatory Approvals, or (iii) the
existence of a Closing Legal Impediment related to any Mandatory Regulatory
Approval, then either the Buyer or the Seller may extend the Outside Date for
a period of six (6) months to [****] by written notice to such other Party;
provided further that the applicable rights of termination under this Section
9.1(c) shall not be available to (x) any Party whose failure to comply with
its obligations under this Agreement has been the primary cause of, or has
primarily resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to such
then-applicable Outside Date, or (y) either Party if the other Party has filed
an Action seeking specific performance and is actively pursuing such Action at
the time of such Party's attempt to terminate pursuant to this Section 9.1(c).

(d) by the Buyer, by written notice to the Seller, if there has been a breach
of or failure to perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
set forth in this Agreement on the part of the Seller, which breach or failure
to perform individually or in combination with any other such breach, (i)
would cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 8.2(a) or Section
8.2(b) not to be satisfied and (ii) if capable of being cured, shall not have
been cured or waived within ten (10) Business Days after the Buyer has
provided the Seller written notice of such breach or failure to perform;
provided that the Buyer shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 9.1(d) if the Buyer is, at that time, in material
breach of this Agreement; or

(e) by the Seller, by written notice to the Buyer, if there has been a breach
of or failure to perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
set forth in this Agreement on the part of either Buyer Party, which breach or
failure to perform (i) would cause the conditions set forth in Section 8.3(a)
or Section 8.3(b) not to be satisfied and (ii) if capable of being cured,
shall not have been cured or waived within ten (10) Business Days after the
Seller has provided the Buyer written notice of such breach or failure to
perform; provided that the Seller shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(e) if the Seller is, at that time, in
material breach of this Agreement.

Section 9.2 Effect of Termination; Termination Fee

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1,
written notice thereof shall be given to the Buyer or the Seller, as
applicable, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination
is made and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and have no
effect, without any Liability on the part of any Party (other than as set
forth in this Section 9.2); provided, however, that notwithstanding anything
in the foregoing to the contrary, (i) this Section 9.2 and Article XI shall
survive any termination of this Agreement and (ii) no such termination shall
relieve any Party of any Liability to any other Party resulting from any Fraud
or any material breach of this Agreement prior to such termination. The Confidentiality Agreement shall survive and not be
affected by a termination of this Agreement.

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated:

(i) by either the Buyer or the Seller pursuant to Section 9.1(b) as a result
of an Order or Law that arises from, relates to or is in connection with any
Mandatory Regulatory Approval, or

(ii) by either the Buyer or the Seller pursuant to Section 9.1(c) if any
Mandatory Regulatory Approval has not been obtained or otherwise remains
outstanding as of the Outside Date,

then, in any such case, the Buyer shall promptly, but in no event later than
three (3) Business Days after the date of such termination, pay or cause to be
paid to the Seller or its designees $4,000,000 (the "Termination Fee") by wire
transfer of immediately available funds. For the avoidance of doubt, in no
event shall the Buyer be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one
occasion, and in circumstances where the Buyer has paid the Termination Fee
such Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Seller and
its Affiliates against the Buyer and its Affiliates as a result of the related
termination or otherwise relating to this Agreement or the Transactions
(whether framed in tort, contract or otherwise), except that no such payment
shall relieve either Party of any Liability to the other Party resulting from
any Fraud or any intentional breach of this Agreement.

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Seller pursuant to
Section 9.1(e) as a result of any Buyer Party's breach of or failure to
perform any covenant set forth in Section 5.2, the Buyer shall promptly, but
in no event later than three (3) Business Days after the date of such
termination, pay or cause to be paid to the Seller or its designees an amount
equal to $4,000,000 (the "Liquidated Damages") by wire transfer of immediately
available funds as liquidated damages for such breach. For the avoidance of
doubt, in no event shall the Buyer be required to pay the Liquidated Damages
on more than one occasion, and in circumstances where the Buyer has paid the
Liquidated Damages, such Liquidated Damages shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Seller and its Affiliates against the Buyer and its Affiliates
as a result of the related termination or otherwise relating to this Agreement
or the Transactions (whether framed in tort, contract or otherwise).

(d) If the Buyer fails to pay the Termination Fee or the Liquidated Damages
when required to do so under this Section 9.2, and, in order to obtain such
payment, the Seller commences an Action that results in a judgment against the
Buyer for the Termination Fee or the Liquidated Damages, as the case may be,
the Buyer Parties shall pay to the Seller, together with the Termination Fee
or the Liquidated Damages, as the case may be, (i) interest on the Termination
Fee or the Liquidated Damages, as the case may be, from the date of
termination of this Agreement at a rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate and
(ii) the Seller's costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees)
arising from or in connection with such Action.

(e) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 9.2
are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without these agreements,
the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. In particular, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that the Liquidated Damages are not a penalty, but
rather liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the
Seller in the circumstances in which the Liquidated Damages are payable for
the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and otherwise in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions.

Section 10.3 Indemnification Procedure

(a) Notice of Claims. A Buyer Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person
claiming indemnification hereunder (a "Claiming Party") shall give to the
Seller for claims under Section 10.1 or to the Buyer Parties for claims under
Section 10.2 (as applicable, the "Responding Party") prompt written notice
(such notice, the "Claim Notice") of any good faith claim for indemnification
(including as a result of a Third Party Claim, a "Claim"), but in any event
(i) prior to the expiration of any survival period for such Claim as provided
in Section 10.4(a) and (ii) if such Claim relates to the assertion against the
Claiming Party of any claim or dispute by a third party (a "Third Party
Claim"), within thirty (30) days after the assertion in writing by or on
behalf of such third party of such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no delay in providing the Claim Notice in accordance with the terms
hereof (other than the failure to give notice prior to the expiration of the
survival period for such Claim, as specified in Section 10.4(a)) shall affect
a Claiming Party's rights hereunder unless (and then only to the extent that)
the Responding Party is materially prejudiced thereby. The Claim Notice shall
describe the nature of the Claim, the amount thereof if then known and the
provision or provisions of this Agreement on which the Claim is based, and the
Claiming Party shall otherwise make reasonably available to the Responding
Party all relevant information which is material to the Claim and which is in
the possession of the Claiming Party. Unless the Claim described in the Claim
Notice is contested by the Responding Party by written notice to the Claiming
Party of the amount of the Claim that is contested, given within thirty (30)
days of the receipt of the Claim Notice (the "Dispute Notice"), the Claiming
Party may recover such undisputed amount of the Claim described in the Claim
Notice, if any, from the Responding Party, subject to the terms and
limitations of this Article X. The Claiming Party and the Responding Party
shall attempt in good faith for thirty (30) days after receipt of a Dispute
Notice to resolve the objections set forth therein. If no settlement can be
reached between the Claiming Party and the Responding Party with respect to a
Claim after good faith negotiation during the thirty (30)-day period after the
Claiming Party's receipt of the Dispute Notice, the Parties will no longer be
bound by the dispute resolution procedures in this Section 10.3(a) and either
Party may commence an Action to resolve such dispute. The Parties agree that
all discussions, negotiations and other information exchanged between the
Parties during the foregoing dispute resolution proceedings will be without prejudice to the
legal position of a Party in any subsequent Action.

(b) Third Party Claims. If any Claim is a Third-Party Claim, the following
provisions shall apply:

(i) Within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Claim Notice, the Responding
Party will, upon written notice thereof to the Claiming Party, have the right
to assume control of the defense of the Third Party Claim with counsel of the
Responding Party's choice reasonably satisfactory to the Claiming Party,
provided that the Responding Party must conduct the defense of the Third Party
Claim actively and diligently and must keep the Claiming Party reasonably
informed of the status of the Third Party Claim and the Responding Party may
not, except as set forth in Section 10.3(b)(iv), assume the control of the
defense of any Third Party Claim in which equitable relief is sought against
the Claiming Party or any of its Subsidiaries; and provided further that the
Claiming Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and
participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim and the Responding Party
shall consider in good faith the views of the Claiming Party and its counsel.
In conducting the defense of the Third Party Claim, the Responding Party will
not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with
respect to the Third Party Claim (including with respect to the matters set
forth in Schedule 10.3(b)(i)) without the prior written consent of the
Claiming Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned)
unless the judgment or proposed settlement involves only the payment of money
damages by the Responding Party, does not impose an injunction or other
equitable relief upon the Claiming Party, does not include any admission of
wrongdoing on the part of the Claiming Party or its Affiliates and includes
the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to the Claiming Party of a release
from all Liability in respect of such Third Party Claim.

(ii) In the event that the Responding Party does not elect (or is not
permitted by the terms of this Agreement) to assume the defense of any Third
Party Claim, the Claiming Party shall assume and conduct the defense of the
Third Party Claim, provided that the Claiming Party must conduct the defense
of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently and must keep the Responding
Party reasonably informed of the status of the Third Party Claim. In
conducting the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Claiming Party will not
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect
to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Responding
Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

(iii) Subject to the terms and limitations of this Article X, the
indemnifiable fees and expenses of counsel to the Claiming Party incurred in
connection with a Third Party Claim shall be considered Damages for purposes
of this Agreement if (A) the Claiming Party controls the defense of such Third
Party Claim pursuant to the terms of this Section 10.3(b) or (B) the
Responding Party assumes control of such defense and the Claiming Party
reasonably concludes upon advice of legal counsel that the Claiming Party and
the Responding Party have material conflicting interests or material different
defenses available with respect to such Third Party Claim

(iv) With respect to a Third Party Claim within the subject matter of Section
10.1(e) in which equitable relief is sought against the Claiming Party or any
of its Subsidiaries, the Responding Party shall, within thirty (30) days after
delivery of the Claim Notice, notify the Responding Party whether it intends
to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim. If the Responding Party
notifies the Claiming Party that it intends to assume the defense of such
Third Party Claim, the Claiming Party shall, within ten (10) days of the receipt of
such notice from the Responding Party, notify the Responding Party regarding
whether the Claiming Party consents to the Responding Party's assumption of
the defense of such Third Party Claim, and a failure of the Claiming Party to
respond within such period shall be deemed consent. Any such notice shall
reference and include the language in this Section 10.3(b)(iv). If the
Claiming Party consents to the Responding Party's assumption of the defense of
such Third Party Claim, the Responding Party shall assume the defense of such
Third Party Claim subject to the rights and obligations set forth in this
Agreement. If the Claiming Party does not consent to the Responding Party's
assumption of the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Responding Party
shall be relieved of all Liability with respect to such Third Party Claim
under this Article X and otherwise. If following the Responding Party's
assumption of the defense of such Claim the Claiming Party desires to assume
the defense of such Claim in a circumstance other than as permitted under this
Section 10.3, the Claiming Party shall have the right to do so, provided it
notifies the Responding Party in writing of such election. If the Claiming
Party assumes the defense of such Third Party Claim as described in the
preceding sentence, the Responding Party shall be relieved of all Liability
with respect to such Third Party Claim under this Article X and otherwise and
shall be entitled to share in any recovery or settlement pursuant to Schedule
10.1(e) as if the Responding Party had not ceased to control such defense.

(c) Cooperation. The Buyer Parties and the Seller as the Responding Party or
the Claiming Party, as applicable, shall reasonably cooperate with each other
in the defense of any Third Party Claim hereunder and shall make available to
the Party defending such Third Party Claim such materials and assistance
relating thereto as is reasonably requested by such Party.

Section 10.4 Survival

(a) General.

(i) The representations and warranties of the Seller set forth in (A) Section
3.1(a)-(e) (Organization, Standing and Power; Matters Relating to the Acquired
Entities), Section 3.2 (Authority), Section 3.8(a) (Title to Property), and
Section 3.16 (Brokers' and Finders' Fees) (collectively, the "Seller
Fundamental Representations") shall survive the Closing for a period of
[****], at which time they shall expire; (B) Section 3.9 (Intellectual
Property) shall survive the Closing for a period of [****], at which time they
shall expire; and (C) Section 3.11 (Taxes) shall survive [****].

(ii) The representations and warranties of the Buyer Parties set forth in
Section 4.1 (Organization, Standing and Power), Section 4.2 (Authority),
Section 4.7 (Brokers' and Finders' Fees) and Section 4.11 (Purchase Price Note
and Earnout Note) (collectively, the "Buyer Fundamental Representations")
shall survive the Closing for a period of [****], at which time they shall
expire.

(iii) All representations and warranties not otherwise set forth in Section
10.4(a)(i) or Section 10.4(a)(ii) (such representations and warranties,
together with the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.9
(Intellectual Property) and Section 3.11 (Taxes), collectively, the "Non-
Fundamental Representations") made by either Party contained in this
Agreement, the certificates delivered pursuant to Section 8.2(d) or Section
8.3(d), the Bills of Sale or the Intellectual Property Assignment and License
Agreement shall survive the Closing for a period of [****], at which time they
shall expire. (iv) The covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement shall continue
and survive the Closing until all obligations with respect thereto shall have
been performed or satisfied or have been terminated in accordance with their
terms (or if no period for performance is specified therein, such covenants
and agreements shall survive indefinitely). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
Claim for indemnification under Section 10.1(b) or Section 10.2(b) based upon
any breach of a covenant or agreement in this Agreement to be performed or
complied with before or at the Closing may be made or asserted by any Person,
and no obligation to indemnify in respect thereof shall exist, unless written
notice thereof is provided in accordance with the terms hereof within [****]
of the Closing Date.

(v) A claim based on Fraud may be brought at any time.

(b) Survival of Claims until Final Determination. No Claim for indemnification
in respect of Damages arising in connection with this Agreement may be made or
asserted by any Person, and no obligation to indemnify in respect thereof
shall exist, unless written notice of such Claim shall have been given as
provided in this Article X on or prior to the last day of the survival period
specified in Section 10.4(a) relating to the provision(s) of this Agreement on
which such Claim is based. For each Claim for indemnification hereunder
regarding a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that is properly
made in writing in accordance with the terms hereof before the expiration of
such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, the representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement that is the basis for such Claim shall survive
until, but only for the purpose of, the final determination and satisfaction
of such Claim.

(c) Effect on Statute of Limitations. It is the express intent of the Parties
that, if the applicable survival period for an item as contemplated by this
Article X is shorter than the statute of limitations that would otherwise have
been applicable to such item, then, by contract, the applicable statute of
limitations with respect to such item shall be deemed to have been reduced to
the shortened survival period contemplated hereby. The Parties further
acknowledge and agree that the time periods set forth in this Article X for
the assertion of Claims under this Agreement are the result of arms' length
negotiation between the Parties and that they intend for the time periods to
be enforced as agreed by the Parties.

Section 10.5 Limitations

(a) Threshold on Indemnification.

(i) The Buyer Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to indemnification

(A) unless and until the aggregate amount of all indemnifiable Damages
suffered or incurred by all Buyer Indemnified Persons under Section 10.1(a)
with respect to Seller Non-Fundamental Representations exceeds the Threshold

Indemnified Persons for all such Damages, including the Threshold) and (B) for
any Claim, unless and until such Buyer Indemnified Persons have suffered or
incurred aggregate indemnifiable Damages arising out of such Claim or series
of related Claims under Section 10.1(a) with respect to Seller Non-Fundamental

forth in this Section 10.5(a)(i) shall not apply with respect to the Seller
Fundamental Representations or with respect to Fraud. (ii) The Seller Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to indemnification

Indemnified Persons for [****]) and (B) for any Claim, unless and until such
Seller Indemnified Persons have suffered or incurred aggregate indemnifiable
Damages arising out of such Claim or series of related Claims under Section
10.2(a) with respect to Buyer Non-Fundamental Representations in excess of the
Eligible Claims Threshold (provided that any such Claim or series of related
Claims not exceeding such amount shall not count towards the Threshold and

by the amount of such Specified Environmental Liabilities up to the
Environmental Excess Amount. All Specified Environmental Liabilities shall,
for the purposes of the limitations in this Section 10.5(b)(i)(B), apply
towards determining the Seller's total Liability under Section 10.1(f),
regardless of whether such Liabilities are incurred before or after the
Closing, incurred by the Seller or the Buyer (or any of their respective
Affiliates) or subject to any indemnification claim by any Buyer Indemnified
Person.

(C) The limitations set forth in Sections 10.5(b)(1)(A) and 10.5(b)(1)(B)
shall not apply to the Seller Fundamental Representations.

(D) The Seller's total Liability under (1) Section 10.1(e) and (2) Section
12(a)(i) of the Supply Agreement shall not exceed (in the aggregate) the
Special Indemnification Matters Cap.

(E) The Seller's maximum aggregate Liability pursuant to (a) Section 10.1, (b)
Section 12(a)(i) of the Supply Agreement and (c) Section 12(a)(ii) of the
Supply Agreement shall not exceed (in the aggregate) the Aggregate Cap. All
Liabilities within the subject matter of Section 10.1(f) shall, for the
purposes of the limitations in this Section 10.5(b)(1)(E), apply towards the
Seller's total Liability under Section 10.1, regardless of whether such Liabilities are incurred before or after the
Closing, incurred by the Seller or the Buyer (or any of their respective
Affiliates) or subject to any indemnification claim by any Buyer Indemnified
Person.

(F) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth in this Section
10.5(b)(i) shall not apply with respect to Fraud.

(ii) Buyer's Liabilities

(A) The Buyer Parties' total Liability under Section 10.2(a) (with respect to
the Buyer Non-Fundamental Representations) shall not exceed (in the aggregate)
the General Representations Cap (without giving effect to any adjustment in
Section 10.5(b)(i)(B)); provided, that the foregoing limitation shall not
apply with respect to the Buyer Fundamental Representations.

(B) The Buyer Parties' maximum aggregate Liability pursuant to Section 10.2
shall not exceed the Aggregate Cap.

(C) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth in this Section
10.5(b)(ii) shall not apply with respect to Fraud.

(c) Damages Net of Insurance and other Third Party Recovery; Effect on
Insurance and other Third Party Recovery. The indemnities provided for in this
Article X are not intended and shall not be deemed to limit, condition, reduce
or supplant the primary availability of any insurance or third-party coverage
or indemnification that would be available to the Claiming Party in the
absence of such indemnities. For all purposes of this Article X, "Damages"
shall be calculated net of the amount of any insurance or third-party
indemnification or other reimbursement or coverage actually received by the
applicable Claiming Party (or any Affiliate thereof) from insurance policies
or third parties in connection with such Damages, net of all applicable
deductibles, limitations, co-payments, retro premium obligations and premium
increases attributable thereto, and all reasonable fees, costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the collection of any such proceeds. The
applicable Claiming Party will (and will cause any Affiliate thereof to) use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such insurance proceeds or third
party-indemnification or other coverage; provided that the Claiming Party
shall not be obligated to commence any Action with respect thereto. If a
Claiming Party (or any Affiliate thereof) receives an amount under insurance
or third-party indemnification or other reimbursement or coverage with respect
to Damages at any time subsequent to any indemnification provided by a
Responding Party, then such Claiming Party shall promptly reimburse the
Responding Party for any such payment made up to such amount received by the
Claiming Party (and any Affiliate thereof) (net of applicable deductibles,
limitations, co-payments, retro premium obligations and premium increases
attributable thereto, and all reasonable fees, costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the collection of any such proceeds).

(d) Working Capital Matters; Mitigation. No Buyer Indemnified Person shall be
entitled to indemnification for any Damages to the extent that a specific
amount relating to the matter giving rise to such Damages was taken into
account as a Liability for purposes of calculating the Adjustment Amount;
provided, however, that this Section 10.5(d) shall not limit the amount to
which any Buyer Indemnified Person would otherwise be entitled to
indemnification for any Damages in excess of such amount taken into account
for purposes of calculating the Adjustment Amount. Any Damages under this
Agreement shall be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the
state of facts giving rise to such Damages constituting a breach of more than
one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. The Buyer's indemnification obligations under Section 10.2 and the Seller's
indemnification obligations under Section 10.1 shall not limit the Buyer
Indemnified Parties' rights to indemnification under Section 10.1 or the
Seller Indemnified Persons' rights to indemnification under Section 10.2,
respectively, regardless of whether such obligations to indemnify and rights
to indemnification arise out of the same facts and circumstances. By way of
example only and not of limitation, if a Seller Indemnified Person suffers
Damages from an Assumed Liability and the facts giving rise to such Assumed
Liability also give rise to a breach of this Agreement for which a Buyer
Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 10.1,
the right of such Buyer Indemnified Person to receive indemnification from the
Seller under Section 10.1 shall apply notwithstanding that the Buyer remains
obligated to indemnify the Seller for Damages from such Assumed Liability
under Section 10.2. Schedule 10.5(d) sets forth illustrative examples of the
Parties' intention with respect to situations in which the same fact pattern
creates overlapping indemnification obligations. A Claiming Party shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate
any Damage upon becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected
to, or does, give rise to such Damages.

(e) Set Off; Payments by the Seller. Neither the Buyer Parties nor the Seller
shall have any right to set off any amounts owed to a Buyer Indemnified Person
or a Seller Indemnified Person, respectively, under this Article X against any
payments to be made by either of them or their respective Affiliates under any
other provisions of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, except
that, if the Seller is determined to be required to indemnify a Buyer
Indemnified Person under this Article X, if the Seller has a payment
obligation to the Buyer under Section 2.9(d)(i), or if the Seller or an
Affiliate of the Seller is otherwise determined to be liable to a Buyer
Indemnified Person under any Transaction Document, the Buyer Indemnified
Persons, prior to receiving from the Seller or any Affiliate of the Seller any
cash payment for Claims under this Article X, any cash payment under Section
2.9(d)(i) or any other cash payment under any Transaction Document, shall
first set off any such amounts owed to a Buyer Indemnified Person against any
unpaid amount of the Purchase Price Note or, if there are no amounts available
for setoff under the Purchase Price Note, the Earnout Note (when and if issued
in accordance with Section 2.11(a)) as provided herein and therein, with such
amount being first set off against any unpaid interest and then against any
unpaid principal on such note.

(f) Specific Indemnity Matters. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the Buyer Indemnified Persons' sole and exclusive remedy in
connection with Damages within the subject matter of Schedule 10.1(e) shall be
pursuant to Section 10.1(e).

Section 10.6 Exclusive Remedies

Except as expressly set forth in Sections 2.6(b), 6.4 and Article IX, the
Parties each acknowledge and agree (on behalf of themselves and their
respective Affiliates) that from and after the Closing the indemnification
provisions set forth in this Article X shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
of the Buyer Indemnified Persons and the Seller Indemnified Persons with
respect to any and all claims or disputes, whether in contract, tort, law,
equity or otherwise, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement
(including the certificates delivered pursuant to Section 8.2(d) and Section
8.3(d)), the Bills of Sale or the Intellectual Property Assignment and License
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, and
without limiting the Buyer Indemnified Persons' and the Seller Indemnified
Persons' rights to indemnification under Section 10.1 and Section 10.2,
respectively, nothing contained in this Section 10.6 shall limit (a) any
rights or remedies arising out of or related to any Transaction Document other
than those expressly set forth in the first sentence of this Section 10.6, (b)
any rights or remedies (including rights to indemnification) set forth in any
Transaction Document or (c) any equitable remedies, including those described in Section 11.8. In no event shall the Buyer, its
successors or its permitted assigns be entitled to claim or seek rescission of
the Transactions.



Section 10.7 Characterization of Indemnity Payments

Any indemnification payments made pursuant to this Agreement shall be
considered, to the extent permissible under Law, as adjustments to the Cash
Purchase Price for all Tax purposes.



Section 10.8 Materiality; Investigation

(a) For purposes of determining the amount of any Damages arising out of,
relating to or resulting from any breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty made in this Agreement, but not for purposes of
determining whether or not such breach or inaccuracy has occurred, such
representations and warranties shall be considered without giving effect to
any limitation or qualification as to "material", "materially", "in all
material respects", "Seller Material Adverse Effect". "Buyer Material Adverse
Effect" or any other derivation of the word "material", in any case, other
than with respect to the use of the word "material" in the term "Material
Contract" itself.

(b) The right of any Buyer Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person to
indemnification will not be affected by any investigation conducted with
respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any
time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance
with, any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement.

Section 11.2 Counterparts

This Agreement, and any amendments hereto, may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original,
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Signatures delivered by facsimile transmission or other electronic means
(e.g., PDF) shall be binding for all purposes hereof.

Section 11.3 Entire Agreement; Nonassignability; Parties in Interest

This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents (together with all schedules and exhibits thereto as the same may be
amended, modified, supplemented or restated from time to time in accordance
with their terms) constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior and
contemporaneous agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the
Parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof. Except as set forth in the last sentence of this Section 11.3, no
Party may assign its rights or delegate its obligations under this Agreement, by
operation of Law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other
Parties, and any attempted assignment in violation of this Section 11.3 shall
be null and void. This Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder
shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors, heirs, legal representatives and permitted assigns.
Except as set forth in Article X and Section 11.10, nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any
right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement. It is the current intention of the Buyer Parties that the assets,
liabilities and employees of the Business that are located in the U.S. will be
acquired, assumed and hired by Buyer or another U.S.-based Buyer Group Member,
and that the assets, liabilities and employees of the Business that are
located outside of the U.S. will be acquired, assumed and hired by Buyer
Parent or another non U.S.-based Buyer Group Member. Notwithstanding the
limitations on assignment contemplated by this Section 11.3, the Parties will
cooperate in good faith at the Buyer's sole cost and expense to facilitate
such structuring approach by the Buyer Parties, and, subject to Section 11.14,
the Buyer Parties are expressly permitted to assign their rights and
obligations under this Agreement to any Buyer Group Member for the foregoing
purposes and no such assignment shall require the consent of the Seller.

Section 11.4 Severability

In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof,
becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal,
void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full
force and effect and the application of such provision to other Persons or
circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the
Parties. The Parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable
provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such void or unenforceable provision.

Section 11.5 Amendment; Waiver

No amendment, modification, waiver, termination or discharge of any provision
of this Agreement, or any consent to any departure by the Parties from any
provision hereof, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in
writing and signed by each of the Parties (or by the Party providing the
waiver, in the case of a waiver), and each such amendment, modification,
waiver, termination or discharge shall be effective only in the specific
instance and for the specific purpose for which given. No delay on the part of
either Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of either Party
of any right, power or privilege hereunder operate as a waiver of any other
right, power or privilege hereunder, nor shall any single or partial exercise
of any right, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege
hereunder. Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement (including in Section
10.6), the rights and remedies provided for in this Agreement are cumulative
and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that the Parties may otherwise
have at law or in equity.

Section 11.6 Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction

This Agreement shall be interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of Delaware. Any and all claims, controversies, and causes of
action arising out of or relating to this Agreement, whether sounding in
contract, tort, or statute, shall be governed by the laws of the State of
Delaware, including its statutes of limitations, without giving effect to any
conflict-of-laws rule that would result in the application of the laws of a different jurisdiction. Each
of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and
its assets and properties, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware (or if such court shall not have
jurisdiction, any state or federal court sitting in Delaware), and each of the
Parties consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate
appellate courts) in any such Action and waives any objection to venue laid
therein. Process in any Action referred to in the preceding sentence may be
served on any Party anywhere in the world using any of the means described in
Section 11.1, which the Parties agree shall constitute effective service of
process. The Parties expressly disclaim the application of the United Nations
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.

Section 11.7 Expenses

Except as otherwise expressly provided for in this Agreement, whether or not
the Transactions are completed, all costs and expenses arising out of,
relating to or incidental to the discussion, evaluation, negotiation and
documentation of this Agreement and the Transactions (including reasonable
fees and expenses of legal counsel and financial advisors and accountants, if
any) (in the aggregate, "Transaction Expenses") shall be paid by the Party
incurring such costs and expenses.

Section 11.8 Equitable Remedies

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that any breach of this
Agreement would not be adequately compensated by monetary Damages. Except as
otherwise set forth in this Section 11.8, including the limitations set forth
herein, the Parties acknowledge and agree that, prior to the valid termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1, the Buyer Parties, on the one hand,
and the Seller, on the other hand, shall, in the event of any breach or
threatened breach by the Seller, on the one hand, or any Buyer Party, on the
other hand, of any of their respective covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement, be entitled to obtain equitable relief, including an
injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement by the other Party, and to specifically enforce the
terms and provisions of this Agreement, or to enforce compliance with the
covenants and agreements of the other Party under this Agreement. The Parties
have specifically bargained for the right to specific performance of the
obligations hereunder, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Section 11.8.

(b) Each Party hereby agrees not to raise any objections to the availability
of the equitable remedy of specific performance when available pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement to prevent or restrain breaches of this Agreement by
such Party (other than challenging the existence of a breach or threatened
breach), and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, or to enforce compliance with the covenants and agreements of such
Party under this Agreement. A Party seeking an injunction or other Order or to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with such injunction or other Order. Each Party
further agrees that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in this Section
11.8, a Party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form
of relief that may be available to such Party under this Agreement, and (ii)
nothing set forth in this Section 11.8 shall require any Party to institute
any Action for (or limit any Party's right to institute any Action for)
specific performance under this Section 11.8 prior to, or as a condition to,
exercising any termination right under Article IX, nor shall the commencement
of any Action pursuant to this Section 11.8 or anything set forth in this
Section 11.8 restrict or limit any Party's right to terminate this Agreement
in accordance with the terms of Article IX or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may
be available then or thereafter.

Section 11.9 Attorneys' Fees

Should any Party institute any Action to enforce any provision of this
Agreement or for Damages by reason of alleged breach of any provision of this
Agreement, the prevailing Party shall be entitled to receive from the non-
prevailing Party such reasonable out of pocket expenses (including attorneys'
fees and expenses) incurred by the prevailing party in connection with any
such Action.

Section 11.10 Waiver of Conflicts; Privilege

(a) Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that Smith, Anderson, Blount,
Dorsett, Mitchell and Jernigan, L.L.P. ("Smith Anderson") has acted as counsel
to the Seller and its Affiliates (including, prior to the Closing, the
Acquired Subsidiary) in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement, the
other Transaction Documents and the Transactions. The Buyer hereby consents
and agrees to, and agrees to cause the Acquired Subsidiary to consent and
agree to, Smith Anderson representing the Seller and any of its Affiliates
(collectively, the "Seller Parties") or any director, shareholder, officer or
employee of the Seller Parties after the Closing, including with respect to
disputes in which the interests of the Seller Parties may be directly adverse
to the Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Subsidiary). In
connection with the foregoing, the Buyer hereby irrevocably waives and agrees
not to assert, and agrees to cause the Acquired Subsidiary to irrevocably
waive and not to assert, any conflict of interest arising from or in
connection with (i) Smith Anderson's prior representation of the Acquired
Subsidiary or the Business and (ii) Smith Anderson's representation of the
Seller Parties prior to and after the Closing. The Buyer represents that the
Buyer's legal counsel has explained and helped the Buyer evaluate the
implications and risks of waiving the right to assert a future conflict
against Smith Anderson and the Buyer's consent with respect to this waiver is
fully informed.

(b) The Buyer further agrees, on behalf of itself and, after the Closing, on
behalf of the Acquired Subsidiary, that all pre-Closing communications subject
to any attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product protection or other
similar protection for the benefit of the Seller Parties, in any form or
format whatsoever between or among Smith Anderson, on one hand, and the
Acquired Subsidiary, the Business, or any of their respective directors,
officers, employees or other representatives, on the other hand, to the extent
related in any way to the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the
Transactions or any dispute arising under this Agreement (collectively, the
"Privileged Deal Communications") shall be deemed to be retained and owned
collectively by the Seller Parties, shall be controlled by the Seller on
behalf of the Seller Parties and shall not pass to or be claimed by the Buyer
or the Acquired Subsidiary. For the avoidance of doubt, any attorney-client
privilege, attorney work-product protection or other similar protection in any
form or format whatsoever between or among Smith Anderson, on the one hand,
and the Acquired Subsidiary, the Business or any of their respective
directors, officers, employees or other representatives, on the other hand, to
the extent not related to the negotiation, documentation and consummation of
the Transactions shall belong to the Acquired Subsidiary and the Buyer,
respectively, and shall be controlled, and may be waived, only by the Acquired
Subsidiary or the Buyer, as applicable, and shall not be controlled, waived,
claimed or used by any Seller Entity following the Closing.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a dispute arises between the Buyer or
the Acquired Subsidiary, on the one hand, and a third party other than a
Seller Party on the other hand, the Buyer or the Acquired Subsidiary may
assert the attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product protection or
other similar protection for the benefit of the Seller Parties, the Buyer or
the Acquired Subsidiary to prevent the disclosure of the Privileged Deal Communications to such third party;
provided, however, that neither the Buyer nor the Acquired Subsidiary may
waive such privilege without the prior written consent of the Seller. If the
Buyer or the Acquired Subsidiary is legally required by Order of any
Governmental Entity or otherwise to access or obtain a copy of all or a
portion of the Privileged Deal Communications following the Closing, the Buyer
shall as soon as reasonably practicable notify the Seller in writing
(including by making specific reference to this Section 11.10) so that the
Seller can seek a protective order, and the Buyer agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts, at the Seller Parties' expense, to assist therewith.

(d) To the extent that files or other materials maintained by Smith Anderson
that contain Privileged Deal Communications constitute property of its
clients, only the Seller Parties shall hold such property rights and Smith
Anderson shall have no duty to reveal or disclose any Privileged Deal
Communications contained in such files or other materials or any other
Privileged Deal Communications by reason of any attorney-client relationship
between Smith Anderson, on the one hand, and the Acquired Subsidiary, on the
other hand.

(e) The Buyer agrees that it will not, and that it will cause the Acquired
Subsidiary not to, use any Privileged Deal Communications against the Seller
Parties in connection with any dispute between the Seller, on the one hand,
and the Buyer and the Acquired Subsidiary, on the other hand, with respect to
this Agreement or the Transactions.

(f) This Section 11.10 is intended for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, the Seller and Smith Anderson. This Section 11.10 shall be
irrevocable, and no term of this Section 11.10 may be amended, waived or
modified without the prior written consent of the Seller and Smith Anderson.
This Section 11.10 shall not limit in any manner Section 2.3(d).

Section 11.11 Currency

Whenever any payment hereunder is to be paid in "cash," payment shall be made
in the legal tender of the United States and the method for payment shall be
by wire transfer of immediately available funds. In the event there is any
need to convert U.S. dollars into any foreign currency, or vice versa, for any
purpose under this Agreement the exchange rate shall be that published by the
Wall Street Journal on the date an obligation is paid (or if the Wall Street
Journal is not published on such date, the first date thereafter on which the
Wall Street Journal is published).

Section 11.12 Seller Disclosure Schedule and Buyer Disclosure Schedule

The Parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the disclosure by the Seller or the
Buyer Parties of any matter in the Seller Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer
Disclosure Schedule, respectively, shall not be deemed to constitute an
indication, admission or acknowledgement by the Seller or the Buyer Parties,
respectively, that the matter is required to be disclosed by the terms of this
Agreement or that the matter is material or significant (nor shall it
establish a standard of care or materiality for any purpose whatsoever), and
matters that are included in the Seller Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer
Disclosure Schedule that are not required by this Agreement to be so included
are for informational purposes only and do not necessarily include other
matters of a similar nature; (b) if any section of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule lists an item or information in such
a way as to make its relevance to the disclosure required by or provided in
another section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure
Schedule, respectively, or the statements contained in any Section of this
Agreement reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure, the matter shall
be deemed to have been disclosed in or with respect to such other section,
notwithstanding the omission of an appropriate cross-reference to such other section or the omission of a reference in the particular
representation and warranty to such section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, respectively; (c) except as provided in the
preceding clause (b), headings have been inserted in the Seller Disclosure
Schedule and the Buyer Disclosure Schedule for convenience of reference only;
(d) neither the Seller Disclosure Schedule nor the Buyer Disclosure Schedule
nor the information and statements contained therein are intended to
constitute, and shall not be construed as constituting, representations or
warranties of any Party or creating any covenant and shall not expand or
enlarge any of the representations or warranties set forth in Article III or
Article IV, as applicable; (e) any additional matters set forth for
informational purposes do not necessarily include other matters of a similar
nature; and (f) all references to representations and warranties contained in
this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents shall be deemed to be
references to such representations and warranties as qualified and limited by
the Seller Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, as
applicable.



Section 11.13 Local Agreements

(a) The Parties do not intend this Agreement to transfer title to any
Transferred Interests or Acquired Assets or to cause the assumption of any
Assumed Liabilities in any jurisdiction in which such transfer or assumption
is required to be made pursuant to a Local Agreement, and any such Transferred
Interests, Acquired Assets and Assumed Liabilities, as applicable, shall only
be transferred by the applicable Local Agreement. The Local Agreements shall
not provide for any additional rights or obligations of the Seller Entities,
on the one hand, or the Buyer, on the other hand, not provided for in this
Agreement. The Seller and the Buyer shall reasonably cooperate in the
preparation of such Local Agreements, which shall be prepared in a manner
consistent in all respects with the terms of this Agreement with only such
changes as necessary to comply with Law of such foreign jurisdictions.

(b) To the extent that the provisions of a Local Agreement are inconsistent
with or (except to the extent they implement a transfer in accordance with
this Agreement) additional to the provisions of this Agreement:

(i) the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail; and

(ii) so far as permissible under Law of the relevant jurisdiction, the Seller
and the Buyer shall cause the provisions of the relevant Local Agreement to be
adjusted, to the extent necessary to give effect to the provisions of this
Agreement.

(c) Each Party shall not, and shall cause its respective Affiliates not to,
bring any claim (including for breach of any warranty, representation,
undertaking, covenant or indemnity relating to the Transactions) against the
other Parties or any of their respective Affiliates in respect of or based
upon any of the Local Agreements, except to the extent necessary to enforce
any transfer of Transferred Subsidiary Interests or the Acquired Assets or
assumption of the Assumed Liabilities in a manner consistent with the terms of
this Agreement. All such claims (except as referred to above) shall be brought
and be subject to the provisions, rights and limitations set out in this
Agreement, and no Party shall be entitled to recover Damages or obtain
payment, reimbursement, restitution or indemnity under or pursuant to any of
the Local Agreements (but without prejudice to the establishment of the
existence of the claim hereunder).

Section 11.14 Buyer Parent Guarantee

The Buyer Parent hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees
(the "Buyer Parent Guarantee") the prompt and full payment and performance of
any and all obligations (including payment obligations and other covenants) of each Buyer Group Member under this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents (the "Buyer Group Obligations").
The Buyer Parent Guarantee shall not be released, discharged or otherwise
affected by (a) any acceleration, extension, modification or renewal in
respect of any Buyer Group Obligations by operation of Law or otherwise, (b)
any amendment, waiver or modification of this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document or (c) any other provisions of Law applicable to
guarantees. The Buyer Parent Guarantee is a guarantee of payment and
performance and not of collection, and the Seller and its Affiliates shall not
be obligated to enforce or exhaust their respective remedies against the Buyer
Group Members before proceeding to enforce the Buyer Parent Guarantee. The
Buyer Parent hereby irrevocably waives any and all rights and defenses under,
and each other provision of, any Law that restricts or in any way limits the
rights of any obligee against a guarantor or surety following a default or
failure of payment or performance by an obligor with respect to whose
obligations the guarantee or surety is provided. The Buyer Parent Guarantee
shall survive the Closing and remain in effect for so long as any Buyer Group
Member has obligations under any Transaction Document. The Buyer Parent agrees
that so long as the Buyer Group Obligations remain outstanding, the Buyer
Parent will operate in the Ordinary Course of Business and not dispose of (by
dividend, distribution, sale, transfer, or otherwise) all or substantially all
of its assets other than to Affiliates that shall also agree in writing to
become a guarantor of the Buyer Group Obligations under the terms and
