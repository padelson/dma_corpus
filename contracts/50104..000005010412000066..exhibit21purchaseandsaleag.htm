or state court with proper jurisdiction prior to the date that is twenty-four
(24) months after the Closing Date or (ii) arise out of or relate to any
potential claim by a Governmental Authority identified in any order, notice or
request issued by, or any investigation initiated by any Governmental
Authority pursuant to applicable Law (other than Environmental Law) prior to
the date that is twenty-four (24) months after the Closing Date.

4.1.15 For the avoidance of doubt, any Third Party Environmental Claims that
are covered under both Sections 4.1.2 and 4.1.14 shall be deemed to be
exclusively covered under Section 4.1.2.

ARTICLE 5

DEPOSIT; PURCHASE PRICE

Section 5.1 Deposit.

5.1.1 On the Execution Date, the Buyer shall deposit by wire transfer to the
account designated in Schedule 5.1.1 in same day immediately available funds
into escrow with the Sellers (or their designee) an amount equal to ninety
million dollars ($90,000,000) (the "Deposit"). This Agreement will not become
a legally binding and enforceable obligation of Sellers unless and until the
Deposit is received by the Sellers. If Closing occurs, the Deposit shall be
credited against the Purchase Price as set forth in Section 5.4 without any
interest earned thereon. Upon termination of this Agreement, the Deposit will
be applied as set forth in Section 5.1.3.

5.1.2 Beginning on the date that Sellers notify the Buyer that the Sellers
have informed the Federal Antitrust Agency that Sellers have completed their
response to the "second request", and again every day thereafter until Closing
occurs or until this Agreement terminates, except as provided below in this
Section, the Buyer shall be obligated to pay to the Sellers an amount equal to
three hundred thirty thousand dollars ($330,000) per day during such period
(the "Daily Ticking Fee"). On the last day of each month prior to the Closing
or termination of this Agreement, and again on the termination date, the Buyer
shall deposit by wire transfer in same day immediately available funds into
escrow with the Sellers (or their designee) an amount equal to the sum of all
Daily Ticking Fee accrued during the period between such date and the date of
the immediately preceding deposit of the Daily Ticking Fee; provided, however,
that the amount of Buyer's liability hereunder with respect to the Daily
Ticking Fee shall not exceed fifty million dollars ($50,000,000). The total
amount of the accumulated Daily Ticking Fee owed hereunder by the Buyer shall
be the "Additional Deposit". If the Closing occurs, the Additional Deposit
shall be treated as an increase to the Deposit and the Deposit (including the
Additional Deposit) shall be credited against the Purchase Price as set forth
in Section 5.4 without any interest earned thereon. Upon the termination of
this Agreement the Additional Deposit will be applied as set forth in Section
5.1.3.

5.1.3 The Sellers shall retain the sum of the Deposit and the Additional
Deposit as liquidated damages if (i) all material conditions precedent to the
obligations of the Buyer set forth in Article 9 (excluding those in Section
9.1.5) have been met (other than delivery of documents by the Parties to be
made at Closing) and the Sellers have terminated this Agreement pursuant to
Section 18.1.2 or Section 18.1.6 (in which case the Sellers shall have a claim
against Buyer for the amount identified above), (ii) if the Buyer has
terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 18.1.4, or (iii) if the Buyer or
the Sellers have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 18.1.8. If this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 18.1.1, Section 18.1.3, Section
18.1.5 or Section 18.1.7, then Sellers shall return the Deposit and the
Additional Deposit without interest to the Buyer; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers shall retain the sum of the Deposit and
the Additional Deposit as liquidated damages in the event that this Agreement
is (or can also be) terminated pursuant to either Section 18.1.2 or 18.1.8;
provided, further, in the event this Agreement terminates, if the Federal
Antitrust Agency notifies Sellers that Sellers are not in substantial
compliance and Sellers have not exercised Reasonable Efforts to achieve
substantial compliance as soon as practicable, then Sellers shall return the
Deposit and the Additional Deposit without interest to the Buyer.

Section 5.2 Purchase Price. The purchase price for the Purchased Assets shall
be one billion one hundred seventy-five million dollars ($1,175,000,000) as
adjusted by Section 5.1.2 (the "Purchase Price") and shall be adjusted further
as provided in Section 5.4 and Article 11.

Section 5.3 Estimated Closing Statement. At least five (5) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, the Sellers shall prepare and deliver to the Buyer a
statement (the "Estimated Closing Statement") that shall set forth: (i) the
Estimated Hydrocarbon Inventory Value, (ii) the Estimated Non-Hydrocarbon
Inventory Value, (iii) the Estimated Accounts Amount, (iv) the Estimated
Watson Cogen Company Distribution, and (v) the Included Fuel Retail Sites in
Escrow Amount.

Section 5.4 Closing Payment. The payment (the "Closing Payment") payable by
the Buyer to the Sellers at the Closing shall be the Purchase Price as such
amount is:

5.4.1 reduced by the Deposit;

5.4.2 increased by the Estimated Hydrocarbon Inventory Value;

5.4.3 increased by the Estimated Non-Hydrocarbon Inventory Value;

5.4.4 increased by the Estimated Accounts Amount;

5.4.5 increased by the Estimated Watson Cogen Company Distribution;

5.4.6 reduced by the Pre-Closing Statement BFO Reduction Amount;

5.4.7 increased by the Included Fuel Retail Sites in Escrow Amount; and

5.4.8 (i) reduced by one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) if, as of
Closing, (A) the conditions set forth in Sections 9.1.5 and 9.2.5 have been
satisfied and (B) no litigation or other administrative or judicial action or
proceeding that seeks to prevent the Closing of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement as a violation of any antitrust Law (other than solely a
violation of Section 7A of the HSR Act) has been commenced by any Governmental
Authority; or (ii) reduced by fifty million dollars ($50,000,000) if (A) the
Buyer is required to sell a refinery after any Governmental Authority has
commenced litigation challenging the transactions contemplated hereby as a
violation of the antitrust Laws in order to resolve any such litigation and
allow the Closing to proceed or (B) after Closing, the Buyer is required to
sell a refinery in order to resolve any litigation with any Governmental
Authority challenging the transactions contemplated hereby as a violation of
the antitrust Laws which arose directly as a result of Buyer's purchase of the
Purchased Assets and the Business hereunder.

ARTICLE 6

BFO FUEL RETAIL SITES

Section 6.1 Offers to Operator Franchisees to Purchase BFO Fuel Retail Sites.
Each of the operators of the retail fuel service stations on BFO Fuel Retail
Sites constitutes a "franchisee" as that term is defined in Section 20999 of the California Business and
Professions Code (each an "Operator Franchisee"). Within thirty-six (36) days
after the Execution Date, BPWCP shall provide each Operator Franchisee with a
bona fide offer to purchase the applicable real estate, improvements and
equipment of the BFO Fuel Retail Site (the "BFO"), pursuant to the terms set
forth in a real estate sales agreement ("RESA"). The offer price for each BFO
shall be established by BPWCP after considering an appraisal performed by a
qualified appraiser. BPWCP shall, within five (5) days after delivering a BFO
to an Operator Franchisee, notify the Buyer in writing of the date of such BFO
and the offer price set forth therein. For a period of forty-five (45) days
after BPWCP delivers a RESA to an Operator Franchisee, such Operator
Franchisee shall have the right to accept the BFO by delivering to BPWCP a
fully executed original of the RESA and the applicable deposit. BPWCP reserves
the right, at any time and in any manner as determined in BPWCP's sole
discretion, to extend any of the time limits set forth in this Article 6 or in
any RESA sent to any Operator Franchisee and/or to modify the terms of, or to
accept negotiated changes in, such RESA. BPWCP represents that each RESA
offered to an Operator Franchisee (i) will condition BPWCP's obligation to
sell the BFO Fuel Retail Site to the Operator Franchisee on the Closing of
this Agreement with respect to the Fuel Retail Assets, but (ii) will allow
BPWCP to waive such condition in its sole discretion and close escrow on the
sale of any BFO Fuel Retail Site to the Operator Franchisee prior to the
Closing of this Agreement with respect to the Fuel Retail Assets. Accordingly,
Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, with respect to any BFO Accepted Site,
BPWCP may, in its sole discretion, waive such condition and close escrow for
the sale of the BFO Accepted Site to the Operator Franchisee before the
Closing of this Agreement with respect to the Fuel Retail Assets (each a "Pre-
Closing BFO Accepted Site Closing"), in which case the provisions of Section
6.3.1 shall apply. As of the Closing of this Agreement, and irrespective of
whether Operator Franchisee accepts, rejects or challenges the BFO, whether
Operator Franchisee closes escrow, or whether Buyer owns, operates, manages or
supplies the BFO Fuel Retail Site, each of the BFO Fuel Retail Sites shall be
deemed to be a Purchased Asset for purposes of Third Party Claims, Retained
Environmental Liabilities and Assumed Environmental Liabilities. However, as
between Buyer and Operator Franchisee, nothing herein shall modify or amend in
any manner the Operator Franchisee's liability for any hazardous materials or
environmental remediation at the BFO Fuel Retail Site, as set forth in the
applicable CODO or COFO Agreements or the applicable RESA.

Section 6.2 Rejection of BFO. If, with respect to any BFO Fuel Retail Site,
the Operator Franchisee does not timely deliver an executed RESA to BPWCP
within the forty-five (45) day period (as such period may be extended by BPWCP
pursuant to Section 6.1 above), together with any deposit that may be required
under such RESA, or has otherwise declined or rejected, or is deemed to have
declined or rejected, the BFO, then, unless (x) otherwise prohibited by an
order of a court of competent jurisdiction or (y) there is pending litigation
over the BFO or (z) Operator Franchisee submits a RESA to BPWCP under protest,
and BPWCP decides in its sole discretion not to proceed with the transfer of
the BFO Fuel Retail Site until a later time, (i) BPWCP shall provide written
notice to the Buyer of such event and, effective as of Buyer's receipt of such
notice, this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect with respect to
the sale of said BFO Fuel Retail Site to the Buyer at the Closing; and (ii)
effective as of the Closing (or as soon thereafter as reasonably possible) and
by way of delivery of the Deeds, the Bill of Sale, Assignment and Assumption
Agreement and the Underground Storage Tank Change of Ownership Form (if
applicable), each pursuant to Sections 10.2.2 and 10.2.3, BPWCP shall transfer
to the Buyer fee title to the BFO Fuel Retail Site and, to the extent
assignable, BPWCP shall assign to the Buyer all relevant rights, approvals,
permits, entitlements, and contractual agreements with respect to such BFO
Fuel Retail Site, including any applicable CODO or COFO Agreements, and any
other contracts involving the supply of motor fuels to such BFO Fuel Retail
Site, and, except as otherwise expressly provided for in this Agreement, all
of BPWCP's rights and obligations under the PMPA and any other applicable law,
as those same relate to the any applicable CODO or COFO Agreements, and the
Buyer shall accept the assignment of same and assume all of BPWCP's
obligations thereunder relating to any period on or after the Effective Time.
Upon such conveyance of any such BFO Fuel Retail Sites to Buyer at Closing, such BFO Fuel Retail Sites shall be deemed to be a Purchased
Asset for all purposes under this Agreement, retroactive to the Closing Date.

Section 6.3 Acceptance of BFO. If, with respect to any BFO Fuel Retail Site,
(i) the Operator Franchisee timely delivers a signed RESA to BPWCP, together
with any deposit that may be required under such RESA, without any protest or
reservation of rights to challenge the RESA as a BFO (a "BFO Accepted Site"),
or (ii), the actions set forth in Section 6.2 are otherwise prohibited by an
order of a court of competent jurisdiction or the Operator Franchisee timely
delivers a signed RESA to BPWCP, together with any deposit that may be
required under such RESA, but does so under protest or subject to a
reservation of rights to challenge the RESA as a BFO and BPWCP determines in
its sole discretion not to open an escrow for such RESA/deposit (a "Non-Escrow
Pending BFO Fuel Retail Site"), or (iii) the Operator Franchisee timely
delivers a signed RESA to BPWCP, together with any deposit that may be
required under such RESA, but does so under protest or subject to a
reservation of rights to challenge the RESA as a BFO and BPWCP determines in
its sole discretion to open an escrow for such RESA/deposit ("Escrow Pending
BFO Fuel Retail Site"), then the time deadlines set forth in this Agreement
shall not apply to the sale of such BFO Fuel Retail Site to the Buyer, and,
for each BFO Accepted Site and each Escrow Pending BFO Fuel Retail Site, a
separate escrow between said Operator Franchisee and BPWCP shall be
established. The Non-Escrow Pending BFO Fuel Retail Sites and the Escrow
Pending BFO Fuel Retail Sites are collectively referred to herein as the
"Pending BFO Fuel Retail Sites." Notwithstanding the foregoing, and regardless
of whether there have been any Pre-closing BFO Accepted Site Closings, upon
said Closing of this Agreement with respect to the sale of Fuel Retail Assets
(or as soon thereafter as reasonably practical) and by way of delivery by each
Party of an executed Bill of Sale, Assignment and Assumption Agreement, each
pursuant to Sections 10.2.2 and 10.2.3, BPWCP shall, to the extent assignable,
assign to the Buyer, and the Buyer shall accept assignment of and assume all
of BPWCP's rights and obligations, relating to any period on or after the
Effective Time, under all relevant rights, approvals, permits, entitlements,
and contractual agreements with respect to all of the BFO Fuel Retail Sites
(including any BFO Fuel Retail Sites for which there were Pre-Closing BFO
Accepted Site Closings) including any contracts involving the supply of motor
fuels to those Operator Franchisees, except that BPWCP shall, for all BFO
Accepted Sites for which there was no Pre-Closing BFO Accepted Site Closing
and for all Pending BFO Fuel Retail Sites, retain its fee title to those BFO
Fuel Retail Sites and any fixtures, improvements and equipment thereon
(collectively, the "Interim Retained Assets"). The Buyer's assumption of all
of BPWCP's rights and obligations pursuant to the preceding sentences shall
include any applicable CODO or COFO Agreements, and, except as otherwise
expressly provided for in this Agreement, all of BPWCP's rights and
obligations relating to any period on or after the Effective Time under the
PMPA and any other applicable law, as those same relate to the CODO or COFO
Agreements. Notwithstanding BPWCP's temporary retention (after the Closing of
this Agreement with respect to the sale of the Fuel Retail Assets) of title to
the Interim Retained Assets, the Buyer shall perform any and all obligations
with respect to each such BFO Fuel Retail Site that BPWCP appoints the Buyer
to perform, including BPWCP's obligations as fuel supplier, pursuant to the
terms of the Retail Management Services Agreement attached as Exhibit A.
However, BPWCP shall not appoint Buyer to perform any services under the
Retail Management Services Agreement to the extent those services are assigned
to Buyer pursuant to the provisions in this Article. As to each Pending BFO
Fuel Retail Site, upon resolution of whatever matter(s) caused that BFO Fuel
Retail Site to be a Pending BFO Fuel Retail Site, such BFO Fuel Retail Site
shall, as applicable depending on such resolution, become a BFO Accepted Site,
in which case the provisions of this Section 6.3 regarding a BFO Accepted Site
and the provisions of Section 6.4 and Section 6.5 below shall apply, or shall
be governed by the provisions of Section 6.2 regarding a BFO Fuel Retail Site
for which the Operator Franchisee has rejected, or is deemed to have rejected,
the BFO.

6.3.1 BPWCP shall provide written notice to Buyer no later than ten (10) days
prior to the Closing of any Pre-Closing BFO Accepted Site Closings. With
respect to any Pre-Closing BFO Accepted Site Closings that occur before the delivery of the Estimated Closing
Statement, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the total of all amounts
actually received by or on behalf of BPWCP from Operator Franchisees for any
Pre-Closing BFO Accepted Site Closings closed before delivery of the Estimated
Closing Statement (the "Pre-Closing Statement BFO Reduction Amount"). With
respect to any Pre-Closing BFO Accepted Site Closings that occur after
delivery of the Estimated Closing Statement but before delivery of the Closing
Statement, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the total of all amounts
actually received by or on behalf of BPWCP from Operator Franchisees for any
Pre-Closing BFO Accepted Site Closings closed after delivery of the Estimated
Closing Statement and before the delivery of the Closing Statement (the
"Closing Statement BFO Reduction Amount"). The Closing Statement BFO Reduction
Amount shall be paid pursuant to Section 11.5.

Section 6.4 No Close of Escrow after Acceptance of BFO. If, with respect to
any BFO Accepted Site, the RESA and the separate escrow established therefor
between the Operator Franchisee and BPWCP is terminated prior to the close of
escrow of such transaction for any reason other than BPWCP's breach of the
RESA (including due to the Operator Franchisee's failure to close escrow
within the time period set forth in the RESA, including any extensions granted
by BPWCP in its sole discretion), or, if the RESA escrow has failed to close
due to BPWCP's alleged or actual breach of the RESA and the Operator
Franchisee's right to seek specific performance of BPWCP's obligation to sell
the BFO Fuel Retail Site under the RESA has lapsed or terminated or is
otherwise time-barred and there is no outstanding or threatened litigation
between BPWCP and the Operator Franchisee with respect to the BFO and/or the
RESA, then: (i) BPWCP shall provide written notice to the Buyer of such event
and, effective as of the Buyer's receipt of such notice, this Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect with respect to the sale of said BFO Fuel
Retail Site to the Buyer; (ii) the Buyer shall close escrow on its purchase
from BPWCP of the BFO Fuel Retail Site no later than thirty (30) days after
the date of BPWCP's notice or the Closing of this Agreement with respect to
the Fuel Retail Assets, whichever is the later, (iii) BPWCP shall deliver to
the Buyer a Deed and any other documents necessary to transfer to the Buyer
title to the Interim Retained Assets thereon and (iv) to the extent not
previously assigned, BPWCP shall assign to the Buyer all relevant rights,
approvals, permits, entitlements, and contractual agreements with respect to
such BFO Fuel Retail Site, if any, including any applicable CODO or COFO
Agreement, and any contracts involving the supply of motor fuels to such BFO
Fuel Retail Site, and, except as otherwise expressly provided for in this
Agreement, all of BPWCP's rights and obligations under the PMPA and any other
applicable law, as those same relate to applicable CODO and COFO Agreements,
and the Buyer shall accept the assignment of same and assume all of BPWCP's
obligations thereunder and shall deliver to BPWCP the documents set forth in
Sections 10.2.3.2, 10.2.3.14 and 10.2.3.15. Upon the close of escrow on
Buyer's purchase from BPWCP of such BFO Fuel Retail Sites, such BFO Fuel
Retail Sites shall be deemed to be Purchased Assets for all purposes under
this Agreement, retroactive to the Closing Date.

Section 6.5 Close of Escrow for Operator Franchisee's Purchase Under the RESA.
Upon the closing of each sale of a BFO Fuel Retail Site to an Operator
Franchisee (regardless of when such closing occurs): (i) this Agreement shall
no longer be deemed to apply to the sale of such BFO Fuel Retail Site to the
Buyer; (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Buyer's indemnity obligations pursuant to Section 6.9 and BPWCP's indemnity
obligations pursuant to Section 6.7 shall remain in full force and effect with
respect to such BFO Fuel Retail Site and the BFO Fuel Retail Site shall be
deemed to be a Purchased Asset for purposes of Third Party Claims, Retained
Environmental Liabilities and Assumed Environmental Liabilities; (iii) the
lease provisions in the PMPA Franchise Agreements will terminate or merge with
Operator Franchisee's fee title pursuant to the terms of the RESA; and (iv)
Sellers shall assign to Buyer all of Sellers' rights under the RESA.

Section 6.6 Post-Closing Adjustment. With respect to closings of sales of BFO
Fuel Retail Sites to Operator Franchisees that occur after the delivery of the
Closing Statement under this Agreement, within thirty (30) days of BPWCP's receipt of all cash
consideration in respect of any such closed transaction, BPWCP shall prepare
and submit to the Buyer a statement which will set forth the amount actually
received by BPWCP for such transaction (for each such transaction the "Post-
Closing Statement BFO Retail Sites Reduction Amount"). Disputes with respect
to any Post-Closing Statement BFO Retail Sites Reduction Amount shall be
subject to Section 11.4. Within five (5) Business Days after any Post-Closing
Statement BFO Retail Sites Reduction Amount is determined by mutual agreement
of the Buyer and BPWCP or pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section
11.4, BPWCP shall pay the Post-Closing Statement BFO Retail Sites Reduction
Amount to the Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such
account or accounts of the Buyer as may be designated by the Buyer.

Section 6.7 Indemnification by BPWCP. BPWCP shall, subject to Section 15.5
through Section 15.10, indemnify, defend, protect and hold the Buyer
Indemnified Parties harmless from and against all Losses of Buyer related to
any claim by any Franchisee Operator (each a "Claim" and collectively,
"Claims") to the extent that any such Claim (i) seeks to invalidate or claim
the invalidity of BPWCP's assignment of the CODO or COFO Agreements or any
other rights, obligations, or agreements to the Buyer under this Article,
unless such Claim is based on any act or omission by the Buyer; or (ii) arises
out of, or is in any way related to (A) BPWCP's failure or alleged failure to
fulfill its obligations with respect to any BFO, any RESA, and/or the sale of
any BFO Fuel Retail Site to any Operator Franchisee under this Article, or any
applicable federal or state Law with respect to the PMPA Franchise Agreements,
or (B) BPWCP's failure or alleged failure to fulfill any obligations contained
in the CODO or COFO Agreements prior to BPWCP's assignment thereof to the
Buyer. Any and all Claims under this Section 6.7 shall be Third Party Claims.

Section 6.8 Buyer Franchise Agreement Offers. At an appropriate time prior to
the stated expiration date of each of the PMPA Franchise Agreements assigned
by BPWCP to the Buyer at the Closing, the Buyer will, in good faith and in the
normal course of business and to the extent required by the PMPA or any
applicable state law, offer to each of the Operator Franchisees renewal
franchise agreements as required under the PMPA with respect to the supply of
branded motor fuel, unless such Operator Franchisee has been properly
terminated or non-renewed for any reason permitted by the PMPA. Franchise
agreements offered by the Buyer to the Operator Franchisees referenced
hereunder shall be offered in accordance with the PMPA and shall comply in all
material respects with all applicable provisions of the PMPA and any
applicable state law.

Section 6.9 Buyer's Indemnification. The Buyer shall, subject to Section 15.5
through Section 15.10, indemnify, defend, protect and hold BPWCP, its

any way related to any of the following, to the extent first arising after the
Closing (i) any termination or non-renewal by the Buyer of any CODO or COFO
Agreements assigned by BPWCP to the Buyer, (ii) the Buyer's offer of, or
failure or alleged failure to offer renewal franchise agreements as required
in Section 6.8, (iii) the Buyer's failure or alleged failure to fulfill its
obligations under this Agreement, or any applicable federal or state Law with
respect to the CODO or COFO Agreements; or (iv) the Buyer's failure or alleged
failure to fulfill any obligations contained in the CODO or COFO Agreements
assigned to the Buyer by BPWCP relating to any period on or after the
Effective Time. Any and all Claims under this Section 6.9 shall be Third Party
Claims.

Section 6.10 Expenses. In any lawsuit brought by any Operator Franchisee in
connection with the matters governed by this Article 6, each Party shall bear
its own attorneys' fees and other costs of defense incurred in such action,
except as otherwise provided above. ARTICLE 7

PRE-CLOSING COVENANTS

Section 7.1 Satisfaction of Conditions Precedent. From the Execution Date
until the earlier of the Closing Date and the termination of this Agreement,
each Party will use Reasonable Efforts to take all action (or refrain from
taking any detrimental action within its control) and to do all things
necessary, proper, or advisable in order to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement including the satisfaction of the
conditions precedent set forth in Article 9; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not require or cause any Party to waive any right it may have
under other provisions of this Agreement.

Section 7.2 Non-Assignability of Purchased Assets and Environmental Permits.

7.2.1 Non-Assignability of Purchased Assets. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, this Agreement shall not constitute an
agreement of the Sellers to transfer or assign any Purchased Asset (including
any lease of a Leased Real Property or Assigned Contract, but excluding any
Permits), if the attempted transfer or assignment of the same, as a result of
the absence of the consent or authorization of a Third Party or the failure of
the notice period to expire under a right of first refusal, right of first
offer or other similar preemptive right, would constitute a breach or Default
under any such agreement; or would violate any applicable Law. Buyer and
Sellers shall jointly use all Reasonable Efforts to take all necessary actions
before Closing to permit the Purchased Asset to be transferred or assigned to
Buyer, including obtaining any required Third Party consent or authorization
for such transfer, assignment or waiver of any applicable right of first
refusal, right of first offer, or similar preemptive right. If any such
consent, authorization, or waiver is not obtained, or if an attempted
transfer, assignment or assumption would be otherwise ineffective, with
respect to any such Purchased Asset (or Purchased Asset that is otherwise
deemed to constitute an Excluded Asset pursuant to Sections 2.2.8 and 2.2.10,
but excluding Permits, any assets and matters governed by the provisions of
Article 6), so that the Buyer would not, in fact, receive all Sellers' rights,
or assume all Sellers' obligations relating to any such period on or after the
Effective Time with respect thereto as they exist prior to such attempted
transfer, assignment or assumption, then (i) provided that Buyer has satisfied
the Leased Real Property Conditions where required under Section 7.9, the
Sellers and Buyer shall enter into such supplemental agreements (including
subleases, licenses, operating or transportation agreements, the transfer of a
Purchased Asset to an Affiliate of Sellers followed by the transfer of such
entity to Buyer, etc., as applicable) on reasonable terms and conditions that
may be necessary (including enforcement at the shared cost of the Parties of
any and all rights of the Sellers against any involved Third Parties) to
provide the Buyer with the same benefits of such Purchased Asset as possessed
by Sellers immediately prior to Closing, and, notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, any such Purchased Asset shall be deemed to constitute an
Assumed Liability and (ii) the Sellers and Buyer shall enter into such
supplemental agreements on reasonable terms and conditions that may be
necessary to provide to Sellers the right to purchase certain fuel and
petroleum products from Buyer in order to perform Sellers' sales obligations
under such fuel and petroleum product sales contracts to Third Parties;
provided that all fuel and petroleum products purchased by Sellers from Buyer
under all such supplemental agreements shall be at the same price as such fuel
and petroleum products are sold by Sellers to Third Parties under such fuel
and petroleum product sales contracts with Third Parties. Notwithstanding the
execution of any supplemental agreements, the Parties shall continue to seek
the relevant consents, authorizations or waivers and if and when such
consents, authorizations or waivers, the absence of which caused the deferral
of transfer of any Purchased Asset pursuant to this Section, are obtained,
such Purchased Asset shall no longer be an Excluded Asset under Section 2.2.8.
The Parties' obligations under this Section, including with respect to the
term of the supplemental agreements entered into pursuant to the above, with
respect to the Carson Logistics and Marketing Terminals Assets and the
Wilmington Calciner Assets, shall expire on the same date that Sellers'
underlying rights and obligations in connection therewith would expire, and with respect to all other Purchased Assets, shall expire on
the date that is the twenty-four (24) month anniversary of the Closing Date;
provided, that, with respect to all such other Purchased Assets, if, following
such twenty-four (24) month anniversary of the Closing Date Buyer reasonably
demonstrates to Sellers that any such other Purchased Assets are necessary for
the operation of the Business (excluding any aspects of the Business related
to the Excluded Assets other than those subject to the requirements of this
Section 7.2.1) in the manner in which it is currently being operated and the
expiration of the Parties' obligations under this Section would have a
material adverse effect, then the Parties' obligations hereunder shall
continue to survive; provided, further that any disputes with respect to the
continuation of such obligations shall be resolved pursuant to Section 19.10.
Subject to (i) above, in the event Sellers are unable to transfer to Buyer
that certain Lease dated December 17, 1969 by and between the City of Long
Beach, acting by and through its Board of Harbor Commissioners, as lessor, and
Atlantic Richfield Company (predecessor-in-interest to BP West Coast Products
LLC), as lessee, as amended, supplemented or assigned (the "Barn Lease") on or
before the date that any option to extend the term of the Barn Lease must be
exercised then BPWCP shall, pursuant to the terms of the Barn Lease exercise
its option to extend the term of the Barn Lease and BPWCP shall exercise
Reasonable Efforts to achieve commercially reasonable lease payment rates
thereunder. The Parties shall comply with the terms of the Technology
Agreement with respect to the identification, assignment and transfer of Third
Party Licenses of Third Party IT Systems and other contemplated Third Party
license agreements. If any such license cannot be transferred or assigned to
Buyer within a reasonable time, the Parties shall comply with the terms of
this Section 7.2.1 with respect to such license and, pending resolution of the
issue, Buyer shall use Reasonable Efforts to provide, either directly or
through a Third Party, any transitional services that are necessary in lieu of
that license, and if Buyer is not able to provide such necessary transitional
services, Sellers shall use Reasonable Efforts to provide such services, if
practicable, subject to the terms and conditions in Transition Services
Agreement.

7.2.2 Non-Assignability of Permits (including Environmental Permits). The
Sellers and the Buyer shall cooperate using their Reasonable Efforts to
transfer, obtain, or to cause to be transferred or obtained, prior to the
Closing or as soon as practicable thereafter, all Permits (including
Environmental Permits) necessary for the Buyer to own or operate the Purchased
Assets or the Business in the manner substantially similar to the manner
operated by the Sellers prior to the Effective Time, and provided that such
Permits (including Environmental Permits) are not substantively different from
the Permits (including Environmental Permits) held by the Sellers prior to the
Effective Time. Any such Permit transferred to or obtained by Buyer shall be
included among the Purchased Assets and shall not be an Excluded Asset
pursuant to Section 2.2.8. During the period commencing on the date that is
six (6) days after the Execution Date and continuing until one hundred eighty
(180) days after the Closing Date, which one hundred eighty (180) day period
may be extended in thirty (30) day increments by mutual agreement of the Buyer
and the Sellers, provided that, in no case shall such aggregate period,
including any extensions, end later than the date that is eighteen (18) months
after the Closing Date the Sellers and the Buyer shall provide or cause to be
provided to the other party all commercially reasonable assistance as is
reasonably requested in connection with transferring, if required by
applicable Laws, any such Permits (including Environmental Permits). In
addition, commencing on the date that is six (6) days after the Execution Date
the Sellers shall (i) provide or cause to be provided to the Buyer all
commercially reasonable assistance as is reasonably requested in connection
with securing any such Permits (including Environmental Permits) and (ii) if
any Permits (including Environmental Permits) are not secured prior to the
Closing, the Sellers and the Buyer shall cooperate in any lawful and
reasonable arrangement reasonably proposed by the other party under which the
Buyer shall, to the extent allowed by applicable Laws, obtain the same
benefits of such Permits as possessed by Sellers immediately prior to Closing
(including Environmental Permits) held by the Sellers in connection with the
ownership or operation of the Purchased Assets or the Business following the
Effective Time; provided, that the Parties' obligations with respect to any
such provision of assistance or cooperation hereunder shall expire on the date
that is the twenty-four (24) month anniversary of the Closing Date. 7.2.3 Uninsurable Title Conditions. If the existence of any easements,
licenses, rights of way, encumbrances, agreements, instruments, discrepancies,
conflicts, shortages in area or boundary lines, encroachments or protrusions,
overlapping of improvements, defects, irregularities and other matters related
to any of the assets listed on Schedule 7.2.3 which are not reflected in the
title reports, title commitments or surveys made available to the Buyer prior
to the Execution Date or listed on Schedule 2.1.2.3(b) or contained within the
documents and interests reflected therein preclude Buyer from obtaining
insurable title to such assets ("Uninsurable Title Conditions"), Buyer and
Sellers shall use Reasonable Efforts to address such Uninsurable Title
Conditions on reasonable terms and conditions as may be necessary (including
enforcement at the shared cost of the Parties of any and all rights of the
Sellers against any involved Third Parties) to enable the Buyer to obtain
insurable title therefor; provided, however, such obligations shall expire on
the first to occur of (i) the date that Buyer conveys the subject asset to
another party (other than TLLP, its general partner or any of its wholly-owned
subsidiaries) and (ii) the date that is the twenty-four (24) month anniversary
of the Closing Date.

Section 7.3 Approvals by Governmental Authority.

7.3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Buyer
and the Sellers shall use their Reasonable Efforts to (i) cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated as soon as
practicable, (ii) make, or cause to be made, the filings required of it or any
of their Affiliates under the HSR Act and any other applicable antitrust or
competition laws outside the United States in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby no later than the fifteenth (15th)
Business Day following the Execution Date or such later date as the Parties
may otherwise agree in writing, (iii) comply at the earliest practicable date
and after consultation with the other Party with any request for additional
information or documentary material received by them or any of their
Affiliates from any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction with respect to
the HSR Act and any other applicable antitrust or competition laws and use
their Reasonable Efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions
consistent with this Section 7.3.1 necessary to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act (including any
extensions thereof) as soon as practicable; (iv) make, or cause to be made,
the filings required of it or any of their Affiliates under the Federal Power
Act, and obtain the corresponding approvals thereunder from the applicable
Governmental Authority, in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby no later than the fifteenth (15th) Business Day following
the Execution Date or such later date as the Parties may otherwise agree in
writing (the "FERC Filing"), and (v) obtain all other actions or non-actions,
approvals, consents, waivers, registrations, permits, authorizations and other
confirmations from any Governmental Authority (the "Other Governmental
Approvals") as well as those from the United States Department of
Transportation or the California State Fire Marshal, or Third Party necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as soon as practicable.

7.3.2 Each of the Buyer and the Sellers shall: (i) promptly notify the other
Party of, and if in writing, furnish the others with copies of (or, in the
case of oral communications, advise the others of the contents of) any
communication to it from a Governmental Authority and permit the other Party
to review and discuss in advance (and to consider in good faith any comments
made by the others in relation to), any proposed written communication to a
Governmental Authority, (ii) keep the other Party informed of any
developments, meetings or discussions with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any filings, investigation, or inquiry concerning the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) unless prohibited by such Governmental
Authority, not independently participate in any meeting or discussions with
any Governmental Authority (except for unsolicited telephone calls initiated
by such Governmental Authority) in respect of any filings, investigation or
inquiry concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without
giving the other Party prior notice of such meeting or discussions and the
opportunity to attend or participate and (iv) use Reasonable Efforts to
achieve substantial compliance as soon as practical following receipt of
notification from the Federal Antitrust Agency that Buyer or Sellers are not in substantial compliance. However, each of the Buyer and the Sellers
may designate any non-public information provided to any Governmental
Authority as restricted to "Outside Antitrust Counsel" only and any such
information shall not be shared with employees, officers or directors or their
equivalents of the other Party without approval of the Party providing the
non-public information. The Buyer or the Sellers shall not enter into any
agreement with any Governmental Authority that would delay consummating the
transaction or otherwise set a schedule for an investigation or any litigation
without the prior written agreement of the other Party. As used in this
Section 7.3, "Governmental Authority" is limited to a government agency with
jurisdiction over antitrust matters.

7.3.3 If the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are enjoined other
than through a temporary restraining order (whether preliminarily or
permanently) as a result of any injunction or other order in any action or
proceeding brought by any Governmental Authority that seeks to prevent the
Closing of this transaction as a violation of any antitrust Law as long as the
basis of the court order is not solely a violation of Section 7A of the HSR
Act, the Buyer must immediately propose to the relevant Governmental Authority
to commit to and to effect, by consent decree, hold separate order, trust or
otherwise, the sale, license, divestiture or other disposition of the
Wilmington Refinery in order to effect the dissolution or lifting of any such
injunction or other order and to satisfy the conditions set forth in Sections
9.1.5 and 9.2.5.

7.3.4 Subject to Section 7.3.3, in the event that any litigation or other
administrative or judicial action or proceeding is commenced, threatened or is
foreseeable challenging the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
such litigation, action or proceeding seeks, or would reasonably be expected
to seek, to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Buyer and Sellers shall
use Reasonable Efforts to avoid or resolve any such litigation, action or
proceeding and each of the Buyer and the Sellers shall cooperate with the
other and use their respective Reasonable Efforts to contest and resist any
such litigation, action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 7.4 Pending Sale of Non-BFO Facilities in Escrow. In connection with
the Fuel Retail Business, the Parties acknowledge and agree that, as of the
Execution Date, the Sellers have escrows open with certain Third Parties (each
a "Non-BFO Purchaser") to sell certain of the Sellers' retail fuel facilities
described on Schedule 7.4 (each a "Non-BFO Facility" and, collectively, the
"Non-BFO Facilities") to such Non-BFO Purchasers pursuant to real estate and
purchase and sale agreements (collectively all such agreements, "Non-BFO
RESAs") and that such escrows may or may not close prior to the Closing
between the Buyer and the Sellers hereunder. The Sellers shall be entitled to
proceed with the closing of such pending sale transactions and transfer to
such Non-BFO Purchasers the ownership of such Non-BFO Facilities prior to the
Closing; provided, however, that no later than ten (10) days prior to the
Closing, the Sellers shall deliver written notice to the Buyer (the "Included
Fuel Retail Sites Notice") identifying any of the Non-BFO Facilities that
shall be purchased by the Buyer and included in the Closing (collectively, the
"Included Fuel Retail Sites in Escrow"). Subject to the provisions contained
herein and by way of delivery of the Deeds, the Bill of Sale, Assignment and
Assumption Agreement and the Underground Storage Tank Change of Ownership Form
(if applicable), and other applicable documents pursuant to Section 10.2.2 at
Closing: (i) the Buyer shall purchase and accept, and Sellers shall transfer
to the Buyer fee title to, all Included Fuel Retail Sites in Escrow identified
in the Included Fuel Retail Sites Notice; and (ii) the Sellers shall, to the
extent assignable, assign to the Buyer, and the Buyer shall accept assignment
of and assume, all of the Sellers' relevant rights, approvals, permits,
entitlements, and contractual agreements with respect to all of the Included
Fuel Retail Sites in Escrow, including any applicable CODO or COFO Agreements,
the applicable Non-BFO RESAs, and any contracts involving the supply of motor
fuels to all of the Included Fuel Retail Sites in Escrow, and, except as
otherwise expressly provided for in this Agreement, all of Sellers' rights and
obligations under the PMPA and any other applicable law, as those same relate
to the PMPA Franchise Agreements for all of the Included Fuel Retail Sites in
Escrow. For the avoidance of doubt, from and after the Closing, the Buyer,
upon written notice from Sellers as set forth above, shall assume all of the
Sellers' obligations with respect to all pending sale transactions to Non-BFO
Purchasers regarding the Included Fuel Retail Sites in Escrow, all of the
Sellers' rights and obligations under the Non-BFO RESAs with respect to such
Included Fuel Retail Sites in Escrow. At Closing, the Purchase Price shall be
increased by an amount equal to the total of all amounts to be paid by or on
behalf of the Non-BFO Purchasers for sales of Non-BFO Facilities pursuant to
the Non-BFO RESAs with respect to the Included Fuel Retail Sites in Escrow
(such amount the "Included Fuel Retail Sites in Escrow Amount"). As of the
Closing of this Agreement, and irrespective of whether Non-BFO Purchaser
closes escrow, or whether Buyer owns, operates, manages or supplies the site,
each of the Non-BFO Facilities shall be deemed to be a Purchased Asset for
purposes of Third Party Claims, Retained Environmental Liabilities and the
Assumed Environmental Liabilities. However, as between Buyer and Non-BFO
Purchaser, nothing herein shall modify or amend in any manner the Non-BFO
Purchaser's liability for any hazardous materials or environmental remediation
at the Non-BFO Facility, as set forth in the applicable CODO or COFO
Agreements, or the applicable Non-BFO RESA.

Section 7.5 Operation of Business. From the Execution Date until the earlier
of the Closing Date and the termination of this Agreement, the Sellers will
cause the Purchased Assets and the Business to be operated in the Ordinary
Course of Business; provided, however, that the foregoing notwithstanding, the
Sellers shall be entitled to undertake such actions as may be reasonably
required to undertake the Scheduled Turnaround and the Special Projects (and
in connection therewith, the Sellers shall use their Reasonable Efforts to
undertake both such activities in a manner that promotes the best commercial
interests of the Business), separate the Excluded Assets from the Purchased
Assets, consummate the Dealer Loan Purchase and the Watson Cogen Company
Contract Renewal, and effect the transactions contemplated by, and other
purposes of, this Agreement. Unless in violation of applicable Law, the
Sellers shall provide the Buyer with periodic, detailed updates on the status
of the consummation of the Watson Cogen Company Contract Renewal (including
participation in reasonably requested meetings with Buyer copies of draft and
final agreements unless precluded by a confidentiality agreement with a Third
Party) and the undertaking of the Scheduled Turnaround and the Special
Projects. Except in the Ordinary Course of Business or as otherwise expressly
contemplated by this Agreement (including the preceding sentence of this
Section 7.5), and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Sellers will not and will cause the Watson Cogen Company to not, without the
prior written consent of the Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned):

7.5.1 sell, lease or otherwise dispose of, or grant any right or Encumbrance
except Permitted Encumbrances with respect to, any material Purchased Asset,
other than sales of goods or services, the replacement of worn out or obsolete
property with property of comparable quality, or the expiration of leases or
the settlement of pending condemnation actions, as well as the transactions
contemplated in Article 6 and Section 7.4, regarding the acquisition,
disposition and/or other transfer of rights related to certain of the BFO Fuel
Retail Sites and Non-BFO Facilities identified therein, or enter into a
material Contract with respect to any matter set forth in Section 7.4 for work
or services related to the Purchased Assets that would have a term extending
beyond December 31, 2013, and which could not be cancelled without penalty,
cancellation fee or other charge or cost of termination, upon ninety (90) days
written notice;

7.5.2 amend in any material respect any Assigned Contracts (other than
connection with the Watson Cogen Company Contract Renewal); 7.5.3 except for the annual pay and bonus review, grant any material increase
in compensation to any employee involved in the Business or hire any new
employees involved in the Business other than to fill vacancies in existing
positions, or other than in connection with any agreement with any of the
Unions regarding the Represented Business Employees;

7.5.4 fail to (i) maintain its status as a qualifying cogeneration facility
pursuant to 18 C.F.R. 292.205, (ii) maintain its status as an exempt wholesale
generator, or (iii) comply with all requirements necessary to maintain its
authority to sell power at market based rates;

7.5.5 Sellers or their Affiliates will not hire, without the prior written
consent of Buyer, any new employee between the Execution Date and the Closing
Date where such employee is not represented by any Unions and such employee is
not employed by the Refinery Business or the Carson Logistics and Marketing
Terminals Business; or

7.5.6 commit in any manner to any of the transactions contemplated by the
foregoing Sections 7.5.1 through 7.5.5.

Notwithstanding the foregoing and without requiring the consent of the Buyer,
the Sellers may, in their sole discretion, engage in and undertake any and all
activities necessary to prevent or minimize injury to persons or damage to
property or the Facilities in the case of an emergency and/or to address,
prevent or minimize a health, environmental or safety concern involving the
Purchased Assets, the Facilities or the Business.

Section 7.6 Access to Information.

7.6.1 Unless in violation of Law, prior to the Closing, the Sellers will
permit representatives of the Buyer to have reasonable access at reasonable
times and at Buyer's cost, and in a manner so as not to interfere with the
normal business operations conducted thereat, to (i) all premises, properties
and personnel of the Sellers exclusively related to the Purchased Assets and
the Business or any assets necessary for the operation of the Business
(excluding any aspects of the Business related to the Excluded Assets) in the
manner in which it is currently being operated, whether or not such assets are
included amongst the Purchased Assets, and (ii) Books and Records as well as
all files, documents, instruments, papers, plans, drawings, manuals, books and
records that are reasonably necessary for the operation of the Purchased
Assets and the Business in the manner in which they are currently being
operated but that are not "Books and Records" solely because they do not
exclusively relate to the Purchased Assets and the Business; provided,
however, that Sellers shall first be entitled to redact from all such files,
documents, instruments, papers, plans, drawings, manuals, books and records
any information which does not exclusively relate to the Purchased Assets and
the Business; and provided, further, that Sellers shall have no obligation
under this Section to grant Buyer access to any Sellers' Standards which are
exclusively subject to Section 12.5. In addition, the Sellers will exercise
their Reasonable Efforts to permit representatives of the Buyer to have
reasonable access at reasonable times and at Buyer's cost, and in a manner so
as not to interfere with the normal business operations conducted thereat, to
all premises, properties and personnel of the Watson Cogen Company and the
Fuel Retail Third Parties; provided, however, that access to the premises,
properties and personnel of the Watson Cogen Company shall be subject to its
consent and access to those premises and properties operated by Fuel Retail
Third Parties shall be subject to the consent of such Fuel Retail Third
Parties. In connection with the foregoing, Buyer may provide Sellers with a
list of additional information and documents reasonably requested by Buyer to
review and other matters and facilities reasonably requested by Buyer to
inspect pursuant to this Section 7.6. Sellers shall use Reasonable Efforts to
provide all such requested additional information and documents to Buyer as
promptly as possible following such request by Buyer and Buyer shall use
Reasonable Efforts to complete Buyer's review of such requested additional
information and documents as promptly as possible after the last of such requested additional
information has been provided by Sellers to Buyer. The Sellers shall grant
particular priority to all information requests related to the identification
and transition planning for the orderly transfer at Closing of Books and
Records involving those operation and maintenance records (such as inspection,
critical equipment, major maintenance and scheduled turnaround histories, unit
process design documentation, engineering drawings and calculations,
blueprints and operating instructions) that are material to the safe and
prudent operation of the Purchased Assets. Any information obtained by the
Buyer or its employees, representatives, consultants, attorneys, agents,
lenders and other advisors under this Section 7.6 shall be subject to the
provisions of this Agreement relating to confidentiality. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Buyer may not under any circumstances (x) conduct or cause to
be conducted any sampling or other invasive investigation of the air, soil,
soil gas, surface water, groundwater, building materials or other
environmental media at any property related to the Sellers or their Affiliates
or the Business, including the Purchased Assets, the Facilities and the Real
Property Interests or (y) access or attempt to access the Sellers' proprietary
network. The Buyer shall ensure that the access permitted pursuant to this
Section 7.6.1 will be used solely for the purpose of effecting the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. During such access, the Buyer and
each of its representatives shall comply with the Sellers' applicable policies
and procedures, including Sellers' code of conduct, digital security, health,
safety, security, and environmental policies. If, at any time, the Sellers
believe in good faith that the Buyer or any representative of Buyer has not
complied with the Sellers' applicable policies and procedures (or those of the
Watson Cogen Company or any Fuel Retail Third Parties in the event of access
on their respective premises or properties), then the Sellers may immediately
terminate the Buyer's or such representative's access to the premises,
properties and personnel of the Sellers and Books and Records.

7.6.2 Prior to Closing, and at Buyer's sole cost and expense, Sellers shall
use Reasonable Efforts to make available to Buyer's independent auditors such
financial information as may be reasonably required for such independent
auditors to construct pro forma financial statements for various Carson
Logistics and Marketing Terminal Assets for the prior three (3) fiscal years.
Any such information shall be made available to such independent auditors only
pursuant to a confidentiality agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to
Sellers, which shall include a provision that, prior to Closing, such
independent auditors shall not disclose any information it receives from
Sellers in this regard to Buyer or Buyer's representatives, except as may be
expressly authorized in writing by Sellers. Buyer will also be liable for all
costs and expenses associated with updates of financial audit material by such
independent auditors required by Buyer and incurred on or after the Execution
Date, for purposes of SEC filings in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

7.6.3 Buyer bears the risk of injury to any of its employees, advisors or
representatives who are provided access to the premises or properties of the
Sellers or their Affiliates or the Fuel Retail Third Parties hereunder, and
shall indemnify, defend and hold the Sellers, their Affiliates and the Fuel
Retail Third Parties, as the case may be, harmless for any and all Losses
resulting from Buyer's acts or omissions while upon the premises or properties
of the Sellers, their Affiliates or the Fuel Retail Third Parties provided
hereunder.

Section 7.7 Contact with Third Parties. The Buyer and its Affiliates shall
not, prior to the Effective Time, contact any customers, vendors, suppliers,
Fuel Retail Third Parties, or any other Person having business dealings with,
the Sellers or their Affiliates with respect to the operation of the Business
or with respect to any aspect of the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement, except where Buyer and its Affiliates have received the prior
written consent of the Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. Section 7.8 Release and Replacement of Bonds, Guaranties, etc.

7.8.1 Prior to Closing, the Buyer shall deliver to the applicable beneficiary
or counterparty replacement or substitute guaranties, letters of credit,
bonds, security deposits, and other surety obligations and evidence of
financial capacity, in each case acceptable to the relevant beneficiary or
counterparty (the "Substitute Credit Support Arrangements"), in replacement of
those credit support arrangements set forth in Schedule 7.8 (the "Credit
Support Arrangements"), and the Buyer, in form and substance acceptable to the
Sellers, shall cause the release as of the Effective Time of the Sellers and
their Affiliates from all obligations relating to the Credit Support
Arrangements and any Liabilities related thereto. If the Buyer does not or is
unable to deliver an acceptable Substitute Credit Support Arrangement and/or
is unable to obtain a release of the Sellers and their Affiliates for any
Credit Support Arrangement prior to the Effective Time and in each case
effective at the Effective Time, then the Sellers may, but are not obligated
to, agree to maintain such Credit Support Arrangements, subject to Section
7.8.2 and for such period of time (the "Post-Closing Support Period") as is
agreed between the Buyer and the Sellers at the relevant time. During any such
Post-Closing Support Period(s) the Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Sellers and their Affiliates, and their respective directors,
officers, employees, agents and representatives, from and against any and all
Losses (or any draws against any Credit Support Arrangement provided by
Sellers pursuant to Section 7.8.2 below) relating to, resulting from, or
arising out of, any Credit Support Arrangement which is not replaced by the
Buyer as of the Effective Time and is maintained by the Sellers in accordance
with this Section 7.8. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer acknowledges
and agrees that in no event shall any Post-Closing Support Period exceed six
(6) months.

7.8.2 For any Credit Support Arrangement to be maintained by the Sellers after
the Closing Date, the Buyer shall pay the Sellers a fee, as reasonably
required by the Sellers, and shall, prior to Closing, provide a letter of
credit from a bank acceptable to Sellers in the full amount of all Liabilities
under all Credit Support Arrangements to be maintained by Sellers and their
Affiliates following Closing (or such other security as the Sellers may
reasonably request) each in exchange for the Sellers agreeing to maintain such
Credit Support Arrangement following the Closing Date. Sellers shall be
entitled to draw against such letter of credit in an amount equal to the
amount of any and all draws against any Credit Support Arrangement that
Sellers have provided.

Section 7.9 Leased Real Property Conditions.

7.9.1 If the terms of any lease of Leased Real Property require the consent of
the Third Party lessor or lessee thereof to assignment or transfer, then Buyer
and Sellers shall jointly use all Reasonable Efforts to obtain the written
consent of the Third Party lessor or lessee with respect thereto prior to
Closing (collectively, the "Leased Real Property Consents"). If the terms of
any lease of Leased Real Property permit the Third Party lessor or lessee
thereof to condition the assignment or transfer of the lease to Buyer upon (i)
the furnishing of any credit assurance, collateral or undertaking by or on
behalf of Buyer or (ii) the satisfaction of any creditworthiness standard or
other criteria by or on behalf of Buyer (collectively, the "Leased Real
Property Conditions"), then Buyer shall be solely responsible to furnish or
satisfy such Leased Real Property Conditions, except to the extent such Leased
Real Property Condition is a Retained Liability. In addition, where consent to
transfer is required for the leased real property identified in Schedule
7.9.1, Buyer and Sellers shall jointly use all Reasonable Efforts to cause the
release as of the Effective Time of the Sellers and their Affiliates from all
obligations relating to such lease and any Credit Support Arrangements and any
Liabilities related thereto, other than Liabilities for which Sellers or their
Affiliates would be responsible under Section 4.1.

7.9.2 For the avoidance of doubt, Reasonable Efforts to comply with the
provisions of Section 7.9.1, shall not require Sellers or any Affiliate of
Sellers to provide or continue any guarantees or other credit enhancement that may be necessary in order for Buyer to satisfy
any Leased Real Property Conditions or to obtain any Leased Real Property
Consent.

7.9.3 Further, for the avoidance of doubt, the Leased Real Property Conditions
do not include any rights of any Operator Franchisee under PMPA or other
applicable Law regarding BFO Fuel Retail Sites.

Section 7.10 Consent Decree Modification. Buyer acknowledges that it has
received written notice of the Consent Decree and been provided with a copy
thereof. Within a reasonable time after the date hereof (but in any event no
later than thirty (30) days prior to Closing), Sellers or their Affiliates
shall provide notice of this Agreement to the other parties to the Consent
Decree, including the United States. Simultaneously with such notice, Sellers
or their Affiliates and Buyer shall consult with the parties to the Consent
Decree to confirm that Buyer has sufficient resources and the technical
ability to comply with the Consent Decree and that Buyer has agreed to assume
such obligations. In connection therewith, Sellers or their Affiliates and
Buyer shall confirm that the parties to the Consent Decree have no objections
to modifying the Consent Decree (the "Consent Decree Modification") such that
Buyer will become responsible for performing the Consent Decree Obligations on
or after the Effective Time with respect to the Purchased Assets and the
Business (including those obligations related to the allocation of heater
capacity and related tonnage of emissions reductions to be achieved pursuant
to paragraph 15 of the Consent Decree). To the extent any such objections
arise, Sellers or their Affiliates and the Buyer shall exercise their
respective Reasonable Efforts to resolve and overcome any such objections.
Upon obtaining such confirmation or making any changes mutually acceptable to
Sellers and Buyer to address any objections by the parties to the Consent
Decree, Sellers shall take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate actions to
have the Consent Decree Modification entered by the Consent Decree Court, and
Buyer shall take all reasonable steps to support Sellers' or their Affiliates'
actions to have the Consent Decree Modification entered by the Consent Decree
Court, including supporting Sellers' and their Affiliates' efforts to be
released from the Consent Decree Obligations on or after the Effective Time
and to demonstrate to the Consent Decree Court and the other parties to the
Consent Decree that Buyer has the financial and technical ability to assume
the Consent Decree Obligations on or after the Effective Time. On and after
the Closing, Buyer shall satisfy, perform and assume the Consent Decree
Obligations on or after the Effective Time with respect to the Purchased
Assets and the Business and the Buyer shall not be entitled to any
reimbursement or recovery from the Sellers for any Liabilities incurred in
connection with the Consent Decree following the Effective Time.

Section 7.11 Buyer Transition Plan. Unless in violation of applicable Law,
within thirty-six (36) days of the Execution Date, Buyer and Sellers shall
discuss and develop a plan for ensuring an orderly transition of the Purchased
Assets on the Closing Date, including an identification of the scope of
transition services that Sellers are to provide pursuant to the Transition
Services Agreement together with Buyer's process for ensuring an adequate
integration and migration of all applicable IT Systems by the end of the
period presently set forth in the Transition Services Agreement. In connection
with the preparation of such plan, Sellers shall identify those services that
Sellers can or cannot provide (which shall not be less than those in the
current Transition Services Agreement and related term sheets, provided that
all the relevant interdependencies in connection therewith are maintained) and
the conditions required for Seller to provide such services (including the
systems and information that must be supplied by Buyer, the schedule therefor,
required Third Party service providers and the costs that are to be paid by
Buyer, which shall be at Seller's actual cost). The Parties agree and
acknowledge that the Transition Services Agreement sets forth the underlying
baseline of services and establishes the related inter-dependencies among the
software applications and transition services bundles identified therein and
all services shall be offered at Sellers' actual costs. Although Buyer may
seek to exclude or restructure certain of such software applications and
transition services bundles, the ability of Sellers to accept such exclusions
and restructuring is limited by the requirement that the proper applications
remain in place for ensuring proper functionality, interface and data flow integrity with respect to the
transition services that are to be provided. Consequently, the cost of
delivering and supporting revised transition services may not necessarily
decrease from the cost of delivering existing bundles. Sellers shall have the
right to reject Buyer's request for service modifications based both on the
foregoing such requirements and if the resulting schedule to comply with
Buyer's requests would likely delay the Closing Date given that the Transition
Services Agreement is premised on the objective of achieving the Closing
within ninety (90) days of the Execution Date.

Section 7.12 Title Policies and Surveys. The Buyer, at its sole cost and
expense, may procure owner's title insurance commitments and title insurance
policies (the "Title Policies") from Lawyers Title Company with respect to the
Owned Real Property and/or the Leased Real Property insuring title subject
only to the Permitted Encumbrances and such other general title exceptions as
may be raised by Lawyers Title Company; provided, that Buyer's ability or
inability to obtain title insurance from Lawyers Title Company on such Owned
Real Property or such Leased Real Property shall not result in an adjustment
to the Purchase Price. If Buyer requests extended coverage policies or any
endorsements to the Title Policies, Buyer shall also be responsible for the
cost of such extended coverage and endorsements and the delivery of any
documentation required by the title company in connection with the issuance of
such extended coverage and endorsements (including surveys and/or zoning
reports), however, Sellers shall deliver the documentation required by the
title company in connection therewith as described below in this Section 7.12.
At Buyer's request, the Sellers and their Affiliates shall cooperate with and
assist Buyer with any reasonable request in Buyer's efforts to obtain such
Title Policies and shall execute and deliver to Lawyers Title Company (i) such
affidavits, certificates and other documentation as are customary and
reasonably requested to cause Lawyers Title Company to issue CLTA Standard
title insurance policies for the Owned Real Property and/or the Leased Real
Property, provided that no such cooperation or assistance and nothing in such
affidavits, certificates or documentation shall require the Sellers or their
Affiliates to incur any Liabilities or obligations to any Person that are not
otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, and (ii) the owner's
affidavits, gap undertakings and, if required by Lawyers Title Company, real
estate tax indemnity agreements, in the forms attached hereto as Exhibit S. In
no event shall Sellers be obligated to seek estoppel certificates in
connection with any of the Fuel Retail Leased Real Properties, the Carson
Logistics and Marketing Terminals Pipeline Systems or the Carson Logistics and
Marketing Terminals Pipeline Systems ROWs. Prior to Closing, the Buyer may, at
its sole cost and expense, obtain and update any surveys pertaining to the
Owned Real Property or the Leased Real Property; provided, however, that any
such surveys and survey updates shall be performed by Dulin and Boynton or
another surveyor acceptable to the Sellers, the approval of which shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

Section 7.13 Natural Hazard Disclosure Statements. As used herein, the term
"Natural Hazard Area" shall mean those areas identified as natural hazard
areas or natural hazards in the Natural Hazard Disclosure Act, California
Governance Code Sections 8589.3, 8589.4 and 51183.5, and California Public
Resources Code Sections 2621.9, 2694 and 4136, and any successor statutes or
laws (the "Act"). Prior to the Execution Date, Sellers have made available to
Buyer Natural Hazard Disclosure Statements (the "Disclosure Statement") for
each Real Property Interest in a form and to the extent required by the Act
and including various other disclosures as required by applicable Laws. The
Buyer acknowledges that the Sellers have retained the services of Fidelity
National Disclosure Source, LLC (doing business as Disclosure Source) to
examine the maps and other information made available to the public by
governmental agencies for the purpose of enabling the Sellers to fulfill their
disclosure obligations with respect to the Act. The Buyer acknowledges that

11.1.1 On or within five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
representatives of Sellers and Buyer shall cause to be taken a measurement to
determine the Hydrocarbon Inventory as of the Effective Time and shall cause a

Hydrocarbon Inventory Value") to be undertaken and calculated pursuant to the
procedures set forth in Schedule 2.1.6.

11.1.2 On or within five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
representatives of Sellers and Buyer shall cause a physical verification to be

shall cause a valuation to be undertaken and calculated pursuant to the

Inventory as of the Effective Time (the "Closing Non-Hydrocarbon Inventory
Value"). 11.1.3 Following the Closing Date, the Sellers shall prepare a calculation of
the Accounts Amount pursuant to the procedures set forth in Schedule 11.1.3.

11.1.4 Following the Closing Date, and as a condition to Sellers' obligation
to prepare and deliver the Closing Statement to Buyer pursuant to Section
11.2, the Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Sellers a calculation that
shows the difference, either positive or negative, between the Estimated
Watson Cogen Company Distribution and the actual amount of the distribution
provided to Carson Cogen Company and Products Cogeneration Company by the
Watson Cogen Company in connection therewith (the "Closing Watson Cogen
Company Distribution").

Section 11.2 Closing Statement. On or within ninety (90) days following the
Closing Date, the Sellers shall deliver to the Buyer a closing statement (the
"Closing Statement") which will set forth the following adjustments to the
Closing Payment (each, a "Closing Payment Adjustment Amount"):

11.2.1 the Closing Hydrocarbon Inventory Value;

11.2.2 the Closing Non-Hydrocarbon Inventory Value;

11.2.3 the Accounts Amount (other than those amounts for Taxes not known at
the time of the Closing Statement as further described in and pursuant to
Section 17.2.3);

11.2.4 the Closing Watson Cogen Company Distribution; and

11.2.5 the Closing Statement BFO Reduction Amount.

Section 11.3 Closing Statement Policies and Procedures. The Closing Payment
Adjustment Amounts and the balances included in the Closing Statement shall be
prepared applying policies and procedures in the following order of priority:

11.3.1 in accordance with the specific policies set forth in Schedule 11.3.1;

11.3.2 subject to Section 11.3.1, on the same basis of preparation as that
used for, and in accordance with, the same accounting principles, policies,
treatments, estimation techniques, classifications, categorizations and
practices (including in relation to the exercise of accounting discretion and
judgment) as were applied in the preparation of the Accounts Amount subject to
such accounting principles, policies, treatments, estimation techniques,
classifications, categorizations and practices (including in relation to the
exercise of accounting discretion and judgment) being in accordance with US
GAAP; and

11.3.3 subject to Sections 11.3.1 and 11.3.2, in accordance with US GAAP.

Section 11.4 Resolution of Disputes with respect to the Closing Statement.

11.4.1 If the Buyer fails to object to any portion of the Closing Hydrocarbon
Inventory Value, Closing Non-Hydrocarbon Inventory Value, Accounts Amount or
Closing Statement BFO Reduction Amount, or if Sellers fail to object to any
portion of the Closing Watson Cogen Company Distribution delivered to the
Sellers by the Buyer pursuant to Section 11.1.4, within sixty (60) days
following the Buyer's receipt of the Closing Statement from the Sellers or the
Sellers' receipt of the Closing Watson Cogen Company Distribution from the
Buyer, then such portion of the applicable Closing Payment Adjustment Amounts or Closing Watson Cogen Company
Distribution not objected to shall be final and binding upon the Sellers and
the Buyer.

11.4.2 If the Buyer disagrees with any portion of the Closing Payment
Adjustment Amounts reflected on the Closing Statement, or if the Sellers
disagree with any portion of the Closing Watson Cogen Company Distribution,
then such disagreeing Party must notify the other Party in writing of such
disagreement within sixty (60) days following such disagreeing Party's receipt
of the Closing Statement or Closing Watson Cogen Company Distribution by
setting forth such disagreeing Party's calculation of the disputed portion of
such Closing Payment Adjustment Amount or Closing Watson Cogen Company
Distribution (the "Disputed Closing Adjustment Amounts"), and describing the
basis for such disagreement (such notification, an "Objection Notice"). If an
Objection Notice is timely delivered to a Party, then the Buyer and the
Sellers shall negotiate in good faith to resolve their disagreements with
respect to any Disputed Closing Adjustment Amounts. In the event that the
Buyer and the Sellers are unable to resolve all such disagreements within
thirty (30) days after a Party's receipt of any such Objection Notice, either
the Buyer or the Sellers may at any time thereafter submit such remaining
disagreements to the Independent Accountants.

11.4.3 The Buyer and the Sellers shall use Reasonable Efforts to cause the
Independent Accountants, once appointed, to resolve all remaining
disagreements with respect to Disputed Closing Adjustment Amounts as soon as
practicable, but in any event shall direct the Independent Accountants to
render a determination within thirty (30) days after retention of the
Independent Accountants. The Independent Accountants shall consider only those
remaining disagreements with respect to Disputed Closing Adjustment Amounts to
which the Buyer and the Sellers have been unable to agree. In resolving any
disputed item, the Independent Accountants may not assign a value to any item
greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either Party or less
than the smallest value for such item claimed by either Party. The Independent
Accountants' determination of the Disputed Closing Adjustment Amount shall be
based solely on written materials submitted by the Buyer and the Sellers
(i.e., not on independent review) and on the definitions and the calculation
methodologies set forth in this Agreement. The determination of the
Independent Accountants shall be conclusive and binding upon the Parties and
shall not be subject to appeal or further review in the absence of fraud or
manifest error.

11.4.4 The costs and expenses of the Independent Accountants in determining
any Disputed Closing Adjustment Amount shall be borne by the Buyer, on the one
hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, based upon the percentage which the
portion of the contested amount not awarded to each Party bears to the amount
actually contested by such Party. For example, if the Buyer claims the
Accounts Amount is $1,000 less than the amount determined by the Sellers, and
the Sellers contest only $500 of the amount claimed by the Buyer, and if the
Independent Accountants ultimately resolve the dispute by awarding the Buyer
$300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and expenses of the Independent
Accountants will be allocated 60% (i.e., 300 ÷ 500) to the Sellers and 40%
(i.e., 200 ÷ 500) to the Buyer. In connection with their determination of any
Disputed Closing Adjustment Amount, the Independent Accountants shall,
pursuant to the terms of this Section 11.4.4, also determine the allocation of
its fees and expenses between the Buyer and the Sellers, which such
determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Parties and shall not
be subject to appeal or further review.

Section 11.5 Payment.

11.5.1 Within five (5) Business Days after any final Closing Payment
Adjustment Amount is determined by mutual agreement of the Buyer and the
Sellers or pursuant to the procedures in Section 11.3, the Buyer or the
Sellers (as applicable) shall make a payment to the other Party, with respect
to such final Closing Payment Adjustment Amount, in accordance with the
following payment instructions: 11.5.1.1 With respect to the Closing Hydrocarbon Inventory Value, the Buyer
shall pay to the Sellers the amount by which the final Closing Hydrocarbon
Inventory Value exceeds the Estimated Hydrocarbon Inventory Value or the
Sellers shall pay to the Buyer the amount by which the Estimated Hydrocarbon
Inventory Value exceeds the final Closing Hydrocarbon Inventory Value;

11.5.1.2 With respect to the Closing Non-Hydrocarbon Inventory Value, the
Buyer shall pay to the Sellers the amount by which the final Closing Non-
Hydrocarbon Inventory Value exceeds the Estimated Non-Hydrocarbon Inventory
Value or the Sellers shall pay to the Buyer the amount by which the Estimated
Non-Hydrocarbon Inventory Value exceeds the final Closing Non-Hydrocarbon
Inventory Value;

11.5.1.3 With respect to the Accounts Amount, the Buyer shall pay to the
Sellers the amount by which the Accounts Amount exceeds the Estimated Accounts
Amount or the Sellers shall pay to the Buyer the amount by which the Estimated
Accounts Amount exceeds the Accounts Amount; and

11.5.1.4 With respect to the Closing Watson Cogen Company Distribution, the
Buyer shall pay to the Sellers the amount by which the final Closing Watson
Cogen Company Distribution exceeds the Estimated Closing Watson Cogen Company
Distribution or the Sellers shall pay to the Buyer the amount by which the
Estimated Closing Watson Cogen Company Distribution exceeds the final Closing
Watson Cogen Company Additional Distribution;

11.5.1.5 provided, however, that, if more than one final Closing Payment
Adjustment Amount is concurrently determined by mutual agreement of the Buyer
and the Sellers or pursuant to the procedures in Section 11.3, then the Buyer
or the Sellers (as applicable) shall make one net payment to the other Party
with respect to all such final Closing Payment Adjustment Amounts in
accordance with the preceding payment instructions.

11.5.2 The amounts paid by the Buyer or by the Sellers pursuant to this
Section 11.5 shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
such account or accounts of the Sellers (as may be designated by the Sellers)
or of the Buyer (as may be designated by the Buyer), as the case may be. The
amounts paid by the Buyer or by the Sellers pursuant to this Section 11.5
shall bear interest from and including the Closing Date to, but excluding, the
date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the Interest Rate. Such interest
shall be payable at the same time as the payment to which it relates and shall
be calculated on the basis of a year of three hundred sixty-five (365) days
and the actual number of days for which it is due.

Section 11.6 Access. In connection with the preparation and review of the
Closing Statement and Closing Payment Adjustment Amounts, each of the Parties
shall permit the other Party and its Representatives to have reasonable access
during normal business hours and upon prior notice to such Party's (a) books
and records pertaining to or necessary for the preparation and review of the
Closing Statement or the Closing Payment Adjustment Amounts and provide such
other Party with copies thereof, and (b) employees and accountants involved in
preparation of the Closing Statement (including the Closing Watson Cogen
Company Distribution), in each case, as reasonably requested by such other
Party.

Section 11.7 Fuel Retail Supply Contracts.

11.7.1 At any time that BPWCP offers to sell a BFO Fuel Retail Site to an
Operator Franchisee pursuant to Section 6.1, BPWCP may, if it elects to do so
in its sole discretion, also (i) offer to enter into a gasoline supply
agreement with the Operator Franchisee in BPWCP's standard form for a term of
ten (10) years or more; or (ii) offer to enter into a gasoline supply
agreement with the Operator Franchisee in BPWCP's standard form for a term of twenty (20) years if the
Operator Franchisee also enters into a ampm mini market agreement with BPWCP
in BPWCP's standard form for a term of twenty (20) years. If the Operator
Franchisee elects to enter into such a gasoline supply agreement with BPWCP,
and BPWCP assigns such gasoline supply agreement (and ampm mini market
agreement if applicable) to Buyer, then such BFO Fuel Retail Site shall be
excluded from the calculations in Section 11.7.2.

11.7.2 Any positive difference between (i) the total appraised value for all
BFO Fuel Retail Sites (other than those in Section 11.7.1) sold to an Operator
Franchisee prior to delivery of the Closing Statement (less the total value of
all Operator Franchisee owned equipment that was included in all such
appraisals) as determined by the appraisals from Herron and Company commissioned
by BPWCP multiplied by ninety-two and a half percent (92.5%) and (ii) the
total amount received (or to be received) by BPWCP for all BFO Fuel Retail
Sites (other than those in Section 11.7.1) sold to an Operator Franchisee
prior to delivery of the Closing Statement shall be paid by BPWCP to Buyer at
the same time as any other adjustments are settled between the Parties
pursuant to Section 11.5. After delivery of the Closing Statement, any
positive difference between (i) the appraised value for any particular BFO
Fuel Retail Site (other than those in Section 11.7.1) sold to an Operator
Franchisee after delivery of the Closing Statement (less the total value of
the Operator Franchisee owned equipment that was included in such appraisal)
as determined by the appraisals from Herron and Company commissioned by BPWCP
multiplied by ninety-two and a half percent (92.5%) and (ii) the total amount
received by BPWCP for the particular BFO Fuel Retail Site (other than those in
Section 11.7.1) sold to an Operator Franchisee after the delivery of the
Closing Statement shall be paid by BPWCP to Buyer within thirty (30) days
after the closing of the sale of the particular BFO Fuel Retail Site to the
Operator Franchisee and BPWCP\'s receipt of all amounts in respect thereof.
For the avoidance of doubt, BPWCP may elect in its sole discretion to sell a
BFO Fuel Retail Site to an Operator Franchisee at a price less than the
appraised value for the particular BFO Fuel Retail Site as determined by the
appraisals from Herron and Company commissioned by BPWCP.

to Buyer at Closing so that they may be reasonably retrievable and not to
destroy or dispose of any portion thereof for a period of five (5) years from

files, documents, instruments, papers, plans, drawings, manuals, books and
records in response thereto that are reasonably necessary for the operation of
the Purchased Assets and the Business in the manner in which they are
currently being operated but that are not "Books and Records" solely because
they do not exclusively relate to the Purchased Assets and the Business;
provided, however, that Sellers shall first be entitled to redact from all
such files, documents, instruments, papers, plans, drawings, manuals, books
and records any information which does not exclusively relate to the Purchased
Assets and the Business; and provided, further, that Sellers shall have no
obligation under this Section to deliver any Sellers' Standards which are

the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement or the Technology Agreement, or (c) to be
made available to the Buyer pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement
(collectively, "Seller Confidential Data") from the computers or storage
devices that are Included IT Equipment and to reformat the hard drives or
memory disks associated with such computers or storage devices (provided that
such reformatting shall not prevent or inhibit Buyer's access to or use of the
Books and Records that are to be delivered to the Buyer), (ii) the Buyer shall
cause each of the Sellers' employees hired by the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates to review his/her computer or other storage devices to identify and
move all Seller Confidential Data to a specified directory on a Seller-owned
server, and (iii) the Buyer shall obtain for the Sellers from each such
employee hired by the Buyer or its Affiliate a signed statement in which such

Adverse Effect on Buyer's operation of the Business following the Effective

and used in the conduct of the Business certain Excluded Intellectual
Property, including documents defining and describing the Sellers' standards,
processes, procedures, practices and policies related to Sellers' Operating

with respect to the conduct of the Business (collectively, the "Sellers'
Standards").

Intellectual Property, Sellers hereby grant Buyer a nonexclusive, paid-up,
perpetual and irrevocable right and license to continue to use, and to make
copies of (in hardcopy or electronic form), those Sellers' Standards which the
Business has in its possession at Closing; provided, that (i) nothing herein
shall be deemed to imply that Buyer has any right or interest in or access to
any IT Systems used or created by Sellers or their Affiliates in connection
with the Sellers' Standards and (ii) Buyer will have no right or license to
use or make copies of (in hardcopy or electronic form) the Sellers' Standards
to the extent not relating exclusively to the Business.

12.5.3 The Sellers' Standards, and all portions thereof, shall be used solely
for the purpose of operating the Business and shall not be used in connection
with operating or conducting any other business.

12.5.4 Sellers make no representations or warranties, express or implied, and

matters for which the Sellers shall be responsible under this Agreement,
including any corrective or remedial actions relating to any Retained
Liabilities. In the event of and as a condition to a subsequent sale, lease or
other transfer of the Business and/or other Purchased Assets, the Buyer shall
require that the Buyer's transferee agree (in a form satisfactory to the
Sellers) to the access provisions of this Section 12.6. Buyer shall not
interfere with Sellers' right of entry or actions taken pursuant thereto, and
shall cooperate with Sellers in obtaining any permits, consents or approvals
necessary for Sellers' actions taken with respect to the Purchased Assets.

12.6.2 In connection with the exercise of rights of their access to and entry
upon the Purchased Assets or pursuant to Section 12.6.1, and except as

hundred eighty (180) days after the Effective Time, the Buyer will stop using
the BP Marks in any form in the operation of the Business, including by

that appear on any Purchased Asset or Assumed Liabilities, including all
signage, storage containers, uniforms and clothing, promotional or advertising
literature, stationery, purchase order forms, office forms and labels,
packaging, manuals, policy books, reference materials and other such documents
(including signs displaying the Sellers' or their Affiliates' emergency
contact telephone numbers or otherwise using or displaying the BP Marks or the
phrase "BP" or "British Petroleum" in whole or in part) and Buyer, within such
time period, will replace all signs located at the applicable Carson Logistics
and Marketing Terminals Owned Real Property or the Carson Logistics and
Marketing Terminals Pipeline Systems, including at river crossings, which
identify Sellers, terminals or pipelines of Sellers, or any Affiliate of
Sellers as the operator of such Carson Logistics and Marketing Terminals Owned
Real Property or Carson Logistics and Marketing Terminals Pipeline Systems. As
promptly as practical after the Effective Time, the Buyer shall post the
Buyer's emergency contact telephone numbers in place of any of the Sellers' or
their Affiliates' emergency contact telephone numbers. Without limiting the
foregoing restrictions, until such time as the BP Marks are removed or covered
by the Buyer, in no event will the Buyer use or display the BP Marks in any
way other than in the same manner used by the Business immediately prior to
the Effective Time. During any period that the Buyer is using the BP Marks as
provided in this Section 12.7, Buyer shall use Reasonable Efforts to inform
customers, suppliers and contractors that it is not part of BP and is using
the BP Marks with permission solely to facilitate the transition of the
Business. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Buyer shall have no
right to create any new materials to be used in the operation of the Business

accounting principles and practices consistent with those currently used by
the Business for purposes of reporting similar information to the Sellers,
including financial statements for the fiscal quarter in which Closing occurs
and calendar year-to-date, as may be reasonably requested during the period
from Closing until thirty (30) days after the end of the fiscal quarter in
which the Closing occurs, in connection with the preparation of such
consolidated financial statements. Unless in violation of Law, after the
Effective Time, the Buyer upon reasonable request of the Sellers (and at no
cost to Sellers), will provide the Sellers with access to those of the
Transferred Employees listed on Schedule 12.8 who were previously involved in
the preparation of financial statements and will cause such Transferred
Employees to cooperate with and assist the Sellers in the preparation of the
Sellers' financial statements.

Section 12.9 Sellers' Right of Entry for Remedial Work not performed by Buyer.
From and after the Effective Time, should Buyer default in any obligation to
complete any Remedial Work on the Purchased Assets for any Hazardous
Substances, and if, as a consequence, a Governmental Authority or third party
shall notify Sellers that Sellers must undertake any Remedial Work for any
Hazardous Substances, Sellers shall notify Buyer of same, Buyer shall promptly
undertake same, and Buyer shall immediately notify the relevant Governmental Authority or third
party that Buyer shall respond to such notice in the place of Sellers.
However, if Sellers are legally compelled to undertake or pursue Remedial Work
for any Hazardous Substances or threatens to impose penalties or other adverse
consequences (including damages, litigation, indemnification obligations,
attorneys' fees, etc.) on Sellers, then (A) Sellers shall have the right and
authority, but not the obligation, to access and enter upon the Purchased
Assets where the Remedial Work is to be performed and to conduct such
activities at Buyer's sole expense and without trespass, and (B) Buyer shall
provide to Sellers (or cause third parties to provide to Sellers) a limited
license, access agreement or easement agreement allowing Sellers to have
access to property owned by third parties where the Remedial Work is to be
performed, and Sellers shall have the right but not the obligation, to conduct
such activities at Buyer's sole expense and without trespass. Sellers' access
to and entry thereon shall not be deemed either an admission of liability for
any Hazardous Substances or a waiver of any reimbursement rights. While on the
relevant Real Property Interests where the Remedial Work is to be performed,
Sellers shall have the right to install, maintain, operate, store, use and
remove equipment, including monitoring wells, recovery wells and other
assessment or remediation equipment, to remove, remediate, store and test
soils and groundwater therefrom and thereon and to otherwise take all actions
required to comply with the Environmental Law. Sellers shall exercise their
right of entry onto the relevant Real Property Interests where the Remedial
Work is to be performed in a manner which does not unreasonably interfere with
Buyer's use of the relevant Real Property Interests where the Remedial Work is
to be performed and Sellers shall provide Buyer, within thirty (30) days of
its written request, copies of all correspondence between Sellers and a
Governmental Authority or third party regarding Sellers' activities on the
relevant Real Property Interests where the Remedial Work is to be performed.
In the event of and as a condition to a subsequent sale, lease or other
transfer of the Business and/or other Purchased Assets, the Buyer shall
require that the Buyer's transferee agree (in a form satisfactory to the
Sellers) to the access provisions of this Section 12.9. Buyer shall not
interfere with Sellers' right of entry or actions taken pursuant thereto, and
shall cooperate with Sellers in obtaining any permits, consents or approvals
necessary for Sellers' actions taken with respect to the Property. In
connection with the exercise of rights of their access to and entry upon the
Purchased Assets or pursuant to this Section 12.9 and except as otherwise may
be provided in any of the Other Agreements, Sellers bear the risk of injury to
any of its employees, advisors or representatives who are provided access to
the Purchased Assets and shall indemnify, defend and hold the Buyer and its
Affiliates harmless for any and all Losses resulting from Sellers' acts and
omissions while upon the Purchased Assets.

Purchased Assets, the Transferred Employees and the Business under any and all
insurance policies (including property/casualty and workers' compensation
policies) maintained immediately prior to the Closing by the Sellers or any of
their Affiliates (collectively, the "Seller Insurance Policies"), (ii) none of
the Purchased Assets, the Transferred Employees and the Business will be
covered under the Seller Insurance Policies, and (iii) the Buyer shall become

policies with respect to the Purchased Assets, the Transferred Employees and
the Business, which Buyer may in its sole discretion choose to obtain.

Section 12.11 Litigation Cooperation. 12.11.1 In connection with the defense or prosecution of any suit, action or
proceeding (including any investigation or similar activity by a Governmental
Authority) relating to any Purchased Assets, Assumed Liabilities, Excluded
Assets or Retained Liabilities (but subject to the provisions of Section 15.1
and Section 15.3 in the event indemnification is being sought thereunder
pursuant to any applicable provision of this Agreement) each Party shall (i)
cooperate, and cause its respective Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense or
prosecution of such suit, action or proceeding, (ii) furnish or cause to be
furnished such documents, records, information and testimony, grant or cause
to be granted access to all reasonably requested witnesses, and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, in each case
as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith, and (iii) take all
reasonable steps to make available to the other Party, upon written request,
its former and current employees, other personnel and agents (whether as
witnesses or otherwise) to the extent that such Persons may reasonably be
required in connection therewith. The Party requesting assistance shall
reimburse the other Party for its reasonable costs and expenses in providing
such assistance.

12.11.2 For a period of five (5) years from the Closing Date or such longer
time as may be required by applicable Law, neither the Sellers nor the Buyer
will (and each of Sellers and the Buyer shall cause its respective Affiliates
not to) destroy or dispose of any Legal Hold Documents or any documents,
records or information that a Party may have the right to obtain pursuant to
this Section 12.11 without first notifying the other Party of the proposed
destruction or disposition and giving the other Party the opportunity to take
possession of or copy such documents, records or information prior to such
destruction or disposition.

Section 12.12 National Multi-Site Contracts. The Sellers are parties to
certain contracts and related work releases, purchase commitments or other
similar commitments to which the Sellers and their Affiliates are parties, and
which pertain to various other refineries, facilities and other assets owned
by the Sellers and their Affiliates in addition to the Purchased Assets (each,
a "National Multi-Site Contract" and collectively, the "National Multi-Site
Contracts").

12.12.1 Subject to the provisions of Section 12.12.3, Buyer acknowledges and
agrees that the Buyer shall not be entitled to become a party thereto after
the Effective Time, except and solely to the extent that it is in connection
with any work releases, purchase commitments or other similar commitments that
are exclusively related to the Business or the Purchased Assets and which are
assigned to Buyer hereunder. In connection with the foregoing, Buyer shall be
obligated to honor any work releases, purchase commitments or other similar
commitments made by the Sellers under any National Multi-Site Contracts prior
to the Effective Time, but not yet fully performed or satisfied as of the
Effective Time, so long as such commitments were not made in violation of
Sellers' obligations under Section 7.5.

12.12.2 Buyer acknowledges that the terms and conditions of the National
Multi-Site Contracts (including rate sheets, price lists, and other commercial
terms) are proprietary and confidential information of Sellers subject to the
provisions of this Agreement relating to confidentiality, and the Buyer shall
destroy any such information it may inadvertently obtain, and shall not use
such information for any purpose other than as may be necessary for the Buyer
to honor any pending work release or other commitment thereunder in accordance
with the foregoing provisions of this Section 12.12, and will use all
Reasonable Efforts to segregate such terms and conditions, especially the
prices, rate sheets and price lists, from Buyer's employees or agents who have
responsibility to negotiate agreements with the other party to the National
Multi-site Contract.

12.12.3 Subject to any and all restrictions or prohibitions on assignment or
assumption, Buyer may, at its option, seek to obtain assignment and assumption
of any of the National Multi-Site Contracts that it selects in its sole
discretion, but only with respect to that portion of such National Multi- Site Contracts that relates to the Purchased Assets or the Business. In the
event that Buyer exercises its option to assume any such portion of a National
Multi-Site Contract, Sellers shall use Reasonable Efforts to assist Buyer to
either (i) obtain a partial assignment of such National Multi-Site Contract,
or (ii) enter into a new Contract with the applicable counterparty; provided
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that any
such partial assignments or new Contracts may not in fact be consummated. The
Technology Agreement provides a methodology for apportioning National Multi-
Site Contracts that are Third Party Licenses.

Section 12.13 Post-Closing Operations. The Buyer acknowledges that it is an
experienced and knowledgeable owner and operator of facilities and assets
similar to the Business and will be responsible for and will rely on its own
expertise and resources in conducting the Business from and after the Closing.

the Buyer merges or consolidates with or into any of its Affiliates or
dissolves, liquidates, sells, assigns, transfers or otherwise disposes of any
material portion of the assets owned by Buyer, directly or indirectly, to any
Affiliate, then such Affiliate shall be deemed to have assumed all of Buyer's
obligations under this Agreement, and shall be jointly and severally liable
with Buyer and directly liable to Sellers hereunder with respect to same, from
and after the date of such merger, consolidation, sale, assignment, transfer
or disposition. The provisions of this Section do not apply to transfers or
dispositions of any of the Carson Logistics and Marketing Terminals Assets to
or from Tesoro Logistics LP, a Delaware master limited partnership ("TLLP"),
its general partner or any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries.

Section 12.15 Environmental Control Bonds.

12.15.1 The environmental facilities listed on Schedule 12.15.1(a) (the
"Environmental Facilities") which are included in the Purchased Assets, were
constructed and equipped with the proceeds from the sale of the tax exempt
bonds listed on Schedule 12.15.1(b) (collectively, the "Environmental Control
Bonds"). Liabilities pursuant to the Environmental Control Bonds shall be
retained by the Sellers or their Affiliates, except to the extent such
Liabilities result from the Buyer's failure to comply with its obligations
under this Section 12.15. The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Sellers and
their Affiliates reserve the right, in Sellers' or their relevant Affiliates'
sole discretion, to retire, at any time, any or all of the Environmental
Control Bonds. The Buyer hereby covenants and agrees that from and after the
Effective Time, for any period that the Buyer continues to operate or have
operated on its behalf, the Environmental Facilities until the earlier of (a)
redemption, cancellation, or retirement of the applicable Environmental
Control Bonds or (b) December 31, 2014, the Buyer shall (i) use the
Environmental Facilities in a manner so as to continue the tax-exempt status
of the Environmental Control Bonds in accordance with Section 103(b) of the
Code and in full compliance with the use requirements set forth in the
applicable agreements and tax certifications relating to the Environmental
Control Bonds, and (ii) comply with all applicable agreements securing the
Environmental Control Bonds relating to the operation, maintenance, insurance,
use, removal of Encumbrances, payment of Taxes and keeping of records with
respect to the Environmental Facilities; provided, however, the foregoing
shall not prevent the Buyer from operating the Purchased Assets, the Business
and the Environmental Facilities in substantially the same manner as being
conducted by the Sellers and their Affiliates as of the Effective Time. The
Buyer agrees to cause the provisions of this Section 12.15 to be binding upon
(i) any successors or assigns of the Buyer, (ii) any transferee of all or any
portion of the Environmental Facilities, and (iii) any grantee of rights of
use and/or operation thereof. If the Buyer is notified at any time prior to
January 1, 2018 by Sellers that the Environmental Control Bonds have been
selected for audit by the Internal Revenue Service, then the Buyer shall use
Reasonable Efforts to provide, at Sellers' expense, to Sellers such
information in the possession of and reasonably available to the Buyer or its
Affiliates or other Representatives with respect to the Environmental Facilities in order
that Sellers may timely and adequately respond to any questions posed to it by
the Internal Revenue Service.

12.15.2 The Buyer acknowledges that certain requirements set forth in the
Environmental Control Bond documents must be complied with by the owner or
operator of the Environmental Facilities as long as the Environmental Control
Bonds are outstanding. In order to assist the Sellers, or any Person directed
on the Sellers' behalf, in the ongoing compliance with such requirements, the
Buyer hereby agrees to: (i) provide access to representatives of the Sellers,
or any Party directed on the Sellers' behalf, to the Environmental Facilities,
for the purposes of observing the continuing use, operation and condition of
the Environmental Facilities; (ii) provide any information about the
continuing use, operation, condition and remaining economic life of the
Environmental Facilities that the Sellers may reasonably periodically request
prior to January 1, 2018; (iii) notify the Sellers at least thirty (30) days
in advance of any change in the use, operation or ownership of the
Environmental Facilities; and (iv) provide an annual written certification by
an authorized officer of the Buyer in a form acceptable to the Sellers
certifying the status of the qualified use of the Environmental Facilities.

14.1.3.1 All of the Assigned Contracts are valid and binding agreements of

failure to be valid, binding and in full force and effect would not have a
Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in Schedule 14.1.3.1, each Seller
has performed all material obligations required to be performed by it to date
under those Assigned Contracts that each entail a remaining contractual
obligation or liability in excess of four million dollars ($4,000,000) from

party to any such Assigned Contract that entails a remaining contractual
obligation or liability in excess of four million dollars ($4,000,000) from
and after the Effective Time is in Default thereunder and no event or
circumstance has occurred that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute any event of Default thereunder that, in either case, would have a
Material Adverse Effect. As of the Effective Time, each Assigned Contract that
is between the Sellers (or any Seller) on the one hand, and an Affiliate of Sellers, on
the other hand, which will survive the Closing and be transferred to Buyer
hereunder (i) has been entered into in the Ordinary Course of Business and
pursuant to an arm's length negotiation or (ii) may be terminated by Buyer
upon ninety (90) days or less notice without payment penalty.

14.1.3.2 Schedule 14.1.3.2 contains a true and complete listing of the
following Assigned Contracts to which the Watson Cogen Company is a party (the
"Watson Cogen Company Contracts") or to which any Seller is a party (provided,
that for purposes of this Section 14.1.3.2 the definition of Assigned Fuel
Retail Contracts for purposes of defining the Assigned Contracts shall include
only the Jobber Agreements and the Included Fuel Retail Assigned Contracts):

through (c) above, each Assigned Contract involving remaining aggregate
payments in excess of four million dollars ($4,000,000) from and after the
Effective Time between the Sellers or any Affiliate of the Sellers (other than
the Watson Cogen Company) on the one hand, and the Watson Cogen Company, on
the other hand, which will survive the Closing and which cannot be cancelled
by the Watson Cogen Company upon sixty (60) days or less notice without
payment penalty;

(e) except for Assigned Contracts of the nature described in clauses (a)
through (c) above, each Assigned Contract involving remaining aggregate
payments in excess of four million dollars ($4,000,000) from and after the
Effective Time between the Sellers or any Affiliate of the Sellers (other than
the Watson Cogen Company) on the one hand, and a Seller, on the other hand,
which will survive the Closing and which cannot be cancelled by the Sellers
upon sixty (60) days or less notice without payment penalty;

through (e) above, any Assigned Contract for the purchase of materials,
supplies, goods, services, equipment or other assets that provides for
remaining aggregate payments by any Seller or the Watson Cogen Company of four
million dollars ($4,000,000) or more in any twelve (12) month period from and
after the Effective Time; and

(g) any partnership or joint venture agreement that entails a remaining
contractual obligation or liability in excess of four million dollars
($4,000,000).

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary (i) in the case of
any breach of this Section 14.1.3.2 (and any amendment of Schedules pursuant
to Section 19.12), arising as a result of a failure to include an Assigned
Contract in Schedule 14.1.3.2, the Losses, if any, incurred by the Buyer as a
result of such breach or amendment of Schedules shall be determined by taking
into account not only the obligations and/or liabilities to be incurred by the Buyer as a result of the
assignment of such Assigned Contract but also the goods, services, payments
and other benefits (including obligations and liabilities to be incurred or
assumed by the counterparty to such Assigned Contract) to be received by the
Buyer, (ii) Buyer and Sellers acknowledge and agree that certain of the
Assigned Contracts are not listed in any of the Exhibits and Schedules to the
Agreement because such Contracts (the "Confidential Contracts" herein) have
confidentiality provisions that have not been waived by the applicable
counterparty, and (iii) the failure to list such Confidential Contracts on any
Exhibit or Schedule shall not result in a breach or default of any provision
of this Agreement including Section 14.1.3.2 and the addition of any such
Confidential Contracts to any Exhibit or Schedule after the Execution Date
pursuant to Section 19.12 shall not give rise to any Losses for the Buyer or
require any indemnification of the Buyer under this Agreement so long as such
Confidential Contract was entered into in the Ordinary Course of Business or
would have otherwise satisfied the requirement of the first sentence of
Section 7.5, assuming that such sentence applied to Contracts executed prior
to the Execution Date.

14.1.3.3 All of the Watson Cogen Company Contracts are valid and binding
agreements of the Watson Cogen Company and are in full force and effect,

required to be performed by it to date under the Watson Cogen Company
Contracts, and is not in Default under any obligation of any such Watson Cogen
Company Contracts, except where such failure to perform or Default would not
have a Material Adverse Effect. To the Sellers' Knowledge, no other party to
any such Watson Cogen Company Contract is in Default thereunder and no event
or circumstance has occurred that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute any event of Default thereunder that, in either case, would have a
Material Adverse Effect.

Knowledge, each borrower is current on all payments under its respective
Dealer Loan; (ii) on the Closing Date, all of the Dealer Loans are valid and
binding agreements of the Seller that is party thereto, and are in full force

obligations required to be performed by it to date under the Dealer Loans, and
is not in Default under any obligation of any such Dealer Loans, except where
such failure to perform or Default would not have a Material Adverse Effect;
(iv) to the Sellers' Knowledge, no other party to any such Dealer Loan is in
Default thereunder and no event or circumstance has occurred that, with notice
or lapse of time or both, would constitute any event of Default thereunder
that would, in either case, have a Material Adverse Effect; and (v) the
Sellers have delivered or made available (in the electronic data room or
otherwise) to the Buyer or given the Buyer access to complete and correct
copies of the Line of Credit and Security Agreement, the Promissory Note, all

Section 15.4 Limitations of Liability. Notwithstanding the foregoing or

15.4.1 no Buyer Indemnified Party seeking indemnification under Section 15.2.1

Losses (excluding Losses attributable to the De Minimis Amount) for which the
Sellers would otherwise have an indemnification obligation under this
Agreement exceeds or is equal to twenty-four million dollars ($24,000,000)
(the "Threshold Amount"), whereupon the Buyer Indemnified Party may claim

Amount; 15.4.3 in no event may the Buyer Indemnified Parties recover in the aggregate

Section 15.5 Exclusive Remedy.

15.5.1 Effective as of Closing, the Parties acknowledge and agree that, except
as provided in any of the Other Agreements and any other agreements entered
into among the Parties in connection with the Purchased Assets or the
Business, the indemnification provisions in this Article 15, Article 6,
Article 7, Article 12, Article 17 and Section 19.12 shall be the exclusive
remedies of the Sellers, the Seller Indemnified Parties and their Affiliates,
on the one hand, and the Buyer, the Buyer Indemnified Parties and their
Affiliates, on the other hand, with respect to the purchase and sale of the
Purchased Assets and the Business. From and after the Effective Time except as
provided for in this Agreement, the Other Agreements and any other agreements
entered into among the Parties in connection with the Purchased Assets or the
Business, each Party hereby waives (on its behalf and on behalf of its other
Indemnified Parties) to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Laws,
any and all rights, claims and causes of action they may have against one
another relating to the purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets and the
Business arising under any or based on any applicable Law, including such
rights, claims and causes of action the Parties may have against one another
under breaches of statutory or implied warranties or otherwise, nuisance or
other tort actions, and common law rights of contribution. Each Party agrees
that the previous sentence shall not limit or otherwise affect any nonmonetary
right or remedy which any Party may have under this Agreement or any Other
Agreement or otherwise limit or affect any Party's right to seek equitable
relief, including the remedy of specific performance for nonmonetary relief.
Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, nothing in this
Agreement or any documents, certificates, schedules or exhibits delivered or
attached to this Agreement shall limit any liability for fraud.

15.5.2 All indemnification obligations and Liabilities of the Buyer with
respect to the representations and warranties in Section 14.1.6 and Tax
matters shall be governed by Article 17 and not this Article 15.

Section 15.6 Matters Involving Third Parties.

15.6.1 If a Party receives notice of a Third Party Claim that may give rise to
a right to claim for indemnification against any other Party under Section
6.7, 6.9, 15.2 or 15.3, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the
Indemnifying Party thereof in writing; provided, however, that failure to give
timely notice shall not affect the right to indemnification to the extent such
failure to give timely notice is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party.

15.6.2 The Indemnifying Party, in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 15.7 will have the right to assume and conduct the defense of the
Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party will not
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect
to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party (not to be unreasonably withheld) unless the judgment or proposed
settlement involves only the payment of money damages which shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party and does not impose an injunction or other
equitable relief upon the Indemnified Party. As provided in Section 15.7, the
Indemnifying Party may assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, at the
Indemnifying Party's cost and expense, without also accepting and agreeing to
the claim for indemnification described in the related Claim Notice.

15.6.3 Unless and until the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the
Third Party Claim as provided in Section 15.6.2, the Indemnified Party may
defend against the Third Party Claim in any manner it reasonably may deem
appropriate for the account of the Indemnifying Party.

15.6.4 In no event will the Indemnified Party consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

15.6.5 The Indemnified Party agrees, at its cost and expense, to cooperate
with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any Third Party
Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest, including the making of
any related counterclaim or cross-complaint against any Person (other than a
Buyer Indemnified Party, if the Indemnified Party is a Buyer Indemnified
Party, or a Seller Indemnified Party, if the Indemnified Party is a Seller
Indemnified Party).

15.6.6 The Party that is conducting the defense against the Third Party Claim
shall provide the other Party such information possessed by the Party that is
conducting such defense as such other Party shall reasonably request with
respect to the Third Party Claim and the defense thereof.

Section 15.7 Procedures. The Party seeking indemnification under Article 6,
Section 15.2 or Section 15.3 (the "Indemnified Party") may make claims for
indemnification hereunder by giving written notice (a "Claim Notice") to the
Party required to provide indemnification hereunder (the "Indemnifying
Party"). Such notice shall briefly explain the nature of the claim and the
parties known to be involved, and shall specify the amount thereof to the
extent known by the Indemnified Party. Each Indemnifying Party to which a
Claim Notice is given shall respond to any Indemnified Party that has given a
Claim Notice (a "Claim Response") within thirty (30) days (the "Response
Period") after the date that the Claim Notice is given. Any Claim Notice or
Claim Response shall be given in accordance with the notice requirements
hereunder, and any Claim Response shall specify whether or not the
Indemnifying Party giving the Claim Response disputes the claim for
indemnification described in the Claim Notice and whether it will defend any
Third Party Claim specified in such Claim Notice at its own cost and expense.
If any Indemnifying Party fails to give a Claim Response within the Response
Period, such Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have disputed the claim for
indemnification described in the related Claim Notice and to have elected not
to defend any Third Party Claim specified in such Claim Notice. The aforesaid
election or deemed election by the Indemnifying Party not to assume the
defense of the Indemnified Party with respect to any Third Party Claim
specified in such Claim Notice, however, shall, except as contemplated by the
following proviso, be subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party to
subsequently assume the defense of the Indemnified Party with respect to any
such Third Party Claim at any time prior to settlement or final determination
thereof; provided, that the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to so
assume the defense of the Indemnified Party with respect to any Third Party
Claim which the Indemnifying Party has (or is deemed to have) previously
elected not to defend to the extent that the Indemnified Party would be
materially prejudiced as a result of such assumption.

Section 15.8 Determination of Amount of Losses. The Losses giving rise to any
indemnification obligation hereunder shall be limited to the actual loss
incurred by the Indemnified Party (i.e., reduced by any insurance proceeds or
other payment or recoupment payable to the Indemnified Party as a result of
the events giving rise to the claim for indemnification). Upon the request of
the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall provide the Indemnifying
Party with information sufficient to allow the Indemnifying Party to calculate the amount of the
indemnity payment in accordance with this Section 15.8. An Indemnified Party
shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate damages in respect of any claim
for which it is seeking indemnification and shall use Reasonable Efforts to
avoid any costs or expenses associated with such claim and, if such costs and
expenses cannot be avoided, to minimize the amount thereof.

Section 15.9 Limitation of Damages. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING CONTAINED TO THE
CONTRARY IN ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE
INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS OF EACH PARTY HERETO, AND THE RECOVERY BY ANY
PARTY HERETO OR INDEMNITEE OF ANY COVERED LOSSES SUFFERED OR INCURRED BY IT AS
A RESULT OF ANY BREACH OR NONFULFILLMENT BY A PARTY HERETO OF ANY OF ITS
REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS, AGREEMENTS OR OTHER OBLIGATIONS UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT, SHALL BE LIMITED TO ACTUAL DAMAGES AND SHALL NOT INCLUDE OR
APPLY TO, NOR SHALL ANY PARTY HERETO OR INDEMNITEE BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER, ANY
INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY PUNITIVE, OR OTHER SIMILAR DAMAGES
(INCLUDING ANY DAMAGES ON ACCOUNT OF LOST PROFITS OR OPPORTUNITIES OR BUSINESS
INTERRUPTION OR DIMINUTION IN VALUE) SUFFERED OR INCURRED BY ANY PARTY HERETO
OR INDEMNITEE.

Section 15.10 Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. All indemnification
payments made under this Agreement shall be treated as Purchase Price
adjustments for Tax purposes to the extent permitted under applicable Laws.

ARTICLE 16

CASUALTY OR CONDEMNATION

Section 16.1 Notice. In the event that, prior to the Closing Date, all or any
material portion of the Purchased Assets is damaged or destroyed by fire or
other casualty for which the associated repair or replacement costs could
reasonably be expected to exceed ten million dollars ($10,000,000) (a
"Casualty") or taken by condemnation or eminent domain or by agreement in lieu
thereof with any Person or Governmental Authority authorized to exercise such
rights (a "Taking"), Sellers shall promptly notify Buyer thereof.

Section 16.2 Repair or Replacement.

16.2.1 In the event of a Casualty or Taking between the Execution Date and the
Closing Date affecting the Purchased Assets and Business for which the
associated repair or replacement costs as determined by the Sellers in good
faith could reasonably be expected to be less than one hundred fifty million
dollars ($150,000,000), Sellers shall elect, at their option, to either (i)
repair or replace or make adequate provision for the repair or replacement of
the affected Purchased Asset at Sellers' cost prior to the Closing, in which
case Buyer's obligation to effect the Closing shall not be affected, but the
Closing Date shall be deferred until three (3) Business Days after repairs or
replacement have been completed and the affected Purchased Asset has been
restored to performance substantially comparable in all material respects to
that prior to the Casualty or Taking, and/or (ii) negotiate with Buyer to
reduce the Purchase Price by an amount agreed to by Sellers and Buyer to
reflect the cost to repair or replace the affected Purchased Asset as
determined by Sellers in good faith (collectively, the "Repair Costs"), in
which case, in the event of a Repair Cost Dispute, the Closing Date and the
Termination Date shall be deferred as provided in Section 16.5.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers' election in clause (i) of this Section
16.2.1 shall be unavailable and clause (ii) of this Section 16.2.1 shall apply
if the required repairs or replacements could reasonably be expected to result in an extension of the
Closing Date for more than ninety (90) days.

16.2.2 If Sellers and Buyer agree on the Repair Costs within fifteen (15) days
of Buyer's receipt of Sellers' notice of the Casualty or Taking (the "Repair
Negotiation Period"), Buyer's obligation to effect the Closing shall not be
affected, but the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Repair Costs so
agreed, together with an additional reduction to the Purchase Price as
mutually agreed between the Parties with respect to the reasonably anticipated
post-Closing loss of net income of the Business deriving from the operation of
the Purchased Assets attributable to the Casualty (the "Casualty Post-Closing
Income Adjustment").

16.2.3 If Sellers and Buyer do not agree on the Repair Costs within the Repair
Negotiation Period (a "Repair Cost Dispute"), either Party may request an
engineering company that shall be mutually agreed to by Buyer and Sellers to
evaluate the affected Purchased Assets and deliver to Buyer and Sellers its
written estimate of the Repair Costs (the "Third-Party Estimate") within
thirty (30) days after the appointment of such engineering company.

16.2.3.1 If the Third-Party Estimate is less than one hundred fifty million
dollars ($150,000,000), Buyer's obligation to effect the Closing shall not be
affected and the parties may submit the Repair Cost Dispute to binding
arbitration pursuant to Section 19.10 for final resolution after the Closing,
with a post-Closing adjustment to the Purchase Price equal to the Repair Costs
finally-determined pursuant to such arbitration, together with an additional
reduction to the Purchase Price to reflect the Casualty Post-Closing Income
Adjustment.

16.2.3.2 If the Third-Party Estimate is equal to or greater than one hundred
fifty million dollars ($150,000,000), Buyer may elect, by giving Sellers
written notice of election within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the Third-
Party Estimate, to terminate this Agreement (other than Sections 15.5.1, 15.9,
18.2, 19.1, 19.6, 19.9 and 19.10, which shall continue in effect) without
further obligation to Sellers.

16.2.4 If Sellers and Buyer do not agree on the Casualty Post-Closing Income
Adjustment within the Repair Negotiation Period, either Party may request a
refining industry consultant that shall be mutually agreed to by Buyer and
Sellers to evaluate the reasonably anticipated post-Closing loss of net income
attributable to the Casualty and deliver to Buyer and Sellers its
determination of the amount thereof within thirty (30) days after the
appointment of such refining industry consultant. Either party may submit such
determination to binding arbitration pursuant to Section 19.10 for final
resolution after the Closing, with a post-Closing adjustment to the Purchase
Price equal to the Casualty Post-Closing Income Adjustment finally-determined
pursuant to such arbitration.

Section 16.3 Condemnation Awards. In the event of any reduction in the
Purchase Price in connection with a Taking affecting the Purchased Assets, as
provided in Section 16.2.1, Buyer shall be entitled to collect from any
condemnor the entire award(s) that may be made in any such proceeding, without
deduction, to be paid out as follows: subject to actual receipt of such
award(s) by Buyer, (i) Buyer shall pay to Sellers all such amounts, up to the
amount of such Purchase Price reduction, and (ii) Buyer shall be entitled to
retain the balance (if any) of such award(s).

Section 16.4 Purchase Price Adjustment. Any adjustment of the Purchase Price
which is necessary to reflect a final determination of Repair Costs after the
Closing shall be made as follows: (i) an adjustment in favor of Buyer shall be
paid in cash by Sellers; and (ii) an adjustment in favor of Sellers shall be
paid in cash to the extent the Purchase Price had been reduced pursuant to
this Article 16. Any such reduction, refund or payment shall be made within ten (10) Business
Days after such final determination.

Section 16.5 Deferral of Closing Date and Termination Date. In the event of a
Repair Cost Dispute, the Closing Date and the Termination Date shall be
deferred until (i) three (3) Business Days after receipt of the Third-Party
Estimate, or (ii) if Sellers elect the option in Section 16.2.1(i), as
provided therein.

ARTICLE 17

TAX MATTERS

Section 17.1 Filing of Tax Returns and Allocation of Income, Gain Loss,
Credits and Other Tax Items for Carson Cogen Company and Watson Cogen Company.

17.1.1 Buyer and Sellers hereby agree to allocate and report income, gain,
loss, credits and other Tax items for US federal income purposes and state
income and franchise purposes for Carson Cogen Company and Watson Cogen
Company in the manner set forth in this Section 17.1. Buyer and Sellers agree
further to treat other Taxes as set forth in Section 17.3.

17.1.2 Buyer and Sellers hereby acknowledge that, pursuant to Treasury
Regulation § 1.1502-76(b), the sale of shares of Carson Cogen Company from
Buyer to Sellers will cause the tax year of Carson Cogen Company to end as of
the end of the Closing Date.

17.1.3 Sellers shall include income, gain, loss, credits and other Tax items
from Carson Cogen Company for the period of time through Closing Date within
Sellers' consolidated or unitary US federal and state income tax returns to
the extent applicable. Buyer shall include income, gain, loss, credits and
other Tax items from Carson Cogen Company for the period of time beginning on
the date following the Closing Date and ending on the end of Buyer\'s tax year
of its consolidated or unitary US federal and state income tax returns to the
extent applicable. With respect to the allocation of income, gain, loss,
credits and other Tax items of Carson Cogen Company in the case of
consolidated or unitary US federal and state income or franchise tax returns,
Sellers and Buyer agree to elect to ratably allocate nonextraordinary items
pursuant to Treasury Regulation § 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)(D). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Sellers and Buyer agree to allocate income, gain,
loss, credits and other Tax items derived by Carson Cogen Company with respect
to its interest in Watson Cogen Company on the basis of a ratable allocation
pursuant to Treasury Regulation § 1.706-1(c)(2)(ii). Sellers and Buyer agree
to allocate nonextraordinary items, including nonextraordinary items reported
on Schedule K-1 of IRS Form 1065 of Watson Cogen Company for tax year ended
December 31 of the calendar year during which the Effective Time occurs, on
the basis of the relative number of days that Sellers and Buyer owned Carson
Cogen Company during the tax year ended December 31 of the calendar year
during which the Effective Time occurs. The denominator of such allocation
ratio shall be based upon the total number of days in the calendar year that
includes the Closing Date. Sellers shall include within the numerator of its
allocation ratio the number of days up to and including the Closing Date.
Sellers and Buyer agree exchange information necessary to complete the
statement required by Treasury Regulation § 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)(D)(1) and the
agreement required by Treasury Regulation § 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)(D)(2) by May
31 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Effective
Time occurs.

17.1.4 With respect to the partnership interest in Watson Cogen Company
transferred by Products Cogeneration Company to Buyer, except as provided
otherwise in this Section 17.1.4, pursuant to Treasury Regulation §
1.706-1(c)(2)(ii) Sellers and Buyer agree to ratably allocate income or loss
with respect to the partnership interest on the basis of the relative number
of days that Products Cogeneration Company and Buyer held such partnership
interest during the tax year ended December 31 of the calendar year during which the Effective Time occurs. Sellers and Buyer agree to
allocate any income, gain, loss, credits and other Tax items of a type that
would constitute extraordinary items under Treasury Regulation §
1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)(C) to Buyer or Sellers, as the case may be, based upon the
date or period of time to which such extraordinary items relate.

17.1.5 Buyer and Sellers hereby acknowledge that Products Cogeneration Company
currently is the "tax matters partner" of Watson Cogen Company and further
acknowledge further that Buyer shall become the "tax matters partner" of
Watson Cogen Company effective as of the date immediately following the
Closing Date.

17.1.6 Buyer and Sellers acknowledge that Watson Cogen Company is subject to
pending California Proposition 8 property tax appeals that relate to property
tax for the years 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 and further
acknowledge that the resolution of the issues pursuant to such property tax
appeals could give rise to property tax refunds or to additional tax payments.
Buyer and Sellers agree that any such property tax refunds or tax payments
related to any Pre-Closing Date Taxable Period are the sole entitlement or
obligation of the Sellers to the extent of Sellers' ownership percentage in
the Watson Cogen Company as of the Closing Date. To the extent that the
resolution of an issue results in a property tax refund or a tax payment,
Buyer and Sellers will settle the amount within thirty (30) days of the date
of the issuance of the refund check, or within thirty (30) days of the date
the tax payment becomes due.

17.1.7 Sellers agree to make a §338(h)(10) election to recognize gain or loss
on the sale of Carson Cogen Company's assets while a member of Sellers'
consolidated group, or to otherwise structure the transaction so that Buyer
can achieve a step-up in basis of Carson Cogen Company's corporate assets and
of Watson Cogen Company's partnership assets.

Section 17.2 Other Taxes.

17.2.1 In the case of any other Taxes not addressed in Section 17.1, including
property Taxes imposed based on ownership of the Purchased Assets on January
1st of the year that includes the Closing Date, the portion, if any, of such
Taxes that is attributable to the Pre-Closing Date Taxable Period shall be the
responsibility of Sellers and shall be calculated as the amount of such Tax
for the entire period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days up to and including the Closing Date and the denominator of
which is the number of days in the entire period; provided, however, that
Sellers shall not be liable for any Taxes that relate to or are attributable
to an increased valuation of the relevant Purchased Assets by an applicable
Governmental Authority after the Closing Date. The Party that receives the
billing for such property Taxes shall be responsible for the timely payment of
such property Taxes and shall notify the other Party of the proration of such
property Taxes and the other Party shall pay to the Party that receives such
billing its share of such property Taxes at least twenty (20) days prior to
the due date for such property Taxes.

17.2.2 Any other Taxes paid by either the Sellers or the Buyer for which
payment is required under Section 17.2.1 shall be included in the Accounts
Amount calculation necessary to arrive at the Closing Payment Adjustment
Amount as described in Article 11 and as described more specifically in
Section 11.1.3. Any other Taxes paid by either the Sellers or the Buyer for
which payment is required under Section 17.2.1 shall similarly be included in
Schedule 11.1.3 of this Agreement.

17.2.3 The Parties acknowledge that other Taxes amounts for which payment is
required under Section 17.2.1 may not be known within the ninety (90) day time
period for which the Closing Statement is required pursuant to Section 11.2.
Sellers shall reimburse Buyer to the extent that Sellers' final liability for
other Taxes pursuant to Section 17.2.1 exceeds the amount of such other Taxes
amount included in the Closing Statement provided by Sellers pursuant to Section
11.2. Buyer shall reimburse Sellers to the extent that Buyer's payment of
other Taxes pursuant to Section 17.2.1 is less than that contained in the
Closing Statement provided by Sellers pursuant to Section 11.2. Any payments
required under this Section 17.2.3 shall be made from Buyer to Sellers or from
Sellers to Buyer, as the case may be, within sixty (60) days of Buyer's
receipt of the final tax bill that corresponds to other Taxes paid by either
the Sellers or the Buyer for which payment is required under Section 17.2.1.

Section 17.3 Transfer Taxes. Sellers and Buyer shall each be responsible for
fifty percent (50%) of all state, county and local transfer, sales, use,
stamp, registration or other similar Taxes resulting from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Any determination or agreement between the
Buyer and the Sellers with respect to the valuation of assets for purposes of
Transfer Taxes is limited in scope to Transfer Taxes and shall not constitute
an agreement with respect to valuation of assets for purposes of Section 1060
of the Code.

Section 17.4 Assistance and Cooperation. After the Closing Date, in the case
of any audit, examination, or other proceeding with respect to Taxes (the "Tax
Proceeding") for which the Sellers are or may be liable pursuant to this
Agreement, the Buyer shall inform the Sellers within ten (10) days of the
receipt of any notice of such Tax Proceeding, and shall afford the Sellers, at
the Sellers' expense, the opportunity to control the conduct of such Tax
Proceeding. The Buyer shall execute or cause to be executed powers of attorney
or other documents necessary to enable the Sellers to take all actions desired
by the Sellers with respect to such Tax Proceeding to the extent such Tax
Proceeding may affect the amount of Taxes for which the Sellers are liable
pursuant to this Agreement. The Sellers shall have the right to control any
such Tax Proceeding and to initiate any claim for refund, file any amended
return, or take any other action that it deems appropriate with respect to
such Taxes. To the extent that Sellers are or become subject to a Tax
Proceeding with respect to a Pre-Closing Date Taxable Period, whether before
or after the Closing Date, Buyer acknowledges that Sellers may desire access
to certain Transferred Employees after the Closing Date to obtain information
that may be relevant to such Tax Proceeding. Upon reasonable request of the
Sellers, Buyer shall provide Sellers access to those of the Transferred
Employees (or successors to such Transferred Employees) who possess
information that may be relevant to such Tax Proceeding.

Section 17.5 Access to Information. Unless in violation of Law, after the
Closing, the Sellers shall grant to the Buyer (or its designees) access at all
reasonable times to all of the information, books, and records relating to the
Purchased Assets within the possession of the Sellers, and shall afford the
Buyer (or its designees) the right (at the Buyer's expense) to take extracts
therefrom and to make copies thereof, to the extent reasonably necessary to
permit the Buyer (or its designees) to prepare Tax Returns and to conduct
negotiations with Taxing Authorities. Unless in violation of Law, after the
Closing, the Buyer shall grant to the Sellers (or their designees) access at
all reasonable times to all of the information, books and records relating to
the Purchased Assets within the possession of the Buyer (including Tax work
papers and correspondence with Taxing Authorities), and shall afford the
Sellers (or their designees) the right (at the Sellers' expense) to take
extracts therefrom and to make copies thereof, to the extent reasonably
necessary to permit the Sellers (or their designees) to prepare Tax Returns
and to conduct negotiations with Taxing Authorities.

Section 17.6 Tax Indemnity. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement, Section 15.1, this Section 17.6 and Section 17.7 shall apply to
indemnification by the Sellers to the Buyer for, and shall be the sole remedy
of the Buyer in respect of, the Losses described in the following sentence.
The Sellers agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer from and against
any and all Losses that the Buyer may suffer for (i) any breach of the
representations and warranties found in Section 14.1.6, and (ii) any Taxes
attributable to the Purchased Assets or the Business for a Pre-Closing Taxable
Period; provided, however, that the Sellers' obligation to indemnify the Buyer for any Losses under this
Section 17.6 shall be subject to the limitations set forth in Section 15.4,
and provided further, however, that in no event shall the Buyer be entitled to
recover more than once for the same Losses. No right to indemnity shall exist
if the Loss is the result of actions of the Buyer or its Affiliates.

Section 17.7 Tax Indemnity Claims. The provisions of this Section 17.7 shall
apply only to the indemnification provided for under Section 17.6. If a claim
for Taxes is made against the Buyer and if the Buyer intends to seek indemnity
with respect thereto under Section 17.6, the Buyer shall promptly furnish
written notice to the Sellers of such claim within sixty (60) days of the
claim being made against the Buyer. The Sellers shall have thirty (30) days
after receipt of such notice to undertake, conduct, and control (through
counsel of its own choosing and at its own expense) the settlement or defense
thereof, and the Buyer shall cooperate with it in connection therewith. The
Sellers shall permit the Buyer to participate in such settlement or defense
through counsel chosen by the Buyer (but the fees and expenses of such counsel
shall be paid by the Buyer). So long as the Sellers, at the Sellers' cost and
expense, (i) have undertaken the defense of, and assumed full responsibility
for all indemnified Losses with respect to, such claim, (ii) are reasonably
contesting such claim in good faith by appropriate proceedings, and (iii) have
taken such action (including the posting of a bond, deposit, or other
security) as may be necessary to prevent any action to foreclose a lien
against or attachment of the property of the Buyer for payment of such claim,
the Buyer shall not pay or settle any such claim. Notwithstanding compliance
by the Sellers with the preceding sentence, the Buyer shall have the right to
pay or settle any such claim, but in such event it shall waive any right to
indemnity by the Sellers for such claim. If within thirty (30) days after the
receipt of the Buyer's notice of a claim of indemnity hereunder, the Sellers
do not notify the Buyer that it elects (at the Sellers' cost and expense) to
undertake the defense thereof and assume full responsibility for all
indemnified Losses with respect thereto, or, if the Sellers give such notice
and thereafter fail to contest such claim in good faith or to prevent action
to foreclose a lien against or attachment of the Buyer's property as
contemplated above, the Buyer shall have the right to contest, settle, or
compromise such claim and the Buyer shall not thereby waive any right to
indemnity for such claim under this Agreement.

Section 17.8 Tax Refunds and Payments. Refunds received or receivable and
taxes paid or payable (to the extent not received due to offset against other
Taxes) with respect to Taxes for which the Sellers or any of their Affiliates
have responsibility hereunder, shall be promptly paid as directed by the
Sellers and Buyer, respectively.

Section 17.9 Certification of Non-Foreign Status. On the Closing Date, the
Sellers shall deliver to the Buyer a certificate (substantially in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit F) signed under penalties of perjury (i) stating
that it is not a foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign trust or
foreign estate, (ii) providing its U.S. Employer Identification Number, and
(iii) providing its address, all pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code (the
"Certificate of Non-Foreign Status").

Section 17.10 Counterparty Taxpayer Identification Numbers.

17.10.1 In connection with the performance of services and/or the provision of
accounting systems by a Seller pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement,
the Seller and the Buyer acknowledge that the Seller may transfer to Buyer
information with respect to the tax identity and/or tax status of
counterparties as well as other tax-related information contained in customer
lists, contracts, licenses or other legal agreements that the Sellers are
transferring to the Buyer (such information collectively referred to herein as
"Tax Information"). Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence,
the phrase "Tax Information" includes (i) Taxpayer Identification Numbers as
set forth on IRS Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and
Certification, (ii) information from one or more forms in the IRS Form W-8 series, (iii) identification numbers as set
forth in other tax forms or documents, and (iv) certifications with respect to
exemptions from tax withholding.

17.10.2 Buyer acknowledges that any provision by a Seller of Tax Information
is for the purpose of facilitating compliance with applicable tax law
requirements, including the requirement to perform backup withholding to the
extent required by Code § 3406\. The Buyer agrees to treat all Tax Information
as confidential information pursuant to Code § 3406(f).

17.10.3 In the event the Internal Revenue Service or other Taxing Authority
imposes any tax, fine, penalty, expense or other such cost on a Seller on
account of the provision of Tax Information to the Buyer or on account of the
Buyer's use of any Tax Information, or in the event that the Sellers incur any
other liability on account of the provision of Tax Information to the Buyer or
on account of the Buyer's use of Tax Information, the Buyer shall indemnify,
defend, protect and hold harmless and reimburse the Sellers with respect to
any such cost or liability and shall make payment to the Sellers within ninety
(90) days of the Sellers' submission of request for such payment.

17.10.4 Each Seller disclaims any and all responsibility for the completeness
and accuracy of the Tax Information. Without limiting the generality of the
preceding sentence, the Buyer shall not seek any reimbursement or other
payment from a Seller in the event the Internal Revenue Service or other
Taxing Authority imposes any tax, fine, penalty, expense or other such cost on
the Buyer on account of the Buyer's use of any Tax Information or in the event
that the Buyer incurs any other liability on account of the Buyer's use of any
Tax Information.

Section 17.11 Tax Free Exchange. Buyer and Sellers acknowledge that either
Party may wish to structure this transaction as a tax deferred exchange of
like-kind property within the meaning of Section 1031 of the Code. Each Party
agrees to reasonably cooperate with the other Party to effect such an
exchange; provided, however, that (i) the cooperating Party shall not be
required to acquire or take title to any exchange property, (ii) the
cooperating Party shall not be required to incur any expense (excluding
attorneys\' fees) or liability whatsoever in connection with the exchange,
including, without limitation, any obligation for the payment of any title,
brokerage or other costs incurred with respect to the exchange, (iii) no
substitution of the effectuating Party shall release said Party from any of
its obligations, warranties or representations set forth in this Agreement or
from liability for any prior or subsequent default under this Agreement by the
effectuating Party, its successors or assigns, which obligations shall
continue as the obligations of a principal and not of a surety or guarantor,
(iv) the effectuating Party shall give the cooperating Party at least five (5)
Business Days prior notice of the proposed changes required to effect such
exchange and the identity of any Party to be substituted in the Closing, (v)
the effectuating Party shall be responsible for preparing all additional
agreements and documents (collectively, the "Exchange Documents") required by
the exchange, at its sole cost and expense, and (vi) the effectuating Party
shall be responsible for making all determinations as to the legal
sufficiency, tax considerations and other considerations relating to the
proposed exchange, the Exchange Documents and the transactions contemplated
thereby, and the cooperating Party shall in no event be responsible for, or in
any way be deemed to warrant or represent, any tax or other consequences of
the exchange transaction arising by reason of the cooperating Party\'s
performance of the acts required hereby.

appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding
and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection
that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit,

proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any
Party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any
such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party agrees that service of

Section 19.10 Arbitration.

19.10.1 Except with respect to the resolution of disputes regarding the
Closing Statement or any Closing Payment Adjustment Amount, which is
exclusively addressed in Section 11.3, it is agreed among the Parties, as a
severable and independent arbitration agreement separately enforceable from
the remainder of this Agreement, that if the Parties hereto or the respective
successors, assigns, heirs or legal representatives of any of the foregoing
are unable to amicably resolve any dispute or difference solely between
themselves or their Affiliates arising under or out of, in relation to or in
any way connected with this Agreement but not any of the Other Agreements
(whether contractual, tortious, equitable, statutory or otherwise), the
Parties shall first to try in good faith to settle such dispute by mediation
administered by JAMS. If the Parties are unable to resolve such dispute
through such mediation, it shall be finally and exclusively referred to and
settled by arbitration under the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and
Procedures of JAMS; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prevent
any Party from seeking any court order in aid of arbitration or as otherwise
provided in Section 19.11. In the event of any conflict between the
Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS and the provisions of
this Section 19.10.1, the provisions of this Section 19.10.1 shall govern and
control.

19.10.2 The arbitration shall be heard and determined by three (3) neutral
arbitrators who shall be qualified by at least fifteen (15) years' experience
in handling disputes of a comparable nature and related degree of complexity.
The Party initiating the arbitration shall appoint one of the arbitrators
contemporaneously with the filing of the notice of arbitration and the other
Party shall appoint the second arbitrator within thirty (30) days thereof. The
two Party-appointed arbitrators shall in turn appoint the third arbitrator,
who shall preside over and chair the tribunal within thirty (30) days
following the appointment of the second of the Party-appointed arbitrators. If
the Party-appointed arbitrators cannot reach agreement on a presiding
arbitrator of the tribunal and/or one Party fails or refuses to appoint its
Party-appointed arbitrator within the prescribed period, the appointing
authority for the presiding arbitrator and/or such Party-appointed arbitrator
shall be JAMS, which, in each case, shall appoint an independent arbitrator
who does not have any financial interest in the dispute, controversy or claim
or bear any relationship to either Party. If an arbitrator should die,
withdraw or otherwise become incapable of serving, or refuse to serve, a
successor arbitrator shall be selected and appointed in the same manner as the
original arbitrator. For purposes of appointing arbitrators hereunder the
Sellers shall be deemed to be one Party. 19.10.3 Unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing by the parties to the
arbitration proceedings:

19.10.3.1 the arbitration proceedings shall be held in Houston, Texas;

19.10.3.2 the arbitrators shall be and remain at all times wholly independent
and impartial;

19.10.3.3 the arbitration proceedings shall be conducted under the
Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS, as amended from time
to time;

19.10.3.4 any procedural issues not determined under the arbitration rules
selected pursuant to Section 19.10.3.3 shall be determined by the arbitration
act and any other Laws of the State of Texas, without regard to the conflicts
of law rules of such state;

19.10.3.5 the arbitrators shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement,
including applicable limitations on liability set forth herein, in resolving
any dispute arising hereunder;

19.10.3.6 all decisions and awards by the arbitration tribunal shall be made
by majority vote, shall be reduced to writing, shall be final and binding
without the right of appeal, and shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
regarding any claims, counterclaims, issues or accountings presented to the
arbitrators; any damage awards by the arbitrators shall be promptly paid free
of any deduction or offset; and any costs or fees incident to enforcing the
award shall to the maximum extent permitted by law be charged against the
Party resisting such enforcement;

19.10.3.7 consequential, indirect, special, exemplary, punitive or other
similar damages shall not be allowed, except those payable to Third Parties
for which any Liabilities are allocated among the parties by the arbitration
award;

19.10.3.8 the fees of the arbitrators shall be borne equally by the Parties.
All other fees, costs and expenses of the arbitration proceedings (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of the other Party, including costs and
fees of expert witnesses) shall be borne by the Party that does not prevail in
the dispute as determined by the arbitrators;

19.10.3.9 judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having

other Party, to supplement or amend the schedules applicable to that Party
with respect to any matter hereafter arising or discovered which, if existing
or known at the Execution Date, would have been required to be set forth or
described in the schedules. For the purposes of determining whether the
conditions set forth in Article 9 have been fulfilled, the schedules shall be
deemed to include the information contained in the supplemental or amended
schedule, provided, however, that if Closing shall occur, then a Party shall
be entitled to make a claim for indemnification pursuant to Article 15 for
Losses resulting from such supplemented or amended schedule (provided,
however, that excluded therefrom for purposes of determining such Losses shall
be any Contracts that have been entered into in accordance with Section 7.5
and any Contracts entered into on or prior to the Execution Date that were
entered into in the Ordinary Course of Business and are not described in any
one or more of subclauses (b) through (g) of Section 14.1.3.2) and in the
event such Losses are reasonably estimated (as determined by the Parties in
good faith) to exceed one hundred fifty million dollars ($150,000,000) then
either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement. A matter set
forth in one section of the applicable schedule need not be set forth in any
other section of the applicable schedule so long as its relevance to such
other section of the applicable schedule or to a section of this Agreement is
reasonably apparent on the face of the information disclosed therein. Further,
if the Buyer obtains knowledge of any matter hereunder prior to the Closing
and the Closing shall occur, any waiver or non-waiver of any related claim
will be handled in the same manner as such matters are handled with respect to
any supplement or amendment to the schedules.

Transaction Agreements and to induce the Beneficiary to enter into the
Transaction Agreements;



NOW THEREFORE, in order to induce Beneficiary to enter into the Transaction
Agreements, and in consideration of the foregoing recitals, and for other good
and valuable consideration, the adequacy, receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, Guarantor hereby agrees as follows:









\- 2 -





1. Guaranty.



(a) Subject to the second sentence of this Section 1(a), Guarantor hereby
unconditionally, absolutely and (subject to the express provisions hereof with
respect to termination) irrevocably guarantees (i) the punctual payment when
due, whether upon demand, at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise,
of Sellers\' payment obligations arising under the Transaction Agreements
(whether present or future, direct or indirect, absolute or contingent,
matured or unmatured and including obligations which but for the automatic
stay under Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, would become due) and (ii)
to cause the performance of the obligations of BPWCP, ARCO Material Supply and
ARCO Terminal (collectively, the "Guaranteed Entities") pursuant to Sections
7.2, 12.1, 12.2, 12.11, 15.6 and 15.7 of the Agreement together with the
obligations of BPWCP under the ARCO License Agreement, Technology Agreement,
Transition Services Agreement and Master Franchise Agreement; provided, that
Buyer has first requested the performance of the Guaranteed Entities and
notified Guarantor in writing of any failed performance, and in both (i) and
(ii) above, as the Transaction Agreements may be amended or modified by
agreement in writing between Sellers and the Beneficiary from time to time
(collectively, the "Guaranteed Obligations"). Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, the Guaranteed Obligations with respect to the Other
Agreements shall only be in respect of Sellers\' payment obligations and
performance obligations (when applicable) arising under the Other Agreements
during the initial term of such Other Agreements and shall not include any
Seller obligations arising during any extension or renewal of such initial
term.



(b) Guarantor shall reimburse the Beneficiary for all sums paid to the
Beneficiary by Sellers with respect to such Guaranteed Obligations which the
Beneficiary is subsequently required to return to Sellers or a representative
of Sellers\' creditors as a result of Sellers\' bankruptcy, insolvency,
liquidation, or similar proceeding.



(c) This Guaranty shall be a continuing guaranty of all of the Guaranteed
Obligations and shall apply to and secure any ultimate balance due or
remaining unpaid to the Beneficiary; and this Guaranty shall not be considered
as wholly or partially satisfied by the payment or liquidation at any time of
any sum of money for the time being due or remaining unpaid to the
Beneficiary.



(d) This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the
case may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations
is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Beneficiary on the
insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of Sellers or Guarantor or otherwise,
all as though such payment had not been made.





\- 3 -







(e) Except with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations set forth in Section
1(a)(ii) above, Guarantor shall have no obligation to perform under the
Transaction Agreements, including, without limitation, to sell, deliver,
supply or transport gas, electricity or any other commodity and Guarantor\'s
obligations and liability under this Guaranty shall be limited to payment
obligations only.



(f) In no event shall Guarantor be liable for special, exemplary, punitive or
consequential damages.



(g) Subject to Section 2(f), if, after the closing of the transactions
contemplated by the Agreement, Guarantor merges or consolidates with or into
any of its affiliates, or dissolves, liquidates, sells, assigns, transfers or
otherwise disposes of any material portion of the assets owned by Guarantor,
directly or indirectly, to any affiliate, then such affiliate shall assume in
writing all of Guarantor\'s obligations under this Guaranty, and shall be
deemed to have assumed all of Guarantor\'s obligations under this Guaranty,
and shall be jointly and severally liable with Guarantor and directly liable
to Beneficiary hereunder with respect to same, from and after the date of any
such merger, consolidation, sale, assignment, transfer or disposition.



2. Guaranty Absolute. The liability of Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be absolute and unconditional, and shall not be limited, lessened or discharged by any act, on the part of the Beneficiary or matter or thing irrespective of, without limitation: 



(a) any incapacity or disability or lack or limitation of status or power of
Sellers or that Sellers may not be legal entities;



(b) the bankruptcy or insolvency of Sellers;



(c) any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any
jurisdiction affecting any of the Guaranteed Obligations or the rights of the
Beneficiary with respect thereto;



(d) any lack of validity or enforceability of the Transaction Agreements;



(e) any discontinuance of or any reduction, increase or other variation of
credit granted to Sellers or any change in the time, manner or place of
payment of or in any other term of, all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations
or any other amendment, modification, extension, renewal or waiver of or any
consent to or other acquiescence in the departure from the terms of the
Transaction Agreements, regardless of whether this Guaranty is in effect at
such time; or



(f) any change in the name, constitution or capacity of Sellers, or any
Seller being merged with another corporation, in which case this Guaranty
shall apply to the liabilities of the resulting corporation, and the term
"Seller" shall include such resulting corporation;







\- 4 -



save due performance by Sellers or Guarantor. Any account settled or stated by
or between the Beneficiary and Sellers shall be accepted by Guarantor in the
absence of manifest error, as conclusive evidence that the balance or amount
thereof thereby appearing due by Sellers to the Beneficiary, is so due.



The obligations of Guarantor hereunder are several and are primary obligations
for which Guarantor is the principal obligor. There are no conditions
precedent to the enforcement of this Guaranty except as expressly contained
herein. It shall not be necessary for the Beneficiary, in order to enforce
payment or performance (when applicable) by Guarantor under this Guaranty, to
exhaust any of its remedies or recourse against Sellers, any other guarantor,
or any other person liable for the payment or performance when due and shall
apply regardless of whether recovery of all such Guaranteed Obligations may be
discharged or uncollectible in any bankruptcy, insolvency or other proceeding,
or be otherwise unenforceable. A separate action or actions may be brought and
prosecuted against Guarantor with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations
whether action is brought against the Sellers or whether the Sellers be joined
in any such action or actions; provided, however, that except for the defenses
of (i) lack of authority, (ii) failure of consideration, and (iii) discharge
as a result of bankruptcy, Guarantor reserves all defenses and limitations of
liability of Sellers in the Transaction Agreements.

3. Waiver. Guarantor hereby waives: 

(a) Guarantor expressly waives any and all benefits which might otherwise be

thereto; or any waiver or consent under the Transaction Agreements, including

obligations under the Transaction Agreements or notice of any extension of
time for the payment of any sums due and payable to the Beneficiary under the

notice of any other kind with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations;

action by the Beneficiary be taken against, or any notice of default or other
notice to be given to, or any demand be made on Sellers or any other person,
or that any other action be taken or not taken as a condition to Guarantor\'s
liability for the Guaranteed Obligations under this Guaranty or as a condition
to the enforcement of this Guaranty against Guarantor;

(g) any other circumstance (including, without limitation, the failure to
obtain from any intended guarantor, other than Guarantor, a valid guaranty and
any release and discharge of any other guarantor or surety for the Guaranteed
Obligations) which might otherwise constitute a defense, set-off or
counterclaim available to, or a legal or equitable discharge of, Sellers in
respect of the Guaranteed Obligations or Guarantor in respect of this
Guaranty, all of which are hereby expressly waived by Guarantor;

(h) the waiver, surrender, compromise, settlement, release or termination by
Beneficiary of any or all of the obligations, covenants or agreements of the
Sellers under the Agreement, except to the extent such waiver, surrender,
compromise, settlement, release or termination expressly releases Guarantor
hereunder; provided that, if such waiver, surrender, compromise, settlement,
release or termination is not in connection with any bankruptcy, insolvency,
assignment for the benefit of creditors, liquidation or other similar action
or proceeding relating to or impacting the Sellers, then Guarantor\'s
obligations hereunder shall be reduced to the same extent as those of the
particular Seller were reduced pursuant to such waiver, surrender, compromise,
settlement, release or termination, but Guarantor\'s other obligations to
Beneficiary hereunder shall not be affected or otherwise reduced;

(i) the failure to give notice to Guarantor of the occurrence of a Default
under the Agreement;

(j) the taking or the omission of any of the actions referred to in the
Agreement including any acceleration of sums owing thereunder;

(k) any failure, omission, delay or lack on the part of Beneficiary to
enforce, assert or exercise any right, power of remedy conferred on it in the
Agreement; and

(l) any duty of Beneficiary to advise Guarantor of the financial condition of
the Sellers and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment
of amounts owing under the Agreement which diligent inquiry would reveal, as
Guarantor assumes responsibility for being and remaining informed regarding
such conditions or any such circumstances.

4. Subrogation. Guarantor shall be subrogated to all rights of the Beneficiary against Sellers in respect of any amounts paid by Guarantor pursuant to the Guaranty, provided that Guarantor waives any rights it may acquire by way of subrogation under this Guaranty, by any payment made hereunder or otherwise (including, without 





\- 6 -



limitation, any statutory rights of subrogation under Section 509 of the
Bankruptcy Code 11 U.S.C. § 509, or otherwise), reimbursement, exoneration,
contribution, indemnification, or any right to participate in any claim or
remedy of the Beneficiary against Sellers or any collateral which the
Beneficiary now has or acquires, until all of the Guaranteed Obligations shall
have been irrevocably and indefeasibly paid to the Beneficiary in full. If (a)
Guarantor shall perform and shall make payment to the Beneficiary of all or
any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, (b) all the Guaranteed Obligations
shall have been indefeasibly paid in full and (c) the Beneficiary shall have
confirmed in writing to Sellers that no extensions of credit are outstanding
or contracted for under the Transaction Agreements, the Beneficiary shall, at
Guarantor\'s request, execute and deliver to Guarantor appropriate documents
necessary to evidence the transfer by subrogation to Guarantor of any interest
in the Guaranteed Obligations resulting from such payment of Guarantor.

5. Notices. All demands, notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall, unless otherwise specifically provided herein, (a) be in writing addressed to the party receiving the notice at the address set forth below or at such other address as may be designated by written notice, from time to time, to the other party, and (b) be effective upon delivery, when mailed by U.S. or Canadian mail, as the case may be, registered or certified, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or personally delivered.

There are no other requirements of notice, presentment or demand. Guarantor shall pay, or cause to be paid, such Guaranteed Obligations within ten (10) business days of receipt of such demand, unless, within such ten (10) business day period, the default giving rise to such demand has been remedied.

7. No Waiver; Remedies. Except as to applicable statues of limitation, no failure on the part of the Beneficiary to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right.

8. Term; Termination. This Guaranty shall be and continue to be in full force and effect from the Effective Date (as defined immediately above the signature lines hereof) until the date the Guaranteed Obligations have been fully and indefeasibly paid.

If at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of Sellers or otherwise, Guarantor\'s obligations hereunder with respect to such payment shall be reinstated at such time as though such payment had not been made.

9. Assignment; Successors and Assigns. Neither party may assign or delegate any of their respective rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party; provided, however, Beneficiary may, without the prior written consent of the Guarantor, assign its rights under this Guaranty in accordance with Section 19.3 of the Agreement. Any assignment that does not comply with the terms of this Section 9 shall be deemed null and void and of no force or effect. This Guaranty shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 

10. Amendments, etc. No amendment or other modification of the terms of this Guaranty shall be effective unless in writing and signed by Guarantor and the Beneficiary and stating that it is expressly intended to give effect to the applicable amendment or modification hereto. No waiver of any provision of this Guaranty nor consent to any departure by Guarantor therefrom shall in any event be effective unless such waiver shall refer to this Guaranty, be in writing and be signed by the Beneficiary. Any such waiver

shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose
for which it was given.
