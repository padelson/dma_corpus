provide each other with such information as may be required to be included in the Joint Proxy Statement or Form S-4 or as may be
reasonably required to respond to any comment of the SEC. After all comments received from the SEC have been cleared by the SEC

as reasonably practicable and to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as necessary to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions.
The Company shall file the definitive Joint Proxy Statement with the SEC and cause such definitive Joint Proxy Statement to be
mailed (including by electronic delivery if permitted) as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective
under the Securities Act, to its stockholders of record, as of a record date reasonably established by the Company Board in accordance

as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving or having agreed to serve as a director or officer
of the Corporation, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as
the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits

such request is made before or after the acts taken or allegedly taken or events occurring or allegedly occurring which give rise

indemnify any such person seeking indemnification pursuant to this subsection in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof)
initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board. The right to indemnification conferred

to subsection (b)(i)(A) on the date this Certificate of Incorporation is effective and to a person subject to subsection (b)(i)(B)

by such person&rsquo;s service or continued service as a director or officer of the Corporation for any period after the offer
is made and (ii) in the case of a person subject to subsection (b)(i)(B), by such person&rsquo;s continued service in such capacity
as such person was serving when designated as subject to subsection (b)(i)(B) by the Board, or any committee thereof, or if such
person is no longer serving in such capacity, by such person&rsquo;s written acceptance and, in each case, shall include the right
to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided
further, however, that if the DGCL requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a current, former or proposed director or
officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer or proposed director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which
service was or is or has been agreed to be rendered by such person while a director or officer, including, without limitation,
service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to the
Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such indemnified person, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately
be determined that such indemnified person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article NINTH or otherwise. The Corporation
may, by action of the Board, provide indemnification or advancement to employees or agents of the Corporation with the same scope
and effect as the foregoing indemnification of directors and officers.</P>

claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including
its Board, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action

set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders)
that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that
the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.</P>

shall cause to be issued to each stockholder one or more certificates, under the seal of the Corporation or a facsimile thereof
if the Board of Directors shall have provided for such seal, and signed by the Chairman of the Board (if any), chief executive

number of shares (and, if the stock of the Corporation shall be divided into classes or series, the class and series of such shares)
owned by such stockholder in the Corporation; provided, however, that any of or all the signatures on the certificate may be facsimile.
The stock record books and the blank stock certificate books shall be kept by the Secretary, or at the office of such transfer
agent or transfer agents as the Board of Directors may from time to time by resolution determine. In case any officer, transfer
agent or registrar who shall have signed or whose facsimile signature or signatures shall have been placed upon any such certificate
or certificates shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued by the Corporation,
such certificate may nevertheless be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if such person were such officer, transfer
agent or registrar at the date of issue. The stock certificates shall be consecutively numbered and shall be entered in the books
of the Corporation as they are issued and shall exhibit the holder&rsquo;s name and number of shares. The Board of Directors may
deem that any outstanding shares of the Corporation will be uncertificated and registered in such form on the stock books of the
Corporation.</P>
