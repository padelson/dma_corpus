1.5 _Directors and Officers_. From and after the Effective Time,

Article II 
 EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK 
 OF THE COMPANY AND MERGER SUB

  



  

2.1 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any party or
the holder of any of their securities:

  



  

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of capital stock of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and shall represent one share of common stock,
par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, so that,
immediately after the Effective Time, OpCo shall be the holder of all of the
issued and outstanding shares of the Surviving Corporation's capital stock.

  



  

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Any shares of Company Common
Stock held immediately prior to the Effective Time by (A) the Company,
as treasury shares, or any of its Subsidiaries, or (B) by Parent, OpCo,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries ( _clauses (A)_ and _(B)_
collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ "), in each case, shall automatically be
canceled and cease to exist as of the Effective Time and no Merger
Consideration shall be delivered or deliverable therefor.

  



  

(c) _Conversion of Capital Stock of the Company_. Subject to the
other provisions of this _Article II_ , each share of common stock of
the Company, par value $0.001 per share (the " _Company Common Stock_ "),
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any
Company Restricted Shares and any Net Exercise Shares, but excluding any
Excluded Shares and any Appraisal Shares) shall be converted into and shall
thereafter represent the right, at the election of such share's
holder pursuant to the procedures set forth in _Section 2.2_, to receive any
the following forms of consideration (the " _Merger Consideration_ "):

  



  

(i) _Mixed Election Shares_. Each share of Company Common Stock
with respect to which an election to receive a combination of stock and cash
(a " _Mixed Election_ ") has been properly made and not been properly revoked
(each, a " _Mixed Consideration Election Share_ ") and, except to the extent
provided in _Section 2.2_ , each No Election Share shall be converted into
the right to receive the combination (which combination shall hereinafter be
referred to as the " _Per Share Mixed Consideration_ ") of (x) $25.35 in cash
without interest (the " _Per Share Cash Amount_ ") and (y) 0.584 of a share
of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, par
value $0.005 per share, of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ ," and such
fraction of a share, the " _Mixed Election Stock Exchange Ratio_ "), subject
to adjustment in accordance with _Section 2.6_.

  



    

3 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(ii) _Cash Election Shares_. Each Net Exercise Share shall be
automatically deemed, without any action by the holder thereof, to have made
a Cash Election (as defined below) and shall be converted into the right to
receive $39.00 in cash without interest, and without being subject to any
adjustment set forth in _Section 2.1(c)(ii)_ or _Section 2.6_. Each share of
Company Common Stock (excluding the Net Exercise Shares) with respect to
which an election to receive cash (a " _Cash Election_ ") has been properly
made and not been properly revoked (each, a " _Cash Election Share_ ") shall
be converted (provided that the Available Cash Election Amount equals or
exceeds the Cash Election Amount) into the right to receive (x) $39.00 in
cash without interest (the " _Per Share Cash Election Consideration_ "),
subject to adjustment in accordance with _Sections 2.1(c)(ii)_ and _2.6_ ;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if __ (A) the product of the number of Cash
Election Shares and the Per Share Cash Election Consideration (such product,
the " _Cash Election Amount_ ") exceeds (B) (w) the product of the Per Share
Cash Amount and the total number of shares of Company Common Stock (other than
the Excluded Shares, but including, for the avoidance of doubt, Company
Restricted Shares, Net Exercise Shares and Company Phantom Shares pursuant to
the terms and conditions of _Section 2.4_ ) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time _minus_ (x) the product of the number
of Mixed Consideration Election Shares (provided that No Election Shares shall
be deemed to be Mixed Consideration Election Shares for purposes of this
_Section 2.1(c)(ii)_) and the Per Share Cash Amount (the " _Aggregate
Mixed Consideration Cash Amount_ ") _minus_ (y) the Provisional Appraisal
Holders Cash Amount _minus_ (z) the aggregate Option Consideration (such
result of the calculations in this _clause (B)_ being the " _Available
Cash Election Amount_ "), then each Cash Election Share (other than any Net
Exercise Shares) shall be converted into a right to receive (1) an amount of
cash (without interest) equal to the product of (p) the Per Share Cash
Election Consideration and (q) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be
the Available Cash Election Amount and the denominator of which shall be the
Cash Election Amount (such fraction being the " _Cash Fraction_ ") and (2) a
number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the product of (r) the Exchange Ratio and (s) one (1)
_minus_ the Cash Fraction. The " _Provisional Appraisal Holders Cash Amount_ "
means the product of (x) the number of Appraisal Shares and (y) the Per Share
Cash Election Consideration.

  



  

(iii) _Stock Election Shares_. Each share of Company Common Stock
with respect to which an election to receive stock consideration (a " _Stock
Election_ ") has been properly made and not been properly revoked (each, a "
_Stock Election Share_ ") shall be converted (provided that the Cash Election
Amount equals or exceeds the Available Cash Election Amount), into the right
to receive 1.669 shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock, subject to adjustment
in accordance with _Sections 2.1(c)(iii)_ and _2.6_ (the " _Per Share Stock
Consideration_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Available Cash
Election Amount exceeds the Cash Election Amount, then each Stock Election
Share shall be converted into the right to receive (1) an amount of cash
(without interest) equal to the amount of such excess divided by the number
of Stock Election Shares and (2) a number of validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (x) the
Exchange Ratio and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Per
Share Cash Election Consideration minus the amount calculated in _clause
(1)_ of this paragraph and the denominator of which shall be the Per Share
Cash Election Consideration.

  



    

4 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(d) All shares of Company Common Stock shall, when so converted,
cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and cease to
exist. Each holder of a certificate previously representing any such shares of
Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive (x) the Merger Consideration to be issued or paid
in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificates in
accordance with _Section 2.5_ and (y) any cash to be paid in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section 2.6_.

  



  

(e) _Impact of Stock Splits, etc_. In the event of any change in
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock, Company Common Stock or
Company Equity Awards between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time by reason of any stock split, stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, combination, or exchange of
shares, the Merger Consideration to be paid for each share of Company Common
Stock and Equity Award Consideration to be paid for each Company Equity Award
as provided in this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted.

  



  

2.2 _Election Procedures_.

  



  

(a) _Election Form_. Not less than thirty (30) days prior to the
anticipated Effective Time (the " _Mailing Date_ "), the Company shall mail
an election form, reasonably acceptable to all parties (the " _Election Form_
"), to each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock (including any
Company Restricted Shares, Company Phantom Shares and Net Exercise Shares,
but excluding any Excluded Shares) as of a record date that is five (5)
business days prior to the Mailing Date (the " _Election Form Record Date_
").

  



  

(b) _Choice of Election_. Each Election Form shall permit the
holder (or the beneficial owner through customary documentation
and instructions), other than holders of Appraisal Shares, or holders of Net
Exercise Shares who shall automatically be deemed to have elected to receive
only cash, to specify (i) the number of shares of such holder's Company Common
Stock with respect to which such holder elects to receive the Per Share Mixed
Consideration, (ii) the number of shares of such holder's Company
Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to receive the Per
Share Stock Consideration, (iii) the number of shares of such holder's
Company Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to receive the
Per Share Cash Election Consideration or (iv) that such holder makes no
election with respect to such holder's Company Common Stock. For the
avoidance of doubt, each holder of a Company Equity Award shall receive the
Equity Award Consideration described in _Section 2.4_.  Any shares of
Company Common Stock (other than Appraisal Shares) with respect to which the
Exchange Agent does not receive a properly completed Election Form during the
period (the " _Election Period_ ") from the Mailing Date to 5:00 p.m., New
York time, on the second (2nd) business day prior to the Effective Time (the
" _Election Deadline_ ") shall be deemed to be No Election Shares. Parent
shall publicly announce the anticipated Election Deadline at least five (5)
business days prior to the Election Deadline. If the Effective Time is
delayed to a subsequent date, the Election Deadline shall be
similarly delayed to a subsequent date (which shall be the second (2nd)
business day prior to the Effective Time), and Parent shall promptly announce
any such delay and, when determined, the rescheduled Election Deadline. For
the purposes of this Agreement, " _No Election Share_ " means each share of
Company Common Stock for which no election to receive Per Share
Mixed Consideration, Per Share Cash Election Consideration or Per Share Stock
Consideration has been properly made in accordance with the terms of this
_Section 2.2_ or for which such election has been properly revoked in
accordance with the terms of this  _Section 2.2_.

  



    

5 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(c) _New Holders_. Parent shall make available one or more
Election Forms as may reasonably be requested from time to time by
all persons who become holders or beneficial owners of Company Common Stock,
Company Restricted Shares or Company Phantom Shares during the Election
Period, and the Company shall provide the Exchange Agent all information
reasonably necessary for it to perform its duties as specified herein.

  



  

(d) _Revocations; Exchange Agent_. Any election shall have been
properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received
a properly completed Election Form during the Election Period. After a Cash
Election, a Stock Election or a Mixed Election has been properly made with
respect to any shares of Company Common Stock, any subsequent transfer of such
shares of Company Common Stock shall automatically revoke such election. Any
Election Form may be revoked or changed by the person submitting it, by
written notice received by the Exchange Agent during the Election Period. In
the event an Election Form is revoked during the Election Period, the shares
of Company Common Stock represented by such Election Form shall be deemed to
be No Election Shares, except to the extent a subsequent election is properly
made during the Election Period. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and
of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to
determine whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or
timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any
good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be
binding and conclusive. None of Parent or the Company or the Exchange Agent
shall be under any obligation to notify any person of any defect in an
Election Form.

  



  

2.3 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding any other provision
contained in this Agreement, any shares of Company Common Stock that are
issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and that are held by a
stockholder who has not voted such shares in favor of the Merger and who is
entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to,
and who complies in all respects with, and has otherwise taken all of the
steps required by, Section 262 of the DGCL to properly perfect such
stockholder's appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Appraisal
Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and instead shall be cancelled and shall be entitled to receive
the amount determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the event that a stockholder of the Company fails to
perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses its right to appraisal under Section
262 of the DGCL, the shares of Company Common Stock held by such
stockholder shall be deemed to be No Election Shares and converted into and
represent only the right to receive the Per Share Mixed
Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)(i)_. The Company shall give Parent
(i) prompt notice of any written notices to exercise appraisal rights in
respect of any shares of Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such
notices, and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law that are
received by the Company with respect to stockholders' appraisal rights, and
(ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any such demands for payment of fair value under
the DGCL. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle
any such demands for payment of fair value under the DGCL.

2.4 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

  



  

(a) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, the restrictions
applicable to each share of restricted Company Common Stock outstanding as of
the Effective Time, whether or not subject to service-based or performance-
based vesting conditions (each, a " _Company Restricted Share_ " and
together, the " _Company Restricted Shares_ "), issued pursuant to the
Company's 2009 Long Term Incentive Plan, as amended from time to time (the "
_2009 LTIP_ "), shall lapse and each such Company Restricted Share shall
become fully vested, and, subject to _Section 2.4(e)_ , shall be treated as a
share of Company Common Stock for all purposes of this Agreement, including
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with
_Section 2.1_ (the " _Restricted Share Consideration_ ").

  



  

(b) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, the restrictions
applicable to each share of phantom Company Common Stock outstanding as of
the Effective Time, whether or not subject to service-based or performance-
based vesting conditions (each, a " _Company Phantom Share_ " and together,
the " _Company Phantom Shares_ "), deferred pursuant to the Second
Amended and Restated Stock and Deferral Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the
" _Director Deferral Plan_ " and together with the 2009 LTIP, the " _Company
Stock Plans_ "), shall lapse and each such Company Phantom Share shall become
fully vested, and, subject to _Section 2.4(e)_ and the terms and conditions
of the Director Deferral Plan, shall be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.1_ (the " _Deferred
Share Consideration_ "), and such Deferred Share Consideration shall be held
within the Director Deferral Plan subject to the terms and conditions of
the Director Deferral Plan.

  



  

(c) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding
option for the purchase of Company Common Stock issued pursuant to any
Company Stock Plan (a " _Company Stock Option_ ") outstanding (whether or not
then vested or exercisable), by virtue of the occurrence of the Closing and
without any action on the part of any holder of any Company Stock Option, will
be deemed exercised pursuant to a cashless exercise for that number of shares
of Company Common Stock (the " _Net Exercise Shares_ ") equal to (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time minus (ii) the number of whole and
partial shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
that, when multiplied by $39.00 per share, is equal to the aggregate exercise
price of such Company Stock Option. Each Net Exercise Share shall be deemed
to be an outstanding share of Company Common Stock for purposes of _Sections
2.1(c)_ and _2.2_ ;  _provided_ , _however_ , that only a Cash Election may
be made in respect of such share (any Merger Consideration received for such
Net Exercise Shares being hereinafter referred to as the " _Option
Consideration_ " and, together with the Restricted Share Consideration and
the Deferred Share Consideration, the " _Equity Award Consideration_ ").

  



  

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
necessary such that, effective as of the Effective Time, each
outstanding Company Restricted Share, Company Phantom Share and Company Stock
Option (each a " _Company Equity Award_ " and together, the " _Company Equity
Awards_ ") shall be canceled in exchange for the applicable Equity Award
Consideration (if any), including (i) obtaining any consents from holders of
Company Equity Awards that are required under the terms of the applicable
Company Stock Plan, and (ii) amending, to the extent necessary and to the
extent such amendment is permitted by the terms of such Company Equity Award
or Company Stock Plan, the terms of such Company Equity Awards or Company
Stock Plan to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this _Section
2.4_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Section 2.4_ , payment may
be withheld in respect of any Company Equity Award until any required consent
of the holder of such Company Equity Award is obtained.

  



    

7

--- 

    



  

(e) All payments of Equity Award Consideration shall be made through
the Surviving Corporation's payroll system, and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable to any holder of Company Equity Awards pursuant to this Agreement any
amount required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under applicable Law, including Taxes. To the extent that amounts are
so properly deducted and withheld by the Surviving Corporation, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the Company Equity Awards in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation. No interest
shall be paid or accrue on the amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 2.4_
in respect of any Company Equity Award.

  



  

2.5 _Payment; Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer Books_.

  



  

(a) _Exchange Agent; Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent will designate a national bank or trust company, that is
reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to act as agent for the holders of
Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ ")
to receive the cash necessary to make the cash payments contemplated by
_Section 2.1(c)_. Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event not
later than two Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, in trust with
the Exchange Agent in a separate account for the benefit of holders of
Company Common Stock (the " _Exchange Fund_ ") the aggregate cash and the
aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holders shall
be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_. If for any
reason the cash or the shares of Parent Common Stock in the Exchange Fund
shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be
made by the Exchange Agent hereunder (including the payment of any cash to be
paid in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock in accordance
with _Section 2.6_ ), the Surviving Corporation shall promptly deposit cash or
Parent Common Stock, as applicable, into the Exchange Fund in an amount that
is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash or Parent Common Stock, as
applicable, required to fully satisfy such payment obligations.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

  



  

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, and
in any event within five Business Days thereafter, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record
of a certificate formerly representing a share of Company Common Stock ("
_Certificates_ ") or any corresponding book-entry share of Company Common
Stock (" _Book-Entry Share_ ") whose shares of Company Common Stock were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (A) a letter of
transmittal (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares,
upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal, and
such letter of transmittal will be in customary form) and (B) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or, in the case of Book-
Entry Shares, the surrender of such Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration. Each holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares may
thereafter until the first anniversary of the Effective Time surrender such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent, as agent for such
holder, under cover of the letter of transmittal. Upon delivery of a duly
completed and validly executed letter of transmittal and the surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on or before the first anniversary of the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay the holder of
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, in exchange for the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, (X) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent Common
Stock that such holder has the right to receive, and (Y) cash or a check in
an amount equal to the amount such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
this  _Article II_ , plus cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.6_. Until so surrendered, Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares (other than shares of Company Common Stock held by
Parent, Merger Sub, or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent, direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Merger Sub, and shares of Company Common
Stock held in the treasury of the Company) will represent solely the right to
receive the aggregate Merger Consideration relating to the shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. The
Exchange Agent will, within five Business Days of any surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this _Section 2.5(b)(i)_ ,
notify Parent of such surrender, whereupon Parent will, in accordance with its
normal procedures for issuance of new shares, make the appropriate entries in
Parent's shareholders register in respect of the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable upon such surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ , taking into account (to the extent applicable)
the provisions of _Section 2.5(b)(ii)_ below.

  



  

(ii) If all or any portion of the Cash Consideration, or all or any
portion of the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to
_Section 2.1(c)_ , in each case in respect of cancelled shares of Company
Common Stock is to be paid or issued to a Person other than the Person in
whose name surrendered Certificates are registered, it will be a condition to
such payment that (A) the Certificates so surrendered will be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that (B) the Person
requesting payment of Cash Consideration, or issuance of shares of Parent
Common Stock, to a person other than the Person in whose name the
relevant surrendered Certificates are registered, shall have paid any
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of such payment of
Cash Consideration, or issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock, to a person
other than the registered holder of the Certificates surrendered, or shall
have established to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent and Parent that
such Tax is not applicable. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender
for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_
, including shares of Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_
, will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares theretofore represented by such Certificates.

(iii) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
will be closed and there will not be any further registration of transfers of
any shares of the Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the
Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares will cease to have any rights with respect to any shares of
Company Common Stock, except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement or
by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares (other than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing shares of
Company Common Stock held by Parent, Merger Sub or any direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary
of the Company or direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Merger Sub,
and shares of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company) are
presented to the Surviving Corporation, they will be cancelled and exchanged
for Merger Consideration, including shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ , as provided in this _Article II_. No interest
will accrue or be paid on any cash payable upon the surrender of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares that immediately before the Effective Time represented
shares of Company Common Stock.

  



  

(iv) Promptly following the date that is one year after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation will be entitled to require the
Exchange Agent to deliver to it any cash, including any interest received
with respect to such cash, Certificates and other documents in its possession
relating to the Merger and the other Transactions, which had been made
available to the Exchange Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares or previously delivered to the Surviving
Corporation, and thereafter such holders will be entitled to look to (A) the
Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws) only as general creditors of the Surviving Corporation with
respect to the Cash Consideration payable upon due surrender of their
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, without any interest on such Cash
Consideration and (B) to Parent, with respect to the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ upon surrender of their
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any Subsidiary of Parent or the Exchange
Agent will be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for
Merger Consideration delivered to a Governmental Authority pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. The obligation of
Parent to issue shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement to
any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock shall absolutely and
finally terminate and expire, without any limitation or restriction
whatsoever, at such time as such former holder of shares of Company Common
Stock, as a result of abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws applicable
within the United States, or for any other reason based on Laws applicable
within the United States, ceases to be entitled to receive from the Surviving
Corporation the Cash Consideration in respect of such holder's shares of
Company Common Stock.

  



  

(v) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from cash amounts payable under this Agreement, such
amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code, the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state or local Law
with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable Governmental Authority,
such withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding were made.

--- 

    



  

(vi) If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may direct as
indemnity against any action that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall (A) pay, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Cash Consideration to be paid in respect
of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates as
contemplated by this _Article II_ and (B) notify the Parent of such payment,
whereupon the Parent will issue to the holder of the relevant lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, in the manner set forth in _Section 2.1(c)_ , the
appropriate number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in respect of
the shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate as set forth in _Section 2.1(c)_.

  



  

2.6 _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender
for exchange of Certificates or with respect to Book-Entry Shares, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock
converted by virtue of the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock, shall receive, in lieu
of such fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock, cash, without interest,
in United States dollars in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share
of Parent Common Stock multiplied by the Parent Stock Price.

to forward-looking statements or any other statements that are non-specific,
predictive or primarily cautionary in nature other than historical facts
included therein), where the relevance of the information as an exception to
(or disclosure for purposes of) a particular representation is reasonably
apparent on the face of such disclosure or (ii) as set forth on the disclosure
schedule dated as of the date of this Agreement and delivered by the Company
to Parent and Merger Sub on or prior to the date of this Agreement (the "

exclusively made in _Section 3.1(r)_.

  



  

(r) _Oil and Gas Matters_.

  



  

(i) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect and except for property (A) sold or
otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business since the dates of
the reserve reports prepared by Netherland, Sewell and Associates, Inc. ("
_NSAI_ ") relating to the Company interests referred to therein as of December
31, 2013 (the " _Company Reserve Reports_ ") or (B) reflected in the Company
Reserve Reports or in the Company SEC Documents as having been sold or
otherwise disposed of, as of the date hereof, the Company and its Subsidiaries

basis for the reserves reflected in the Company Reserve Reports and in each
case as attributable to interests owned by the Company and its Subsidiaries,

Permitted Encumbrances. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, " _good
and defensible title_ " means that the Company's or one or more of its
Subsidiaries', as applicable, title (as of the date hereof and as of the
Closing) to each of the Oil and Gas Properties held or owned by them (or
purported to be held or owned by them) (I) entitles the Company (or one or
more of its Subsidiaries, as applicable) to receive (after satisfaction
of all Production Burdens applicable thereto), not less than the net revenue
interest share shown in the Company Reserve Reports of all Hydrocarbons
produced from such Oil and Gas Properties throughout the life of such Oil and
Gas Properties, (II) obligates the Company (or one or more of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable) to bear a percentage of the costs and expenses

positive differences in such percentage) and the applicable working interest
shown on the Company Reserve Reports for such Oil and Gas Properties that are
accompanied by a proportionate (or greater) net revenue interest in such Oil
and Gas Properties and (III) is free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than
Permitted Encumbrances).

(ii) The factual, non-interpretive data supplied to NSAI relating to
the Company interests referred to in the Company Reserve Reports, by or on
behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries that was material to such firm's
estimates of proved oil and gas reserves attributable to the Oil and Gas
Properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the
preparation of the Company Reserve Reports was, as of the time provided,
accurate in all material respects. The oil and gas reserve estimates of the
Company set forth in the Company Reserve Reports are derived from reports
that have been prepared by NSAI, and such reserve estimates fairly reflect,
in all material respects, the oil and gas reserves of the Company at the dates
indicated therein and are in accordance with SEC guidelines applicable
thereto applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved. Except
for changes generally affecting the oil and gas exploration, development and
production industry (including changes in commodity prices) and normal
depletion by production, there has been no change in respect of the matters
addressed in the Company Reserve Reports that would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(iii) Except as would not be material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, all proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons
produced from the Oil and Gas Properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries
forming the basis for the reserves reflected in the Company Reserve Reports
are being received by them in a timely manner and no proceeds from the sale of
Hydrocarbons produced from any such Oil and Gas Properties are being held in
suspense (by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any third party operator
thereof or any other Person or individual) for any reason other than awaiting
preparation and approval of division order title opinions for recently
drilled wells.

Properties owned or held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and none of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or, to the Company's knowledge, any

cancel, rescind or procure judicial reformation of any such Oil and Gas

its Subsidiaries have been operated in accordance with reasonable, prudent oil
and gas field practices and in material compliance with the applicable Oil
and Gas Leases, Oil and Gas Contracts and Law, except where the failure to so

Subsidiaries forming the basis for the reserves reflected in the

Material Adverse Effect, (A) all of the wells located on the Oil and

could result in a penalty or forfeiture as a result of such election not to
participate in such operation or activity. The Company Reserve Reports
accurately reflect, in all material respects, any payout balances applicable
to any well included in the Oil and Gas Properties held or owned by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries forming the basis for the reserves
reflected in the Company Reserve Reports.

Disclosure Schedule, since December 31, 2013, there has not been any action

(i) _Compliance with Law_. Parent and its Subsidiaries are in
compliance with, and are not in default under or in violation of, any Law,
except where such non-compliance, default or violation have not had and would

(k) _Oil and Gas Matters_.

  



  

(i) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect and except for property (A) sold or
otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business since the dates of
the reserve reports prepared by Parent and evaluated by NSAI relating to
Parent interests referred to therein as of June 30, 2013 (the " _Parent
Reserve Reports_ ") or (B) reflected in the Parent Reserve Reports or in
Parent SEC Documents as having been sold or otherwise disposed of, as of the
date hereof, Parent and its Subsidiaries have good and defensible title to
all Oil and Gas Properties forming the basis for the reserves reflected in
the Parent Reserve Reports and in each case as attributable to interests owned
by Parent and its Subsidiaries, free and clear of any Encumbrances, except
for (1) Production Burdens and (2) Permitted Encumbrances. For purposes of the
foregoing sentence, " _good and defensible title_ " means that Parent's or
one or more of its Subsidiaries', as applicable, title (as of the date hereof
and as of the Closing) to each of the Oil and Gas Properties held or owned by
them (or purported to be held or owned by them) (I) entitles Parent (or one
or more of its Subsidiaries, as applicable) to receive (after satisfaction of
all Production Burdens applicable thereto), not less than the net revenue
interest share shown in the Parent Reserve Reports of all Hydrocarbons
produced from such Oil and Gas Properties throughout the life of such Oil and
Gas Properties, (II) obligates Parent (or one or more of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable) to bear a percentage of the costs and expenses for the
maintenance and development of, and operations relating to, such Oil and Gas
Properties, of not greater than the working interest shown on the Parent
Reserve Reports for such Oil and Gas Properties (other than any positive
differences in such percentage) and the applicable working interest shown on
the Parent Reserve Reports for such Oil and Gas Properties that are
accompanied by a proportionate (or greater) net revenue interest in such Oil
and Gas Properties and (III) is free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than
Permitted Encumbrances).

  



  

(ii) The factual, non-interpretive data supplied to NSAI relating to
Parent interests referred to in the Parent Reserve Reports, by or on behalf
of Parent and its Subsidiaries that was material to such firm's estimates of
proved oil and gas reserves attributable to the Oil and Gas Properties of
Parent and its Subsidiaries in connection with the evaluation of the Parent
Reserve Reports was, as of the time provided, accurate in all material
respects. The oil and gas reserve estimates of Parent and its Subsidiaries
set forth in the Parent Reserve Reports are derived from reports that have
been prepared internally by Parent's management and evaluated by NSAI, and
such reserve estimates fairly reflect, in all material respects, the oil and
gas reserves of Parent and its Subsidiaries at the dates indicated therein
and are in accordance with SEC guidelines applicable thereto applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods involved. Except for changes
generally affecting the oil and gas exploration, development and
production industry (including changes in commodity prices) and normal
depletion by production, there has been no change in respect of the matters
addressed in the Parent Reserve Reports that would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(iii) Except as would not be material to Parent and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, all proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from
the Oil and Gas Properties of Parent and its Subsidiaries forming the basis
for the reserves reflected in the Parent Reserve Reports are being received
by them in a timely manner and no proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons
produced from any such Oil and Gas Properties are being held in suspense (by
Parent, any of its Subsidiaries, any third party operator thereof or any
other Person or individual) for any reason other than awaiting preparation
and approval of division order title opinions for recently drilled wells.

good standing, valid and in full force and effect, (B) all rentals, shut-ins
and similar payments (and all Production Burdens) owed to any Person or
individual under (or otherwise with respect to) any such Oil and Gas Leases
have been properly and timely paid, (C) all royalties, minimum royalties,
overriding royalties and other Production Burdens with respect to any Oil and
Gas Properties owned or held by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries have been
timely and properly paid, (D) none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (and,
to Parent's knowledge, no third party operator) has violated any provision of,
or taken or failed to take any act that, with or without notice, lapse of
time, or both, would constitute a default under the provisions of any Oil and
Gas Lease (or entitle the lessor thereunder to cancel or terminate such Oil
and Gas Lease) included in the Oil and Gas Properties owned or held by Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries and none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (or,
to Parent's knowledge, any third party operator) has received written notice
from any other party to any such Oil and Gas Lease (1) that Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries (or such third party operator, as the case may be) has
breached, violated or defaulted under any such Oil and Gas Lease or (2)
threatening to terminate, cancel, rescind or procure judicial reformation of
any such Oil and Gas Lease.  _Schedule 3.2(k)(iv)_ sets forth all the Oil and
Gas Leases included in Parent's (or any Subsidiary's) Oil and Gas Properties
that are scheduled to expire (in whole or in part) at any time in the twelve
(12) month period immediately following the execution of this Agreement

  



  

(v) All Oil and Gas Properties forming the basis for the reserves
reflected in the Parent Reserve Reports operated by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries have been operated in accordance with reasonable, prudent oil and
gas field practices and in material compliance with the applicable Oil and
Gas Leases, Oil and Gas Contracts and Law, except where the failure to so
operate would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(vi) None of the Oil and Gas Properties of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries forming the basis for the reserves reflected in the Parent
Reserve Reports is subject to any preferential purchase preemptive, consent
(including any Consent) or similar right that would become operative as a
result of the entry into (or the consummation of) the Transactions, except for

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

of all applicable Oil and Gas Leases and Oil and Gas Contracts, (B) all

Properties owned or held by it (or them, as applicable) forming the basis for
the reserves reflected in the Parent Reserve Reports that could result in a
penalty or forfeiture as a result of such election not to participate in
such operation or activity. The Parent Reserve Reports accurately reflect, in
all material respects, any payout balances applicable to any well included in
the Oil and Gas Properties held or owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
forming the basis for the reserves reflected in the Parent Reserve Reports.

  



  

(viii) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, with respect
to Parent's (and its Subsidiaries') Oil and Gas Properties forming the basis
for the reserves reflected in the Parent Reserve Reports, all currently
producing wells and all tangible equipment included therein, used in
connection with the operation thereof or otherwise primarily associated
therewith (including, for the avoidance of doubt, all buildings, plants,

stock) are in a good state of repair and are adequate and sufficient (in all
material respects) to maintain normal operations in accordance with past
practices (ordinary wear and tear accepted).

  



  

(ix) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, neither the entry into (nor the consummation of) the
Transactions will result in a breach of the terms of, or give rise to any

Contract included in any of Parent's (or any of its Subsidiaries') Oil and Gas
Properties forming the basis for the reserves reflected in the Parent Reserve
Reports.

(v) To Parent's knowledge, there has been no exposure of any Person

foregoing restrictions by any of the Company's or its Subsidiaries'
Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 4.3_ :

  



  

(i) to the extent required by applicable Law, the Company may comply
with Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act;

Change in any disclosure document or communication filed or publicly issued or
made in conjunction with the compliance with such requirements; and

  



  

(ii) prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Company's
stockholders, the Company may engage in the activities described in
_Section 4.3(a)(B)_ and _Section 4.3(a)(C)_ with any Person who has made a
bona fide written Competing Proposal that did not result from a material
violation of _Section 4.3(a)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) no non-
public information may be furnished to such Person until the Company enters
into an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such Person;
_provided_   _further_ that any such Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement may
not contain provisions that prohibit the Company from complying with the
provisions of this _Section 4.3_ and the Company shall simultaneously provide
to Parent any information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries provided
to any other Person in connection with a Competing Proposal that was not
previously provided to Parent; (B) at least one Business Day prior to
engaging in any activities described in _Section 4.3(a)(B)_ or  _Section

prior to taking any such actions, the Company Board shall have reasonably
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and independent financial advisors, that such Competing Proposal is, or is
reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Proposal, and after consultation
with its outside counsel, the Company Board reasonably determines in good
faith that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 4.3_ ,
prior to the obtaining of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company
Board may (i) in the case of a Competing Proposal, make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(e)_ if the Company Board shall have reasonably determined in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and independent financial
advisors, that such Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and the
failure of the Company Board to take such action would be inconsistent with
the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law; or (ii) in the absence
of a Competing Proposal, and solely in response to a Company Intervening
Event, make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if the Company Board
shall have reasonably determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Company Board to make such
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Company Intervening Event
would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable
Law. The Company Board shall not make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
pursuant to _Section 4.3(c)(i)_ or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(e)_ unless prior to taking such action (A) the Company has given
Parent prior written notice (which notice shall (1) include a copy of the
proposed transaction agreements with the Person making such Superior Proposal,
(2) specify the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal
(including the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal), (3)
include a representation by the Company that such Superior Proposal was not,
after the date hereof, initiated, solicited, facilitated or knowingly
encouraged by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their
Representatives in any manner not permitted by this Agreement, and (4) inform

_Superior Proposal Notice_ "); (B) the Company has negotiated, and has caused
its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent, to the extent
Parent wishes to negotiate and so long as Parent negotiates in good faith,
during the period starting on the first Business Day following Parent's
receipt of the Superior Proposal Notice and ending at 11:59 p.m., Houston,
Texas time on the third Business Day following such receipt (such time, a "
_Superior Proposal Notice Period_ "), to enable Parent to revise the terms of
this Agreement such that it would cause such Competing Proposal to no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal; (C) none of the Company or any of
its Representatives shall have breached in any material respect any of the
provisions set forth in _Section 4.3_ in a manner related to such Superior
Proposal; and (D) at the end of such Superior Proposal Notice Period, the
Company Board shall have reasonably determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and independent financial advisors
and taking into account any changes to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such Competing Proposal,
that such Competing Proposal remains a Superior Proposal compared to Parent's
revised proposal. The parties agree that any amendment to the financial terms
or other material terms of a Superior Proposal following the delivery of a
Superior Proposal Notice in respect of such Superior Proposal shall require
delivery of another Superior Proposal Notice and another Superior Proposal
Notice Period in respect of such amended Superior Proposal, except that if
the only change to the Superior Proposal is a change in price, then the
Superior Proposal Notice Period shall be the greater of the remaining time of
the Superior Notice Period in effect prior to the delivery of such new
Superior Proposal Notice and the period starting on the first Business Day
following Parent's receipt of such new Superior Proposal Notice and ending at
11:59 p.m., Houston, Texas time on the second Business Day following such
receipt. The Company Board shall not make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to _Section 4.3(c)(ii)_ unless prior to taking such action,
(A) the Company has given Parent prior written notice (which notice shall (1)
provide a detailed description of the Company Intervening Event and (2)
inform Parent that the Company intends to make such Company Adverse
Recommendation Change at the end of the Company Intervening Event Notice
Period) (such notice being referred to herein as a " _Company Intervening
Event Notice_ "); (B) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its
Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent, to the extent Parent
wishes to negotiate, during the period starting on the first Business Day
following Parent's receipt of the Company Intervening Event Notice and ending
at 11:59 p.m., Houston, Texas time on the third Business Day following such
receipt (such time, a " _Company Intervening Event Notice Period_ "), to
enable Parent to revise the terms of this Agreement in such a manner that
would obviate the need for taking such action as a result of such Company
Intervening Event; and (C) following the end of such Company Intervening
Event Notice Period, the Company Board shall have considered in good faith
any changes to this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that notwithstanding such proposed changes, failure to take such actions in
response to a Company Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the
directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(d) The Company shall advise Parent, orally and in writing as
promptly as practicable (but in no event more than 24 hours of the

non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event within 24 hours, with

request.

4.4 _Parent Change in Recommendation_.

  



  

(a) Except as permitted in this _Section 4.4(a)_ , Parent may not

Parent Shareholder Approval, in the absence of any action by Parent or its

Parent Intervening Event make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change if the

the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law. The Parent Board shall
not make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless prior to taking such
action, (A) Parent has given the Company prior written notice (which notice
shall (1) provide a detailed description of the Parent Intervening Event and

following such receipt (such time, a " _Parent Intervening Event Notice
Period_ "), to enable the Company to revise the terms of this Agreement in
such a manner that would obviate the need for taking such action as a result
of such Parent Intervening Event; and (C) following the end of such Parent
Intervening Event Notice Period, the Parent Board shall have considered in
good faith any changes to this Agreement proposed in writing by the Company,
and shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside

with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

  



  

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change_ " shall mean (i) any failure to make the Parent Board Recommendation,
(ii) making any change, qualification, withholding, withdrawal or

its Representatives such information concerning the Company's and its
Subsidiaries' business, properties (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Company's and its Subsidiaries' Oil and Gas Properties), contracts, records
and personnel as may be reasonably requested, from time to time, by or on
behalf of the Parent. Parent and its Representatives shall conduct any such
activities in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries and there shall be
no invasive environmental testing without the prior consent of the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Company shall not be required to, or to
cause any of its Subsidiaries to, grant access or furnish information to
Parent or any of its Representatives to the extent that such information is
subject to an attorney-client privilege or attorney work-product doctrine
(other than title opinions relating to the Company's and its Subsidiaries'
Oil and Gas Properties) or that such access or the furnishing of such
information is prohibited by Law; and (ii) Parent shall not have access to
personnel records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to
individual medical histories or other information the disclosure of which
could subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to risk of significant
liability. Parent agrees that it will not, and will cause its Representatives
not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this _Section 5.1_ for any
purpose unrelated to the Transactions. The Confidentiality Agreement shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and shall apply to all
information furnished thereunder or hereunder.

5.2 _Preparation of Joint Proxy Statement; Form S-4_.

  



  

(a) Each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other
in the preparation of the preliminary and the definitive Joint
Proxy Statement, including all amendments or supplements to the preliminary
Joint Proxy Statement, and the Form S-4. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to prepare and file with the SEC the preliminary Joint Proxy
Statement and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the Form S-4, in
which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus, and each
party will use its respective reasonable best efforts to do so no later than
21 days following the date of this Agreement. No filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, the Form S-4 or Joint Proxy Statement will be made by Parent or
the Company, as applicable, without the Other Party's prior consent (which
shall not be reasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and without
providing the Other Party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
thereon. The Company or Parent, as applicable, shall notify the Other Party of
the receipt of any comments of the SEC with respect to the preliminary Joint
Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 and of any requests by the SEC for any
amendment or supplement thereto or for additional information and shall
provide to the Other Party, as promptly as reasonably practicable, copies of
all written correspondence between the Parent, Company or any Representative
of the Parent or Company, as applicable, and the SEC with respect to the
preliminary or definitive Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4. If any
comments are received from the SEC with respect to the preliminary Joint Proxy
Statement or Form S-4, the Company and Parent shall respond as promptly as
reasonably practicable to such comments. Parent and the Company shall, as
promptly as reasonably practicable, provide each other with such information
as may be required to be included in the Joint Proxy Statement or Form S-4 or
as may be reasonably required to respond to any comment of the SEC. After all
comments received from the SEC have been cleared by the SEC and all
information required to be contained in the Joint Proxy Statement and the Form
S-4 has been included therein, each of Parent and the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable and to keep the Form S-4
effective as long as necessary to consummate the Merger and the other
Transactions. The Company shall file the definitive Joint Proxy Statement
with the SEC and cause such definitive Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed
(including by electronic delivery if permitted) as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities
Act, to its stockholders of record, as of a record date reasonably established
by the Company Board in accordance with applicable Law.

_provided_ , _however_ , that unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, the
Company Stockholders Meeting shall not be adjourned or postponed to a date
that is more than 20 Business Days after the date for which the meeting was

5.4 _Consents; Regulatory Approvals_.

  



  

(a) Except to the extent that the parties' obligations are
specifically set forth elsewhere in this _Article V_ , upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties
shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
Other Parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
Merger, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary Consents and the taking
of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain a Consent from, or to
avoid an any Proceeding by, any Governmental Authorities; (ii) the obtaining
of all consents from (A) any third Persons as reasonably requested by Parent
and (B) the Persons set forth on _Schedule 5.4(a)_ of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, including the exercise or use, upon the reasonable request by
Parent, by the Company of all rights and remedies necessary or available
under the Contract under which the consent is sought (but excluding the
initiation of any Proceeding unless Parent and the Company mutually agree),
to procure the waivers or consents to assignment set forth in such _Schedule
5.4(a)_  of the Parent Disclosure Schedule; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with obtaining the consents
referred to in _clauses (A)_ and _(B)_ , (1) the Company shall not, without
the prior written consent of Parent, pay or commit to pay to any Person whose
consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration (other than any 
_de minimis_ amounts), nor incur or agree to incur any non- _de minimis_
liability for the benefit of such Person in connection therewith, and (2)
none of Parent, OpCo, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall
be required prior to the Closing to pay or commit to pay to any person whose
consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration (other than any 
_de minimis_ amounts), nor incur or agree to incur any non- _de minimis_
liability for the benefit of such Person in connection therewith); and (iii)
the execution and delivery of any additional instruments reasonably necessary
to consummate the Merger and to fully carry out the purposes of this
Agreement; _provided_ _further_ that the parties acknowledge that certain of
the Company's or its Subsidiaries' seismic licenses may require the payment of
transfer, consent or similar fees (including related expenses) in connection
with the consummation of the Transactions, and (x) the restrictions set forth
in the foregoing proviso will not apply to any such payments, (y) Parent and
the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each
other in connection with any transfer, consent or similar fees and (z) any

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the execution of
this Agreement, the parties shall make all premerger notification filings
required under (i) the HSR Act (which shall be made no later than ten Business
Days after the date hereof) and (ii) the jurisdictions outside of the United
States in which the Antitrust Laws require a notification to an Antitrust
Authority identified in _Schedule 5.4(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
and _Schedule 5.4(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule (together with the
HSR Act, the " _Merger Notification Rules_ "). Each of Parent and the Company
shall (A) cooperate fully with each other and shall furnish to the other such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may
reasonably request in connection with its preparation of any filings under
the Merger Notification Rules; (B) keep the Other Party reasonably informed
of any communication received by such party from, or given by such party to,
any Antitrust Authority, and of any communication received or given in
connection with any Proceeding by a private Person; and (C) to the extent
permitted by Law and to the extent practicable, permit the Other Party to
review and incorporate the Other Party's reasonable comments in any
communication given by it to any Antitrust Authority or in connection with
any Proceeding by a private Person related to any Antitrust Law with any
other Person, in each case regarding the Merger and in a manner that protects
attorney-client privilege or attorney work-product doctrine. Unless otherwise
agreed and without limiting the obligations stated in this _Section 5.4(b)_ ,
Parent and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to ensure
the prompt expiration of any applicable waiting period under any Merger
Notification Rules and obtain Consent by any relevant Antitrust Authority as
promptly as reasonably practicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
reasonable action by Parent to resist or reduce the scope of a Divestiture
Action shall be deemed consistent with such reasonable best efforts, even if
it delays such expiration to a later date (except that such date may not be
beyond the Outside Date). Further, without limiting the obligations stated in
this _Section 5.4(b)_ , Parent and the Company shall each use its reasonable
best efforts to respond to and comply with any request for information
regarding the Merger or filings under any Merger Notification Rules from any
Antitrust Authority. Parent and the Company shall consult with each other and
jointly determine all strategy and tactics regarding the direction of any
Proceedings or negotiations with any Antitrust Authority or other Person
relating to the Merger or filings under any Merger Notification Rules,
including any communications with any Antitrust Authority relating to any
contemplated or proposed Divestiture Action; provided, however, that in the
event Parent and Company cannot agree on any particular tactic or strategy
after good faith consultations, Parent shall have the right to make the final
determination. Neither party shall initiate, or participate in any meeting or
discussion with any Governmental Authority with respect to any
filings, applications, investigation, or other inquiry regarding the Merger
or filings under any Merger Notification Rules without giving the Other Party
reasonable prior notice of the meeting or discussion and, to the extent
permitted by the relevant Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend
and participate (which, at the request of either party, may be limited to
outside antitrust counsel only); _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the
Company nor Parent shall engage in any substantive communication with any
Governmental Authority with respect to any proposed Divestiture Action without
the consent of the Other Party. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the parties hereto agree that the reasonable best efforts of any
party hereto shall not be deemed to include (i) selling or otherwise
disposing of, or holding separate and agreeing to sell or otherwise dispose
of, assets, categories of assets or businesses of the Company or Parent or
their respective Subsidiaries (other than assets, categories or
businesses that are not material in the aggregate); (ii) terminating,
entering into or modifying existing relationships, contractual rights or
obligations of the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries; (iii)
terminating any venture or other arrangement; (iv) creating any relationship,
contractual rights or obligations of the Company or Parent or their respective
Subsidiaries or (v) effectuating any other change or restructuring of the
Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries (and, in each case, to
enter into agreements or stipulate to the entry of an order or decree or file
appropriate applications with any Antitrust Authority in connection with any
of the foregoing) (each a " _Divestiture Action_ "). The Company shall
cooperate with Parent and shall use its reasonable best efforts to assist
Parent in resisting and reducing any Divestiture Action. The parties
shall take their reasonable best efforts to share information protected from
disclosure under the attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product
doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant to this
_Section 5.4_ so as to preserve any applicable privilege or doctrine.

(c) The Company, Parent, Opco and Merger Sub and any of their
respective Affiliates shall not take any action with the intention to,
or that could reasonably be expected to, hinder or delay the obtaining of any
Consent of any Antitrust Authority under any Merger Notification Rule or
Antitrust Law or the expiration of the required waiting period under the
Merger Notification Rules or any other Antitrust Law; _provided_ , _however_
, that Parent may take any reasonable action to resist or reduce the scope of
a Divestiture Action, even if it delays such expiration to a later date
(except that such date may not be beyond the Outside Date).

  



  

5.5 _Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a) Parent shall take such action as may be necessary so that at the
Effective Time, and for one year thereafter, for the officers and
employees who are employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of
the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Employees_ ") and who remain
employed after the Closing by Parent or any of its Affiliates, including the
Company or its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Parent Group_ "), are
provided base salary, base wages and annual and incentive compensation
opportunities and employee benefits (excluding defined benefit, retiree
health and equity-based compensation arrangements) that, in the
aggregate, are substantially comparable to those made available by the
Company or its applicable Subsidiary to such officers and
employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. To the extent not
duplicative of benefits, for purposes of eligibility to
participate, calculation of benefits and vesting in all benefits provided by
the Parent Group to the Employees, the Employees will be credited under any
applicable Parent Group employee benefit plan with their years of benefits
eligibility service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and any
predecessors thereof to the extent such service was so recognized under
analogous Employee Benefit Plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to
the Effective Time. The eligibility of any Employee to participate in any
welfare benefit plan or program of the Parent Group shall not be subject to
any exclusions for any pre-existing conditions if such individual had met the
participation requirements of similar benefit plans and programs of the
Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Amounts paid before
the Effective Time by Employees under any health plans of the Company or its
Subsidiaries shall, after the Effective Time, be taken into account in
applying deductible and out-of-pocket limits applicable under the health plans
of the Parent Group to the same extent as if such amounts had, when paid,
been paid under such health plans of the Parent Group.

(b) The Company shall cooperate with Parent in respect of any
material contributions, other than in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, that may be required or requested by
applicable plan trustees or other applicable Governmental Authorities to any
Employee Benefit Plan, such cooperation to include providing Parent with
access to all meetings of or with the Persons requesting such contribution.
The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, notify Parent of any
such request for contribution or meeting or any other notice received from a
Governmental Authority in respect of any Employee Benefit Plan.

  



  

(c) The provisions contained in _Section 5.5(a)_ are included for
the sole benefit of the respective parties hereto and shall not create any
right in any other person, including any employee, former employee, or any
participant in any Employee Benefit Plan (or beneficiary thereof), including
any right to continued (or resumed) employment with Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries for any specified period
of any nature or kind whatsoever. No provision in _Section 5.5(a)_  shall (i)
constitute an amendment of, or an undertaking to amend, any Employee Benefit
Plan or any employee benefit plan of the Parent Group, or (ii) limit Parent's
or the Surviving Corporation's power to amend or terminate any
particular Employee Benefit Plan or any employee benefit plan of the Parent
Group or require (and the Company shall take no action that would require)
the Parent or Surviving Corporation to continue any particular Employee
Benefit Plan or any employee benefit plan of the Parent Group.

  



  

5.6 _Directors ' and Officers' Insurance_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding  _Section 1.4_ , Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not, for six years after the Effective Time, amend, repeal
or otherwise modify the Surviving Corporation Certificate of Incorporation or
Surviving Corporation Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation in any manner that
would affect adversely the rights thereunder or under the Company Certificate
of Incorporation or Company Bylaws of any Indemnified Person to
indemnification, exculpation and advancement except to the extent required by
Law. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and
honor any indemnification or exculpation agreements between the Company
and any of its directors, officers or employees existing immediately prior to
the Effective Time that are set forth on _Schedule 5.6(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will cause to be put in place, and Parent shall fully
prepay the premiums of a "tail" insurance policy or policies providing
insurance coverage in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the
Company's existing director and officer liability policies disclosed on
_Schedule 5.6(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule for matters, acts or
omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, with
a claims period of at least six years from the Effective Time, and from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's
current insurance carrier providing such insurance; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall Parent be required to spend more than 300% (the " _Cap
Amount_ ") of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date
hereof (the amount of such premium being set forth in _Schedule 5.6(b)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule) for the six years of coverage under such tail
policy; _provided_ _further_ that if the cost of such insurance exceeds the
Cap Amount, Parent shall purchase as much coverage as is reasonably obtainable
for the Cap Amount.

(c) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of
its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 5.6_.

  



  

(d) The provisions of this _Section 5.6_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the parties hereto and each Person
entitled to indemnification or insurance coverage or expense advancement
pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ , and such Person's heirs and representatives.

  



  

(e) For the purposes of this Agreement, " _Indemnified Person_ "
shall mean each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date
of this Agreement or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who acts as a fiduciary
under any Employee Benefit Plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

5.7 _Agreement to Defend; Stockholder Litigation_. In the event any
Proceeding by any Governmental Authority or other Person is commenced
that questions the validity or legality of the Transactions or seeks damages
in connection therewith, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their
respective reasonable best efforts to defend against and respond thereto;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 5.7_ shall limit the
parties' obligations under _Section 5.4_ hereof. The Company shall give
Parent reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of
any stockholder litigation against the Company and its directors relating to
any of the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such settlement
shall be agreed to without Parent's prior written consent (which consent may
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

  



  

5.8 _Public Announcements_. The parties hereto shall consult with
each other before issuing, and shall provide each other reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release and, to the extent
practicable, other public statements with respect to this Agreement or the
Transactions, and shall not issue any such press release or, to the extent
practicable, make any other public statement prior to such consultation,
except as Parent, Opco, Merger Sub or the Company may be required by
applicable Law or by their listing agreement with the NYSE or the NASDAQ
Global Select Market or as permitted by _Section 4.3_ , in which case such
party will, to the extent reasonably practicable, promptly inform the Other
Parties hereto in writing in advance of such disclosure.

5.9 _Advice of Certain Matters; Control of Business_. Subject to
compliance with all applicable Law, the Company and Parent, as the case may
be, shall confer on a regular basis with each other, report on operational
matters and shall promptly advise each other orally and in writing of any
change or event having, or that would be reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent
Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be. The Company and Parent shall
promptly provide each other (or their respective counsel) copies of all
filings made by such party or its Subsidiaries with the SEC or any other
Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision of the Company's operations.

  



  

5.10 _Financing_.

  



  

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, advisable or proper to consummate and obtain the Financing on the
terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter by the Closing,
including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect and comply
in all material respects with its obligations under the Debt Commitment
Letter, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to the funding of the
Financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive financing
agreements and (iii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with
respect thereto on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter (including after giving effect to any "market flex"
provisions in connection with the Financing) or, if available, on other terms
that are acceptable to Parent and would not adversely affect in any material
respect (including with respect to timing and conditionality) the ability of
Parent, Opco and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated herein
(the " _Debt Financing Agreements_ "). Parent shall keep the Company informed
on a regular basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to
arrange the Financing. Without limiting the effect of the foregoing, Parent
shall give the Company prompt notice of (i) any material breach or default by
any other party to the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing Agreements
of which Parent becomes aware, (ii) the receipt of any written notice or
other written communication with respect to any actual or potential breach,
default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt Commitment
Letter or any Debt Financing Agreement or any provision thereof or any
material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter or any Debt Financing Agreement with respect to the
obligations to fund the Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded
at the Closing, and (iii) the expiration or termination for any reason of the
Debt Commitment Letter or the commitments thereunder or if for any reason all
or any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable.

  



  

(b) Parent shall not, and shall not permit OpCo or Merger Sub to,
agree to or permit any termination, amendment, replacement, supplement or
other modification of, or waive any of its material rights under, the Debt
Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing Agreements without the Company's
prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); _provided_ that Parent, OpCo and Merger Sub may,
without the Company's prior written consent (i) enter into any amendment,
replacement, supplement or other modification to or waiver of any provision of
the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing Agreements that does not (w)
reduce the aggregate amount of net cash proceeds from the Financing below the
amounts otherwise required to be paid by Parent, OpCo or Merger Sub hereunder
in cash, (x) impose new or additional conditions to the funding of the
financing, (y) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub
to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter
or the Debt Financing Agreements or (z) otherwise contain any provisions that
would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impede
the consummation of the Financing or the Transactions; and (ii) amend the
Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, book runners,
syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the Debt
Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement so long as any such
addition would not reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or
materially impede the consummation of the Financing or the Transactions. For
the avoidance of doubt, each of Parent, OpCo or Merger Sub may, if it so
determines in its discretion, arrange for alternative financing for the
Transactions from a third party or parties (and thereafter the " _Debt
Commitment Letter_ " and " _Financing_ " as defined herein shall refer to
such financing commitment) on terms and conditions not less favorable to
Parent (taken as a whole), if such alternative financing does not contain any
provisions that would otherwise be prohibited by the proviso to the
immediately preceding sentence.

  



    

64

--- 

    



  



  

(c) In the event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on
the terms and conditions described in or contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter (including after giving effect to any "market flex" provisions in
connection with the Financing) for any reason, Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing from the
same or alternative sources (the " _Alternative Financing_ ") in an amount
sufficient and on terms and conditions not less favorable to Parent (taken as
a whole) and Company (with respect to the timing of closing and conditions to
funding) than those described in the Debt Commitment Letter to enable Parent
to fund the payment of Cash Consideration. If an Alternative Financing
is required in accordance with this _Section 5.10(c)_, Parent shall provide
the Company with a copy of any new financing commitment and any related fee
letter (such fee letter may be redacted only for confidential economic terms)
that provides for such Alternative Financing, and thereafter the " _Debt
Commitment Letter_ " as defined herein shall refer to such financing
commitment in respect of the Alternative Financing, such Alternative Financing
shall constitute the " _Financing_ " hereunder, the " _Financing Sources_ "
shall include the providers of the Alternative Financing and the "
_Debt Financing Agreements_ " shall refer to the definitive documents for the
Alternative Financing.

(d) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to provide to Parent, Opco and Merger Sub, and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to use its reasonable best efforts to provide, and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives, including legal
and accounting, to provide, in each case at Parent's sole expense, all
cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is customary in connection
with the arrangement of the Financing, the Alternative Financing or any
permitted replacement, amended, modified or alternative financing
(collectively with the Financing, the " _Available Financing_ " it being
understood that for purposes of this _Section 5.10_, for the avoidance of
doubt, Available Financing shall include any offering of debt securities or
incurrence of loans contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter) ( _provided_
that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the

8.8 _Severability; No Remedy in Certain Circumstances_. Each party
agrees that, should any court or other competent authority hold any
provision of this Agreement or part hereof to be null, void or unenforceable,
or order any party to take any action inconsistent herewith or not to take an
action consistent herewith or required hereby, the validity, legality and
enforceability of the remaining provisions and obligations contained or set
forth herein shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, unless the
foregoing inconsistent action or the failure to take an action constitutes a
material breach of this Agreement or makes this Agreement impossible to
perform, in which case this Agreement shall terminate. Except as otherwise
contemplated by this Agreement, to the extent that a party hereto took an
action inconsistent with this Agreement or failed to take action consistent
with this Agreement or required by this Agreement pursuant to an Order, such

Order.

any other remedy that may be available to it whether in law or equity,
including monetary damages (but only to the extent expressly permitted by
_Section 7.2(b)_ or _Section 7.3_ ) to seek and obtain in the courts
contemplated by _Section 8.7_ , (a) a decree or order of specific performance
to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant or obligation, and
(b) an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach. Each party
further agrees not to assert that any of the foregoing remedies is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to
object to such a remedy on the basis that a remedy of monetary damages would
provide an adequate remedy for any such breach. Each party
further acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in this
_Section 8.10_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without
these agreements, the Other Party would not enter into this Agreement.

  



  

8.11 _Amendment_. Prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, this Agreement may be amended at any time by all parties hereto.
Following the obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, no amendment to
this Agreement shall be effective if such amendment would require by Law the
further approval by the holders of Company Common Stock without first
obtaining such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

  



  

8.12 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective
boards of directors, may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts
of the Other Parties hereto; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto;
and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements, covenants or conditions
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument
signed on behalf of such party.

SIXTH: Unless and except to the extent that the bylaws of the Corporation

written ballot. The number of directors which shall constitute the entire
Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "Board") shall be fixed from time

SEVENTH: In furtherance of, and not in limitation of, the powers conferred

EIGHTH: Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between the

NINTH: (a) No director of the Corporation shall be liable to the Corporation
or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a
director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the director's duty of
loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions
not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing
violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the DGCL, or (iv) for any
transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.

  



   | (b)| Indemnification and Insurance.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(i) _Right to Indemnification_. (A) Each person who was or is made a
party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action,
suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she or a
person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was or has agreed
to become a director or officer of the Corporation or is or was serving or
has agreed to serve, at the request of the Corporation, in any capacity, with
any corporation, partnership or other entity in which the Corporation has a
partnership or other interest, including service with respect to employee
benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an
official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other
capacity while serving or having agreed to serve as a director or officer of
the Corporation, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to
the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as the same exists or may
hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the
extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader
indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide
prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including,
without limitation, attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or
penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or
suffered by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification
shall continue as to a person who has ceased to serve in the capacity which
initially entitled such person to indemnity hereunder and shall inure to the
benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators, and (B) the
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless in such manner any person
designated by the Board, or any committee thereof, as a person subject to
this indemnification provision, and who was or is made a party or is
threatened to be made a party to a proceeding by reason of the fact that he,
she or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was
serving at the request of the Board as a director, officer, employee or agent
of another corporation or a partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise whether such request is made before or after the acts taken or
allegedly taken or events occurring or allegedly occurring which give rise to
such proceeding; provided, however, that except as provided in subsection
(b)(ii) of this Article NINTH, the Corporation shall indemnify any such
person seeking indemnification pursuant to this subsection in connection with
a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such
proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board. The right to
indemnification conferred herein shall be a contract right based upon an
offer from the Corporation which shall be deemed to have been made to a person
subject to subsection (b)(i)(A) on the date this Certificate of Incorporation
is effective and to a person subject to subsection (b)(i)(B) on the date
designated by the Board, shall be deemed to be accepted, (i) in the case of a
person subject to subsection (b)(i)(A) by such person's service or continued
service as a director or officer of the Corporation for any period after the
offer is made and (ii) in the case of a person subject to subsection
(b)(i)(B), by such person's continued service in such capacity as such person
was serving when designated as subject to subsection (b)(i)(B) by the Board,
or any committee thereof, or if such person is no longer serving in such
capacity, by such person's written acceptance and, in each case, shall include
the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending
any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided further,
however, that if the DGCL requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a
current, former or proposed director or officer in his or her capacity as a
director or officer or proposed director or officer (and not in any other
capacity in which service was or is or has been agreed to be rendered by such
person while a director or officer, including, without limitation, service to
an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding,
shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or
on behalf of such indemnified person, to repay all amounts so advanced if it
shall ultimately be determined that such indemnified person is not entitled
to be indemnified under this Article NINTH or otherwise. The Corporation may,
by action of the Board, provide indemnification or advancement to employees or
agents of the Corporation with the same scope and effect as the foregoing
indemnification of directors and officers.

  



  

   


--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(ii) _Right of Claimant to Bring Suit_. If a claim under Section
(b)(i) of this Article NINTH is not paid in full by the Corporation
within thirty days after a written claim has been received by the
Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the
Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in
whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense
of prosecuting such claim to the fullest extent permitted by law. It shall be
a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim
for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its
final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has
been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards
of conduct which make it permissible under the DGCL for the Corporation to
indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such
defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation
(including its Board, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have
made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that
indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or
she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an
actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board, independent
legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such
applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a
presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

  



  

(iii) _Nonexclusivity of Rights_. The right to indemnification and the
advancement and payment of expenses conferred in this Article NINTH shall
not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have acquired or
hereafter acquires under any law (common or statutory), provision of this
Certificate of Incorporation, bylaw, agreement (including any indemnification
agreement or employment agreement with the Corporation), vote of stockholders
or disinterested directors or otherwise.

  



  

(iv) _Insurance_. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its
expense, to protect itself and any person who is or was serving as a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would
have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or
loss under the DGCL.

  



  

(v) _Nature of Rights_. The rights conferred upon indemnitees in this
Article NINTH shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to
an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and

BYLAWS

  



  

OF

  



  

[SURVIVING CORPORATION]

  



  

ARTICLE I 
  _OFFICES_

  



  

Section 1. _Registered Office_. The registered office of [Surviving
Corporation] (the " _Corporation_ ") required by the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") to be maintained in the State of
Delaware, shall be the registered office named in the original Second Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation (as the same may
be amended and restated from time to time, the " _Certificate of
Incorporation_ "), or such other office as may be designated from time to
time by the Board of Directors in the manner provided by law. Should
the Corporation maintain a principal office within the State of Delaware such
registered office need not be identical to such principal office of the
Corporation.

  



  

Section 2. _Other Offices_. The Corporation may have offices at
such other places both within and without the State of Delaware as the Board
of Directors may from time to time determine or as the business of the
Corporation may require.

  



  

ARTICLE II 
  _STOCKHOLDERS_

  



  

Section 1. _Place of Meetings_. All meetings of the stockholders
shall be held at the principal office of the Corporation, or at such other
place within or without the State of Delaware as shall be specified or fixed
in the notices or waivers of notice thereof.

  



  

Section 2. _Quorum; Adjournment of Meetings_. Unless otherwise
required by law or provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or these
bylaws, the holders of shares of stock with a majority of the voting power
entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall
constitute a quorum at any meeting of stockholders for the transaction of
business and the act of the holders of a majority of the voting power of such
stock so represented at any meeting of stockholders at which a quorum
is present shall constitute the act of the meeting of stockholders. The
stockholders present at a duly organized meeting may continue to transact
business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough
stockholders to leave less than a quorum. Shares of its own stock belonging
to the Corporation or to another corporation, if such shares of stock
represent a majority of the voting power entitled to vote in the election of
directors of such other corporation are held, directly or indirectly, by the
Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum
purposes; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of
the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation to vote stock, including
but not limited to its own stock, held by it in a fiduciary capacity.

Notwithstanding the other provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or
these bylaws, the chairman of the meeting or the holders of shares of
stock with a majority of the voting power present in person or represented by
proxy at any meeting of stockholders, whether or not a quorum is present,
shall have the power to adjourn such meeting from time to time, without any
notice other than announcement at the meeting of the time and place of the
holding of the adjourned meeting; provided, however, if the adjournment is for
more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is
fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be
given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. At any
such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented any
business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as
originally called.

  



  

Section 3. _Annual Meetings_. An annual meeting of the
stockholders, for the election of directors to succeed those whose terms
expire and for the transaction of such other business as may properly come
before the meeting, shall be held at such place, within or without the State
of Delaware, on such date, and at such time as the Board of Directors shall
fix and set forth in the notice of the meeting, which date shall be within
thirteen (13) months subsequent to the later of the date of incorporation or
the last annual meeting of stockholders.

  



  

Section 4. _Special Meetings_. Unless otherwise provided in the
Certificate of Incorporation, special meetings of the stockholders for any
purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board (if
any), by the chief executive officer or by a majority of the Board of
Directors, or by a majority of the executive committee (if any), and shall be
called by the Chairman of the Board (if any), by the chief executive officer
or the Secretary upon the written request therefor, stating the purpose
or purposes of the meeting, delivered to such officer, signed by the
holder(s) of at least 75 percent (75%) of the issued and outstanding stock
entitled to vote at such meeting.

  



  

Section 5. _Record Date_. For the purpose of determining
stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of
stockholders, or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to express consent to
corporate action in writing without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment
of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled
to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of
stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors of
the Corporation may fix, in advance, a date as the record date for any such
determination of stockholders, which date shall not be more than sixty (60)
days nor less than ten (l0) days before the date of such meeting, nor more
than sixty (60) days prior to any other action.

  



  

If the Board of Directors does not fix a record date for any meeting of the
stockholders, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at such meeting shall be at the close of business on the
day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if in accordance
with _Article VIII_ , _Section 3_ of these bylaws notice is waived, at the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is
held. If, in accordance with _Section 12_ of this _Article II_ ,
corporate action without a meeting of stockholders is to be taken, the record
date for determining stockholders entitled to express consent to such
corporate action in writing, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is
necessary, shall be the day on which the first written consent is expressed.
The record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at
the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the
resolution relating thereto.

  



  

   

2 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at
a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the
meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record
date for the adjourned meeting.

  



  

Section 6. _Notice of Meetings_. Written notice of the place, date
and hour of all meetings, and, in case of a special meeting, the purpose
or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be given by or at the
direction of the Chairman of the Board (if any) or the chief executive
officer, the Secretary or the other person(s) calling the meeting to each
stockholder entitled to vote thereat and shall be delivered not less than ten
(10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting, personally,
by electronic transmission or by mail. If mailed, notice is given when
deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the
stockholder at his or her address as it appears on the records of the
Corporation. The Corporation may provide stockholders with notice of a
meeting by electronic transmission provided such stockholders have consented
to receiving electronic notice.

  



  

Section 7. _Stock List_. A complete list of stockholders entitled
to vote at any meeting of stockholders, arranged in alphabetical order
for each class of stock and showing the address of each such stockholder and
the number of shares registered in the name of such stockholder, shall be
open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the
meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10)
days prior to the meeting, either on a reasonably accessible electronic
network, provided that the information required to gain access to the list is
provided with the notice of the meeting, or during ordinary business
hours, at the principal place of business of the Corporation. The stock list
shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during
the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is
present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote
communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any
stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible
electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be
provided with the notice of the meeting.

  



  

Section 8. _Proxies_. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting
of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to a corporate action in
writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for
him by proxy. Proxies for use at any meeting of stockholders shall be filed
with the Secretary, or such other officer as the Board of Directors may from
time to time determine by resolution, before or at the time of the meeting.
All proxies shall be received and taken charge of and all ballots shall
be received and canvassed by the secretary of the meeting who shall decide
all questions touching upon the qualification of voters, the validity of the
proxies, and the acceptance or rejection of votes, unless an inspector or
inspectors shall have been appointed by the chairman of the meeting, in which
event such inspector or inspectors shall decide all such questions.

  



  

No proxy shall be valid after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy
provides for a longer period. Each proxy shall be revocable unless
expressly provided therein to be irrevocable and coupled with an interest
sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power.

  



  

Should a proxy designate two or more persons to act as proxies, unless such
instrument shall provide the contrary, a majority of such persons present
at any meeting at which their powers thereunder are to be exercised shall
have and may exercise all the powers of voting or giving consents thereby
conferred, or if only one be present, then such powers may be exercised by
that one; or, if an even number attend and a majority do not agree on any
particular issue, each proxy so attending shall be entitled to exercise such
powers in respect of the same portion of the shares as he or she is of the
proxies representing such shares.

Section 9. _Voting; Elections; Inspectors_. Unless otherwise
required by law or provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, each
stockholder shall have one vote for each share of stock entitled to vote
which is registered in his or her name on the record date for the meeting.
Shares registered in the name of another corporation, domestic or foreign, may
be voted by such officer, agent or proxy as the bylaw (or comparable
instrument) of such corporation may prescribe, or in the absence of such
provision, as the Board of Directors (or comparable body) of such corporation
may determine. Shares registered in the name of a deceased person may be
voted by his or her executor or administrator, either in person or by proxy.

  



  

All voting, except as required by the Certificate of Incorporation or where
otherwise required by law, may be by a voice vote; provided, however, that
upon demand therefor by stockholders holding shares of stock representing a
majority of the voting power present in person or by proxy at any meeting a
written ballot vote shall be taken. All elections for directors shall be by
written ballot unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation.
Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or
these bylaws, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast by
the holders of shares of stock entitled to vote in the election of directors
at a meeting of stockholders at which a quorum is present. All other elections
and questions presented to the stockholders at a meeting at which a quorum is
present shall, unless otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation,
these by-laws, the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to
the Corporation, or applicable law or pursuant to any regulation
applicable to the Corporation or its securities, be decided by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the
shares of stock of the Corporation which are present in person or by proxy
and entitled to vote thereon. Every stock vote shall be taken by written
ballots, each of which shall state the name of the stockholder or proxy voting
and such other information as may be required under the procedure established
for the meeting..

  



  

At any meeting at which a vote is taken by ballots, the chairman of the
meeting may appoint one or more inspectors, each of whom shall subscribe an
oath or affirmation to execute faithfully the duties of inspector at such
meeting with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her
ability. Such inspector shall \\\l 4ascertain the number of shares of capital
stock of the Corporation outstanding and the voting power of each such share,
\\\l 4 determine the shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented at
the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, \\\l 4 count all votes
and ballots, \\\l 4 determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of
the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors,
and \\\l 4 certify their determination of the number of shares of capital
stock of the Corporation represented at the meeting and such inspectors' count
of all votes and ballots. Such certification and report shall specify such
other information as may be required by law. In determining the validity and
counting of proxies and ballots cast at any meeting of stockholders of the
Corporation, the inspectors may consider such information as is permitted by
applicable law. The chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to serve as
inspector, except no candidate for the office of director shall be appointed
as an inspector.

Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, cumulative
voting for the election of directors shall be prohibited.

  



  

Section 10.   _Conduct of Meetings_. The meetings of the stockholders
shall be presided over by the Chairman of the Board (if any), or if he or she
is not present, by the chief executive officer, or if neither the Chairman of
the Board (if any), nor chief executive officer is present, by a chairman
elected at the meeting. The Secretary of the Corporation, if present, shall
act as secretary of such meetings, or if he or she is not present, an
Assistant Secretary shall so act; if neither the Secretary nor an
Assistant Secretary is present, then a secretary shall be appointed by the
chairman of the meeting. The chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall
determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting, including
such regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of discussion as seem
to him in order. Unless the chairman of the meeting of stockholders shall
otherwise determine, the order of business shall be as follows:

directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly by the
Corporation and such shares shall not be counted for quorum purposes.

  



  

Section 12. _Action Without Meeting_. Unless otherwise provided in
the Certificate of Incorporation, any action permitted or required by law,
the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws to be taken at a meeting of
stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and
without a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken,
shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the
minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such
action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present
and voted. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a

ARTICLE III

Section 1. _Power; Number; Term of Office_. The business and affairs
of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of
Directors, and subject to the restrictions imposed by law or the Certificate
of Incorporation, they may exercise all the powers of the Corporation.

  



  

The number of directors of the Corporation shall be determined from time to
time by resolution of the Board of Directors, unless the Certificate of
Incorporation fixes the number of directors, in which case a change in the
number of directors shall be made only by amendment of the Certificate of
Incorporation. Each director shall hold office for the term for which he or
she is elected, and until his or her successor shall have been elected and
qualified or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal.

  



  

Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, directors need
not be stockholders nor residents of the State of Delaware.

  



  

Section 2. _Quorum_. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of
Incorporation, a majority of the total number of directors shall constitute a
quorum for the transaction of business of the Board of Directors and the vote
of a majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is
present shall be the act of the Board of Directors.

  



  

Section 3. _Place of Meetings; Order of Business_. The directors may
hold their meetings and may have an office and keep the books of the
Corporation, except as otherwise provided by law, in such place or places,
within or without the State of Delaware, as the Board of Directors may from
time to time determine by resolution. At all meetings of the Board of
Directors business shall be transacted in such order as shall from time to
time be determined by the Chairman of the Board (if any), or in his or her
absence by the chief executive officer, or by resolution of the Board of
Directors.

  



  

Section 4. _First Meeting_. Each newly elected Board of Directors
may hold its first meeting for the purpose of organization and the
transaction of business, if a quorum is present, immediately after and at the
same place as the annual meeting of the stockholders. Notice of such meeting
shall not be required.

  



  

Section 5. _Regular Meetings_. Regular meetings of the Board of
Directors shall be held at such times and places as shall be designated from
time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors. Notice of such regular
meetings shall not be required.

  



  

Section 6. _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the Board of
Directors may be called by the Chairman of the Board (if any), the chief
executive officer or, on the written request of any two directors, by the
Secretary, in each case on at least twenty-four (24) hours personal or
written notice or on at least twenty-four (24) hours notice by electronic
transmission to each director. Such notice, or any waiver thereof pursuant to
_Article VII_ , _Section 3_ hereof, need not state the purpose or purposes of
such meeting, except as may otherwise be required by law or provided for in
the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws.

--- 

 


--- 

    



  

Section 7. _Removal_. Any director or the entire Board of Directors
may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority of the
shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors; provided that,
unless the Certificate of Incorporation otherwise provides, if the Board of
Directors is classified, then the stockholders may effect such removal only
for cause; and provided further that, if the Certificate of Incorporation
expressly grants to stockholders the right to cumulate votes for the election
of directors and if less than the entire Board of Directors is to be removed,
no director may be removed without cause if the votes cast against his or her
removal would be sufficient to elect him or her if then cumulatively voted at
an election of the entire Board of Directors, or, if there be classes of
directors, at an election of the class of directors of which such director is
a part.

  



  

Section 8. _Vacancies; Increases in the Number of Directors_.
Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, vacancies and
newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized
number of directors may be filled by a majority of the directors then in
office, although less than a quorum, or a sole remaining director; and any
director so chosen shall hold office until the next annual election and until
his or her successor shall be duly elected and shall qualify, unless sooner
displaced.

  



  

If the directors of the Corporation are divided into classes, any directors
elected to fill vacancies or newly created directorships shall hold
office until the next election of the class for which such directors shall
have been chosen, and until their successors shall be duly elected and shall
qualify.

  



  

Section 9. _Compensation_. Unless otherwise restricted by the
Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors shall have the authority
to fix the compensation of directors.

  



  

Section 10. _Action Without a Meeting; Telephone Conference Meeting_.
Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation, any action
required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors, or
any committee designated by the Board of Directors, may be taken without a
meeting if all members of the Board of Directors or committee, as the case may
be, consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission, and the writing
or writings or electronic transmission or transmissions are filed with the
minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors or committee. Such consent
shall have the same force and effect as a unanimous vote at a meeting, and
may be stated as such in any document or instrument filed with the Secretary
of State of Delaware.

  



  

Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation, subject to
the requirement for notice of meetings, members of the Board of Directors, or
members of any committee designated by the Board of Directors, may
participate in a meeting of such Board of Directors or committee, as the case
may be, by means of a conference telephone or other communications equipment
by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each
other, and participation in such a meeting shall constitute presence in person
at such meeting, except where a person participates in the meeting for the
express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business on the
ground that the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

Section 11. _Approval or Ratification of Acts or Contracts by
Stockholders_. The Board of Directors in its discretion may submit any act or
contract for approval or ratification at any annual meeting of the

of Directors. The Chairman of the Board (if any), chief executive officer or a

certificates, under the seal of the Corporation or a facsimile thereof if the
Board of Directors shall have provided for such seal, and signed by the
Chairman of the Board (if any), chief executive officer or a Vice President
and the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or the Treasurer or an Assistant
Treasurer certifying the number of shares (and, if the stock of the
Corporation shall be divided into classes or series, the class and series of
such shares) owned by such stockholder in the Corporation; provided, however,
that any of or all the signatures on the certificate may be facsimile. The
stock record books and the blank stock certificate books shall be kept by the
Secretary, or at the office of such transfer agent or transfer agents as the
Board of Directors may from time to time by resolution determine. In case any
officer, transfer agent or registrar who shall have signed or whose facsimile
signature or signatures shall have been placed upon any such certificate or
certificates shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar
before such certificate is issued by the Corporation, such certificate may
nevertheless be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if such
person were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.
The stock certificates shall be consecutively numbered and shall be entered in
the books of the Corporation as they are issued and shall exhibit the
holder's name and number of shares. The Board of Directors may deem that any
outstanding shares of the Corporation will be uncertificated and registered in
such form on the stock books of the Corporation.

  



  

Section 2.   _Transfer of Shares_. Subject to the provisions of the
Certificate of Incorporation regarding the transfer of stock, the shares of
stock of the Corporation shall be transferable only on the books of the
Corporation by the holders thereof in person or by their duly authorized
attorneys or legal representatives upon surrender and cancellation of
certificates for a like number of shares. Subject to the provisions of the
Certificate of Incorporation and any other applicable agreements regarding
the transfer of stock, upon surrender to the Corporation or a transfer agent
of the Corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied
by proper evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer, it
shall be the duty of the Corporation to issue a new certificate to the person
entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon
its books.

Section 3.   _Ownership of Shares_. The Corporation shall be entitled
to treat the holder of record of any share or shares of capital stock of the
Corporation as the holder in fact thereof and, accordingly, shall not be bound
to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or

or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of the
State of Delaware.

  



  

Section 4.   _Regulations Regarding Certificates_. The Board of
Directors shall have the power and authority to make all such rules and
regulations as they may deem expedient concerning the issue, transfer and

issued in place of a certificate which is alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed; and may, in their discretion, require the owner of such
certificate or his or her legal representative to give bond, with sufficient
surety, to indemnify the Corporation and each transfer agent and registrar
against any and all losses or claims which may arise by reason of the issue
of a new certificate in the place of the one so lost, stolen or destroyed.

by the Treasurer or by the Assistant Secretary or Assistant Treasurer.

required to be given by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or under the
provisions of these bylaws, said notice shall be deemed to be sufficient if
given \\\l 4 by electronic transmission or \\\l 4 by deposit of the same in a
post office box in a sealed prepaid wrapper addressed to the person entitled
thereto at his or her post office address, as it appears on the records of
the Corporation, and such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the day
of such transmission or mailing, as the case may be.

  



  

Whenever notice is required to be given by law, the Certificate of
Incorporation or under any of the provisions of these bylaws, a written
waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, or a waiver by
electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or
after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice.
Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of
such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose
of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any
business on the grounds that the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.
Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or
special meeting of the stockholders, directors, or members of a committee of

in relying in good faith upon the books of account or reports made to the
Corporation by any of its officers, or by an independent certified public
accountant, or by an appraiser selected with reasonable care by the Board of
Directors or by any such committee, or in relying in good faith upon other
