Merger under the DGCL and to receive such consideration as may be determined
to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to and subject to
the requirements of the DGCL. If any such stockholder shall have failed to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right prior to the
Election Deadline, each of such holders shares of Premcor Common Stock shall
thereupon be deemed to be Non-Election Shares for all purposes of this
Article III. If any holder of Dissenting Shares shall have so failed to
perfect or has effectively withdrawn or lost such stockholders right to
dissent from the Merger after the Election Deadline, each of such holders
shares of Premcor Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted into and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to
receive the Stock Consideration or the Cash Consideration, or a combination
thereof, as determined by Valero in its sole discretion.

  



  

### (e) Subject to the provisions of this Section 3.1, each record holder of
shares of Premcor Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time to be converted in the Merger pursuant to Section 3.1(b) will be
entitled to elect to receive (i) the Cash Consideration for all of such
holders shares (" _Cash Election_ "), or (ii) the Cash Consideration for a
stated whole number of such holders shares and a number of shares of Valero
Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio per share of Premcor Common Stock
for the balance of such holders shares of Premcor Common Stock (" _Partial
Cash Election_ "), or (iii) a number of shares

  



  

10   

     
   

  



  

of Valero Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio per share of Premcor
Common Stock for all of such holders shares of Premcor Common Stock ("
_Stock Election_ "). All Cash Elections, Partial Cash Elections and Stock
Elections shall be unconditional and made on a form designed for that purpose
and mutually agreeable to Valero and Premcor (a " _Form of Election_ "). Any
holder of Premcor Common Stock who fails to properly make a Cash Election,
Partial Cash Election or Stock Election and any holder who fails to submit to
the Exchange Agent a properly completed and signed and properly and timely
submitted Form of Election shall be deemed to have indicated no preference as
to the receipt of cash or Valero Common Stock with respect to such holders
shares (a " _Non-Election_ ") and will receive for such Premcor Common Stock
the Merger Consideration described in Section 3.1(f), 3.1(g) or 3.1(h), as
applicable. Notwithstanding any other provision set forth herein, the
aggregate number of shares of Premcor Common Stock to be converted into the
right to receive cash in the Merger (which shall for this purpose be deemed
to include Dissenting Shares, if any) shall be equal to the Cash Election
Number.

  

### 

  

### (f) If the aggregate number of shares of Premcor Common Stock for which
cash is elected under a Cash Election or a Partial Cash Election and
Dissenting Shares, if any (collectively, the " _Cash Election Shares_ "),
exceeds the Cash Election Number, then all shares of Premcor Common Stock for
which Valero Common Stock was elected under a Stock Election or Partial Cash
Election (collectively, the " _Stock Election Shares_ ") and all shares of
Premcor Common Stock covered by Non-Elections (the " _Non-Election Shares_ ")
shall be converted into the right to receive Valero Common Stock, and the
Cash Election Shares (other than Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into
the right to receive cash and Valero Common Stock in the following manner:

  

### 

  

Each Cash Election Share (other than Dissenting Shares) shall be
converted into the right to receive (A) an amount of cash (rounded to the
nearest cent), without interest, equal to the product of (1) the Cash
Consideration and (2) a fraction (the " _Cash Fraction_ "), the numerator of
which shall be the Cash Election Number and the denominator of which shall be
the total number of Cash Election Shares and (B) a number of shares of Valero
Common Stock equal to the product of (1) the Exchange Ratio and (2) one minus
the Cash Fraction.

  



  

### (g) If the aggregate number of Stock Election Shares exceeds the Stock
Election Number, all Cash Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares shall
be converted into the right to receive cash, and all Stock Election Shares
shall be converted into the right to receive Valero Common Stock and cash in
the following manner:

  

### 

  

Each Stock Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive (A) a
number of shares of Valero Common Stock equal to the product of (1) the
Exchange Ratio and (2) a fraction (the " _Stock Fraction_ "), the numerator
of which shall be the Stock Election Number and the denominator of which
shall be the total number of Stock Election Shares, and (B) an amount of cash
(rounded to the nearest cent), without interest, equal to the product of (1)
the Cash Consideration and (2) one minus the Stock Fraction.

  



  

11   

     
   

  



  

### (h) In the event that neither Section 3.1(f) or 3.1(g) is applicable,
each Cash Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive the
Cash Consideration, each Stock Election Share shall be converted into the
right to receive the Stock Consideration and each Non-Election Share shall be
converted into the right to receive (A) an amount of cash (rounded to the
nearest cent), without interest, equal to the product of (1) the Cash
Consideration and (2) a fraction (the " _Non-Election Cash Fraction_ "), the
numerator of which shall be the Cash Election Number less the number of Cash
Election Shares and the denominator of which shall be the number of Non-
Election Shares, and (B) a number of shares of Valero Common Stock equal to
the product of (1) the Exchange Ratio and (2) one minus the Non-Election Cash
Fraction.

  

### 

  

### (i) Valero shall use all reasonable best efforts to cause copies of the
Form of Election (which shall contain a Letter of Transmittal) to be mailed
to holders of Premcor Common Stock so as to permit those holders to exercise
their right to make an Election prior to the Election Deadline. Valero shall
initially make available the Form of Election to holders of Premcor Common
Stock not less than 20 Business Days prior to the anticipated Election
Deadline and Valero and Premcor shall use all reasonable efforts to make
available as promptly as possible a Form of Election to any holder of Premcor
Common Stock that requests a Form of Election after the initial mailing of
the Form of Election and before the Election Deadline. In order to be
effective, a properly completed Form of Election must be received by the
Exchange Agent by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date the parties
shall agree is as near as practicable to three Business Days prior to the
expected Closing Date, taking into account Valero intention to minimize the
effect of certain limitations under Applicable Law that might apply during
the period from the initial mailing of the Form of Election until such date
(the " _Election Deadline_ "). The parties shall cooperate to issue a press
release reasonably satisfactory to the parties between five and 15 Business
Days prior to the Election Deadline. An election by a holder of Premcor
Common Stock shall be validly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have
timely received a Form of Election properly completed and executed (with the
signature or signatures thereon guaranteed as required by the Form
of Election) by that stockholder accompanied either by the Premcor
Certificate or Premcor Certificates representing all of the shares of Premcor
Common Stock owned by that stockholder, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise
in form acceptable for transfer on the books of Premcor, or by an appropriate
guarantee of delivery in the form customarily used in transactions of this
nature from a member of a national securities exchange, a member of the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., or a commercial bank or
trust company in the United States. All elections may be revoked until the
Election Deadline in writing by the record holders submitting Forms of
Election. Valero shall have the authority, in its sole discretion, to make
all determinations as to whether or not a Form of Election has been timely
received.

  

### 

  

### (j) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Cash
Election Number shall not be greater than the greatest number that would
permit the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.2(c) and
7.3(c).

  

### 

  

## 3.2 _Stock Options_. (a) Each option to purchase Premcor Common Stock (a "
_Premcor Stock Option_ ") granted under Premcor Stock Plans that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent
a right to acquire shares of Premcor Common Stock and shall be converted (as
so converted, a " _Premcor Converted Option_ "), at the Effective Time and
subject to the immediately following sentence, into an option to purchase
Valero

  



  

12   

     
   

  



  

Common Stock (a " _Valero Stock Option_ "), on the same terms and conditions
as were applicable under the Premcor Stock Option. The number of shares of
Valero Common Stock subject to each such Valero Stock Option shall be the
number of shares of Premcor Common Stock subject to the Premcor Stock Option
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary, to the nearest whole
share of Valero Common Stock, and such Valero Stock Option shall have
an exercise price per share (rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent)
equal to the per share exercise price of such Premcor Stock Option divided by
the Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , _however_ , that the exercise price and the
number of shares of Valero common stock purchasable pursuant to the
Premcor Converted Option shall be determined in a manner consistent with
the requirements of Section 409A of the Code; and _provided_ , _further_
, that in the case of any Premcor Stock Option to which Section 421 of the
Code as of the Effective Time (after taking into account the effect of
any accelerated vesting thereof) applies by reason of its qualification
under Section 422 of the Code, the exercise price, the number of shares
subject to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such
option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of
Section 424(a) of the Code. As of the Effective Time, Valero shall assume
the obligations of Premcor under the Premcor Stock Plans, and from and after
the Effective Time, except as otherwise set forth herein, the terms of each
Premcor Stock Option and the Premcor Stock Plan under which such Premcor
Stock Option was initially granted, in each case, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall continue to apply to the corresponding
Valero Stock Option.

  

## 

  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Premcor shall take all necessary action for
the adjustment of Premcor Converted Options under this Section 3.2. Valero
shall reserve for issuance a number of shares of Valero Common Stock at least
equal to the number of shares of Valero Common Stock that will be subject to
Premcor Converted Options. As soon as practicable following the Effective
Time, Valero shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any
successor, or if Form S-8 is not available, other appropriate, forms) with
respect to the shares of Valero Common Stock subject to Premcor Converted
Options and shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement
or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus
or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such options remain
outstanding.

  



  

## 3.3 _Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Valero shall appoint a
commercial bank or trust company, or a subsidiary thereof, mutually agreed
upon by Valero and Premcor to act as exchange agent in connection with the
Merger for the purpose of exchanging Premcor Certificates for the Merger
Consideration (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). At or prior to the Effective Time,
Valero shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of
holders of shares of Premcor Common Stock, (a) certificates representing
shares of Valero Common Stock and (b) cash, to be issued and paid pursuant to
Section 3.1(b) and Section 3.7 in respect of shares of Premcor Common Stock
converted pursuant to Section 3.1(b) in exchange for outstanding shares of
Premcor Common Stock upon due surrender of Premcor Certificates pursuant to
this Article III. Following the Effective Time, Valero agrees to make
available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient
to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 3.5. Any
cash and certificates representing Valero Common Stock deposited with the
Exchange Agent (including the amount of any dividends or other distributions
payable with respect thereto and such cash in lieu of fractional shares to be
paid pursuant to Section 3.7) shall hereinafter be referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_."

  



  

13   

     
   

  



  

## 3.4 _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Valero shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of a Premcor Certificate
(other than Premcor Certificates representing Dissenting Shares) that has not
timely submitted a properly completed and executed Form of Election
accompanied by an appropriately endorsed Certificate or Certificates
representing all of the shares of Company Common Stock owned by that
stockholder (or, alternatively, by an appropriate guarantee of delivery) (a)
a letter of transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") that shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Premcor
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Premcor
Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which Letter of Transmittal shall be
in customary form and have such other provisions as Valero or Premcor may
reasonably specify (such letter to be reasonably acceptable to Premcor and
Valero prior to the Effective Time) and (b) instructions for effecting the
surrender of such Premcor Certificates in exchange for the
Merger Consideration, together with any dividends and other distributions
with respect thereto and any cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
this Article III. Upon surrender of a Premcor Certificate to the Exchange
Agent together with such Letter of Transmittal or the Form of Election
pursuant to Section 3.1(i), duly executed and completed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Premcor Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) shares of Valero Common Stock
(which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical
certificate is requested by such holder or is otherwise required by
applicable law or regulation) representing, in the aggregate, the whole
number of shares that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 3.1 (in each case, after taking into account all shares of Premcor
Common Stock then held by such holder), (ii) a check in the amount equal to
the cash, if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 3.1, and (iii) a check in the amount equal to the cash, if any,
that such holder has the right to receive in lieu of any fractional shares of
Valero Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.7 and in respect of any dividends
and other distributions pursuant to Section 3.5. No interest will be paid or
will accrue on any cash payable pursuant to the provisions of this Article
III. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Premcor Common Stock that is
not registered in the transfer records of Premcor, one or more shares of
Valero Common Stock evidencing, in the aggregate, the proper number of shares
of Valero Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.1, a check in the proper amount
of cash representing Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1, a check in
the proper amount of cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Valero Common
Stock pursuant to Section 3.7 and any dividends or other distributions to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.5, may be issued with
respect to such Premcor Common Stock to such a transferee if the Premcor
Certificate representing such shares of Premcor Common Stock is presented to
the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes
have been paid.

  

## 

  

## 3.5 _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Premcor Certificate with respect to the
shares of Valero Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive
upon surrender of such Premcor Certificate, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares of Valero Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder
pursuant to Section 3.7, until such holder shall surrender such Premcor
Certificate in accordance with Section 3.1(i) or Section 3.4. Subject to the
effect of applicable laws, following the later of the surrender of any such
Premcor Certificate and the Effective Time, there shall be paid to the

  



  

14   

     
   

  



  

record holder thereof without interest, (a) promptly after such time, the
amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Valero Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.7 and the amount
of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Valero Common
Stock and (b) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time, but prior to
surrender, and a payment date subsequent thereto, payable with respect to
such whole shares of Valero Common Stock.

  

## 

  

## 3.6 _No Further Ownership Rights in Premcor Common Stock_. All shares of
Valero Common Stock issued and cash paid upon conversion of shares of Premcor
Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Article III (including any
cash paid pursuant to Section 3.5 or 3.7) shall be deemed to have been issued
or paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of
Premcor Common Stock.

  

## 

  

## 3.7 _No Fractional Shares of Valero Common Stock_. No certificates or
scrip or shares of Valero Common Stock representing fractional shares of
Valero Common Stock or book-entry credit of the same shall be issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Premcor Certificates, and such fractional share
interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of
a stockholder of Valero or a holder of shares of Valero Common Stock. In lieu
of any such fractional share, each holder of shares of Premcor Common Stock
who would otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of a share of Valero
Common Stock either pursuant to Section 3.1(b) upon surrender of Premcor
Certificates or pursuant to Section 3.1(a) (determined in each case after
taking into account all Premcor Certificates delivered by such holder) shall
be paid, in the case of conversion pursuant to Section 3.1(b), upon such
surrender or, in the case of conversion pursuant to Section 3.1(a), as soon
as practicable after the Effective Time, cash (without interest) in an amount
equal to the value (determined with reference to the closing price of a share
of Valero Common Stock as reported on the NYSE Composite Tape on the last
full trading day immediately prior to the Closing Date) of such fractional
interest. Such payment with respect to fractional shares is merely intended
to provide a mechanical rounding off of, and is not a separately bargained
for, consideration.

  

## 

  

## 3.8 _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Premcor Certificates one year after
the Effective Time shall, at Valeros request, be delivered to Valero or
otherwise on the instruction of Valero, and any holders of Premcor
Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article III shall
after such delivery look only to Valero for the Merger Consideration with
respect to the shares of Premcor Common Stock formerly represented thereby to
which such holders are entitled pursuant to Sections 3.1 and 3.4, any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Valero Common Stock to which such holders are
entitled pursuant to Section 3.7 and any dividends or distributions with
respect to shares of Valero Common Stock to which such holders are entitled
pursuant to Section 3.5. Any such portion of the Exchange Fund remaining
unclaimed by holders of shares of Premcor Common Stock immediately prior to
such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by law, become the
property of Valero free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

  



  

15   

     
   

  



  

## 3.9 _No Liability_. None of Valero, Premcor or the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration from the Exchange
Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.

  

## 

  

## 3.10 _Investment of the Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest
any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Valero on a daily
basis; _provided_ that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the
amounts payable or the timing of the amounts payable to Premcor stockholders
pursuant to the other provisions of this Article III. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall promptly be paid to Valero.

  

## 

  

## 3.11 _Lost Certificates_. If any Premcor Certificate (other than any
Premcor Certificate representing Dissenting Shares) shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Premcor Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Valero, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as Valero may direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Premcor Certificate,
following the Effective Time the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Premcor Certificate the Merger Consideration
with respect to the shares of Premcor Common Stock formerly represented
thereby, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Valero Common Stock, and
unpaid dividends and distributions on whole shares of Valero Common Stock
deliverable in respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.

  

## 

  

## 3.12 _Withholding Rights_. Valero shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld or paid over to or deposited with the
relevant Governmental Entity by Valero, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Valero.

  

## 

  

## 3.13 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers
and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Surviving Corporation or Premcor,
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in
the name and on behalf of the Surviving Corporation or Premcor, any other
actions and things necessary to vest, perfect or confirm of record or
otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest
in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be
acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with,
the Merger.

  

## 

  

## 3.14 _Stock Transfer Books_. The stock transfer books of Premcor shall be
closed immediately upon the Effective Time, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Premcor Common Stock thereafter on the
records of Premcor. On or after the Effective Time, any Premcor Certificates
presented to the Exchange Agent, Valero or the Surviving Corporation for any
reason shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
with respect to the shares of Premcor Common Stock formerly represented
thereby (including any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Valero Common
Stock to which the holders thereof are

  



  

16   

     
   

  



  

entitled pursuant to Section 3.7, and any dividends or other distributions to
which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 3.5).

## 4.1 _Representations and Warranties of Premcor_. Except as disclosed in
the section of the Premcor disclosure schedule delivered to Valero
concurrently with this Agreement (the " _Premcor Disclosure Schedule_ ")
corresponding to the subsection of this Section 4.1 to which such disclosure
applies, Premcor hereby represents and warrants to Valero as follows:

  

## 

  

### (a) _Corporate Organization_. (i) Premcor is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Delaware. Premcor has the corporate power and authority to own or lease
all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it
makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to
be so licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Premcor. True and complete
copies of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the
Amended and Restated By-Laws of Premcor, as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, have previously been made available by Premcor to Valero.

  

### 

  

(ii) Each Subsidiary of Premcor (A) is duly organized and validly existing
under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (B) is duly qualified to
do business and in good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal,
state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of property or the
conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and in which the
failure to be so qualified would, individually or in the aggregate with all
other such failures by Subsidiaries of Premcor, have a Material Adverse
Effect on Premcor, and (C) has all requisite corporate (or, as applicable,
equivalent partnership or company) power and authority to own or lease its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted.

  



  

### (b) _Capitalization_. (i) The authorized capital stock of Premcor
consists of (A) 150,000,000 shares of Premcor Common Stock, of which, as of
March 4, 2005, 89,216,910 shares were issued and outstanding and no shares
were held in treasury and (B) 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Premcor (" _Premcor Preferred Stock_ ," together with the
Premcor Common Stock, the " _Premcor Capital Stock_ "), of which no shares
are issued and outstanding. From March 4, 2005, to the date of this
Agreement, no shares of Premcor Capital Stock have been issued except
pursuant to the exercise of Premcor Stock Options granted under the Premcor
2002 Special Stock Incentive Plan, the Premcor 2002 Equity Incentive Plan or
the Premcor 1999 Stock Incentive Plan, each as in effect as of the date of
this Agreement (the " _Premcor Stock Plans_ "). Except pursuant to the terms
of Premcor Stock Options granted pursuant to Premcor Stock Plans and
outstanding as of the date of this Agreement, Premcor does not have and is
not bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls,
commitments or agreements of any character calling for the purchase
or issuance of any shares

  



  

17   

     
   

  



  

of Premcor Capital Stock or any other equity securities of Premcor or any
securities of Premcor representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive
any shares of Premcor Capital Stock. As of March 4, 2005, no shares of
Premcor Capital Stock were reserved for issuance, except for 9,267,675 shares
of Premcor Common Stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of Premcor
Stock Options pursuant to the Premcor Stock Plans. Premcor has no Voting Debt
issued or outstanding. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, the total number of shares of
Premcor Common Stock that are issued and outstanding and that are then
issuable, or that may become issuable in the future, with respect to any
outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or
agreements of any character, shall not exceed 96,650,000. No Subsidiary of
Premcor owns any capital stock of Premcor.

  

### 

  

(ii) Premcor owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock or other equity ownership or voting interests of each
Subsidiary of Premcor, free and clear of any liens, pledges, charges,
encumbrances and security interests whatsoever (" _Liens_ "), and all of such
shares or equity ownership or voting interests are duly authorized and
validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership
thereof. No Subsidiary of Premcor has or is bound by any outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any
character calling for the purchase, issuance or voting of any shares of
capital stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary or any
securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares
of capital stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary. Section
4.2(b)(ii) of the Premcor Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of each
material investment of Premcor in any corporation, joint venture,
partnership, limited liability company or other entity other than its
Subsidiaries, that, individually or taken together in the aggregate, would be
considered a Significant Subsidiary if such investment constituted control of
such entity (each a " _Non-Subsidiary Affiliate_ ").

  



  

### (c) _Authority; No Violation_. (i) Premcor has full corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, have
been duly and validly approved by the Board of Directors of Premcor. The
Board of Directors of Premcor has directed that this Agreement be submitted
to Premcor stockholders for approval at a meeting of Premcor stockholders for
the purpose of approving the Merger and this Agreement (the " _Premcor
Stockholders Meeting_ "), and, except for the approval of the Merger and of
this Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Premcor Common Stock (the " _Premcor Stockholder
Approval_ "), no other corporate proceedings on the part of Premcor are
necessary to approve this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by Premcor and (assuming due authorization, execution
and delivery by Valero) constitutes a valid and binding obligation of
Premcor, enforceable against Premcor in accordance with its terms.

  

### 

  

(ii) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Premcor, nor the
consummation by Premcor of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor
compliance by Premcor with any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement,
will (A) violate any

  



  

18   

     
   

  



  

provision of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the
Amended and Restated By-Laws of Premcor, or (B) assuming that the consents
and approvals referred to in Section 4.1(d) are duly obtained, (1) violate
any statute, code, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ, decree
or injunction applicable to Premcor, any of its Subsidiaries or Non-
Subsidiary Affiliates or any of their respective properties or assets or (2)
violate, conflict with, result in a breach of any provision of or the loss of
any benefit under, constitute a default (or an event that, with notice or
lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) under, result in the
termination of or a right of termination or cancellation under, accelerate
the performance required by, accelerate any right or benefit provided by, or

#### (iii) Section 4.1(l)(iii) of the Premcor Disclosure Schedule identifies
each Premcor Plan that is intended to be a "qualified plan" within the

respect to each Premcor Qualified Plan and the related trust, and such
determination letter has not been revoked. No circumstances exist and no
events have occurred that could adversely affect the qualified status of any
Premcor Qualified Plan or the related trust, which could not be corrected

23

Guaranty Corporation (the " _PBGC_ ") have been timely paid in full; (E) no
liability (other than for premiums to the PBGC) under Title IV of ERISA has
been or is expected to be incurred by Premcor or any of its Subsidiaries; and
(F) the PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate any such Premcor
Plan and, to Premcors knowledge, no condition exists that presents a risk

any Governmental Entity, including, but not limited to, ERISA and the Code,
and (B) there are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims for
benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations that have been
asserted or instituted against the Premcor Plans, any fiduciaries thereof
with respect to their duties to the Premcor Plans or the assets of any of the
trusts under any of the Premcor Plans that could reasonably be expected to

## 6.1 _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meeting_. (a) As
promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
Valero and Premcor shall cooperate in preparing and each shall cause to be
filed with the SEC mutually acceptable proxy materials that shall constitute
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and Valero shall prepare and file with the SEC
the Form S-4. The Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included as a prospectus
in and will constitute a part of the Form S-4 as Valeros prospectus. Each of
Valero and Premcor shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus cleared by the SEC and the Form S-4 declared effective
by the SEC and to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as is necessary to
consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. Valero and
Premcor shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide each
other with copies of any written comments, and advise each other of any oral
comments, with respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Form S-4 received
from the SEC. The parties shall cooperate and provide the other party with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 prior to filing such with
the SEC and will provide each other with a copy of all such filings made with
the SEC. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, no
amendment or supplement (including by incorporation by reference) to the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 shall be made without the approval
of both Valero and Premcor, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed; _provided_ that, with respect to documents filed by a party that
are incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
this right of approval shall apply only with respect to information relating
to the transactions contemplated

  



  

39   

     
   

  



  

hereby or to the other party or its business, financial condition or results
of operations. Premcor will use reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to Premcor stockholders as promptly as
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities
Act. Each party will advise the other party, promptly after it receives
notice thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective, the
issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Valero
Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4. If, at any time prior to the Effective
Time, any information relating to Valero or Premcor, or any of their
respective Affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by Valero or
Premcor and such information should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus so
that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party discovering such information shall promptly notify the
other party and, to the extent required by law, rules or regulations, an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of Premcor.

  

## 

  

(b) Premcor shall duly call and give notice of the Premcor Stockholders
Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the Premcor Stockholder Approval and
such other matters as the Board of Directors of Premcor may direct, and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Premcor Stockholders Meeting to
occur as soon as reasonably practicable. The Board of Directors of Premcor
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Premcor Stockholder
Approval.

  



  

## 6.2 _Access to Information_. Upon reasonable notice, each party shall (and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford to the officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives of the
other party reasonable access during normal business hours, during the period
prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts,
commitments, records, officers and employees and, during such period, such
party shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the
other party (a) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and
other document filed, published, announced or received by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities laws or
the HSR Act, as applicable (other than documents that such party is not
permitted to disclose under applicable law), and (b) all other information
concerning it and its business, properties and personnel as such other party
may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that either party may
restrict the foregoing access to the extent that any law, treaty, rule or
regulation of any Governmental Entity applicable to such party or any
contract requires such party or its Subsidiaries to restrict or
prohibit access to any such properties or information. The parties will hold
any information obtained pursuant to this Section 6.2 in confidence in
accordance with, and shall otherwise be subject to, the provisions of the
confidentiality agreement dated March 22, 2005, between Premcor and Valero
(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which Confidentiality Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect. Any investigation by either Valero or
Premcor shall not affect the representations and warranties of the other.

  

## 

  

## 6.3 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, each party will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all

  



  

40   

     
   

  



  

actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable under this Agreement and applicable laws and regulations
to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, including
(i) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to
effect all necessary applications, notices, petitions, filings, and other
documents and to obtain as promptly as practicable all Necessary Consents and
all other consents, waivers, licenses, orders, registrations, approvals,
permits, rulings, authorizations and clearances necessary or advisable to be
obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in order to
consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (collectively, the " _Required Approvals_ ") and (ii) taking all
reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain all such Necessary Consents
and the Required Approvals. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, each of Valero and Premcor agrees (i) to make (A) as promptly as
practicable, but in any event prior to May 9, 2005, an appropriate filing of
a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, and (B) as promptly as practicable all
other necessary filings with other Governmental Entities relating to the
Merger, and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information
or documentation that may be requested pursuant to such laws or by such
authorities and to use reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration
or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and the
receipt of Required Approvals under such other laws or from such authorities
as soon as practicable and (ii) not to extend any waiting period under the
HSR Act or enter into any agreement with the FTC or the DOJ not to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior
written consent of the other party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
neither Valero nor Premcor nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be
required (1) to hold separate (including by trust or otherwise) or to divest,
or agree to hold separate or divest, any of their respective businesses or
assets (including, without limitation, any refinery or related assets) or any
interest therein, or (2) to take or agree to take any other action or agree
to any limitation, restriction or condition that could reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Valero or Premcor or substantially
impair the benefits to Valero expected, as of the date of this Agreement, to
be realized from consummation of the Merger, and neither Valero nor Premcor
shall be required to agree to take any action that is not conditional on the
consummation of the Merger.

  

## 

  

(b) Each of Premcor and Valero shall, in connection with the efforts
referenced in Section 6.3(a) to obtain all Required Approvals, use its
reasonable best efforts, but in any event subject to applicable law, to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry,
including any proceeding initiated by a private party, (ii) subject
to applicable law, permit the other party to review in advance any
proposed written communication between it and any Governmental Entity, (iii)
promptly inform each other of (and, at the other partys reasonable request,
supply to such other party) any communication (or other correspondence or
memoranda) received by such party from, or given by such party to, the DOJ,
the FTC or any other Governmental Entity and of any material communication
received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in
each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iv)
consult with each other in advance to the extent practicable of any meeting
or conference with the DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental Entity or, in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person, and
to the extent

  



  

41   

     
   

  



  

permitted by the DOJ, the FTC or such other applicable Governmental Entity or
other Person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate
in such meetings and conferences.

  



  

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in Sections 6.3(a) and 6.3(b), if any administrative or judicial
action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any regulatory law, or if any
statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, injunction
or administrative order is enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced by
a Governmental Entity that would make the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby illegal or would otherwise prohibit or
materially impair or delay the consummation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby, each of Premcor and Valero shall cooperate
in all respects with each other and use its respective reasonable best
efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to have such statute,
rule, regulation, executive order, decree, injunction or administrative order
repealed, rescinded or made inapplicable so as to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Section 6.3 shall
limit a partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b)
or 8.1(c) so long as such party has up to then complied with its obligations
under this Section 6.3.

  



  

(d) Each of Valero and Premcor and their respective Boards of Directors
shall, if any state takeover statute or similar statute becomes applicable to
this Agreement, the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby,
take all action reasonably necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise to minimize the
effect of such statute or regulation on this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

## 6.4 _Acquisition Proposals_. (a) Premcor agrees that neither it nor any of
its Subsidiaries nor any of its and its Subsidiaries directors, officers and
Affiliates shall, and that it shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its and its Subsidiaries employees, agents and representatives (including
any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its
Subsidiaries, "Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly,
(i) initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or
proposals with respect to, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations
concerning, or (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information or
data to, or have or participate in any discussions with, any Person relating
to, any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that, in the event that, following
the date of this Agreement, Premcor receives an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal not in breach of this Section 6.4, Premcor may, and may
permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries Representatives to,
furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information or data and
participate in such negotiations or discussions to the extent that the Board
of Directors of Premcor concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice
of its outside counsel) that failure to take such actions would result in a
violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided_ _further_
that, prior to providing any nonpublic information permitted to be provided
pursuant to the foregoing proviso, Premcor

  



  

42   

     
   

  



  

shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on
terms no less favorable to it than the Confidentiality Agreement. Premcor
shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities,
discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with
any Persons other than Valero, with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.
Premcor will promptly (within one day) advise Valero in writing following
receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry that could reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and shall keep Valero fully
informed of the substance thereof (including the identity of the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal and material terms thereof), and will keep
Valero apprised of any related developments, discussions and negotiations on
a current basis. Premcor shall use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any
confidentiality or standstill agreements to which it or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party in accordance with the terms thereof. Premcor agrees
to promptly inform its Subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, agents and Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this
Section 6.4. Nothing in this Section 6.4 shall (A) permit Premcor
to terminate this Agreement or (B) affect or limit any other obligation of
Valero or Premcor under this Agreement.

  

## 

  

### (b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Premcor or its
Board of Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the
Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that such
Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant
to such Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.

  

### 

  

## 6.5 _Fees and Expenses_. Subject to Section 8.2, whether or not the Merger
is consummated, all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring
such Expenses, except Expenses incurred in connection with the filing,
printing and mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and Form S-4, which
shall be shared equally by Valero and Premcor.

  

## 

  

## 6.6 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. Following
the Effective Time, Valero shall (i) indemnify and hold harmless, and provide
advancement of expenses to, all past and present directors, officers and
employees of Premcor and its Subsidiaries (in all of their capacities) (A) to
the same extent such persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement
of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by Premcor pursuant to Premcors
Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws and indemnification agreements, if any,
in existence on the date of this Agreement with, or for the benefit of, any
directors, officers and employees of Premcor and its Subsidiaries and (B)
without limitation to clause (A), to the fullest extent permitted by law, in
each case for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby),
(ii) include and cause to be maintained in effect in the Surviving
Corporations (or any successor to the business of the Surviving Corporation)
certificate of incorporation and by-laws for a period of six years after the
Effective Time, provisions regarding elimination of liability of directors,
indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement of
expenses that are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions contained in the current
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the Amended and
Restated By-laws of Premcor and (iii) cause to be maintained by the Surviving
Corporation (or any successor to the business of the Surviving Corporation)
for a period of six years after the Effective Time the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance

  



  

43   

     
   

  



  

and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by Premcor ( _provided_  that
Valero (or any such successor) may substitute therefor one or more policies
of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions
that are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to the insured) with respect
to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Valero (or
any such successor) be required to expend in any one year an amount in excess
of 200% of the annual premiums currently paid by Premcor for such insurance;
and, _provided_ _further,_ that if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, Valero (or any such successor) shall obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such
amount. The obligations of Valero (or any such successor) under this Section
6.6 shall not be terminated or modified following the Effective Time in such
a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this Section 6.6
applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee (it being expressly
agreed that the indemnitees to whom this Section 6.6 applies and their
respective heirs and other representatives shall be third-party beneficiaries
of, and entitled to enforce, this Section 6.6).

  

## 

  

## 6.7 _Employee Benefits_. (a) Following the Effective Time until December
31, 2006 (such period referred to herein as the " _Benefit Protection
Period"_ ), except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.7, Valero shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, to individuals who are employees of
Premcor and its Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective Time and who
continue to be employed by Valero and its Subsidiaries after the Effective
Time (other than those covered by a collective bargaining agreement) (the "
_Premcor Employees_ ") compensation and employee benefits (other than
compensation and benefits under any Premcor Stock Plans) that are, in the
aggregate, not less favorable than those generally provided to Premcor
Employees as of the date of this Agreement, as disclosed by Premcor to Valero
immediately prior to the date of this Agreement. After the expiration of the
Benefit Protection Period, Valero shall provide, or cause to be provided, to
Premcor Employees compensation and employee benefit plans and programs that
are, in the aggregate, not less favorable than those generally provided to
other similarly situated employees of Valero and its Subsidiaries. After the
Effective Time, the equity-based benefits to be provided to an eligible
Premcor Employee shall be pursuant to the equity-based benefit plans and
programs provided to similarly situated employees of Valero and its
Subsidiaries. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent the
termination of employment of any Premcor Employee; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that in the event of a qualifying termination (which shall not include a
termination for cause or voluntary resignation) of any Premcor Employee
during the Benefit Protection Period, Valero shall provide, or cause to be
provided, to such terminated Premcor Employee severance benefits that are not
less than the amount of severance benefits that would have been payable under
the terms of the Premcor severance plan or policy attached to Section 6.7(a)
of the Premcor Disclosure Schedule as in effect as of the date of
this Agreement that is applicable to any such Premcor Employee, subject to
such Premcor Employees execution of a release of claims in the form
regularly used by Valero with respect to similarly situated employees and the
expiration of any applicable revocation period.

  

## 

  

### (b) For all purposes under the employee benefit plans of Valero and its
Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Premcor Employee after the Effective
Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Premcor Employee shall be credited with his
or her years of service with Premcor and its Subsidiaries and predecessor
employers before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Premcor
Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service

any similar Premcor Benefit Plans, except (i) to the extent such credit would
result in a duplication of benefits and (ii) for credit for benefit accrual
purposes under any defined benefit pension plan and any retiree medical plan.
In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each
Premcor Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New
Plan replaces coverage under a Premcor Benefit Plan in which such Premcor
Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans,
collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Premcor Employee, Valero shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions
and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such
employee and his or her covered dependents, and Valero shall cause any
eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents
during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such
employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken
into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

  

### 

  

### (c) Valero will honor, in accordance with their terms, all vested and
accrued benefit obligations to, and contractual rights of, current and former
employees of Premcor and its Subsidiaries to the extent that they are
disclosed on Premcors Disclosure Schedules. Nothing in this Agreement
shall be interpreted as preventing Valero from amending, modifying
or terminating any Premcor Benefit Plan or other contract, arrangement,
commitment or understanding, in accordance with its terms and applicable law.

  



  

### (d) Valero hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" within the
meaning of (i) each Premcor Stock Plan with respect to Premcor Stock Options
outstanding on the date of this Agreement and (ii) the Premcor agreements in
effect on the date of this Agreement and listed on Section 6.7(d) of the
Premcor Disclosure Schedule will occur on the Effective Time.

  

###

Employees who are covered under a collective bargaining agreement shall be
provided the benefits that are required by such collective bargaining
agreement from time to time.

  

###

effects of Sections 280G and 409A of the Code on Premcor, Premcor employees
and directors and Valero.

efforts to develop a joint communications plan and each shall use reasonable
best efforts (i) to ensure that all press releases and other public
statements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
consistent with such joint communications plan and (ii) unless otherwise
required by applicable law or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with or rules of any securities exchange, to consult with each
other before issuing any press release or, to the extent practical, otherwise
making any public statement or broadly disseminated employee communication
with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. In
addition to the foregoing, except to the extent disclosed in or consistent
with the Proxy Statement/Prospectus in accordance with the provisions of

necessary to reflect changes from the date thereof. Premcor shall use

## 6.11 _Section 16 Matters_. In order to most effectively compensate and
retain Premcor Insiders (as defined below) in connection with the Merger,

Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection
with the conversion of shares of Premcor Common Stock and Premcor Stock
Options into shares of Valero Common Stock and Valero Stock Options in the

resulting from the transactions contemplated by Article II or Article III of
this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
Premcor or will become subject to such reporting requirements with respect to
Valero pursuant to the Merger (each such person, a " _Premcor Insider_ "), to
be exempt, to the extent permitted by law, under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act.

such debt in order to avoid default thereunder, which Premcor Indebtedness is
listed in Section 6.12 of the Premcor Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the
" _Assumed Indentures_ "), Valero shall execute and deliver to the trustees
or other representatives in accordance with the terms of the respective
Assumed Indentures, supplemental indentures or other instruments, in form
satisfactory to the respective trustees or other representatives, expressly
assuming the obligations of Premcor with respect to the due and punctual
payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on,

  



  

46   

     
   

  



  

and conversion obligations under, all debt securities issued by Premcor under

covenants and conditions of the Assumed Indentures to be kept or performed by

to the respective trustees or other representatives under the Assumed
Indentures. The parties agree that on and after the date of this Agreement
Valero may enter into and effect financing transactions, including but not
limited to offerings and issuances of debt, equity or other securities, in
connection with or in furtherance of this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

to cause to be delivered to Valero a letter from its independent public
accountants addressed to Valero, dated a date within two Business Days before
the date on which the Form S-4 or other registration forms under the
Securities Act shall become effective, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Valero and customary in scope and substance for letters
delivered by independent public accountants in connection with registration
statements similar to the Form S-4.

  

## 

  

## 6.14 _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, each of Valero and
Premcor shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends
in respect of Valero Common Stock and Premcor Common Stock and the record
dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the
parties that holders of Premcor Common Stock shall not receive two dividends,
or fail to receive one dividend, for any quarter with to respect their shares
of Premcor Common Stock and any shares of Valero Common Stock any such holder
receives in exchange therefor in the Merger.

  

## 

  

## 6.15 _Registration Rights_. Premcors existing registration rights
agreements set forth on Section 6.15 of the Premcor Disclosure Schedule will
be assumed by Valero in accordance with their terms and the holders of
Premcor common stock party thereto shall have substantially the same rights
with respect to the securities of Valero that they may receive as a result of
the Merger as they currently possess under such agreements.

otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  



  

I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be an
"affiliate" of Premcor Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Premcor_ "), as the
term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule
145 of the Rules and Regulations (the " _Rules and Regulations_ ") of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _Commission_ ") under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Act_ "). I have been further
advised that pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of April 24, 2005 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), by and between Valero
Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Valero_ "), and Premcor,
Premcor will merge with and into Valero (the " _Merger_ "), and that as a
result of the Merger, I may receive shares of Valero Common Stock (as defined
in the Merger Agreement) in exchange for shares of Premcor Common Stock (as
defined in the Merger Agreement) owned by me. Valero will be the
surviving corporation in the Merger and is sometimes referred to herein as
the " _Surviving Corporation_."

  



  

I represent, warrant and covenant to Valero that in the event I receive any
Valero Common Stock as a result of the Merger:

  



  

(a) I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of the Valero
Common Stock in violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations.

  



  

(b) I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and discussed
its requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell,
transfer or otherwise dispose of Valero Common Stock to the extent I believed
necessary with my counsel or counsel to Premcor.

  



  

(c) I have been advised that the issuance of Valero Common Stock to me
pursuant to the Merger will be registered with the Commission under the Act
on a Registration Statement of Form S-4. However, I have also been advised
that, since at the time the Merger will be submitted for a vote of the
stockholders of Premcor, I may be deemed to have been an affiliate of Premcor
and the distribution by me of Valero Common Stock has not been registered
under the Act, I may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the Valero
Common Stock issued to me in the Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer or
other disposition has been registered under the Act, (ii) such sale, transfer
or other disposition is made in conformity with the volume and other
limitations of Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under the Act, or (iii)
in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to Valero or under a "no-
action" letter obtained by me from the staff of the Commission, such sale,
transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the
Act.

  



  

A-1   

     
   

  



  

(d) I understand that the Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to
register the sale, transfer or other disposition of the Valero Common Stock
by me or on my behalf under the Act or to take any other action necessary in
order to make compliance with an exemption from such registration available.

  



  

(e) I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to the
Surviving Corporations transfer agents with respect to the Valero Common
Stock and that there will be placed on the certificates for the Valero Common
Stock issued to me, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in the
substance:

  



  

The securities represented by this certificate have been issued in a
transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933
applies and may only be sold or otherwise transferred in compliance with the
requirements of Rule 145 or pursuant to a registration statement under said
act or an exemption from such registration.

  



  

(f) I also understand that unless the transfer by me of my Valero Common
Stock issued to me as a result of the Merger has been registered under the
Act or is a sale made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145, the
Surviving Corporation reserves the right to put the following legend on the
certificates issued to my transferee:

  



  

The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under the
Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired from a person who received such
shares in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities
Act of 1933 applies. The shares have been acquired by the holder not with a
view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof within
the meaning of Securities Act of 1933 and may not be sold, pledged or
otherwise transferred except in accordance with an exemption from
the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933.

  



  

It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth in paragraphs (e) and
(f) above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without
such legend if the undersigned shall have delivered to the
Surviving Corporation a copy of a letter from the staff of the Commission, or
an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Surviving Corporation, to the effect that such legend is not required for
purposes of the Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) such legends will be
removed by delivery of substitute certificates upon written request of the
undersigned if at the time of making such request the undersigned would be
permitted to dispose of the Valero Common Shares represented by such
certificates pursuant to Rule 145(d)(2); (ii) nothing contained herein shall
be construed as an admission that I am an "affiliate," or as a waiver of any
rights that I may have to object to any claim that I am such an affiliate on
or after the date of this letter, and (iii) this letter agreement shall
terminate if and when the Merger Agreement is terminated according to its
terms.
