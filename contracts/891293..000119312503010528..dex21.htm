iv AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER



THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is made and entered into
as of June 16, 2003, by and between Cell Therapeutics, Inc., a Washington
corporation ("CTI"), and Novuspharma, S.p.A., an Italian joint stock company
("Novuspharma").



THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT enter into this Agreement on the basis of the
following facts and understandings: 



A. The respective Boards of Directors of CTI and Novuspharma have each
approved the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject to the terms
and conditions herein, and have granted to their respective officers or
managing directors, as applicable, the relevant powers to execute this
Agreement.



1. The Board of Directors of CTI has resolved, among other things, to: (i) approve the draft merger plan ( _progetto di fusione_ ) in the form set forth on _Schedule A_ attached hereto (together with the attachments thereto, including an English translation approved and reasonably accepted by each of CTI and Novuspharma (the "Merger Plan")); (ii) recommend to its shareholders the approval of the issuance of shares of CTI Common Stock (as hereinafter defined) in the merger contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger Plan pursuant to which Novuspharma will merge into CTI (the "Merger") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the Business Corporation Act of the State of Washington, as amended (the "WBCA") and the Italian Civil Code, as amended, and any other applicable provision of Italian law ("Italian Law"); (iii) convene the CTI Shareholders Meeting (as defined in Section 5.1(f) hereof); (iv) apply, promptly following the Shareholder Approvals (as defined in Recital C below), to the Borsa Italiana S.p.A. (the "Borsa Italiana") for the listing on the Nuovo Mercato of the shares of common stock, no par value per share, of CTI ("CTI Common Stock") and to the _Commissione Nazionale per le Societ a e la Borsa_, the Italian securities regulatory commission ("CONSOB"), for the registration of the relevant Listing Particulars (as defined in Section 5.1(a) hereof); (v) notify the National Association of Securities Dealers ("NASD") on the appropriate form prior to the consummation of the Merger of the issuance and listing on the Nasdaq National Market of the shares of CTI Common Stock to be issued as Merger Consideration (as defined in Section 1.7(b) hereof) and (vi) carry out any action necessary in order to accomplish the foregoing objectives and to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. 



2. The Board of Directors of Novuspharma has resolved to: (i) approve the Merger Plan; (ii) recommend to its shareholders the approval of the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the WBCA and Italian Law; (iii) convene the Novuspharma Shareholders Meeting (as defined in Section 5.1(f) hereof); (iv) cooperate with CTI with respect to CTIs application to the Borsa Italiana for the listing on the Nuovo Mercato of the shares of CTI Common Stock and to CONSOB for the registration of the relevant Listing Particulars; and (v) carry out any actions necessary in order to accomplish the foregoing objectives and to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. 



 

1 As a consequence of the Merger, each ordinary share, nominal value One Euro
(Euro 1) per share, of Novuspharma (the "Novuspharma Ordinary Shares") (other
than Novuspharma Ordinary Shares, if any, to be cancelled in accordance with
Section 1.7(a) hereof and Rescission Shares (as defined in Section 1.10
hereof)) shall be converted in accordance with Section 1.7(b) of this
Agreement into that number of shares of CTI Common Stock representing the
Merger Consideration.



B. The Merger, the Merger Plan, and certain of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement must be approved by the holders of at least
two-thirds (66 2/3%) of the Novuspharma Ordinary Shares present at the
Novuspharma Shareholders Meeting, provided that the quorum required for the
Novuspharma Shareholders Meeting shall consist of more than one-half (50%)
of the outstanding Novuspharma Ordinary Shares as of the relevant record date
during the first call, more than one-third (33 1/3%) of the outstanding
Novuspharma Ordinary Shares as of the relevant record date during the second
call, and more than one-fifth (20%) of the outstanding Novuspharma Ordinary
Shares as of the relevant record date during the third call (the "Novuspharma
Shareholder Approval").



C. The Merger and the Merger Agreement must be approved by a majority of
the outstanding shares of Cerebus Common Stock (the "CTI Shareholder
Approval" and, together with the Novuspharma Shareholder Approval, the
"Shareholder Approvals").



D. Immediately after the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Novuspharma, (i) CTI and each of the shareholders of Novuspharma listed on
_Schedule B_ attached hereto ("Novuspharma Significant Shareholders") shall
enter into a voting agreement (each, a "Novuspharma Shareholder Voting
Agreement") in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A-1_ or
_Exhibit A-2_ , and (ii) Novuspharma and each of the shareholders of CTI
listed on _Schedule C_ attached hereto ("CTI Significant Shareholders") shall
enter into a voting agreement (each, a "CTI Shareholder Voting Agreement" and
together with the Novuspharma Shareholder Voting Agreement, the "Shareholder
Voting Agreements") in substantially the form attached hereto as  _Exhibit
B-1_ or _Exhibit B-2_ ; and (iii) CTI and each of the prospective shareholders
of the Surviving Corporation listed on _Schedule D_ attached hereto is
entering into a shareholders agreement (the "Shareholders Agreement") in
substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ ; and the effectiveness
of the Shareholders Agreement shall be subject to and conditioned upon the
consummation of the Merger. 



E. Immediately after the execution of this Agreement by Novuspharma, CTI
and the employees of Novuspharma listed on _Schedule E_ attached hereto
("Continuing Employees") shall enter into employment agreements reasonably
satisfactory to CTI (the "Employment Agreements").



F. As a condition and inducement to each partys willingness to enter into
this Agreement, CTI shall obtain the listing of the CTI Common Stock on the
Nuovo Mercato, and, in furtherance thereof, CTI shall, inter alia, (i) apply
to the Borsa Italiana for the listing on the Nuovo Mercato of the shares of
CTI Common Stock and apply to CONSOB for the registration of the relevant
Listing Particulars (subject to _Schedule J_ ), (ii) notify the NASD prior to
the issuance and listing on the Nasdaq National Market of the shares of CTI
Common Stock issued as Merger Consideration, and (iii) carry out any other
actions or activity reasonably required pursuant to Italian Law in order to
accomplish such listings and Novuspharma shall cooperate with CTI in carrying
out such actions. The effectiveness of the listing of the shares of CTI Common
Stock on the Nuovo Mercato and the newly issued shares of CTI Common Stock on
the Nasdaq National Market is intended to occur simultaneously.



 

2 G. For Italian income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
shall constitute a tax-neutral transaction for Novuspharma and for holders of
Novuspharma Ordinary Shares resident in Italy, except for transfers made
pursuant to Section 1.9 or 1.10 below. It is understood that (i) CTI shall
establish an Italian Branch, qualifying as a permanent establishment for
Italian tax purposes (the "Italian Branch"), prior to the Closing (as defined
in Section 1.2 below) and appoint an Italian legal representative ("
_Institore_ "), (ii) at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3 below)
the assets (or a portion thereof) of the Surviving Corporation that were owned
by Novuspharma immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be attributed to
the Italian Branch, and (iii) within one hundred twenty (120) days after the
Effective Time, CTI shall cause the assets (or a portion thereof) of the
Italian Branch to be contributed to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Surviving
Corporation in the form of a S.r.l. (the "Italian Subsidiary") in exchange
for all of the quotas of capital stock of the Italian Subsidiary.



H. As a condition and inducement to Novuspharmas willingness to enter into
this Agreement, the parties agree that, (i) as of the Effective Time, the
individuals set forth on _Schedule G_ attached hereto shall become directors
of the Surviving Corporation (as defined in Section 1.1 below), and (ii) upon
the contribution of the assets (or a portion thereof) of the Italian Branch
to the Italian Subsidiary, the directors of the Italian Subsidiary shall be as
set forth on _Schedule H_ attached hereto.



I. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
parties shall announce the Merger to the public and to the relevant
securities authorities in compliance with Applicable Laws (as defined in
Section 2.4).



J. CTI and Novuspharma desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and also to prescribe various
conditions to the Merger.



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto, intending to be legally
bound, agree as follows:



ARTICLE I

 



THE MERGER



1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the WBCA and Italian Law,
Novuspharma shall be merged with and into CTI at the Effective Time. Following
the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Novuspharma shall cease and
CTI shall continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation")
and shall succeed to and assume all of the rights and obligations as well as
the assets and liabilities of Novuspharma in accordance with the WBCA and
Italian Law.



1.2 _Closing_. The Closing of the Merger shall take place at a date and
time to be agreed between the parties, which shall be no later than the fifth
business day after satisfaction or waiver by the relevant party or parties of
the last of the conditions set forth in Article VI (the "Closing Date"), at
the offices of Studio Notarile Marchetti, Via Agnello 18, Milan, Italy, before
the Italian notary public, Mr. Piergaetano Marchetti or any other notary
public of his office (the "Italian Notary Public"), unless another Italian
notary public, time, date or place is mutually agreed upon in writing by the
parties hereto. For purposes of this Agreement, the



 

3 "Closing" shall mean the execution and delivery of all relevant legal and
contractual documentation required hereunder and under each of the WBCA and
Italian Law to properly consummate the Merger, including the merger deed,
drafted in the Italian language and signed by the parties before the Italian
Notary Public (together with an English translation thereof approved, and
reasonably accepted and countersigned by the parties, (the "Merger Deed")).



1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
soon as practicable on or after the Closing, the parties shall file (a)
appropriate Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of Washington in
accordance with Chapter 23B.11.050 and any other relevant provisions of the
WBCA (the "Articles of Merger") and (b) the Merger Deed with the Companies
Register in Milan, Italy. The parties shall make all other filings and
recordings required by the WBCA and Italian Law in connection with the Merger.
The Merger shall become effective immediately prior to the first trading date
on the Nuovo Mercato of the shares of CTI Common Stock, or at such other time
as CTI and Novuspharma shall agree should be specified in the Articles of
Merger, the Merger Deed or other appropriate documents (such date and time,
or such other date or time as may be set forth therein, being the "Effective
Time"). The parties intend that the Effective Time shall be as soon as
practicable after the later to occur of (x) the filing of the Articles of
Merger with the Secretary of State of Washington and (y) the recording of the
Merger Deed or other appropriate documents on the Companies Register in
Milan, Italy. The accounting and fiscal effects of the Merger shall take place
as of the Effective Time. 



1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the applicable provisions of the WBCA and Italian Law, including,
without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
Novuspharma shall vest in the Surviving Corporation and all debts, liabilities
and duties of Novuspharma shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of
the Surviving Corporation.

 



1.5 _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be as
set forth in _Exhibit D_ and _Exhibit E_ attached hereto (which shall also be
attached to the Merger Plan), until thereafter changed or amended as provided
therein or by Applicable Laws.



1.6 _Directors; Operations following the Merger_.



(a) The Board of Directors of CTI shall take all actions necessary such
that effective as of immediately following the Effective Time, the Board of
Directors shall be as set forth in _Schedule F_ attached hereto until the
earlier of the resignation or removal of any individual listed on _Schedule F_
attached hereto or designated in accordance with this Section 1.6(a) or until
their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may
be, in the manner provided in the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation, or as otherwise provided by law. The Board
of Directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be classified at Closing with
approximately one-third of the members of the Board elected each year, and
each Board members class designation shall be as set forth in _Schedule F_
attached hereto.



(b) At the Effective Time, the Institore of the Italian Branch shall be as
set forth in _Schedule I_ attached hereto until the earlier of such Italian
Branch Managers resignation or removal or until such Italian Branch Managers
respective successor is duly elected and qualified, as the case may be, in
the manner provided in the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation, and the Institore shall have the powers



 

4 set forth in such Schedule for so long as he is the Institore. Upon the
contribution of the assets of the Italian Branch into the Italian Subsidiary,
the Board of Directors, and certain of the officers of the Italian Subsidiary
shall be as set forth in _Schedule H_ attached hereto until the earlier of the
resignation or removal of any individual listed on  _Schedule H_ or
designated in accordance with this Section 1.6(b) or until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be, in the manner
provided in the Articles of Association and Bylaws of the Italian Subsidiary
(which Bylaws shall be substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit
F_ ) or as otherwise provided by law.



1.7 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of CTI, the following shall occur:



(a) _Cancellation of Novuspharma Treasury Stock; Cancellation of
Novuspharma Owned Shares of CTI Common Stock_. Each Novuspharma Ordinary Share
that is owned by Novuspharma immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be cancelled without any conversion thereof and no consideration
shall be delivered with respect thereto. Each share of CTI Common Stock that
is owned by Novuspharma immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any,
shall automatically be cancelled at the Effective Time. Novuspharma and,
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall take or cause to be taken
all actions necessary in order to accomplish such cancellations.



(b) _Conversion of Novuspharma Ordinary Shares_.



(i) Each Novuspharma Ordinary Share issued and outstanding as of the
Effective Time (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section
1.7(a) hereof and Rescission Shares), shall be converted, subject to Section
1.10 of this Agreement, into 2.45 (the "Exchange Ratio") shares of CTI Common
Stock (the "Merger Consideration"). The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to
reflect fully the appropriate effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or pro rata distribution of securities
convertible into CTI Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification or other like changes with respect to CTI Common
Stock having a record date on or after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time.



(ii) As of the Effective Time, all such Novuspharma Ordinary Shares shall
no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and each book-entry position with depositary intermediaries
participating to Monte Titoli S.p.A. ("Monte Titoli") previously representing
any such shares shall thereafter represent the shares of CTI Common Stock
into which such Novuspharma Ordinary Shares were converted in the Merger in
accordance with this Section 1.7(b). The holders of such book-entry positions
with depositary intermediaries participating in Monte Titoli previously
evidencing such Novuspharma Ordinary Shares outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to Novuspharma
and such Novuspharma Ordinary Shares as of the Effective Time. Such book-
entry positions previously representing Novuspharma Ordinary Shares shall be
exchanged for book-entry positions representing whole shares of CTI Common
Stock issued as Merger Consideration, without interest, in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. As of the Effective Time, each share of CTI Common
Stock issued as Merger Consideration shall be entitled to the same rights,
preferences and privileges as other shares of CTI Common Stock, including
dividend rights. No fractional shares of CTI Common Stock shall be issued,
but in lieu thereof, the provisions of Section 1.9 shall apply.



 

5 (c) _Novuspharma Stock Options_. Each and every Novuspharma Stock Option
outstanding under the Novuspharma Stock Option Plan (as defined in Section
2.10 hereof) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be treated in the
manner set forth in Section 5.4 hereof.



(d) _No Effect on CTI Common Stock_. At and after the Effective Time,
each share of CTI Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (except for any shares of CTI Common Stock owned by
Novuspharma, which shall be cancelled pursuant to Section 1.7(a) above) shall
remain an issued and outstanding share of CTI Common Stock and shall not be
affected by the Merger.



1.8 _Exchange of Shares_. The exchange procedure shall be carried out
through the centralized depositary system managed by Monte Titoli and in
accordance with the applicable provisions of Italian Law (including, but not
limited to, Italian Legislative Decree no. 213 of June 24, 1998) and the
standard operating procedures adopted by Monte Titoli. Novuspharma and CTI
shall take all actions necessary or useful in order to accomplish the
exchange, including, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, CTI shall take all necessary steps in order to issue and deliver
the shares of CTI Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 1.7(b) hereof
in exchange for Novuspharma Ordinary Shares and cash or shares of CTI Common
Stock, as the case may be, sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares
in accordance with Section 1.9 hereof (collectively, the "Exchange Fund").
Except as contemplated by this Section 1.8, the Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any other purposes. Novuspharma acknowledges that Novuspharma shall
be responsible for delivering to Monte Titoli the relevant instructions
regarding the Exchange Ratio, the Effective Time and any other information
that Monte Titoli may require in connection with the exchange procedure, and
CTI will cooperate with Novuspharma in such respect should Novuspharma
reasonably request. Such instructions shall be given by Novuspharma prior to
or on the Closing Date.



1.9 _No Fractional Shares_.



(a) No fractional shares of CTI Common Stock shall be issued upon the
conversion or exchange of Novuspharma Ordinary Shares, and such fractional
share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights
of a shareholder of CTI.



(b) Within ten (10) days following the Shareholder Approvals, CTI and
Novuspharma shall select and enter into an agreement (in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to both parties) with a financial intermediary which
participates in Monte Titoli or a bank designated by the parties to act as
exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent"). CTI, Novuspharma and the Exchange
Agent shall determine suitable procedures for the treatment of fractional
shares of CTI Common Stock issued in respect of Novuspharma Ordinary Shares in
the Merger in accordance with market practice in Italy and with the rules and
practice of Monte Titoli. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all commissions,
transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs of the Exchange Agent
incurred in connection with dealing with any such fractional shares of CTI
Common Stock. In addition, the Surviving Corporation shall pay the Exchange
Agents compensation and expenses in connection with dealing with any such
fractional shares of CTI Common Stock.



1.10 _Rescission Shares_. Notwithstanding Section 1.7 hereof or any
other provision of this Agreement, if the Merger is consummated pursuant to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the WBCA and Italian Law,
Novuspharma Ordinary Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and held by a holder who has exercised and perfected



 

6 his or her rescission rights in accordance with Italian Law and who does not
subsequently withdraw such exercise or abandon such right (the "Rescission
Shares"), shall not be converted into or exchanged for the Merger
Consideration, but, effective as of the Effective Time or at any other time
determined by Novuspharma and CTI in accordance with Applicable Laws, the
holders of Rescission Shares shall be entitled to receive cash per Novuspharma
Ordinary Share equal to the Average Closing Price (as defined below). The
effective payment of the cash consideration for the rescission right will be
made immediately following the closing by the Surviving Entity since the
effective exercise of the rescission right will be subject to the consummation
of the Merger. For purposes of this Section 1.10, "Average Closing
Price" means the average closing price for a share of Novuspharma Ordinary
Shares on the Nuovo Mercato during the six (6) months prior to the date of the
Novuspharma Shareholder Approval. Novuspharma shall set aside, in a bank
account instituted by Novuspharma for such purposes, amounts in cash to be
potentially paid in respect of Rescission Shares and Novuspharma shall give
CTI and its counsel prompt notice of any demands for rescission rights
received by Novuspharma or its counsel from the holders of Novuspharma
Ordinary Shares or their nominees. Upon payment of the amounts due in respect
of the Rescission Shares pursuant to this Section 1.10, the Rescission Shares
and book-entry positions representing Rescission Shares shall automatically
be cancelled and any holder thereof shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, including as a shareholder of the Surviving Corporation.



 

1.11 _Return of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the former shareholders of Novuspharma for six
(6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation, upon demand by the Surviving Corporation, and any such former
shareholders of Novuspharma who have not theretofore complied with any
instructions provided to them in connection with the exchange of Novuspharma
Ordinary Shares for shares of CTI Common Stock shall thereafter seek recourse
only from the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for CTI Common
Stock. None of CTI, Novuspharma, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any former holder of Novuspharma Ordinary Shares for
any shares of CTI Common Stock or cash otherwise deliverable or payable to any
holder of Novuspharma Ordinary Shares properly paid to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.



1.12 _No Further Ownership Rights in Novuspharma Ordinary Shares_. All
shares of CTI Common Stock issued in accordance with the terms of this
Article I (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 1.9 or 1.10 hereof)
shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to Novuspharma Ordinary Shares. At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of Novuspharma shall be closed, and there shall be no
further registrations of transfers of Novuspharma Ordinary Shares thereafter
on the records of Novuspharma.



1.13 _Associated Rights_. References in this Agreement to CTI Common
Stock shall include, unless the context requires otherwise, the associated
Preferred Stock Purchase Rights ("Rights") issued pursuant to that
certain Rights Agreement dated as of November 11, 1996, by and between CTI
and Harris Trust Company of California, as amended by that certain First
Amendment to Rights Agreement, dated November 20, 2002 between CTI, Harris
Trust Company of California and Computershare Investor Services, LLC (as
amended, the "Rights Plan").



1.14 _Further Assurances_. Immediately after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation and its proper officers and directors or their designees
shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name of and on behalf of
either CTI or Novuspharma, any deeds,



 

7 bills of sale, assignments or assurances or other acts or things necessary,
desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise,
in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any
of the rights (including, without limitation, the right to collect damages for
past infringement of Intellectual Property (as defined in Section 2.13(a)
hereof) or other rights), privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets
of either of CTI or Novuspharma or (b) otherwise to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement.

Except as set forth on the Disclosure Schedules (provided that an item

being conducted. Novuspharma is duly qualified or licensed to do business and
is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business
or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be

reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect (as defined in Section
8.3 hereof) on Novuspharma. The corporate records and minute books of
Novuspharma have been maintained in accordance with all applicable
requirements and are true, correct and complete in all respects, except as
would not be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on
Novuspharma. Novuspharma has delivered or made available to CTI true, correct
and complete copies of its Articles of Association and Bylaws, as amended to
the date hereof.



2.2 _Capital Structure_. As of the date hereof, the authorized capital
stock of Novuspharma consists of 6,566,200 Novuspharma Ordinary Shares, of

2.5 _Publicly Filed Documents; Financial Statements_.

Documents were prepared in accordance and complied in all material respects
with the requirements of Italian Law and the rules and regulations of the
Borsa Italiana and the CONSOB promulgated thereunder and applicable to such
CONSOB Documents, and none of the CONSOB Documents contained any untrue,
incorrect or incomplete statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Except to the extent that information contained in any
CONSOB Document has been revised or superseded by a later-filed CONSOB
Document filed and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement,
none of the CONSOB Documents contains any untrue, incorrect or incomplete
statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.



(b) The audited financial statements of Novuspharma included in the CONSOB
Documents (together with the notes thereto, the "Novuspharma Audited Financial



 

11 Statements") and the unaudited financial statements of Novuspharma included in
the CONSOB Documents (the "Novuspharma Unaudited Financial Statements" and,
together with the Novuspharma Audited Financial Statements, the "Novuspharma
Financial Statements"): (i) comply as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of

the case of the Novuspharma Audited Financial Statements, have been duly
audited by KPMG S.p.A. in accordance with Italian Law. Except as required by
Italian GAAP, Novuspharma has not, since November 9, 2000, made any change in

material respects in accordance with Italian GAAP and other applicable legal

of business consistent with past practice since the Novuspharma Balance Sheet

Novuspharma has (i) no liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) required by Italian GAAP to be
recognized or disclosed on the Novuspharma Financial Statements, and (ii) no
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, contingent or
otherwise) that, individually or in the aggregate, would be reasonably likely
to have a material adverse effect on Novuspharma. No basis exists that would
require, and to Novuspharmas knowledge, no circumstance exists that would be
reasonably likely to require Novuspharma to restate any of the Novuspharma
Financial Statements.



(c) Other than in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, Novuspharma is not or has never been subject to any
filing or other reporting requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, as

Registration Statement (as defined in Section 5.1(a) hereof), will, at the
time the Registration Statement is filed with the SEC, at any time it is
amended or supplemented or at the time it becomes effective under the

material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they are made, not misleading, (b) the Proxy Statement (as
defined in Section 5.1(a) hereof) will, at the date the Proxy Statement is
first mailed to CTIs shareholders or at the time of the CTI Shareholders

12 untrue, incorrect or incomplete statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading, or (c) the Information Document and the Listing
Particulars will, at the date they are first filed with the Borsa Italiana
and the CONSOB, respectively, or, in the case of the Information Document,
made available at Novuspharmas registered office in Bresso, Italy, or at the
time of the Novuspharma Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue,
incorrect or incomplete statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,

respect to Novuspharma, its officers or directors shall occur which is
required to be described in the Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement,
the Information Document or the Listing Particulars, (1) Novuspharma shall
promptly advise CTI of such event, and (2) if required by Applicable Law,
Novuspharma shall promptly file an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto
with the CONSOB or the Borsa Italiana, and, as required by Applicable
Law, disseminate such amendment or supplement to the shareholders of
Novuspharma; provided, however, that, subject to the requirements of Italian
securities laws, in no event shall Novuspharma make any disclosure without the
prior written consent of CTI if doing so would violate or cause a violation
of United States securities laws or any other Applicable Laws. The Information
Document will comply as to form in all material respects with the rules and
regulations of the CONSOB and the Borsa Italiana. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no representation or warranty is made by Novuspharma with respect
to statements made or incorporated by reference in the Information Document
based on information supplied by CTI specifically for inclusion

practice, (ii) there has not been any declaration, setting aside or payment of
any dividend on, or other distribution (whether in case, stock or property) in

contingent), that is not in the ordinary course of business or that would,
individually or in the aggregate, result in a material adverse effect on
Novuspharma, (ii) Novuspharma has not sustained any material
damage, destruction or loss, whether or not covered by insurance, and (iii)
there has been no event, circumstance or development that would be reasonably
likely to have a material adverse effect on Novuspharma.

Novuspharma Benefit Plans have been administered in accordance with their
terms and have been properly accrued and reflected in the
Novuspharma Financial Statements, except in each case as, individually or in
the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to have a material adverse
effect on Novuspharma. Novuspharma and all such Novuspharma Benefit Plans are

Agreement. Except as set forth in _Schedule 2.11(a)_ of the Novuspharma
Disclosure Schedules, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by

thereof through the date of such Novuspharma Financial Statements.

file all such returns and reports required to be filed on or before the
Effective Time, and all such returns and reports are true, correct
and complete in all material respects. Novuspharma has timely paid and
discharged all social security contributions due from them, other than such
social security contributions as are being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings and are adequately reserved for on the most



 

16 recent Novuspharma Financial Statements filed prior to the date of this

Statements filed prior to the date of this Agreement and publicly available

thereof through the date of such Novuspharma Financial Statements.

security contributions are pending.



(e) Novuspharma has withheld and timely paid over to the proper
governmental authorities all social security contributions required to have
been withheld and paid over and complied with all material information

or attributable to social security contributions, except for Liens for social
security contributions not yet due.



(h) To Novuspharmas knowledge and as of the date hereof, there is no basis

Novuspharma.



(i) As used in this Agreement, "social security contributions" shall
include all social security contributions, of any nature whatsoever, as well
as any statutory insurance (whether payable directly or by withholding),
together with any interest and penalties, additions to social security

its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted, and
there has occurred no default under any such Permit, except for the lack of

liability for any brokerage, finders, financial advisors or similar fee,
expense or commission, and no broker or finder has acted directly or
indirectly for Novuspharma, in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. Pursuant to Italian Law, KPMG S.p.A.,
Novuspharmas independent auditors, has been appointed "expert" by
Novuspharmas Board of Directors.



2.17 _Title to Properties; Leases_. Novuspharma does not own any real
property. _Schedule 2.17_ of the Novuspharma Disclosure Schedules lists all
real property leases to which Novuspharma is a party, and each amendment
thereto, that is in effect as of the date of this Agreement. All such current
leases are in full force and effect, are valid and effective in accordance
with their respective terms, and there is not, under any of the leases, any
existing default or event of default (or event which with notice or lapse of
time, or both, would constitute a default) that would give rise to a material
claim against Novuspharma. Novuspharma has good and marketable title to, or
valid leasehold interests in, all its properties and assets, except where such
failure, individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to
have a material adverse effect on Novuspharma. Except as set forth on
_Schedule 2.17_ of the Novuspharma Disclosure Schedules, all real estate
properties and moveable assets owned by Novuspharma are owned free of
mortgages, pledges, privileges, burdens, encumbrances and other Liens, whether
in rem or otherwise.

 



 

24 2.18 _Grants and Subsidies_. Novuspharma is as of the date hereof in
compliance in all material respects with all requirements in respect of the
Grants and Subsidies including, without limitation, pursuant to Laws 451/94
and 46/82, the regional law 140/97 and the specific progress
reporting requirements and progress milestones of Grants and Subsidies
financed pursuant to MURST/MIUR decrees.



2.19 _Insider Interests_. Except as described in _Schedule 2.19(a)_ of
the Novuspharma Disclosure Schedules, none of Novuspharma, its officers,
members of its Board of Directors, or, to Novuspharmas knowledge, its
stockholders holding more than 10% of the outstanding Novuspharma Ordinary
Shares (a) has any interest in any assets or property (whether real,
personal, tangible or intangible) of or used in the business of Novuspharma
(other than as owner of outstanding securities of Novuspharma) or (b) is
indebted to Novuspharma. Novuspharma is not indebted to any such
person, except for amounts due under normal arrangements applicable to all
employees generally as to salary or reimbursement of ordinary business
expenses or amounts due generally to members of the Board for their service on
the Board. As of the date hereof, to the knowledge of Novuspharma there are
no losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or judgments which
would entitle any director, officer or employee of Novuspharma to
indemnification by Novuspharma under Applicable Law, the Articles of
Association or Bylaws of Novuspharma or any insurance policy maintained by
Novuspharma. None of the members of Novuspharmas Board of Directors listed on
_Schedule 2.19(b)_ has any direct or indirect interest of any nature whatever
in any person or business which competes with, conducts any business similar
to, has any arrangement or agreement (including arrangements regarding the
shared use of personnel or facilities) with (whether as a customer or supplier
or otherwise) Novuspharma.



2.20 _Insurance_. Novuspharma is, and at all times since its initial
public offering has been, insured with primary insurers against all risks
normally insured against by companies in similar lines of business, and all
of the insurance policies maintained by Novuspharma are in full force and
effect. At no time since its initial public offering has Novuspharma been
unable to obtain, or been denied, product liability or other insurance.
_Schedule 2.20_ of the Novuspharma Disclosure Schedules contains a list of all
insurance policies currently maintained by Novuspharma and contains a listing
of pending workers compensation and general liability claims as of
the Novuspharma Balance Sheet Date. These claims, individually or in the
aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on
Novuspharma. To Novuspharmas knowledge, all necessary notifications of claims
have been made to its insurance carriers.



2.21 _Voting Requirements_. The affirmative vote of the holders of at
least two-thirds (66 2/3%) of the Novuspharma Ordinary Shares present at the
Novuspharma Shareholders Meeting are the only votes of the holders of any
class or series of Novuspharmas capital stock necessary to approve the
Merger, the Merger Plan, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, provided that the quorum required for the Novuspharma Shareholders
Meeting shall consist of more than one-half (50%) of the outstanding
Novuspharma Ordinary Shares as of the relevant record date during the first
call, more than one-third (33 1/3%) of the outstanding Novuspharma Ordinary
Shares as of the relevant record date during the second call, and more than
one-fifth (20%) of the outstanding Novuspharma Ordinary Shares as of the

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF CTI



 

25 Except as set forth on the Disclosure Schedules (provided that an item on such
Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to qualify only the particular section

of its subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed, individually or in the aggregate, would not be
reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on CTI. The corporate
records and minute books of CTI and its subsidiaries have been maintained in
accordance with all applicable requirements and are true, correct and complete
in all respects except as would not be reasonably likely to have a material
adverse effect on CTI. CTI has delivered or made available to Novuspharma

execution and delivery of this Agreement and the agreements contemplated
hereby to which CTI is a party do not, and the consummation of the

provisions hereof and thereof will not, give rise to any preemptive or
antidilutive right of any person with respect to any shares of CTI Common
Stock or any CTI Stock Options. Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.2_ of the
CTI Disclosure Schedules, from the close of business on December 31, 2002 to

corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company,
joint venture or other entity. CTI owns no Novuspharma Ordinary Shares and
since April 4, 2003 has not purchased or sold any CTI Common Stock.

3.5 _SEC Documents; Financial Statements_.



 

28 (a) Since January 1, 1999, CTI has timely filed with the SEC all required
reports, forms and other documents (the "SEC Documents"). As of their
respective dates, the SEC Documents were prepared in accordance and complied
in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the
SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such SEC Documents, and none of the
SEC Documents contained any untrue, incorrect or incomplete statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Except to the extent
that information contained in any SEC Document has been revised or superseded
by a later filed SEC Document filed and publicly available prior to the date
of this Agreement, none of the SEC Documents contains any untrue, incorrect or
incomplete statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. None of CTIs subsidiaries is required to file any reports, forms
or other documents with the SEC.



(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case,
any related notes thereto) contained in the SEC Documents (the "CTI Financial
Statements"), including each SEC Document filed after the date hereof until
the Closing: (i) complied as to form in all material respects with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii) were
prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles ("US GAAP") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of
unaudited interim financial statements, as may be permitted by the SEC on
Form 10-Q, 8-K or any successor form under the Exchange Act), and (iii) fairly
presented in all material respects the consolidated financial position of CTI
and its consolidated subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and
the consolidated results of CTIs operations and cash flows for the periods
indicated. The audited financial statements of CTI included in the SEC
Documents have been duly audited by Ernst and Young LLP in accordance with
Applicable Laws. Except as required by US GAAP, CTI has not, since December
31, 2002, made any change in the accounting practices or policies applied in
the preparation of the CTI Financial Statements. The balance sheet of CTI
contained in the SEC Documents dated as of March 31, 2003 is hereinafter
referred to as the "CTI Balance Sheet" and March 31, 2003 is hereinafter
referred to as the "CTI Balance Sheet Date." The books and records of CTI and
its subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained in all material
respects in accordance with US GAAP and other applicable legal and accounting
requirements. Except as set forth on the CTI Financial Statements and for
liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since the CTI Balance Sheet Date that are not,
individually or in the aggregate, material to CTI, CTI has (i) no material
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) required by US GAAP to be recognized or disclosed on
the CTI Financial Statements, and (ii) no liabilities or obligations of any
nature (whether accrued, contingent or otherwise) that, individually or in the
aggregate, would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on
CTI. No basis exists that would require, and to CTIs knowledge, no
circumstances exist that would be reasonably likely to require CTI to restate
any of the CTI Financial Statements.



3.6 _Disclosure_. None of the information supplied by CTI specifically
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (a) the Registration Statement,
will, at the time the Registration Statement is filed with the SEC, at any
time it is amended or supplemented or at the time it becomes effective under
the Securities Act, contain any untrue, incorrect or incomplete statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated



 

29 therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, (b) the Proxy
Statement will, at the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to CTIs
shareholders or at the time of the CTI Shareholders Meeting, contain any
untrue, incorrect or incomplete statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading, or (c) the Information Document and the Listing
Particulars will, at the date they are first filed with the Borsa Italiana
and the CONSOB, respectively, or, in the case of the Information Document,
made available at Novuspharmas registered office in Bresso, Italy, or at the
time of the Novuspharma Shareholders Meeting contain any untrue, incorrect
or incomplete statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event with
respect to CTI or its subsidiaries or their officers or directors shall occur
which is required to be described in the Proxy Statement, the Registration
Statement, the Information Document or the Listing Particulars, (1) CTI shall
promptly advise Novuspharma of such event, and (2) if required by Applicable
Law, CTI shall promptly file an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto
with the SEC, the CONSOB or the Borsa Italiana, and, as required by
Applicable Law, disseminate such amendment or supplement to the shareholders
of CTI; provided, however, that, subject to the requirements of United States
securities laws, in no event shall CTI make any disclosure without the prior
written consent of Novuspharma if doing so would violate or cause a violation
of Italian securities laws or any other Applicable Laws. The Registration
Statement and Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material respects
with the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or
warranty is made by CTI with respect to statements made or incorporated by
reference in the Registration Statement or Proxy Statement based on
information supplied by Novuspharma specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference therein.

of CTI or any options, warrants, calls or rights to acquire any such shares
or other securities except for repurchases from employees following their
termination pursuant to the terms of their pre-existing stock option or
purchase agreements, (iii) CTI has not acquired or agreed to acquire any
assets other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past

destruction or loss, whether or not covered by insurance, and (iii) there has
been no event, circumstance or development that would be reasonably likely to
have a material adverse effect on CTI.

30 (a) CTI and its subsidiaries have timely filed United States federal,
state, local and foreign tax returns and reports required to be filed by them
through the date hereof and shall timely file all such returns and reports
required to be filed on or before the Effective Time and all such returns and

result in any Lien on the assets of CTI and its subsidiaries or otherwise have
a material adverse effect on CTI.



(g) CTI and its subsidiaries are not, and have not been at any time, a
party to a tax sharing, tax indemnity or tax allocation agreement, and CTI

action, investigation, audit or proceeding in any United States, EU or other
jurisdiction, including, without limitation, any product liability claim,
pending or, to the knowledge of CTI, threatened in writing against CTI or any

the aggregate, would be reasonably likely to (a) have a material adverse
effect on CTI, or (b) have a material adverse effect on the ability of CTI to
perform its obligations under this Agreement.

the CTI Disclosure Schedules, there are no stock option, stock appreciation
rights, restricted stock, stock purchase or other equity-based plan or

Property used in or necessary for the conduct of the business of CTI as
currently conducted (the "CTI Intellectual Property").



(b) _Schedule 3.13(b)_ of the CTI Disclosure Schedules sets forth a true,
correct and complete list of all Patents that are owned or co-owned or

true, correct and complete list of all material license agreements to which
CTI is a party or is otherwise bound, granting any right to use or practice
any Intellectual Property rights, whether CTI is the licensee or licensor
thereunder, and any written settlements relating to any Intellectual Property
to which CTI is a party or is otherwise bound (collectively, the "CTI License
Agreements"), indicating for each the title, the parties, date executed and
the Intellectual



 

36 Property covered thereby. The CTI License Agreements in which CTI is the
licensee, constitute all of the material licenses used by CTI in connection
with its business.



(d) Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.13(d)_ of the CTI Disclosure

Schedules, to CTIs knowledge, the Patents listed on _Schedule 3.13(b_ ) of

party or parties thereto, and is in full force and effect, except to the

except if the failure to be in full force and effect, individually or in the
aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on
CTI, and, except as set forth on _Schedule 3.15(b)_ of the CTI Disclosure
Schedules, CTI has in all material respects performed all obligations
required to be performed by it to date under each CTI Material Contract.
Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.15(b)_ of the CTI Disclosure Schedules, as

terms and there is not, under any of the leases, any existing default or
event of default (or event which with notice or lapse of time, or both, would
constitute a default) that would give rise to a material claim against CTI.
CTI has good and marketable title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all
its properties and assets, except where such failure, individually or in the

Disclosure Schedules or (v) any incurrences in the ordinary course of

consent);



(g) except as set forth on _Schedule 4.2(g)_ of the CTI Disclosure
Schedules, modify or amend in a manner adverse in any material respect, or
terminate any CTI Material Contract or waive, release or assign any material

4.3 _No Solicitation by CTI_.



(a) CTI shall not, nor shall it permit any of its subsidiaries to, nor
shall it authorize or permit any of its or its subsidiaries officers,
directors or employees or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney,
accountant or other representative retained by it or its subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage, knowingly
facilitate or induce any inquiries or the making of any proposal the
consummation of which would constitute a CTI Alternative Transaction (as
hereinafter defined) or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish any person any non-public information with respect to,
or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any
proposal that constitutes or may be reasonably likely to lead to a CTI
Alternative Transaction; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if, at any time prior
to the CTI Shareholder Approval, CTI receives an unsolicited, bona fide
written offer or proposal from a third party with respect to which the Board
of Directors of CTI determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that the failure to provide such information or participate in
such negotiations or discussions would result in a reasonable likelihood that
the Board of Directors of CTI would breach its fiduciary duties to CTIs
shareholders under Applicable Laws, CTI may, in response to any such proposal
that was not solicited by it and which did not otherwise result from a breach
of this Section 4.3(a), and subject to compliance with Section 4.3(c) hereof,
(x) furnish information with respect to CTI to any person pursuant to a
customary confidentiality agreement containing terms as to



 

45 confidentiality no less restrictive than the Confidentiality Agreement dated
December 10, 2002 entered into between Novuspharma and CTI (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), and (y) participate in negotiations regarding
such proposal. For purposes of this Agreement "CTI Alternative Transaction"
means any of (i) a transaction or series of transactions pursuant to which
any person (or group of persons) other than CTI, its subsidiaries or
Novuspharma (a "Third Party") acquires or would acquire, directly or
indirectly, beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange
Act) of 50% or more of the outstanding shares of CTI, whether from CTI or
pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (ii) any
acquisition or proposed acquisition of CTI or any of its significant
subsidiaries by a Third Party by a merger or other business combination
(including any so called "merger of equals" and whether or not CTI or any of
its significant subsidiaries is the entity surviving any such merger
or business combination), pursuant to which the stockholders of CTI or its
significant subsidiary, as the case may be, immediately preceding such
transaction hold less than 50% of the equity interests in the surviving or
resulting entity of such transaction, (iii) any other transaction pursuant to
which any Third Party acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly,
control of assets (including for this purpose the outstanding equity
securities of subsidiaries of CTI and any entity surviving any merger or
combination, including CTI or any of its subsidiaries) of CTI or any of its
significant subsidiaries, as the case may be, for consideration equal to 50%
or more of the fair market value of all of the outstanding shares of
CTI Common Stock on the date prior to the date hereof, or (iv) any
liquidation or dissolution of CTI; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Merger
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not be deemed a CTI
Alternative Transaction in any case.



(b) Neither the Board of Directors of CTI nor any committee thereof shall,
except as expressly permitted by this Section 4.3, withdraw, qualify or
modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner
adverse to Novuspharma, the approval or recommendation by such Board of
Directors or such committee of the Merger or the Merger Agreement, unless the
Board of Directors of CTI determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, that the failure to change, withdraw, qualify or modify such
recommendation would result in a reasonable likelihood that the Board of
Directors of CTI would breach its fiduciary duties to CTIs shareholders under
Applicable Laws, in which case CTI may withdraw, qualify or modify such
approval or recommendation (a "CTI Subsequent Determination"). Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, CTI shall submit the Merger and the
Merger Agreement to its shareholders whether or not the Board of Directors of
CTI makes a CTI Subsequent Determination.



(c) In addition to the obligations of CTI set forth in paragraphs (a) and
(b) of this Section 4.3, CTI shall promptly advise Novuspharma orally and in
writing of any request for information or of any proposal in connection with a
CTI Alternative Transaction, the material terms and conditions of such request
or proposal and the identity of the person making such request or proposal,
and CTI shall provide Novuspharma with a copy of any documentation provided in
connection therewith. CTI will keep Novuspharma reasonably informed of the
status and details (including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such
request or proposal on a current basis and shall promptly provide all written
materials subsequently provided in connection therewith.



(d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.3 shall prohibit CTI from (i)
taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (ii) making any
disclosure to its shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors of CTI, after receipt of advice from outside counsel, failure so to
disclose would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to holders of CTIs



 

46 securities under Applicable Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that CTI agrees to
provide Novuspharma with a copy of such disclosure prior to such disclosure.



4.4 _No Solicitation by Novuspharma_.



(a) Novuspharma shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its
officers, directors or employees or any investment banker, financial advisor,
attorney, accountant or other representative retained by it to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage, knowingly facilitate or induce
any inquiries or the making of any proposal the consummation of which would
constitute a Novuspharma Alternative Transaction (as hereinafter defined), or
(ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish any
person any non-public information with respect to, or take any other action to
facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or
may be reasonably likely to lead to a Novuspharma Alternative Transaction;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if, at any time prior to the Novuspharma
Shareholder Approval, Novuspharma receives an unsolicited, bona fide
written offer or proposal from a third party with respect to which the Board
of Directors of Novuspharma determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to provide such information or
participate in such negotiations or discussions would result in a reasonable
likelihood that the Board of Directors of Novuspharma would breach its
fiduciary duties to Novuspharmas shareholders under Applicable Laws,
Novuspharma may, in response to any such proposal that was not solicited by
it or that did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 4.4(a), and
subject to compliance with Section 4.4(c) hereof, (x) furnish information with
respect to Novuspharma to any person pursuant to a customary confidentiality
agreement containing terms as to confidentiality no less restrictive than the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, and (y) participate in negotiations
regarding such proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, "Novuspharma
Alternative Transaction" means any of (i) a transaction or series of
transactions pursuant to which a Third Party acquires or would acquire,
directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3
under the Exchange Act) of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of
Novuspharma, whether from Novuspharma or pursuant to a tender offer or
exchange offer or otherwise, (ii) any acquisition or proposed acquisition of
Novuspharma by a Third Party by a merger or other business combination
(including any so called "merger of equals" and whether or not Novuspharma is
the entity surviving any such merger or business combination), pursuant to
which the shareholders of Novuspharma immediately preceding such transaction
hold less than 80% of the equity interests in the surviving or resulting
entity of such transaction, (iii) any other transaction pursuant to which any
Third Party acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly, control of
assets of Novuspharma for consideration equal to 20% or more of the fair
market value of all of the outstanding Novuspharma Ordinary Shares on the date
prior to the date hereof, or (iv) any liquidation or dissolution of
Novuspharma;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall not be deemed a Novuspharma Alternative
Transaction in any case.



(b) Neither the Board of Directors of Novuspharma nor any committee thereof
shall (i) except as expressly permitted by this Section 4.4, withdraw,
qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a
manner adverse to CTI, the approval or recommendation by such Board of
Directors or such committee of the Merger or this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event that prior to the Novuspharma Shareholder Approval
the Board of Directors of Novuspharma determines in good faith, after it has
received a Novuspharma Superior Proposal (as defined below) and after receipt
of advice from outside counsel, that the failure to do so would result in a
reasonable likelihood that the Board of Directors of Novuspharma would breach
its fiduciary duties to Novuspharmas shareholders under Applicable Laws, the
Board of Directors of Novuspharma may (subject to



 

47 this and the following sentences) withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose
publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify the approval or recommendation by the
Novuspharma Board of Directors of the Merger or this Agreement (a "Novuspharma
Subsequent Determination"), but only at a time that is after the seventh
business day following CTIs receipt of written notice advising CTI that the
Board of Directors of Novuspharma has received a Novuspharma Superior Proposal
(as hereinafter defined) specifying the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal, identifying the person making such Novuspharma Superior
Proposal and stating that it intends to make a Novuspharma Subsequent
Determination. After providing such notice, Novuspharma shall provide a
reasonable opportunity to CTI to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement as would enable Novuspharma to proceed with its
recommendation to shareholders without making a Novuspharma Subsequent
Determination; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such adjustments shall be at
the discretion of the parties at such time. For purposes of this Agreement, a
"Novuspharma Superior Proposal" means any proposal (on its most recently
amended or modified terms, if amended or modified) made by a Third Party to
enter into a Novuspharma Alternative Transaction involving the sale of a
majority or more of the Novuspharma Ordinary Shares or sale of all or
substantially all of Novuspharmas assets or similar transaction which the
Board of Directors of Novuspharma determines in its good faith judgment
(based on the advice of an independent financial advisor of internationally
recognized reputation) to be more favorable to Novuspharmas shareholders than
the Merger taking into account all relevant factors (including whether, in
the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of Novuspharma, after
obtaining advice from the independent financial advisor of internationally
recognized reputation, the third party is reasonably able to finance the
transaction and the likelihood of completing the transaction within a
reasonable timeframe, and any proposed changes to this Agreement that may be
proposed by CTI in response to such Alternative Transaction). Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, Novuspharma shall submit this
Agreement and the other matters requiring the approval of the shareholders in
order to complete the Merger, to its shareholders whether or not the Board of
Directors of Novuspharma makes a Novuspharma Subsequent Determination.



(c) In addition to the obligations of Novuspharma set forth in paragraphs
(a) and (b) of this Section 4.4, Novuspharma shall promptly advise CTI orally
and in writing of any request for information or of any proposal in
connection with a Novuspharma Alternative Transaction, the material terms and
conditions of such request or proposal and the identity of the person making
such request or proposal, and Novuspharma shall provide CTI with a copy of
any documentation provided in connection therewith. Novuspharma will keep CTI
reasonably informed of the status and details (including amendments or
proposed amendments) of any such request or proposal on a current basis and
shall promptly provide all written materials subsequently provided in
connection therewith.



(d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.4 shall prohibit Novuspharma from
making any disclosure to its shareholders in accordance with the applicable
provisions of Italian Law if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors of Novuspharma, after receipt of advice from outside counsel,
failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to
Novuspharmas shareholders under Applicable Laws; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that Novuspharma shall provide a copy of such disclosure to CTI prior to such
disclosure.



2.5 _Other Actions_. Neither Novuspharma nor CTI shall, nor shall CTI
permit any of its subsidiaries to, take any action that would result in (a)
any of the representations and warranties of such party set forth in this
Agreement that are qualified as to materiality becoming untrue, incorrect or
incomplete or (b) any of such representations and warranties that are not so
qualified becoming untrue, incorrect or incomplete in any material respect.

with filings made pursuant hereto, (iii) after



 

50 receipt of any material request by any officials of any Governmental Entity
for amendments or supplements to any filings made pursuant to, or information
provided to comply in with, Applicable Laws, and (iv) prior to making any
material change to a study protocol, the addition of new trials, or a material
change to the development timeline for any of its product candidates or
programs; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event either CTI or Novuspharma
(x) is contacted by a Regulatory Agency, and (y) has made a good faith effort
to include representatives of the other party in such discussion without
success, then CTI or Novuspharma, as appropriate, shall be allowed to
participate in such discussions without the other party and shall promptly
inform the other party of the content of such discussions.



(c) No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation or
notification pursuant to this Section 5.2 shall affect or be deemed to modify

5.3 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Notification_.



(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done,
and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the making of all necessary
registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Entities and
Regulatory Agencies, if any), (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions,
consents, approvals or waivers from Governmental Entities, Regulatory Agencies
and other third parties, (iii) the taking of all reasonable steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Entity or Regulatory Agency, (iv) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of,
this Agreement, (v) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings,
brought by third parties (other than Governmental Entities) challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, including using commercially reasonable efforts to lift, rescind or
mitigate the effect of any injunction or restraining order or other order
adversely affecting the ability of any party hereto to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, (vi) the taking of all reasonable actions
to fulfill the conditions to the obligations of CTI or Novuspharma set forth
in Article VI of this Agreement, and (vii) the using of all reasonable efforts
to prevent, with respect to a threatened or pending temporary, preliminary or
permanent injunction or other order, decree or ruling or statute, rule,
regulation or executive order, the entry, enactment or promulgation thereof,
as the case may be; provided, however, that neither CTI nor Novuspharma shall
be obligated to take any action pursuant to the foregoing if the taking of
such action or the obtaining of any waiver, consent, approval or exemption is
reasonably likely to be materially burdensome to Novuspharma or CTI and its
subsidiaries (taken as a whole) or to impact in a materially adverse manner
the economic or business benefits of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement so as to render inadvisable the consummation of the Merger. In
connection with and without limiting the foregoing, CTI and Novuspharma and
members of their respective Boards of Directors shall (1) grant such approvals
and take all such other actions as may be necessary so that no United States
federal or state or Italian takeover statute or similar statute or regulation
is or becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (2) if any United States
federal or state or Italian takeover statute or similar statute or regulation
becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any other transaction



 

51 contemplated by this Agreement, use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure
that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
thereby and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effect of such statute or
regulation on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.



(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to require any party hereto to
take or agree to take any Action of Divestiture (as defined below). For
purposes of this Agreement, an "Action of Divestiture" shall mean making
proposals, executing or carrying out agreements or submitting to Judgments
providing for the license, sale or other disposition or holding
separate (through the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any material
assets or categories of material assets or the holding separate of Novuspharma
Ordinary Shares or imposing or seeking to impose any limitation on the ability
of any party hereof to conduct its respective business in any material
respect or own such assets or to acquire, hold or exercise full rights of
ownership of Novuspharmas business.



(c) Novuspharma shall give prompt written notice to CTI, and CTI shall give
prompt written notice to Novuspharma, of (i) any representation or warranty
made by it contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality
becoming untrue, incorrect or incomplete in any respect or any such
representation or warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue,
incorrect or incomplete in any material respect, (ii) the failure by it to
comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, or
(iii) the occurrence of any change or event having, or which insofar as can
reasonably be foreseen as having, individually or in the aggregate, a material
adverse effect on Novuspharma or CTI, as the case may be; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that no such notification shall (1) affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement, or (2) limit or otherwise
affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.



5.4 _Termination of Novuspharma Stock Options, Assumption of Novuspharma
Stock Option Plans and Treatment of Novuspharma Employees_.



(a) CTI shall assume the Novuspharma Stock Option Plans at the Effective
Time. Prior to the Effective Time, Novuspharma shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide that each outstanding Novuspharma Stock Option
shall accelerate and become fully vested and exercisable, and to the extent
not exercised prior to the Effective Time, shall terminate and be cancelled
and shall not be assumed by CTI. Novuspharma shall take (or cause to be taken)
all actions necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective immediately prior
to the Effective Time, each Novuspharma Stock Option. In furtherance of the

informing them that the Novuspharma Stock Options not exercised prior to the
Effective Time shall terminate immediately prior to the Effective Time, which
notice shall be provided to the optionees no later than fifteen (15) days
prior to the Effective Time. The form and substance of such notice shall be
subject to advance review and approval of CTI, which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld.



(b) On or after the Effective Time, CTI shall issue options to acquire CTI
Common Stock to those Novuspharma employees and on such other terms and
conditions (including number of shares of CTI Common Stock and vesting
provisions) as determined by CTI in its discretion (the "New CTI Options").

price equal to the greater of: (i) the average of the closing prices for a
share of CTI Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market for each trading day
during the one-month period immediately preceding the Effective Time or the
relevant date of grant, and (ii) the average of the closing prices for a
share of CTI Common Stock on the Nuovo Mercato Telematico Azionario (if
applicable) for each trading day during the one-month period immediately
preceding the Effective Time or the relevant date of grant. The New CTI
Options shall be granted under and subject to the terms and conditions of the
assumed Novuspharma Stock Option Plans and written option agreements to be
entered into by and between CTI and each applicable optionee.



(c) CTI shall take such actions as are reasonable or appropriate to
effectuate the provisions of this Section 5.4, including the reservation,
issuance and listing of the shares of CTI Common Stock that are subject to the
New CTI Options and available for grant under the assumed Novuspharma Stock
Option Plans. CTI shall use commercially reasonable efforts to file a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) for the shares of
CTI Common Stock issuable with respect to the New CTI Options and available
for grant under the assumed Novuspharma Stock Option Plans to the extent Form
S-8 (or any successor form) is available as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain such registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form)
thereafter for as long as such New CTI Options are outstanding or such shares
remain available for issuance under the assumed Novuspharma Stock Option
Plans.



(d) Novuspharma shall take such actions prior to the Effective Time as are
reasonable or appropriate to effect the provisions of this Section 5.4,
including, without limitation, (i) taking such actions as may be required to
confirm that the CTI Board of Directors shall, effective as of the Effective
Time, become the administrator of the assumed Novuspharma Stock Option Plans
and shall have any and all amendment authority with respect thereto, and (ii)

to effect the termination of Novuspharma Stock Options and assumption of
Novuspharma Stock Option Plans contemplated by this Section 5.4.

steps as may be reasonably required to cause the transactions contemplated by

limitation, derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by each
individual who (i) is a director or officer of Novuspharma, or (ii) at the
Effective Time, shall become a director or officer of the Surviving
Corporation, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act, such steps to be taken in accordance with and to the extent permissible

(f) On and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
maintain plans for the benefit of each employee of Novuspharma as of the
Effective Time (collectively, the "Novuspharma Employees") that provide
benefits to each such employee that are no less favorable, in the aggregate,
to such employees than the benefits provided under the Novuspharma Benefit
Plans as of the Effective Time.



 

53 (g) Except as provided in Section 5.4(b), with respect to each employee
benefit plan, practice or policy of the Surviving Corporation or any of its
affiliates in which Novuspharma Employees participate on or after the
Effective Time, each such Novuspharma Employee shall be given credit under
such plan, practice or policy for all service with Novuspharma or any
predecessor employer or other entity, to the extent such credit was given by
Novuspharma or any predecessor employer or other entity under a comparable
Novuspharma Benefit Plan, for all purposes, including, without limitation,
for purposes of determining eligibility, vesting, benefit accrual, and
determination of benefit levels, and for all other purposes for which such
service is either taken into account; provided, however, that such credit
shall not result in duplication of benefits. Such service shall also apply for
purposes of satisfying any waiting periods, evidence of insurability
requirements, or the application of any pre-existing condition limitations.
Novuspharma Employees shall be given full credit for amounts paid under any
Novuspharma Benefit Plan during the same calendar year in which they commence
participation in a comparable employee benefit plan of the Surviving
Corporation for purposes of applying deductibles, copayments and out-of-
pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the comparable employee benefit plan of the Surviving
Corporation.

preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications
or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use,

forth in the Bylaws attached hereto as _Exhibit H_ , which provisions
mentioned under clause (i) and (ii) above shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who on

of Novuspharma, unless such modification is required by Applicable Laws.



(b) For three (3) years from the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall maintain in effect directors and officers liability insurance covering
Novuspharmas directors and managers currently covered by Novuspharmas
directors and officers liability insurance policies (copies of which have
been heretofore delivered or made available to CTI) which directors and
managers are set forth on _Schedule 5.6_ of the Novuspharma Disclosure
Schedules (the "Covered Novuspharma Directors and Managers") on terms no less
favorable than the terms of such current insurance coverage; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in lieu of the purchase of such insurance by the Surviving
Corporation, CTI, with Novuspharmas written consent, may purchase a three (3)
year extended reporting period endorsement under its existing Directors and
Officers liability insurance coverage;  _provided_ further that in no event
will the Surviving Corporation be required to pay annualized aggregate
premiums for insurance under this Section 5.6(b) in excess of one hundred and
fifty percent



 

54 (150%) of the amount of the aggregate premiums paid by Novuspharma for such
coverage for the year ended December 31, 2002, and to the extent such
premiums would exceed one hundred and fifty percent (150%) of such amount, the
Surviving Corporation shall use all reasonable efforts to cause to be

successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its

thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 7.1(e) shall not be available to Novuspharma where the
failure to obtain Novuspharma Shareholder Approval shall have been caused by
the action or failure to act of Novuspharma and such action or failure to act
constitutes a material breach by Novuspharma of this Agreement;



(f) by either CTI or Novuspharma, if any approval of the shareholders of
CTI required for the consummation of the Merger shall not have been obtained
by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at a duly held meeting of

_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
7.1(f) shall not be available to CTI where the failure to obtain CTI

7.2 _Effect of Termination_.



(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Novuspharma or
CTI as provided in Section 7.1 hereof, and subject to the provisions of
Section 8.1 hereof, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no
effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of CTI or Novuspharma
or their respective officers or directors, except as set forth in this
Section 7.2, and in Sections 2.16(b), 3.16(b), 5.8 and Article VIII hereof,
which shall survive termination, and to the extent that such termination
results from the willful breach by a party of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement in which case
such willfully breaching party shall not be relieved from any liability or
obligations. No termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of
the parties contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which
obligations shall survive any termination of this Agreement.



(b) If this Agreement is terminated (i) pursuant to Sections 7.1(d), (f) or
(g) hereof or (ii) by Novuspharma as a result of CTIs material breach of
Section 4.3 hereof, CTI shall pay to Novuspharma, promptly, but in any event
within five (5) days of such termination, a termination fee of US$ 4,750,000
(the "CTI Termination Fee");  _provided_ , that in the case of termination
under Section 7.1(d) or (f): (A) such payment shall be made only if following
the date hereof and prior to termination of this Agreement, there has been any
offer or proposal for a CTI Alternative Transaction with respect to CTI and
within twelve (12) months following the termination of this Agreement CTI or
its subsidiaries enters into an agreement providing for an Acquisition of CTI
or an Acquisition of CTI is consummated, and (B) such payment shall be made
promptly, but in no event later than one (1) business day after the earlier of
the entering into of such agreement or consummation of such Acquisition of
CTI, as the case may be. CTI hereby acknowledges and agrees that the amount
of the CTI Termination Fee is fair after taking into account the value of the
Merger, the transactions contemplated hereby and all of the costs and expenses
already incurred by the parties before entering into this Agreement.



(c) If this Agreement is terminated (i) pursuant to Sections 7.1(d), (e)
or (h) hereof or (ii) by CTI as a result of Novuspharmas material breach of
Section 4.4, Novuspharma shall pay to CTI, promptly, but in any event within
five (5) days of such termination, a termination fee of US$ 4,750,000 (the
"Novuspharma Termination Fee"); _provided_ , that in the case of termination
under Sections 7.1(d) or (e): (A) such payment shall be made only if following
the date hereof and prior to termination of this Agreement, there has been
any offer or proposal for a Novuspharma Alternative Transaction with respect
to Novuspharma and within twelve (12) months following the termination of this
Agreement Novuspharma enters into an agreement providing for an Acquisition
of Novuspharma or an Acquisition of Novuspharma is consummated, and (B) such
payment shall be made promptly, but in no event later than one (1) business
day after the earlier of the entering into of such agreement or



 

61 consummation of such Acquisition of Novuspharma, as the case may be.
Novuspharma hereby acknowledges and agrees that the amount of the Novuspharma
Termination Fee is fair after taking into account the value of the Merger, the
transactions contemplated hereby and all of the costs and expenses already
incurred by the parties before entering into this Agreement.



(d) The CTI Termination Fee and the Novuspharma Termination Fee
(individually, "Termination Fee") payable under Sections 7.2(b) and (c),
respectively, shall each (i) be payable in immediately available funds, and
(ii) be paid free and clear of all deductions or withholdings. With respect
to the CTI Termination Fee and the Novuspharma Termination Fee, in the event
that a deduction or withholding is required by law, the party owing the
Termination Fee to the other shall pay such additional amount as shall be
required to ensure that the net amount received by the party entitled to the
Termination Fee shall equal the full amount which would have been received by
it, had no such deduction or withholding been required to be made, and
the owing party shall indemnify such other party for such withholding or
deductions, and interest, additions to tax and penalties thereon.



(e) For the purposes of this Section 7.2 only, "Acquisition," with respect
to a party hereto, shall mean any of the following transactions (other than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement): (i) a merger, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the party pursuant to which the shareholders of the
party immediately preceding such transaction hold less than sixty percent
(60%) of the aggregate voting securities in the surviving or resulting entity
of such transaction or any direct or indirect parent thereof, (ii) a sale or
other disposition by the party of assets representing in excess of forty
percent (40%) of the aggregate fair market value of the partys business
immediately prior to such sale, or (iii) the acquisition by any person
or group (including by way of a tender offer or an exchange offer or issuance
by the party or such person or group), directly or indirectly, of beneficial
ownership or a right to acquire beneficial ownership of securities
representing in excess of forty percent (40%) of the voting power of the then
outstanding voting securities of the party.



7.3 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any
time before or after the Shareholder Approvals; _provided_ , _however_ , that
after such Shareholder Approvals have been obtained there shall not be made
any amendment that by law requires further approval by either the shareholders
of Novuspharma or CTI without the further approval of such shareholders. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties.



7.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, a
party may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made by the other party contained in this
Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c)
subject to the proviso of Section 7.3 hereof, waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions of the other party contained in this Agreement. Any
agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing, signed by or on behalf
of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its
rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of
those rights.

constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the

hereof, are not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties
hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.

respective successors and assigns.



8.9 _Specific Performance_. Each party hereto recognizes and agrees
that, if for any reason any of the provisions of this Agreement are not
performed by the other party in accordance with their specific terms or are
otherwise breached, immediate and irreparable harm



 

65 or injury would be caused to the non-breaching party for which money damages
would not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, the parties agree that, in
addition to any other available remedies, the non-breaching party shall be
entitled to an injunction restraining any violation or threatened violation of
the provisions of this Agreement without the necessity of the non-breaching
party posting a bond or other form of security. In the event that any action
should be brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, the
breaching party will not allege, and the breaching party hereby waives

invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction by any rule or law or
public policy shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of
such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without rendering invalid,
illegal or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement
or affecting the validity, legality or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. Without limiting the
foregoing, upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable
Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated
hereby are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.

EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO PREVENT OR DELAY ENFORCEMENT OF EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS,
(II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III)
IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
