MEMBERSHIP INTEREST AND STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT 

   

 This MEMBERSHIP INTEREST AND STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT, dated as of May 28, 2008 (this " _Agreement_ "), is entered into by and among RIGDON MARINE HOLDINGS, L.L.C., a Louisiana limited liability company (" _RMH_ "); RIGDON MARINE CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (" _RMC;_ RMH and RMC each a " _Company_ " and collectively, the " _Companies_ "); all the members of RMH; and SHERWOOD INVESTMENT, L.L.C. (" _Sherwood_ "), JOHN J. TENNANT III IRREVOCABLE TRUST (" _Tennant Trust_ "), BRIAN M. BOWMAN IRREVOCABLE TRUST (" _Bowman Trust_ "; Sherwood, Tennant Trust and Bowman Trust collectively, " _Tennant_ ") and BOURBON OFFSHORE (f/k/a BOURBON OFFSHORE HOLDINGS, SAS), a French corporation (" _Bourbon_ "), as shareholders of RMC (each of the members of RMH and the shareholders of RMC who are signatories hereto, collectively " _Sellers_ "); and Gulfmark Offshore, Inc., a Delaware corporation (together, with any Subsidiary designated by it under _Section 11.3_, " _GLF_ " or " _Buyer_ "). 

  

 WHEREAS, RMC owns and operates offshore support vessels to provide transportation of materials and supplies to and from offshore platforms and drilling rigs (the " _Business_ "); 

  

 WHEREAS, the members of RMH desire to sell their memberships interests in RMH (the " _RMH Interests_ ") to Buyer; 

  

 WHEREAS, the shares of Common Stock in RMC that are not owned by RMH are owned by Tennant and Bourbon, and they desire to sell their shares in RMC (the " _RMC Shares_ ") to Buyer (the RMH Interests and the RMC Shares collectively, the " _Equity Interests_ "); and 

  

 WHEREAS, Buyer desires to purchase the Equity Interests; 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements set forth herein and for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 
 DEFINITIONS 

   

 1.1 _Definitions_. Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have the meanings indicated in _Annex I_. 

  

ARTICLE II 
 PURCHASE AND SALE OF EQUITY INTERESTS 

   

 2.1 _Sale of Equity Interests_. On and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer agrees to purchase from Sellers, and each Seller agrees to sell to Buyer, the Equity Interests for the consideration specified below in this _Article II_. 

  

 2.2 _Base Purchase Price for Equity Interests_. Buyer agrees to pay to Sellers for the purchase of the Equity Interests as designated on _Schedule 2.2(a)_ an aggregate base purchase price of Two Hundred Seventy-Five Million Dollars ($275,000,000) (the " _Base Purchase Price_ "), consisting of One Hundred Fifty Million Dollars ($150,000,000) in cash (the " _Cash Purchase_  

   ##### 

  

    

 _Price_ ") and 2,085,700 shares (the " _Shares_ ") of GLFs Common Stock, par
value $.01 (the " _GLF Common Stock_ ") valued, by agreement of the Parties,
at One Hundred Twenty-Five Million Dollars ($125,000,000). The Cash Purchase
Price, as adjusted by _Section 2.3(b)_ , less the Escrow Deposit, will be
paid by Buyer to Sellers at the Closing by bank wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by the
Seller Representative at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing. At
the Closing, subject to adjustment in accordance with _Section 2.2(c)_,
Buyer shall deliver the Shares to the Seller Representative for distribution
to Sellers, as designated on _Schedule 2.2(b)_. 

  

 2.3 _Establishment of Closing Working Capital Amount and Closing Adjustments to the Base Purchase Price_. 

   

 (a) _Establishment of Closing Working Capital Amount_. _Schedule 2.3(a)_ contains a net working capital statement, prepared in accordance with GAAP, of the combined Companies as of the close of business on April 30, 2008 (the " _Closing Working Capital Amount_ "). 

   

 (b) _Closing Adjustments to the Cash Purchase Price_. 

   

 (i) The Cash Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount to settle all amounts due under the Companies phantom stock plan as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which is Three Million, One Hundred Twenty One Thousand, One Hundred and Eleven ($3,121,111) as reflected in _Schedule 2.3(b)(i)_ (the " _Phantom Stock Plan Settlement Amounts_ "), which will be paid by the Company prior to the Closing. 

   

 (ii) The Cash Purchase Price shall be reduced in accordance with _Section 6.8_. 

   

 (c) _Closing Adjustments to the Number of Shares_. If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, there is (i) any change in the outstanding GLF Common Stock that occurs by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon; or (ii) any cash dividend or other distribution (other than a regular quarterly dividend not in excess of that paid in the prior quarter) paid with respect to the GLF Common Stock; the number of Shares to be delivered to Sellers shall be appropriately adjusted to provide Sellers the same economic benefit as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. 

  

 2.4 _Post-Closing Adjustments to the Base Purchase Price_. 

   

 (a) _In General_. The Base Purchase Price shall also be subject to upward or downward adjustment after Closing (the " _Post-Closing Adjustment_ ") in the manner (i) set forth in this _Section 2.4_ based upon a comparison of the Closing Working Capital Amount and the Final Working Capital Amount, and (ii) as set forth in _Section 9.3_, to the extent such adjustment is known as of the date that the Adjustment Amount Statement is finalized under _Sections 2.4(b) or (c)_. If the Adjustment Amount Statement, as modified, reports that the Final Working Capital Amount is in excess of One Million Dollars 

   ##### 

  

    

($1,000,000) greater than the Closing Working Capital Amount, the amount in
excess of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) will be due to Sellers from Buyer
(" _Seller Final Closing Adjustment Amount_ ") and shall be paid to the
Seller Representative, together with interest thereon from the Closing Date
to the date of payment, within five (5) Business Days following the date when
the same shall be determined finally in accordance with this  _Section 2.4_.
If the Adjustment Amount Statement, as modified, reports that the Final
Working Capital Amount is an amount in excess of One Million Dollars
($1,000,000) less than the Closing Working Capital Amount, the amount in
excess of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) less will be due to Buyer from
Sellers (" _Buyer Final Closing Adjustment Amount_ ") and shall be paid to
Buyer by the Seller Representative on behalf of Sellers, together with
interest thereon from the Closing Date to the date of payment, from the
Escrow Funds within five (5) Business Days following the date when the same
shall be determined finally in accordance with this _Section 2.4_. Either
the Seller Final Closing Adjustment Amount or the Buyer Final Closing
Adjustment Amount shall hereafter be called the " _Final Closing Adjustment
Amount_." In addition, any post-Closing adjustment to the Base Purchase Price
determined pursuant to _Section 9.3_ shall be paid to Buyer by the Seller
Representative on behalf of Sellers and may be paid from available Escrow
Funds. 

   

 (b) _Transaction Expenses_. Prior to and after the Closing, the Companies will pay or accrue the actual and estimated expenses related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for the Companies and for Sellers, including all change in control and severance payments, all Company employment taxes related to these expenses and the Phantom Stock Plan Settlement Amounts, the cost to prepare the Companies and Sellers information for inclusion in the Notification and Report Forms under the HSR Act, the cost to prepare all Tax Returns relating to the period prior to the Closing Date pursuant to _Section 9.2(c)_ , and all legal and accounting fees and other costs incurred by the Companies and Sellers through the Closing (collectively, the " _Transaction Expenses_ "). 

   

 (c) _Final Working Capital Amount and Adjustment Amount Statement_. Within forty-five (45) days after the Closing, Buyer shall prepare and submit to the Seller Representative a working capital statement calculating the working capital amount as of the close of business on the Closing Date, following the format set forth in _Schedule 2.3(a)_ , prepared in accordance with GAAP, of the Companies (the " _Final Working Capital Amount_ "), and comparing the Final Working Capital Amount with the Closing Working Capital Amount (the " _Adjustment Amount Statement_ "). In preparing the Adjustment Amount Statement: (x) the Transaction Expenses will be reflected as liabilities in the Final Working Capital Amount, (y) the Phantom Stock Plan Settlement Amounts included as part of the Transaction Expenses will be added back to the Final Working Capital Amount to prevent a duplicate charge to Sellers, and (z) all attorneys fees, costs, expenses, bank fees, break-up fees, prepayment fees and other fees, charges, costs and expenses associated with the financing of the transaction contemplated by _Section 6.9_ of this Agreement shall not be included in the Final Working Capital Amount but shall be for the account of Buyer. 

   

 (i) If within thirty (30) days following its receipt of the Adjustment Amount Statement, the Seller Representative does not provide written notice to 

   ##### 

  

    

Buyer of any objection to such calculations, then the Adjustment
Amount Statement shall be binding on the Parties for purposes of the Post-
Closing Adjustment contemplated by this _Section 2.4_. 

   

 (ii) If, however, the Seller Representative gives timely written notice of such objection under the previous subsection to the calculations, and the Seller Representative and Buyer resolve their disagreements within fifteen (15) Business Days of Buyers receipt of such notice, then, as to any disputes that are resolved the Adjustment Amount Statement, as modified by the mutual agreement of the Parties, shall be binding on the Parties for purposes of the Post-Closing Adjustment contemplated by this _Section 2.4_. 

   

 (d) _Resolving Disputes_. If the Seller Representative provides timely written notice of an objection and the Parties are not able to resolve their disagreements within fifteen (15) Business Days of Buyers receipt of such notice, then Buyer and the Seller Representative shall promptly (in any event within ten (10) Business Days after such fifteen (15) Business Day period) refer their remaining differences to PriceWaterhouseCoopers, LLC or any other nationally recognized firm of independent certified accountants mutually agreed upon by the Seller Representative and Buyer (the " _Selected Accountants_ "). Acting as experts and not arbitrators, the Selected Accountants shall determine, but only with respect to the remaining differences between Buyer and the Seller Representative so submitted, any necessary adjustments to the (A) Final Working Capital Amount, (B) the Adjustment Amount Statement and (C) the Final Closing Adjustment Amount. The Final Working Capital Amount, the Adjustment Amount Statement and the Final Closing Adjustment Amount with such adjustments, if any, determined by the Selected Accountants shall constitute the Final Working Capital Amount, the Adjustment Amount Statement and the Final Closing Adjustment Amount. The determinations and adjustments made by the Selected Accountants shall be based solely on presentations with respect to the disputed items by Buyer and Seller Representative to the Selected Accountants and not on the Selected Accountants independent review or audit. Buyer and Seller Representative shall use their reasonable efforts to make their presentations as promptly as practicable following submission to the Selected Accountants of the disputed items. Buyer and the Seller Representative shall each be entitled, as part of their presentations, to respond to the presentation of the other Party and any questions and requests of the Selected Accountants. In deciding any matter, the Selected Accountants (i) shall be bound by the provisions of this _Section 2.4_, including the methodology for calculation contained in _Schedule 2.3(a)_, and (ii) may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either Buyer or the Seller Representative or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by Buyer or the Seller Representative. The Selected Accountants determination shall be made within forty-five (45) days after its engagement, or as soon thereafter as practicable.

 (a) _Tax Returns and Payments_.

To the Knowledge of each Seller and Company, all such Tax Returns were correct and complete in all respects and were prepared in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. All Taxes due and owing by the Companies (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have been paid. No claim has ever been made by a Governmental Authority in a jurisdiction where any Company does not file Tax Returns that such Company is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. There are no Liens for Taxes (other than Taxes not yet due and payable) upon any of the assets of any Company. _Section 4.16(a)_ of the Companies Disclosure Schedule lists all Tax Returns filed with respect to each Company for taxable periods ending after the formation of such Company, and indicates those Tax Returns that have been audited and those Tax Returns that currently are the subject of audit.

No Company has received from any foreign, federal, state, or local taxing authority (including jurisdictions where such Company has not filed Tax Returns) any (i) written notice indicating an intent to open an audit or other review, (ii) request for information related to Tax matters, or (iii) notice of deficiency or proposed adjustment for any amount of Tax proposed, asserted, or assessed by any taxing authority against such Company.

No Company has been a United States real property holding corporation within the meaning of Code §897(c)(2) during the applicable period specified in Code §897(c)(1)(A)(ii). Each Company has disclosed on their federal income Tax Returns all positions taken therein that could give rise to a substantial understatement of federal income Tax within the meaning of Code §6662. 

   

 (f) _Reserves_. The unpaid Taxes of the Companies (i) did not, as of the most recent fiscal month end, exceed the reserve for Tax liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the most recent balance sheet (rather than in any notes thereto) and (ii) do not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom and practice of the Companies in filing their Tax Returns.

 (v) prepaid amount received on or prior to the Closing Date.

Each lease and sublease listed in _Section 4.17(b)_ of the Companies Disclosure Schedule is legal, valid, binding, enforceable, and in full force and effect. Each Company has duly performed all of its obligations thereunder to the extent that such obligations to perform have accrued and, as to each Company that is a party thereto, no breach or default, alleged breach or default, or event which would (with the passage of time, notice or both) constitute a breach or default thereunder by any Company or, to the Knowledge of such Company, by the other party thereto, has occurred or is continuing. 

   

 (c) _Personal Property_.

with the operation of the Business or the construction of the Vessels under
construction.

 (ii) Sellers and the Companies shall notify Buyer promptly after receipt by Sellers or any Company (or any of their advisors) of any inquiry relating to any potential Acquisition Proposal and the terms of such proposal or inquiry, including the identity of the Person and its Affiliates making the same, that it may receive in respect of any such transaction, and shall keep Buyer informed on a current basis with respect to any significant developments with respect to the foregoing. 

   

 (iii) Sellers and the Companies shall, and shall cause the officers, directors, advisors, employees, representatives and other agents of Sellers and the Companies to, cease and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with third parties conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. 

   

 (b) _Supplements to Certain Schedules_. Prior to the Closing Date, each Company and Seller shall provide to Buyer updates to _Schedules 3.1_ , _IV_ , and  _9.1_.

In the event notice of any claim for indemnification under this _Article X_ is given within the applicable survival period set forth in this _Section 10.1_, the expiration of the representations and warranties that are the subject of such indemnification claim shall not affect the validity of such claim or the Indemnified Partys right to be indemnified hereunder until such claim is finally resolved, but only insofar as it relates to the specific indemnification claim as to which notice was given prior to expiration. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (d) _Knowledge_. The right of Buyer to indemnification, payment of Losses or other remedy based on the representations, warranties, covenants and obligations contained in this Agreement will not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of, or compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation, including any matter listed in the Schedules hereto, whether at the time of execution or as updated between execution and Closing. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to indemnification, payment of Losses or other remedy based on such representations, warranties, covenants and obligations. 

  

 10.2 _Sellers  Indemnification_. Subject to the terms and conditions of _Section 10.4_ , from and after the Closing, Sellers hereby agree, jointly and severally, that they shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer, the Companies and each of their Affiliates and, if applicable, their respective directors, officers, shareholders and employees and their heirs, successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all costs (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), losses, claims or damages (collectively, " _Losses_ ") sustained, incurred or suffered by or asserted against any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, directly or indirectly, by reason of or resulting from or arising out of: (a) the breach of any representation or warranty made by Sellers in _Section 3.1_ or the Companies in _Article IV_, subject to the limitations contained in _Sections 10.1(a), (c) and (d)_ and _10.5(a), (c)_ and _(d)_ ; (b) all liabilities of the Companies arising from or relating to any pre-Closing event or pre-Closing period; and (c) any breach of any covenant of Sellers or the Companies. 

  

 10.3 _Buyer Indemnification_. Subject to the terms and conditions of _Section 10.4_ , from and after the Closing, Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Seller, its Affiliates and, if applicable, their respective directors, officers, shareholders, managers, members, trustees, beneficiaries and employees and their heirs, successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ " and, such parties, together with the Buyer Indemnified Parties, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against all Losses sustained, incurred or suffered by or asserted against any of the Seller Indemnified Parties, directly or indirectly, by reason of or resulting from or arising out of: (a) the breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer in _Section 3.2_, subject to the limitations contained in  _Sections 10.1(b)_ and _(c)_ and _10.5(b), (c)_ and _(d)_ ; (b) all liabilities arising after the Closing Date for obligations relating to operation of the Companies after the Closing Date; and (c) any breach of any covenant of Buyer. 

  

 10.4 _Conditions of Indemnification_. The respective obligations and liabilities of Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand (herein sometimes called the "indemnifying party"), to the other (herein sometimes called the "party to be indemnified") under _Article X_ hereof shall be subject to the following terms and conditions: 

   

 (a) within 60 days after receipt of notice of commencement of any action or the assertion of any claim by a third party (whether or not any Loss from such claim is within the Basket), the party to be indemnified shall give the indemnifying party written notice thereof together with a copy of such claim, process or other legal pleading (provided that failure to so notify the indemnifying party of the assertion of a claim 

   ##### 

  

    

within such period shall not affect its indemnity obligation hereunder except
as and to the extent that the indemnifying party demonstrates that it has
been prejudiced by such delay), and the indemnifying party shall have the
right to undertake the defense thereof by representatives of its own
choosing; in any event, the indemnified party will be entitled to participate
in at its own cost, but not control, the defense of such claim with counsel
of its choice at its own expense; 

   

 (b) in the event that the indemnifying party, by the 30th day after receipt of notice of any such claim (or, if earlier, by the tenth day preceding the day on which an answer or other pleading must be served in order to prevent judgment by default in favor of the person asserting such claim), does not elect to defend against such claim, the party to be indemnified will (upon further notice to the indemnifying party) have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such claim on behalf of and for the account of the indemnifying party, subject to the right of the indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim at any time prior to settlement, compromise or final determination thereof; 

   

 (c) if there is a reasonable probability that a claim may materially and adversely affect the indemnified party other than as a result of money damages or other money payments, such claim shall not be settled or compromised without the prior written consent of both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, in such case such consent not to be unreasonably withheld; 

   

 (d) in connection with any such indemnification, the indemnified party will cooperate in all reasonable requests of the indemnifying party; and 

   

 (e) neither party hereto will be liable to the other hereunder for any punitive or exemplary or consequential damages of any nature relating to any claim for which either such party may be entitled to recover under this Agreement; provided, however, that this limitation shall not apply to any indemnification claim by any party to this Agreement based (i) on a third party claim which includes, as part of that third party claim, a claim for consequential damages, or (ii) on a claim which alleges willful misconduct or fraud. 

  

 10.5 _Limitations_. 

   

 (a) _Limits on Sellers  Obligations_. Sellers shall not be liable to Buyer Indemnified Parties for indemnification under _Section 10.2(a)_ for any Losses except to the extent (and then only to the extent) such Losses exceed an aggregate amount equal to Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) (the " _Basket_ "), and then only for all such Losses in excess thereof up to Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000) (the " _Cap_ "); provided, however, that the foregoing limitations do not apply to indemnification claims with respect to breaches of the representations or warranties contained in _Sections 3.1(b)_ (Authorization of Transaction), _(f)_ (Binding Effect) and _(i)_  (Equity Interests) and _Sections 4.2_ (Authorization; No Contravention), _4.5_  (Binding Effect), _4.7_ (Capitalization) and _4.9(a)_ (Vessels) or for indemnifiable Taxes described in _Section 9.2_. Sellers obligations to Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be satisfied initially from the Escrow 

   ##### 

  

    

Funds, and the Seller Representative and Buyer shall execute all documents
necessary to release the applicable amount from the Escrow Funds. 

   

 (b) _Limits on Buyer s Obligations_. Buyer shall not be liable to Seller Indemnified Parties for indemnification under _Section 10.3(a)_ for any Losses except to the extent (and then only to the extent) the Losses exceed an aggregate amount equal to the Basket, and then only for all such Losses in excess thereof up to the Cap; provided, however, that the foregoing limitations do not apply to any indemnification claims with respect to breaches of the representations or warranties contained in _Section 3.2(b)_ (Authorization of Transaction), _(f)_ (Binding Effect), _(h)_ (Shares) and  _(m)_ (Environmental Matters), or to the indemnity obligations of Buyer for indemnifiable Taxes described in _Section 9.2_. 

   

 (c) _Limitations on Sellers  and Buyers Obligations_. The amount of any Losses payable under _Sections 10.2_ or _10.3_ shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by the party to be indemnified under applicable insurance policies of the Companies or from any other Person alleged to be responsible therefor. If the party to be indemnified receives any amounts under such applicable insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any Losses subsequent to an indemnification payment by the indemnifying party, then such party to be indemnified shall promptly reimburse the indemnifying party for any payment made or expense incurred in connection with providing such indemnification payment up to the amount received by the party to be indemnified, net of any expenses incurred by such party to be indemnified in collecting such amount. The Parties shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available under insurance coverage and from any other Person alleged to have responsibility therefor. 

   

 (d) _No Duplication of Recovery_. Any liability for indemnification under  _Article X_ shall be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of (i) the state of facts giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or by reason a claim for indemnification may be made under more than one of _Sections 10.2(a)_, _(b)_ or _(c)_ or  _10.3(a)_ , _(b)_ or _(c)_ , as the case may be or (ii) any Post-Closing Adjustment to the Base Purchase Price pursuant to _Article II_.

 (b) _Waiver_. No failure or delay on the part of any Seller or Buyer in exercising any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

 11.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
