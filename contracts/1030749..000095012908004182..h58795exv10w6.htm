other forms of insurance providing insurance coverage to or for any Company or its Vessels since
the Companies started operating the Business are listed in <U>Section&nbsp;4.23</U> of the Companies&#146;
Disclosure Schedule and (a)&nbsp;each Company is named insured under such policies; (b)&nbsp;all premiums
required to be paid with respect thereto covering all periods up to and including the Closing have
been paid; (c)&nbsp;all of such insurance policies have been issued on an &#147;occurrence&#148; basis; (d)&nbsp;there
has been no complete lapse in insurance coverage at any time; (e)&nbsp;there are not presently, and
after the Closing there will not be, any retrospective premiums due under any of such policies,
except losses under the stop loss on any Company&#146;s workmen&#146;s compensation policy, which losses are
reserved against on the Financial Statements; (f)&nbsp;each Vessel shall be insured against loss and/or
damage of a type and in an amount not less than the Unavailable Vessel Amount in <U>Annex II</U>;
and (g)&nbsp;no notice of cancellation or termination has been received with respect to any such policy.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, RMC may be subject to call by its current protection and indemnity
insurance club, The Steamship Mutual Underwriting Association Bermuda Limited, for mutual losses in
accordance with club rules, but no Company is subject to any call by any protection and indemnity
insurance club as to which it was formerly a member. All prepaid insurance premiums will be fully
refundable on a pro rata basis, subject to customary early termination charges that are provided
for in the policies, and have been accurately recorded as such on the Financial Statements and will
be accurately reflected in the Company&#146;s books and records as of the Closing Date. Except as set
forth in <U>Section&nbsp;4.23</U> of the Companies&#146; Disclosure Schedule, since June&nbsp;30, 2007, no
currently outstanding and unpaid claims have been made by the Company on any of such policies. No
claims are being handled by an insurer of any Company under a reservation of rights letter.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.24 <U>Books and Records</U>. The stock and member record books, books of account and
minute books of each Company, all of which have been made available to Buyer, are complete and
correct in all material respects and have been maintained in accordance with sound business
practices. The minute books of each Company contain materially accurate and complete records of
all meetings of, and corporate action taken by, the stockholders or members, the boards of
Directors or managers and committees of the Boards of Directors or managers, of each Company, and
no meeting of any such stockholders or managers, Board of Directors, or committee has been held for
which minutes have not been prepared and are not contained in such minute books. At the Closing,
all of those books and records will be in the possession of the Company. Each Company has
appropriate internal controls to ensure that all corporate transactions are properly authorized and
recorded and to protect against fraud or material inaccuracy in financial reporting.

any fees or commissions to any broker, finder, or agent with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement for which any Company or Buyer would be liable.
