ARTICLE 2

    

THE MERGER

   

 SECTION 2.01 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Purchaser shall be merged with and into the Company in accordance with applicable law, whereupon the separate existence of Purchaser shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). 

   

 SECTION 2.02 _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable after satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the Merger set forth in Article 7, the Company and Purchaser will file a certificate of merger, in the form of Annex A attached hereto, with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Filing Office_ ") and make all other filings or recordings required by applicable law in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time (the _"Effective Time_ ") as the certificate of merger is duly filed with the Filing Office or at such later time as the parties hereto may agree upon and specify in the certificate of merger. 

   

 SECTION 2.03 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger will take place at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the second Business Day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 7 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of

      

those conditions), at the offices of Fulbright and Jaworski L.L.P., 666 Fifth
Avenue, New York, New York 10103, unless the parties agree to another time,
date or place in writing.

   

 SECTION 2.04 _Effects of the Merger_. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and Purchaser, all as provided under applicable law. 

   

 SECTION 2.05 _Certificate of Incorporation_. The certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended as a result of the Merger to be substantially similar to the certificate of incorporation of the Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time until amended in accordance with applicable law, except that Article First thereof shall read as follows: "The name of the corporation is Pulitzer Inc." 

   

 SECTION 2.06 _By-laws_. The by-laws of the Purchaser at the Effective Time shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with applicable law. 

   

 SECTION 2.07 _Directors and Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with applicable law, (a) the directors of Purchaser at the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (b) the officers of the Purchaser at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation. If requested by Parent, the Company shall deliver the resignations of its directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries effective as of the Effective Time. 

   

 SECTION 2.08 _Company Action_. The Company hereby represents and warrants that its Board of Directors, at a meeting duly called and held on January 29, 2005, acting by unanimous vote, has (a) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger (collectively, the " _Transactions_ "), are advisable and fair to and in the best interests of the Company and the CompanyÂ’s stockholders and declared this Agreement advisable and that the Merger Consideration to be paid for the Company Common Stock is fair to the holders of such shares, (b) approved and adopted this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, which, assuming the truth and accuracy of the representation of Parent and Purchaser in Section 5.07 hereof, makes inapplicable to this Agreement and the Transactions the restrictions on "business combinations" set forth in Section 203 (" _Section_ 203") of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Law_ ") or any similar restrictions set forth in any certificate of incorporation, by-law, voting trust or other agreement as to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party without any further action on the part of the stockholders or the Board of Directors of the Company, (c) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the Company vote to approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger, (d) determined that no other state takeover statute is applicable to the Transactions and (e) determined that the consummation of the Transactions does not constitute an unpermitted transfer of any Company Securities under the CompanyÂ’s certificate of incorporation. Copies of the Board of Directors resolutions confirming such actions have been provided to Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such recommendation may be withdrawn, modified or amended as permitted by Section 6.05. 

       

ARTICLE 3

    

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL 
STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; 
EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

   

 SECTION 3.01 _Conversion of Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any other action on the part of the holder thereof: 

   

  (a)   each share of the CompanyÂ’s common stock, $.01 par value (the  " _Common Stock_ "), and each share of the CompanyÂ’s Class B  common stock, $.01 par value (the " _Class B Common Stock_ " and,  together with the Common Stock, the " _Company Common Stock_ "),  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, except as otherwise  provided in Section 3.01(b) or as provided in Section 3.03 with respect to  shares as to which appraisal rights have been demanded, be converted into the  right to receive from the Surviving Corporation, in cash, without interest, an  amount equal to $64.00 per share (the " _Merger Consideration_ "),  as provided in Section 3.02; 

   

  (b)   each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries as treasury stock or owned by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent  immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and no payment shall  be made with respect thereto; and 

   

 (c)   each share of common stock of Purchaser outstanding immediately prior to the  Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of common stock of  the Surviving Corporation with the same rights and powers as the shares so  converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of  the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 SECTION 3.02 _Payment for Shares in the Merger_. (a) Prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement, Parent shall appoint an agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") reasonably acceptable to the Company for the purpose of exchanging certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") representing shares of the Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, Parent or Purchaser shall deposit with the Paying Agent, in trust for the benefit of the CompanyÂ’s stockholders, cash in immediately available funds sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of each share of Company Common Stock (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ "); provided, however, that no such deposit shall relieve Parent or Purchaser of its obligation to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.01(a). The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the Certificates. Earnings from such investment shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent and the Surviving Corporation, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Certificates. For purposes of determining the amount of the Payment Fund to be made available, Parent shall assume that no holder of shares of Company Common Stock will demand appraisal rights with respect to such shares. 

   

 (b)   As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Paying  Agent to send to each holder of shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective  Time (other 

      

than holders of Certificates referred to in Section 3.01(b) or  Section 3.03)
a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall  be
effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery
of  the Certificates to the Paying Agent and will be in such form and have
such  other provisions as Parent and the Company reasonably specify) and
instructions  for use in effecting the surrender of Certificate(s) for
payment therefor.

   

 (c)   Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the  right to receive the Merger Consideration will be entitled to receive, upon  surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly  completed letter of transmittal, the Merger Consideration in respect of each  share of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate. Until so  surrendered, each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time for  all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. No interest  will be paid or will accrue on the Merger Consideration payable upon surrender  of any Certificate. 

   

 (d)   If any portion of the Payment Fund is to be paid to a Person other than the  Person in whose name a surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a  condition to such payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly  endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person  requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other  Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered  holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent  that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. Each of the Surviving Corporation  and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration  otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 3 such amounts as it is  required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under  any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax law. If the Surviving  Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts  shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the  holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which the Surviving  Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding. 

   

 (e)   If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of  an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,  stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting  by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation  may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with  respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such  lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in  respect of each share of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate,  as contemplated by this Article. 

   

 (f)   After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be  closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of  Company Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented  to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the  Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of each share of Company Common Stock  represented by such Certificate, as provided for, and in accordance with the  procedures set forth, in this Article 3. 

   

 (g)   Any portion of the Payment Fund (and any interest or other income earned  thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock  one year after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and  any such holder who has

      

not exchanged each share of Company Common Stock for the  Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Section 3.02 prior to that time  shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the  Merger
Consideration in respect of each such share without any interest thereon. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Paying Agent nor any party hereto 
shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any
amount  paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or  similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of
shares of Company  Common Stock three years after the Effective Time (or such
earlier date  immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise
escheat to or  become property of any Governmental Entity) shall become, to
the extent  permitted by applicable law, the property of Parent free and
clear of any claims  or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
The Surviving Corporation  shall pay all charges and expenses of the Paying
Agent.

   

 SECTION 3.03 _Dissenting Shares_. Each share of Company Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is held by a holder who has not voted such share in favor of the Merger, who shall have delivered a written demand for appraisal of such share in the manner provided by Delaware Law and who, as of the Effective Time, shall not have effectively withdrawn or lost such right to appraisal (each such share, a " _Dissenting Share_ ") shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration. The holders thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the Delaware Law (" _Section 262_ "). Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled to payment for such shares pursuant to Section 262 shall receive payment therefor from the Surviving Corporation in accordance with Delaware Law; provided, however, that (i) if any such holder of Dissenting Shares shall have failed to establish his or her entitlement to appraisal rights as provided in Section 262, (ii) if any such holder of Dissenting Shares shall have effectively withdrawn his or her demand for appraisal of such shares or lost his or her right to appraisal and payment for shares under Section 262 or (iii) if neither any holder of Dissenting Shares nor the Surviving Corporation shall have filed a petition demanding a determination of the value of all Dissenting Shares within the time provided in Section 262, such holder shall forfeit the right to appraisal of such shares and each such share shall be treated as if it had been converted, as of the Effective Time, into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, from the Surviving Corporation. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands. 

   

 SECTION 3.04 _Stock Options and other Equity Awards_.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

   

 Except as set forth in the disclosure memorandum delivered by the Company to Parent on the date hereof and attached hereto (the " _Company Disclosure Memorandum_ ") (it being understood and agreed that any matter disclosed in a section of the Company Disclosure Memorandum shall be treated as if it were disclosed in other sections of the Company Disclosure Memorandum to which it reasonably applies) or in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Purchaser as follows: 

   

 SECTION 4.01 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries._ Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has the requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now being conducted. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. As used in this Agreement, " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means, except as otherwise provided in Sections 7.02, 7.03 and 8.01(d)(i), any change, effect, event, occurrence or state of facts (or any development that has had or is reasonably likely to have any change or effect) that is, individually or in the aggregate, materially adverse to the business, property, assets, liabilities, financial condition or results of operations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, in the case of Parent, or the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, in the case of the Company, or which would prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions; provided, however, that none of the following shall be deemed in themselves, either alone or in combination, to constitute, and none of the following shall be taken into account in determining whether there has been, a Material Adverse Effect: (i) any adverse change in the market price or trading volume of the capital stock of such Person after the date hereof; provided, however, that this clause (i) shall not exclude any underlying event, occurrence, development or circumstance which may have caused such change in stock price or 

     

trading volume; (ii) any adverse event, occurrence or development affecting
any of the industries in which such Person operates generally (to the extent
that such events, occurrences or developments do not disproportionately
affect such Person as compared to other companies in such industries); (iii)
changes, events or occurrences in financial, credit, banking or securities
markets (including any disruption thereof); (iv) any adverse change, event,
development or effect arising from or relating to general business or
economic conditions (including the business of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, in the case of Parent, and the Company or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries, in the case of the Company) which does not
relate only to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, in the case of Parent, or
the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, in the case of the
Company; (v) any adverse change, event, development or effect attributable to
the announcement or pendency of the Transactions, or resulting from or
relating to compliance with the terms of, or the taking of any
action required by, this Agreement; (vi) any adverse change, event,
development or effect arising from or relating to national or international
political or social conditions, including the engagement by the United States
in hostilities or the escalation thereof, whether or not pursuant to the
declaration of a national emergency or war, or the occurrence of any military
or terrorist attack anywhere in the world; and (vii) any adverse change,
event, development or effect arising from or relating to laws, rules,
regulations, orders or other binding directives issued by any Governmental
Entity that do not relate only to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, in the
case of Parent, or the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, in the
case of the Company. The term " _Subsidiary_ ," with respect to any Person,
means any corporation or other legal entity of which such Person Controls
(either alone or through or together with any other Subsidiary), directly or
indirectly, more than 50% of the capital stock or other ownership interests
the holders of which are generally entitled to vote for the election of the
Board of Directors or other governing body of such corporation or other
legal entity. The Company Disclosure Memorandum lists each Subsidiary of the
Company. The Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies
of its certificate of incorporation and by-laws and the certificates of
incorporation and by-laws (or comparable charter documents) of its
Subsidiaries, in each case as amended to the date hereof. Except as set forth
in the Company Disclosure Memorandum, all of the outstanding shares
of capital stock or other ownership interests of each Subsidiary have been
validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and owned by the Company,
by another Subsidiary of the Company or by the Company and another such
Subsidiary, free and clear of all material pledges, claims, liens, charges,
encumbrances and security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever
(collectively, " _Liens_ "), and free of any restriction on the right to
vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other
ownership interests, except for restrictions imposed by applicable securities
laws. Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Memorandum, there are no
outstanding (i) securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock or other
ownership interests in any Subsidiary of the Company or (ii) options or other
rights to acquire from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or other
obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, any capital
stock or other ownership interests in, or any securities convertible into or
exchangeable for any capital stock or other ownership interests in, any
Subsidiary of the Company. Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure
Memorandum, and except for ownership of less than 1% in any publicly traded
company and the capital stock or other ownership interests of its
Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital
stock or other ownership interest in any corporation, partnership, joint
venture or other entity.

consummate the Transactions. The execution, delivery and performance of this

Without limiting the foregoing, the minimum  employer contributions required by law (and with respect to TNI Partners, to the  Knowledge of the Company) have been made with respect to each Employee Plan. 

   

 (d)   There has been (and with respect to TNI Partners, to the Knowledge of the  Company) no failure of any Employee Plan which is a group health plan (as  defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code) to meet the requirements of Code  Section 4980B(f) with respect to a qualified beneficiary (as defined in Section  4980B(g)), other than a failure that would not, individually or in the  aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the  Company. 

   

 (e)   Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Memorandum or as set forth in this  Agreement, no director, employee or former employee of the Company or any  Subsidiary thereof or, to the Knowledge of the Company, TNI Partners will become  entitled to any material bonus, retirement, severance, retention, change in  control or similar benefit (including acceleration of vesting or exercise of an  incentive award) as a result of the Transactions, and there is no contract,  plan, program or arrangement covering any employee or former employee of the  Company or any Subsidiary thereof or, to the Knowledge of the Company, TNI  Partners that, individually or collectively, would reasonably be expected to  give rise to a payment that would not be deductible by Parent, the Company or  any Subsidiary thereof or TNI Partners by reason of Section 280G of

Each of Parent and Purchaser is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed (individually or in the aggregate) would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Purchaser was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions and since the date of its formation has engaged in no activities other than in connection with or as contemplated by this Agreement or in connection with arranging any financing required to consummate the Transactions. 

   

 SECTION 5.02 _Corporate Authorization_. Parent and Purchaser have all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions.

This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and Purchaser and (assuming that this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company) constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each such party, enforceable against each such party in accordance with its terms, except that such enforceability (i) may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditorsÂ’ rights generally and (ii) is subject to general principles of equity.

authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings the failure of which
to be obtained or made would not, individually or in the aggregate,

Purchaser.

     

 SECTION 5.04 _Non-contravention_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Purchaser do not and performance by Parent and Purchaser of this Agreement and the consummation by Parent and Purchaser of the Transactions will not (a) contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of any provision of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of Parent or Purchaser, (b) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 5.03, contravene, conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any provision of any applicable law, regulation, judgment, injunction, order or decree or (c) require any consent or other action by any Person under, constitute a default under, or cause or permit the termination, cancellation, acceleration or other change of any right or obligation or the loss of any benefit to which Parent or Purchaser is entitled under any provision of any agreement or other instrument binding upon Parent or Purchaser, except, in the case of clauses (b) and (c), for such matters as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or Purchaser or materially impair the ability of Parent or Purchaser to consummate the Transactions on the terms and conditions provided for herein. 

   

 SECTION 5.05 _Litigation_. There is no suit, action or proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent or Purchaser, threatened in writing against or affecting the Parent, any Subsidiary of Parent or Purchaser that would reasonably be expected to prevent or substantially delay any of the Transactions or otherwise materially impair the ability of the Parent or Purchaser to consummate the Transactions on the terms and conditions provided for herein, nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against the Parent or Purchaser or any other Subsidiary of Parent having, or which, insofar as reasonably can be foreseen, in the future would have, any such effect. 

   

 SECTION 5.06 _Financial Capability_. Parent has, and shall cause Purchaser to have, sufficient funds to consummate the Transactions, including payment in full for all shares of Company Common Stock (on a fully-diluted basis) outstanding at the Effective Time and to pay all fees and expenses related to the Transactions.

flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 26, 2004, in
conformity with GAAP and which shall not reflect any material adverse
change from the December Financial Statements. Said audited consolidated
financial statements shall be accompanied by the opinion of Deloitte and Touche
LLP, the CompanyÂ’s independent public accountants, or such other independent
public accountants of national standing acceptable to Parent, if Deloitte and
Touche LLP has resigned or been dismissed prior to the completion thereof,
that the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Company at December 26, 2004 and
December 28, 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 26, 2004, in
conformity with GAAP. Any investigation pursuant to this Section shall be
conducted upon two Business DaysÂ’ prior written notice to the Company, during
regular business hours and in such a manner so as not to interfere
unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries. No investigation conducted pursuant to this Section shall
affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made in this
Agreement. Except as required by law, Parent will hold, and will cause its
officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors
and agents to hold, in confidence all documents and information concerning
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries furnished to Parent or its Affiliates
in connection with the Transactions in accordance with the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement.

   

 SECTION 6.05 _No Solicitation; Other Offers_. (a) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article 8, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not, nor shall they permit any of their Affiliates to, nor shall they authorize any of the officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, consultants and other agents and Affiliates of the Company and its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, encourage, induce or knowingly facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) the submission of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries with respect thereto, (ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person concerning an Acquisition Proposal or knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make an Acquisition Proposal or accept an Acquisition Proposal or (iii) disclose any nonpublic information relating to the Company or any 

    

of its Subsidiaries to any Person who, to the Knowledge of the Company, is
making or considering making, or who has made, an Acquisition Proposal. The
Company will notify Parent as promptly as practicable (but in no event later
than 24 hours) after receipt by the Company of any Acquisition Proposal or
any request for nonpublic information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by any Person who, to the Knowledge of the Company, is making or
considering making or who has made, an Acquisition Proposal. The Company
shall provide such notice orally and in writing and shall identify the Person
making, and the terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal or
request. The Company shall keep Parent informed of the status and details
(including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal
or request. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the
directors, employees and other agents of the Company and its Subsidiaries to,
cease immediately and cause to be terminated all activities, discussions and
negotiations, if any, with any Persons conducted prior to the date hereof
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and, to the extent within its power,
to recover or cause to be destroyed all information concerning the Company
and its Subsidiaries in the possession of such Persons and their
Affiliates, representatives and advisors.

   

 (b)   Notwithstanding the first sentence of Section 6.05(a), the Company may, until  the Company Stockholder Meeting (the " _Cutoff Date_ "), negotiate  or otherwise engage in substantive discussions with, and furnish nonpublic  information to, any Person in response to an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal by  such Person if (i) the Company has complied with the terms of this Section 6.05,  (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith that such  Acquisition Proposal could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior  Proposal and, after consultation with and receipt of advice from outside legal  counsel, that the failure to take such action could reasonably be deemed to  constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable law, and (iii) such  Person executes a confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to the  Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (including the  standstill provisions unless the Company shall have amended the Confidentiality  Agreement to modify the standstill provisions therein to be no more restrictive  of Parent than such Person is restricted pursuant to such confidentiality  agreement). The Company shall provide Parent any information regarding the  Company or its Subsidiaries provided to any Person making an Acquisition  Proposal which was not previously provided to Parent. Nothing contained in this  Agreement shall prevent the Company or its Board of Directors from complying  with Rule 14d-9, Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A and Rule 14e-2 under the  Exchange Act with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or making any disclosure  to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders required by applicable law or regulation. 

   

 (c)   Except as permitted in this Section 6.05(c), neither the Board of Directors of  the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or publicly  propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, or take any action  not explicitly permitted by this Agreement that would be inconsistent with its  approval of this Agreement and the Merger or with the recommendation to  stockholders referred to in Section 2.08 hereof, (ii) approve or recommend, or  publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or (iii)  cause the Company to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle,  acquisition agreement or similar agreement related to any Acquisition Proposal.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Cutoff Date, the Board of Directors  of the Company shall be permitted not to recommend to its stockholders approval  and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger, or to 

     

withdraw, or modify in a  manner adverse to Parent, its recommendation to its
stockholders referred to in  Section 2.08 hereof (each, an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "),  but only if (i) the Company has complied with the
terms of this Section  6.05, (ii) the Company has received an unsolicited
Acquisition Proposal which  the Board of Directors determines in good faith
constitutes a Superior Proposal,  (iii) the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after  consultation with and receipt of advice from
outside legal counsel, that the  failure to take such action could reasonably
be deemed to be inconsistent with  its fiduciary duties under applicable law,
(iv) the Company shall have delivered  to Parent a prior written notice
advising Parent that it intends to take such  action, together with a full
and complete copy of the Superior Proposal at least  three Business Days
prior to the Adverse Recommendation Change (it being  understood and agreed
that any amendment to the financial terms or any other  material terms of
such Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and a new  three-Business
Day period), (v) the Company shall have negotiated in good faith  with Parent
during such three-Business Day period to make such amendments to the  terms
and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Board of Directors of 
the Company to proceed with its recommendation of this Agreement (as so
amended)  and the Merger and not make the Adverse Recommendation Change, and
(vi) prior to  the expiration of such three-Business Day period, Parent fails
to make a  proposal to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement that
the Board of  Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after
consultation with its  financial advisors) to be at least as favorable as the
Superior Proposal.

   

 (d)   During the period from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or  earlier termination of this Agreement, the Company shall not terminate, amend,  modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement  relating to an Acquisition Proposal to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a  party (other than any involving Parent or its Subsidiaries). During such period,  the Company agrees to enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable  law, the provisions of any such agreement, including obtaining injunctions to  prevent any breaches of such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms  and provisions thereof in any court of the United States or any state thereof  having jurisdiction. 

   

 SECTION 6.06 _Best Efforts; Notification_. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use its best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other Transactions, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid an action or proceeding by any Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, including, without limitation, seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and its Board of Directors shall, if any state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the 

     

Merger, this Agreement or the other Transactions, use their best efforts to
ensure that the Merger and the other Transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms set forth in this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger
and the other Transactions. Nothing herein shall limit or affect the
CompanyÂ’s taking actions specifically permitted by Section 6.05.

    

 (b)   In furtherance of and without limiting the above provisions, each of the Company  and Parent shall, as promptly as practicable following the execution and  delivery of this Agreement (but in no event more than the tenth Business Day  thereafter), file with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the  " _FTC_ ") and the United States Department of Justice (the  " _DOJ_ ") the notification and report form required for the  Transactions and any supplemental information requested in connection therewith  pursuant to the HSR Act. Any such notification and report form and supplemental  information shall be in substantial compliance with the requirements of the HSR  Act. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish to the other such necessary  information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection  with its preparation of any filing or submission which is necessary under the  HSR Act. The Company and Parent shall keep each other apprised of the status of  any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional  information from, the FTC or the DOJ, and shall comply promptly with any such  inquiry or request. Parent shall take any and all steps necessary to avoid or  eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade  regulation law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to  the Merger so as to enable the closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible,  including, without limitation, proposing, negotiating, committing to and  effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale,  divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses of Parent or any of its  Subsidiaries as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the  dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in  any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing,  delaying or restricting the consummation of the Transactions. 

   

 (c)   Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in furtherance and not in  limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in Sections 6.06(a) and  6.06(b), if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including any  proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)  challenging any of the Transactions as violative of any antitrust, competition  or trade regulation law, each of the parties shall cooperate in all respects  with each other and shall use its respective best efforts in order to contest  and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed  or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether  temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prevents, delays  or restricts consummation of the Transactions. 

   

 (d)   Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in furtherance and not in  limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in Section 6.06(a), if any  objections are asserted with respect to the Transactions under any applicable  law (other than any antitrust, competition or trade regulation law) or if any  suit is instituted by any Governmental Entity or any private party challenging  any of the Transactions as violative of any applicable law (other than any  antitrust, competition or trade regulation law), each of the Company and Parent  shall use its best efforts to resolve any such objections or challenges such  Governmental Entity or private party may have to such Transactions so as to  permit consummation of the Transactions. 

        

 (e)   The existence of the conditions set forth in Article 7 shall not limit or  diminish ParentÂ’s or PurchaserÂ’s obligations pursuant to this Section  6.06 or relieve Parent or Purchaser of any liability or damages that may result  from the breach of its obligations under this Section 6.06. 

   

 SECTION 6.07 _Indemnification, Advancement and Insurance_. (a) After the Effective Time, the Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Corporate Agent against all losses, costs, liabilities, expenses (including attorneyÂ’s and expertÂ’s fees and expenses), claims, fines, penalties or damages in connection with any civil, criminal or arbitrative suit, action, proceeding or investigation based in whole or in part on his or her being or having been such a Corporate Agent prior to and including the Effective Time (including but not limited to the Transactions). This obligation shall include the obligation to pay expenses (including attorneyÂ’s and expertÂ’s fees and expenses) incurred by a Corporate Agent in defending any such suit, action, proceeding or investigation in advance of the final disposition thereof, including appeals. 

   

 (i)   " _Corporate Agent_ " shall mean any person who is or was at any  time prior to and including the Effective Time a director, officer, employee or  agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any person who is or was at  any time prior to and including the Effective Time a director, officer, trustee,  employee or agent of any Other Enterprise, serving as such at the request of the  Company, or the heirs, executors and administrators of any such director,  officer, trustee, employee or agent. 

   

 (ii)   " _Indemnified Party_ " shall mean individually, and  " _Indemnified Parties_ " shall mean collectively, the person or  persons entitled to be indemnified, defended and held harmless under this  Section 6.07 or the heirs, executors and administrators of such person or  persons. 

   

 (iii)   " _Other Enterprise_ " shall mean any domestic or foreign  corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, sole  proprietorship, trust, or other enterprise or entity (including any employee  benefit plan), whether or not for profit, served by a Corporate Agent (other  than the Company). 

   

 (b)   Parent shall cause the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving  Corporation and its Subsidiaries to include provisions for the limitation of  liability of directors and indemnification of the Indemnified Parties to the  fullest extent permitted under Delaware law and shall not permit the amendment  of such provisions in any manner adverse to the Indemnified Parties without the  prior written consent of the Indemnified Parties. 

   

 (c)   Parent shall pay all expenses, including attorneyÂ’s and expertÂ’s fees  and expenses, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the  indemnity and other obligations provided for in this Section 6.07 or in any  action involving an Indemnified Party resulting from the Transactions. 

      

 (d)   For six years after the Effective Time (and thereafter until the final  disposition, including appeals, of any claim that has been asserted or any suit,  action, proceeding or investigation that has been commenced within such six-year  period), Parent shall maintain, or 

     

cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain,  policies of directorsÂ’ and
officersÂ’ liability insurance comparable to  those currently maintained by
the Company for the benefit of directors and  officers of the Company in
effect on the date of this Agreement (true and  complete copies of which have
been provided to Parent) with respect to matters  occurring prior to and
including the Effective Time (except to the extent any  provisions in such
insurance are no longer generally available in the market);  provided, that
in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend  in any one
year an amount in excess of 300% of the aggregate annual premiums  paid by
the Company (or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable) during the 
immediately preceding year for such insurance (the Company represents that
the  annual premiums currently aggregate approximately $500,000); and
provided,  further, that if the aggregate annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed  such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to
obtain a policy or  policies with the greatest coverage available for an
aggregate cost not  exceeding such amount.

    

 (e)   In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their successors or  assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be  the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or  merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets  to any Person, then and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so  that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the  case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.07. In the  event that the Surviving Corporation transfers any material portion of its  assets, in a single transaction or in a series of transactions, Parent will  either guarantee the indemnification obligations referred to in Section 6.07(a)  or take such other action to ensure that the ability of the Surviving  Corporation to satisfy such indemnification obligations will not be diminished. 

   

 (f)   This Section 6.07 shall survive the consummation of the Merger, is intended to  benefit the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and each Indemnified  Party, and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent and the  Surviving Corporation. 

   

 SECTION 6.08 _Employee Benefits_. (a) After the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each Subsidiary thereof to abide by the terms of each collective bargaining agreement to which it is a party. In addition, after the Effective Time through at least September 30, 2006, Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to the individuals who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, are non-bargaining unit employees of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof (" _Company Employees_ ") (i) base pay and commission opportunities which, as to each such individual, are the same as or greater than those provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) except as provided in Sections 6.08(d), (e) and (f), welfare, pension and other employee benefits and incentive opportunities that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided as of the date hereof by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such individuals under the Employee Plans. At the Effective Time, the Company shall pay or cause the payment of bonuses accrued during the period from December 27, 2004 until the Effective Time in accordance with the bonus targets and Company performance through the end of such period. For the period from the Effective Time through September 30, 2005, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to establish a bonus arrangement consistent with the bonus arrangement provided by Parent and its Affiliates to similarly situated employees, taking into account the fact that the bonus period will be less than twelve months. From and after October 1, 2005, the Surviving Corporation shall provide 

     

such bonus opportunities as it deems appropriate. Nothing contained in this
subsection shall preclude the Parent or the Surviving Corporation or
its Subsidiaries at any time following the Effective Time from terminating
the employment of any Company Employee.

     

 (b)   Each Company Employee shall be given full credit for all service with the  Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors to the extent  recognized by the Company and its Subsidiaries at December 26, 2004 under any  plans or arrangements providing vacation, sick pay, severance, retirement,  pension or retiree welfare benefits maintained by Parent or the Surviving  Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates in which such Company  Employees participate for all purposes (including, without limitation, for  purposes of eligibility, vesting, benefit accrual and forms of benefit), except  to the extent that such credit would result in any duplication of benefits. 

   

 (c)   In the event of any change in the welfare benefits provided to Company Employees  following the Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving  Corporation to (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions,  exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage  requirements applicable to the Company Employees under any such welfare benefits  to the extent that such conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would not  apply in the absence of such change and (ii) credit each Company Employee with  any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to any such change in satisfying any  applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements after such change. 

   

 (d)   Without limiting any of its other obligations hereunder, Parent shall cause all  of the individual agreements and other Company plans and arrangements listed in  Items 1, 2, 4, 5 and 20 under Section 4.11 of the Company Disclosure Memorandum  to be honored in accordance with their terms if and to the extent such  agreements, plans and arrangements have been or are made effective, and shall  assume the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries thereunder without  offset. 

   

 (e)   From the Effective Time until September 30, 2007, Parent and the Surviving  Corporation shall provide or shall cause their Affiliates to provide  post-retirement group health coverage to Eligible Company Retirees on terms and  conditions that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than the terms and  conditions of the retiree group health coverage currently provided by the  Company to or for the benefit of retired Eligible Company Retirees. Thereafter,  until December 31, 2008, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall continue to  offer retiree group health coverage to Eligible Company Retirees. Such coverage  shall be on such terms and conditions relating to benefits and cost-sharing as  from time to time are determined by the Board of Directors of Parent and/or the  Surviving Corporation. As used herein, the term " _Eligible Company  Retirees_ " means (i) former non-bargaining unit employees of the Company  or any Subsidiary thereof (and their covered spouses and dependents) who, as of  the Effective Time, are covered or entitled to coverage under the CompanyÂ’s  post-retirement group health plan, (ii) active Company Employees whose  employment terminates after the Effective Time and who, as of the Effective  Time, have satisfied the minimum age and service conditions for Company provided  post-retirement group health coverage, and (iii) active Company Employees listed  in Section 6.08(e) of the Company Disclosure Memorandum whose employment is  terminated either (A) after satisfying the age and service conditions, or (B)  before satisfying those conditions under circumstances entitling them to receive  one or more severance payments, 

     

whether by individual agreement or applicable  severance policy. The
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under  this Section
6.08(e) will also extend to the covered spouses and dependents of  the
present and former Company Employees who are or become Eligible Company 
Retirees.

    

 (f)   If, as of or within May 31, 2006, Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation  or any of its or their Affiliates causes the involuntary termination (other than  termination for "cause") of a Company EmployeeÂ’s employment with  the Surviving Corporation, the Company and/or its Subsidiaries, then the  terminated Company Employee will be entitled to receive severance payments in  accordance with the CompanyÂ’s severance grid set forth in Section 6.08(f)  of the Company Disclosure Memorandum if such grid would have applied to such  Company Employee if he or she had been severed by the Company before the  Effective Time, or, if not, to no less than two weeksÂ’ base pay for each  year of service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and their  respective predecessors), prorated for the year in which termination of  employment occurs, limited, however, to 50 weeksÂ’ base pay, and subject to  a minimum of four weeksÂ’ base pay. The severance protection described in  this Section 6.08(f) shall not apply to Company Employees whose severance  entitlement is governed by the terms of an employment agreement, transition  agreement, participation agreement or other individual agreement providing  severance protection outside of the CompanyÂ’s general severance policy.  Outplacement services described in Section 6.08(f) of the Company Disclosure  Memorandum will also be made available. Any Company Employee whose employment is  terminated within one year following the Effective Time and who is entitled to  severance payments will be credited with not less than one year of  post-Effective Time service for purposes of vesting under any Employee Plan in  which such terminated Company Employee then participates, except to the extent  that such credit would result in any duplication of benefits. 

   

 (g)   Prior to and effective as of the Effective Time, the Company will amend the  Pulitzer Inc. Supplemental Executive Benefit Pension Plan (the  " _SERP_ ") in the following respects: (i) future benefit accruals  will be suspended, (ii) each participantÂ’s accrued benefit will be  converted into a bookkeeping account balance in the amounts set forth in Section  6.08(g) of the Company Disclosure Memorandum (the " _SERP  Schedule_ "), (iii) each participantÂ’s account balance will be  credited with interest at the annual rate of 5.75%, and (iv) each participant  will be entitled to receive payments which will be deducted from his or her  account balance at the time(s) and in the amount(s) set forth in the SERP  Schedule. Parent will make or cause the Surviving Corporation to make the  payments set forth in the SERP Schedule, which payments, when completed, will be  in full and final satisfaction of the participantsÂ’ interest in the SERP.  The CompanyÂ’s SERP amendments will include a provision for full payment of  the participantsÂ’ account balances upon a change in control (defined  substantially as set forth in Section 6.08(g) of the Company Disclosure  Memorandum) of the Parent or the Surviving Corporation, and such other  provisions as may be reasonably necessary in order to satisfy the applicable  requirements of Section 409A of the Code. As of and prior to the Effective Time,  the Company shall satisfy in full the remaining future payment obligations of  the Company under the executive employment and consulting agreement listed in  Item 2 of Section 4.14 of the Company Disclosure Memorandum. Prior to the  Effective Time, the Company shall terminate the CompanyÂ’s 1999 Employee  Stock Purchase Plan and the CompanyÂ’s 2000 Stock Purchase Plan (and any  other such plan listed in Section 4.11(6) of the Company Disclosure Memorandum  (collectively, the " _Company Stock Plans_ ")), and no shares shall  be issued under the Company Stock Plans after 

      

such date. The Company agrees  that, during the period beginning on the date
hereof and ending prior to the  Effective Time, except as described under
Section 4.02(a) with respect to shares  issuable under outstanding Company
Stock Options or Company RSUs, and shares  purchasable under any employee
stock purchase plan, the Company shall not issue  shares of Common Stock in
the aggregate that exceed the average number of  shares, determined on a
quarterly basis, issued under the Company Stock Plans  for the last two
fiscal quarters prior to the date hereof (which amounts and the  price at
which such shares may be purchased under the terms thereof are listed  in
Section 4.11(6) of the Company Disclosure Memorandum). Prior to the
Effective  Time, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
terminate (as  of or immediately prior to the Effective Time) the CompanyÂ’s
interest in  and obligations under the split dollar life insurance agreements
and policies  listed in Section 4.11 of the Company Disclosure Memorandum
maintained for five  covered current and former executives, at a cost to the
Company not to exceed  the then current cash values of the policies plus the
amounts of the premium  payments that were withheld since July 30, 2002, or
such greater amounts as the  Company deems necessary in order to accomplish
the foregoing. Any split dollar  arrangement which is not so terminated will
be assumed and honored by the  Surviving Corporation in accordance with its
terms.

   

 SECTION 6.09 _Public Announcements_. Each of Parent and the Company will obtain the otherÂ’s prior written consent before issuing any press release or making any public statement (including any broadly issued statement or announcement to employees) with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions and, except as may be required by applicable law or any listing agreement with any national securities exchange, will not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to obtaining such consent. 

   

 SECTION 6.10 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Purchaser, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Purchaser, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger. 

   

 SECTION 6.11 _Notices of Certain Events_. Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other of: 

   

 (a)   any representation or warranty made by it in this Agreement that is qualified as  to materiality becoming untrue or inaccurate in any respect or any such  representation or warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue or  inaccurate so as to have a Material Adverse Effect; 

   

 (b)   the failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any  covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under  this Agreement; 

   

 (c)   any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of  such Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions; 

       

 (d)   any notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity in connection  with the Transactions; or 

   

 (e)   any actions, suits, claims, investigations, orders, decrees, complaints or  proceedings commenced or, to its Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or  involving or otherwise affecting the Company, Parent or any of their respective  Subsidiaries that relate to the consummation of the Transactions; 

   

provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section
6.11 (i) shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder
to the party receiving such notice and (ii) shall not be deemed an admission
on the part of the party giving such notice that the occurrence of any such
event constitutes or would reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

   

 SECTION 6.12 _Certain Operational Matters_. (a) For a period of at least five years following the Effective Time, Parent will cause the _St. Louis Post-Dispatch_ to maintain its current name and editorial page platform statement and to maintain its news and editorial headquarters in the City of St. Louis, Missouri. In addition, if the current editor of the  _St. Louis Post-Dispatch_ is replaced within five years following the Effective Time, whether by reason of her resignation or removal or for any other reason, Parent will not appoint or allow to be appointed a new editor of the _St. Louis Post-Dispatch_  without the prior consultation with the Company Designee.
