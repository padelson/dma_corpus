Honeywell and the Closing Statement shall be final, binding and conclusive for
all purposes of this Agreement and not subject to any further recourse by
Honeywell or the Sellers under any provision hereof. In the event that

by applicable Law to be deducted or withheld from such payment and (b) any

withheld, it shall promptly provide notice to the other parties.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any amount is deducted or withheld from any
payment made pursuant to this Agreement and Sellers received less than five (5)

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser&#146;s Savings Plan shall not be

The Employee Transferors shall retain all assets and liabilities related to
Sellers&#146; U.S. Pension Plan, and Purchaser shall have no obligation to replicate
the benefits of Sellers&#146; U.S. Pension Plan, except as follows. Prior to or as
soon as administratively practicable following, but in any event effective as

establish a plan that qualifies under Code Section&nbsp;401(a) and a trust that
qualifies under Code Section&nbsp;501(a) (<B>&#147;Purchaser&#146;s U.S. Pension Plan&#148;</B>) for the

conditions of employment are governed by the collective bargaining agreements
pertaining to production and maintenance workers at Sellers&#146; Fostoria, Ohio and
Greenville, Ohio facilities (&#147;<B>Union Pension Participants</B>&#148;), the

Purchaser shall have previously identified. Purchaser&#146;s U.S. Pension Plan shall
be identical in all relevant respects to the terms of Sellers&#146; U.S. Pension
Plan applicable to the Union Pension Participants and on its establishment
shall have and assume all liabilities of Sellers&#146; U.S. Pension Plan in respect
of the Union Pension Participants and their dependents and beneficiaries.
Simultaneously with the establishment of Purchaser&#146;s U.S. Pension Plan,
Honeywell shall cause the trust forming a part of Sellers&#146; U.S. Pension Plan to
transfer to the trust forming a part of Purchaser&#146;s U.S. Pension Plan an amount
of assets in cash, cash equivalents or other assets of the trust to which
Purchaser has no reasonable objection, determined in accordance with the

the case of a Straddle Period Tax Return for any Transferred Entity organized in

Management group promptly of any potential claim, shall cooperate in the

Insurance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Honeywell nor any Seller

Insurance will be received with respect to any particular incident arising

The Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend against, negotiate, settle
or otherwise deal with any Third-Party Claim which relates to any Losses
indemnifiable hereunder and to select counsel of its choice. If the
Indemnifying Party (i) does not within 20 business days of its receipt of
notice of a Third-Party Claim pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;9.3(a)</U> elect to
defend against or negotiate any Third-Party Claim which relates to any Losses
indemnifiable hereunder or (ii) after assuming such control fails to diligently
defend against such Third-Party Claim in good faith, then the applicable
Indemnified Party may defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with
such Third-Party Claim with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying
Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third-Party Claim,
the applicable Indemnified Party may participate, at its own expense, in the
defense of such Third-Party Claim; provided that if there exists or is
reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest that would make it
inappropriate in the judgment of the Indemnified Party in its reasonable
discretion for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain one
counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party at the expense of the

reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. Similarly, if the Indemnified
Party is defending or prosecuting such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying

in the defense or prosecution thereof and make available to the Indemnified

Third-Party Claim, no such Third Party-Claim may be settled, compromised or
discharged by the Indemnifying Party without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), unless
any such settlement, compromise or discharge (i) obligates the Indemnifying
Party (or its Affiliates) to pay the full amount of the Loss in connection with
such Third-Party Claim, (ii) imposes no injunctive or other equitable relief
against any Indemnified Party, and (iii)&nbsp;unconditionally releases all
Indemnified Parties from all further liability in respect of such Third-Party Claim.
If the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume the defense of a Third-Party
Claim or is not permitted to assume such defense, the applicable Indemnified
Parties shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or
discharge, such Third-Party Claim without the Indemnifying Party&#146;s prior

the <U>Section 10.10(b)</U> relating to the waiver of jury trial shall apply to
any such action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim.</FONT></P>

10.13. <B>Delayed
Closing</B>. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in <U>Section 6.4 </U>or <U>Section 7.4</U>, if the conditions set forth in <U>Section
6.4</U> and <U>Section 7.4</U> have been satisfied in all respects but for the
receipt of the approvals set forth on <U>Schedule 10.13</U> (the &#147;<B>Foreign
Approval</B>s&#148;) with respect to the Purchased Assets set forth on such
Schedule (such Purchased Assets, the &#147;<B>Delayed Transfer Assets</B>&#148;), the conditions
set forth in <U>Section 6.4</U> and <U>Section 7.4</U> shall be deemed
satisfied for all purposes under this Agreement; <U>provided</U> that (i) the
Purchase Price payable by Purchaser at the Closing shall be reduced by the
applicable amount for such Delayed Transfer Assets set forth on <U>Schedule
10.13</U>, (ii) such Delayed Transfer Assets shall not be sold, conveyed,
transferred or assigned to Purchaser at the Closing and instead shall be
treated as Retained Interests until the third business day following the
receipt of the applicable Foreign Approval for such Delayed Transfer Assets
(each such date, a &#147;<B>Delayed Closing Date</B>&#148;) and (iii) on the
applicable Delayed Closing Date, Purchaser will pay to Sellers the applicable
amount for such Delayed Transfer Assets set forth on <U>Schedule 10.13</U> and
the Sellers will sell, convey, transfer or assign to Purchaser the applicable
Delayed Transfer Assets, and Purchaser shall assume the Assumed Liabilities
associated with and related to the applicable Delayed Transfer Assets. For
avoidance of doubt, from and after the Closing Date and until the applicable
Delayed Closing Date, Sellers may own and operate the applicable Delayed
Transfer Assets in the ordinary course of business, consistent with past
practice and consistent with the provisions of Section 5.1 as though operation
of such Delayed Transfer Assets constituted operation of Purchased Assets prior
to the Closing Date. The Sellers shall operate the applicable Delayed Transfer
Assets for the account of the Purchaser and shall not (absent willful misconduct)
have any liability or obligation in connection with such operations, including
for any decline in revenues or profits. The Sellers will promptly pay to
Purchaser any cash generated by the applicable Deferred Transfer Assets, net of
any expenses of operating the Deferred Transfer Assets. For avoidance of doubt,
any liabilities of the Deferred Transfer Assets (whether arising before, on or
after the Closing and excluding any liabilities of any Transferred Entity) are
included in Assumed Liabilities.</FONT></P>
