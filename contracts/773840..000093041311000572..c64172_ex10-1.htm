The failure of any third party consent or approval to be obtained or the failure of any Interest to constitute a Purchased Asset or any circumstances resulting therefrom shall not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute a Business Material Adverse Effect or a breach by any Seller of any 

   representation, warranty, condition, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement, other than, if breached, _Sections 3.4_ , _5.1_ and _5.5(b)_
; provided that nothing in the foregoing shall limit any rights of
Purchaser under _Section 6.3_ or _Article IX_ in respect of a breach of
such Sections.

 Section 1.7. [Intentionally omitted] 

  

 Section 1.8. Purchase Price Adjustment.

  

 (a)  _Closing of the Books on the Closing Date_. In preparation for the Closing, Honeywell shall cause a full balance sheet closing of the books of the Business to take place on the Closing Date as if it were the last day of a fiscal period for the Business. 

  

 (b)  _Pre-Closing Adjustment_. At least five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Honeywell shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser a statement (the "Estimated Closing Statement") consisting of an estimated calculation in reasonable detail (including all constituent elements) of the Net Cash Adjustment (the "Estimated Net Cash Adjustment"). Purchaser shall have the right to object in good faith to the amounts contained in the Estimated Closing Statement within two Business Days after the delivery of the Estimated Closing Statement to Purchaser. Honeywell shall in good faith consider the objections, if any, of Purchaser to the Estimated Closing Statement and, if Honeywell determines, in its reasonable discretion, that changes to the Estimated Closing Statement are appropriate, Honeywell shall re-issue an Estimated Closing Statement containing the Estimated Net Cash Adjustment no later than one Business Day prior to the Closing Date. 

  

 (c)  _Closing Statement_. Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall deliver to Honeywell:

 (ii) a statement (the "Closing Statement"), which shall be delivered at the same time as the Closing Date Audited Statements and shall set forth the Purchase Price, including the amount of the Net Cash Adjustment, determined in accordance with the definitions set forth herein and based upon the Closing Date Audited Statements and the Applicable Accounting Principles. The Closing Date Audited Statements and the Closing Statement shall each be prepared in accordance with the Applicable Accounting Principles, and shall be

   accompanied by reasonable supporting documentation regarding Purchasers
calculation of the Net Cash Adjustment.

  

 (iii) Purchaser shall bear all costs of preparing and delivering the Closing Date Audited Statements. Purchaser and Honeywell shall each bear fifty percent (50%) of the cost of Pricewaterhouse Coopers review of the Closing Statement to confirm its compliance with the Applicable Accounting Principles. 

  

 (d)  _Closing Statement Dispute Notice_. Each of Purchaser and Honeywell shall give the other party and any independent auditors and authorized representatives of such other party reasonable access during normal business hours to the properties, books, records and personnel relating to the Business for purposes of preparing and reviewing the Closing Date Audited Statement and the Closing Statement and resolving any disputes relating thereto. Honeywell shall have forty-five (45) days following the delivery by Purchaser of the Closing Date Audited Statements and the Closing Statement during which to notify Purchaser in writing of any dispute of any item contained in the Closing Statement (a "Disputed Item"), which notice (the "Closing Statement Dispute Notice") shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such dispute and provide reasonable supporting documentation, if available, for such disagreement. If Honeywell fails to notify Purchaser of any such dispute within such 45-day period, the Closing Statement shall be deemed to be accepted by Honeywell and the Closing Statement shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes of this Agreement and not subject to any further recourse by Honeywell or the Sellers under any provision hereof. In the event that Honeywell shall so notify Purchaser of any dispute, Purchaser and Honeywell shall cooperate in good faith and use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute as promptly as possible. For the avoidance of doubt, it is expressly agreed that no objection may be raised and no adjustment may be proposed to any entry or item contained in the Closing Statement except on grounds that such item or entry has not been calculated in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the definition of Closing Date Adjusted Purchase Price, including the Net Cash Adjustment, determined in accordance with the definitions set forth herein. 

  

 (e)  _Independent Accountant_. If Purchaser and Honeywell are unable to resolve all Disputed Items during the 45-day resolution period, then, at the request of either party, Purchaser and Honeywell shall jointly engage and submit the unresolved Disputed Items (the "Unresolved Items") to the Independent Accountant; _provided_ that if the Independent Accountant does not accept such engagement within ten (10) days after either Purchaser or Honeywell gives notice to the other of such request, either of them may request the American Arbitration Association to appoint a substitute Independent Accountant and such appointment shall be final, binding and conclusive on Purchaser and Honeywell. Purchaser and Honeywell shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Independent Accountant to issue its written determination regarding the Unresolved Items within thirty (30) days after such items are submitted for review. The Independent Accountant shall make a determination with respect to the Unresolved Items only and in a manner consistent with this _Section 1.8_ and the Applicable Accounting Principles. Any adjustment with respect to the Unresolved Items may only be made by the Independent Accountant within the range between Purchasers calculation and Honeywells calculation of the Unresolved Items. Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to the Independent Accountant such work papers and other documents and information pertaining to the Unresolved Items as the Independent Accountant may request. The

   determination of the Independent Accountant and all elements in the Closing
Statement as finalized in such determination, shall be final, binding and
conclusive on Purchaser and Honeywell absent manifest error. The
fees, expenses and costs of the American Arbitration Association and the
Independent Accountant shall be borne in the same proportion as the aggregate
amount of the Unresolved Items that is unsuccessfully disputed by each (as
determined by the Independent Accountant) bears to the total amount of the
Unresolved Items submitted to the Independent Accountant.

  

 (f)  _Final Adjustment_. If the Net Cash Adjustment in the final Closing Statement exceeds the Estimated Net Cash Adjustment, then Honeywell shall be entitled to a payment from Purchaser equal to such excess. If the Estimated Net Cash Adjustment exceeds the Net Cash Adjustment in the final Closing Statement, then Purchaser shall be entitled to a payment from Honeywell equal to such excess. Payments shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds within two Business Days of a party becoming entitled to a payment under this  _Section 1.8_. To the extent any amount of the Net Cash Adjustment is undisputed, payment will be made with respect to such undisputed amount as appropriate within five Business Days of delivery of the Closing Statement or Dispute Notice, as applicable. 

  

 (g)  _Method of Payment, Interest, etc_. Any amount paid pursuant to _Section 1.8_ shall be (i) increased by simple interest on such amount at an annual interest rate equal to 5%, from the Closing Date to and including the date of payment based on a 365 day year, (ii) made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the receiving party and (iii) treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax reporting purposes.

  

 Section 1.9. Withholding. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, and for the avoidance of doubt, (a) each payment made pursuant to this Agreement shall be made net of any Taxes required by applicable Law to be deducted or withheld from such payment and (b) any amounts deducted or withheld from any such payment shall be remitted to the applicable Taxing Authority and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid. The party making any such deduction or withholding shall furnish to the other party official receipts (or copies thereof) evidencing the payment of any such Taxes. If either Purchaser or any of the Sellers becomes aware that any amount is required to be so deducted or withheld, it shall promptly provide notice to the other parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any amount is deducted or withheld from any payment made pursuant to this Agreement and Sellers received less than five (5) days notice prior to the making of such deduction or withholding, then, to the extent permitted by Law, any such deduction or withholding shall not be remitted to the applicable Taxing Authority earlier then the date that is five (5) days after Sellers received notice of such deduction or withholding and Sellers shall be entitled to raise any objection with respect to such deduction or withholding during such period.

 Section 3.1. Due Organization. Each of the Sellers and the Transferred Entities is a legal entity of the type described in _Section 3.1_ of the Disclosure Schedule, duly organized, validly existing and, with respect to entities organized within the United States and any other jurisdiction outside the United States in which the concept of good standing or its functional equivalent is applicable, in good standing or its functional equivalent under the Laws of the jurisdiction indicated in _Section 3.1_ of the Disclosure Schedule. Sellers and the Transferred Entities (a) have all requisite power and authority under their respective organizational documents to conduct the Business as it is now being conducted, and (b) are duly qualified or otherwise authorized to do business in each of the jurisdictions in which the ownership, operation or leasing of the Purchased Assets or the assets of any Transferred Entity and the conduct of the Business requires such entity to be so qualified or otherwise authorized, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or otherwise authorized or in good standing would not result in material Liability to the Business or materially impair the ability of any Seller to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   Section 3.2. Authority. Each of the Sellers has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its respective obligations under this Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement, the Assignment and Assumption Agreement, the Real Property Lease Assignments, the Deeds and the other documents and agreements contemplated hereby and thereby to which such Seller is a party (collectively, the "Transaction Documents") and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution, delivery and performance by each of the Sellers of the Transaction Documents to which such Seller is a party and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary action on the part of the applicable Seller, and no other corporate or other proceedings on the part of any Seller are necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by each Seller of this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. This Agreement has been, and upon their execution the Transaction Documents shall have been, duly executed and delivered by Sellers, and, assuming due authorization and delivery by Purchaser, this Agreement constitutes, and upon their execution the Transaction Documents shall constitute, a valid and binding obligation of Sellers, enforceable against Sellers in accordance with their respective terms, except (i) as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws now or hereafter in effect relating to or affecting creditors rights generally or by general equitable principles (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (ii) that specific performance may not be available (collectively, the "Enforceability Exceptions").

  

 Section 3.3. Transferred Entities; Title to Equity Interests. The copies (and, where only a translation has been provided, the translation) of the organizational documents of the Transferred Entities, which have been Made Available to Purchaser, are true, accurate and complete (except in the case of the translations, which are true, accurate and complete in all material respects). For each Transferred Entity, _Section 3.3_ of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth (i) the nature of the equity interest held by Sellers or, if applicable, other Transferred Entities, and, if applicable, the par value thereof, (ii) the holder of such equity interests, (iii) the total number of such equity interests that are outstanding, and (iv) the percentage of the outstanding equity interests held by Sellers or other Transferred Entities (each such equity interest held by a Seller or Transferred Entity, an "Equity Interest"). The Equity Interests constitute, and on the Closing Date will constitute, all of the equity of each Transferred Entity held by Sellers or a Transferred Entity. Except as set forth on _Section 3.3_ of the Disclosure Schedule, there are no other equity securities of any Transferred Entity, and there are no securities convertible into or exchangeable for any equity securities of any Transferred Entity. Sellers and the Transferred Entities are not, and prior to the Closing Date will not become, a party to or subject to any contract or obligation wherein any Person has, or will have, a right, option or warrant to purchase or acquire any rights in any additional capital stock or other securities of the Transferred Entities. There are no stockholder agreements, voting trusts or proxies or other agreements or understandings in effect with respect to any securities of any Transferred Entity. All Equity Interests held by Sellers or a Transferred Entity have been duly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable and not subject to any Encumbrances, except for Encumbrances arising in connection with this Agreement and those imposed by Purchaser. None of the issued Equity Interests held by Sellers or a Transferred Entity was issued in violation of any preemptive rights. Each Seller which holds an Equity Interest in a Purchased Entity has good title thereto and full 

   beneficial ownership thereof and upon delivery of such Equity
Interest against payment therefor pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
Purchaser will receive good title thereto, free and clear of all
Encumbrances. There are no Subsidiaries, joint ventures or other Persons
which are material to the Business in which the Transferred Entities own, of
record or beneficially, any direct or indirect equity or other similar
interest or any right (contingent or otherwise) to acquire any direct or
indirect equity or other similar interest.

 Section 3.12. Employee Matters and Benefit Plans.

  

 (a) Each material employment, deferred compensation, stock option, stock purchase, stock appreciation right, equity-based compensation, incentive, bonus, tuition reimbursement, pension, savings, profit-sharing, retirement, medical, vacation, retiree medical, dental, life, disability, death benefit, group insurance, severance pay plan, other material compensatory plan, policy or agreement (including any severance, retention, change in control or similar agreement) or material fringe benefit plan or arrangement (including any "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) that is maintained or sponsored by a Seller or a Transferred Entity and that covers any Employee in the United States Business, other than statutory plans, has been listed on _Section 3.12(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule (each a "U.S. Benefit Plan" and collectively, the "U.S. Benefit Plans"). Sellers have delivered or made available to Purchaser a current, accurate and complete copy (or, to the extent no such copy exists, an accurate written description) of each U.S. Benefit Plan and, to the extent applicable, the Plans most recent IRS determination letter and current summary plan description, if any. Each U.S. Benefit Plan which is intended to qualify under Code Section 401(a) has been determined to be so qualified by the Internal Revenue Service and to the Knowledge of Honeywell nothing has occurred as to each which has resulted or is likely to result in the revocation of such qualification or which requires or could require action under the compliance resolution programs of the Internal Revenue Service to preserve such qualification.

  

 (b) Each material employment, deferred compensation, stock option, stock purchase, stock appreciation right, equity-based compensation, incentive, bonus, tuition reimbursement, pension, savings, profit-sharing, retirement, medical, vacation, retiree medical, dental, life, disability, death benefit, group insurance, severance pay plan, other material compensatory plan, policy or agreement (including any severance, retention, change in control or similar agreement) or material fringe benefit plan or arrangement that is maintained or sponsored by a Seller or a Transferred Entity and that covers any Employee employed in the Non-United States Business, other than statutory plans, has been listed on _Section 3.12(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule (each a "Foreign Benefit Plan" and collectively, the "Foreign Benefit Plans"). Sellers have delivered or made available to Purchaser a current, accurate and complete copy (or, to the extent no such copy exists, an accurate written description) of each Foreign Benefit Plan and, to the extent applicable, the Plans current summary plan description, if any. Each Foreign Benefit Plan (i) if intended to qualify for special tax treatment, meets all requirements for such treatment; (ii) is fully funded and has been fully accrued for on the Financial Statements; and (iii) if required to be registered, has been registered with the appropriate authorities and has been maintained in good standing with the appropriate regulatory authorities.

  

 (c) No Seller or Transferred Entity has announced its intention, or undertaken (whether or not legally bound) to modify or terminate any U.S. Benefit Plan or Foreign Benefit Plan or adopt any arrangement or program which, once established, would come within the definition of a U.S. Benefit Plan or Foreign Benefit Plan. Neither Honeywell nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any Liability which remains outstanding: (i) under Code Section 412 or Title IV of ERISA with respect to any "single employer plan" (as defined in ERISA 

   Section 4001(a)(15), or (ii) under Title IV of ERISA with respect to any
"multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) or Section 4001(a)(3) of
ERISA)).

  

 (d) None of the Transferred Entities nor any ERISA Affiliate of a Transferred Entity maintains or contributes to (A) any "single employer plan" or "multiemployer plan" (each as defined in the preceding paragraph) that is subject to Code Section 412 or Title IV of ERISA, (B) any "multiple employer welfare arrangement" as defined in Section 3(40)(A) of ERISA, (C) any "multiple employer plan" as described in ERISA Section 210, or (D) any "voluntary employees beneficiary association" within the meaning of section 501(c)(9) of the Code or any other "welfare benefit fund" as defined in section 419(e) of the Code. With respect to any U.S. Benefit Plan set forth on _Section 3.12(d)_ of the Disclosure Schedule which is a "single employer plan" (as defined above) subject to Title IV of ERISA, no reportable event within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA, or event or condition which presents a material risk of termination by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, has occurred. 

  

 (e) No Transferred Entity has incurred any Liability to provide health (including medical, dental or vision care) or life insurance benefits or coverage under any U.S. Benefit Plan for any participant or any beneficiary of a participant after such participants termination of employment, except as may be required by Section 4980B of the Code or Section 601 (et seq.) of ERISA ("COBRA") or under any applicable Law or National Laws (such benefits and coverages, "OPEB Benefits"). To the Knowledge of Honeywell, no U.S. Benefit Plan nor any person who is a party in interest in respect of a U.S. Benefit Plan within the meaning of Section 3(14) of ERISA, has engaged in a prohibited transaction which could subject any Transferred Entity directly or indirectly to liability under Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.

  

 (f) Each U.S. Benefit Plan and Foreign Benefit Plan complies and has complied in all material respects with any applicable Law governing such U.S. Benefit Plan or Foreign Benefit Plan (whether as a matter of substantive law or as necessary to secure favorable tax treatment), including ERISA and the Code, and is and has been maintained in all material respects in accordance with its terms and the terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreement to the extent consistent with all such requirements of Law. With respect to each U.S. Benefit Plan and Foreign Benefit Plan for which a separate fund of assets is or is required to be maintained, full and timely payment has been made of all amounts required of the Sellers and the Transferred Entities, under the terms of each such Plan or applicable Law (determined without regard to any waiver of legally applicable funding requirements), as applied through the Closing Date. There are no pending or threatened legal actions, proceedings or investigations, other than routine claims for benefits, concerning any U.S. Benefit Plan or Foreign Benefit Plan or, to the Knowledge of Honeywell, any fiduciary or service provider thereof in respect of such U.S. Benefit Plan or Foreign Benefit Plan, which could be expected to give rise to any Liability on the part of any Transferred Entity. Neither any Seller nor any Transferred Entity has any material liability, nor has taken any action that could give rise to such material liability, under any U.S. Benefit Plan or Foreign Benefit Plan, arising out of the treatment of any service provider as a consultant or independent contractor and not as an employee (or vice versa).

  

 (g) Except as set forth in _Section 3.12(g)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, there are no providers of subcontracted employees to the Business.

   (h) This _Section 3.12_ contains the exclusive representations and warranties of Sellers with respect to the U.S. Benefit Plans and the Foreign Benefit Plans.

a "Material Contract."

  

 (b) (i) each Seller or Transferred Entity is not, in any material respects, in breach of or default under any Material Contract to which such Seller or Transferred Entity is a party, and, to the Knowledge of Honeywell, no other party to any such Contract is in material breach thereof or material default thereunder, (ii) no Seller or Transferred Entity has received any written notice or claim of material default under any Material Contract and (iii) to the Knowledge of Honeywell, no event has occurred that, with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would result in a material breach or material default under any Material Contract by a Seller or a Transferred Entity.

   otherwise at Purchasers expense), _provided_ , _however_ , that certain
materials subject to any confidentiality obligations or attorney client
privilege, or which may not be shared with the other party pursuant to
applicable Law, have not been and will not be so delivered, but Honeywell

 (a) Sellers will use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to Purchaser at the Closing all properties, books, records, Contracts, information and documents in their or their Affiliates possession that are part of the Purchased Assets. As soon as is reasonably practicable after the Closing, Sellers will deliver or cause to be delivered to Purchaser any remaining properties, books, records, Contracts, information and documents that are part of the Purchased Assets that are not already in the possession or control of Purchaser.

  

 (b) Each of the Sellers and Purchaser agrees that it will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, preserve and keep the books of accounts, financial and other records held by it relating to the Business (including accountants work papers) for a period of seven (7) years from the Closing Date in accordance with their respective corporate records retention policies; _provided_  that prior to disposing of any such records in accordance with such policies (if such records would be disposed of prior to the tenth anniversary of the Closing Date), the applicable party shall provide written notice to the other party of its intent to dispose of such records and shall provide such other party the opportunity to take ownership and possession of such records (at such other partys sole expense) to the extent they relate to such other partys business or obligations within thirty (30) days after such notice is delivered. If such other party does not confirm its intention in writing to take ownership and possession of such records within such 30-

   day period, the party who possesses the records may proceed with

 (c) Sellers and Purchaser shall make all records and other information relating to the Business and all employees and auditors (including by making them available for depositions, interrogatories, testimony, investigation and preparation in connection with any legal or arbitration proceeding) available to the other as may be reasonably required by such party (i) in connection with, among other things, any audit or investigation of, insurance claims by, legal proceedings against, disputes involving or governmental investigations of any Seller or Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates, including the Honeywell Filter Litigation, (ii) in order to enable any Seller or Purchaser to comply with their respective obligations under this Agreement and each other agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, or (iii) for any other reasonable business purpose relating to any Seller, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates and Subsidiaries, but excluding, in each case, any dispute between Honeywell or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, except as would be required by applicable civil process or permitted by applicable discovery rules.

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein and without limiting the generality of this _Section 5.4_ , Honeywell and Purchaser understand and agree that Honeywell will, after the Closing Date, retain the exclusive right to control, defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any and all aspects of the Honeywell Filter Litigation, provided that Honeywell will keep Purchaser reasonably informed of the status of and material developments in the Honeywell Filter Litigation. Purchaser further agrees to and to cause its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, the Transferred Entities) and their respective employees and representatives to, cooperate in good faith with Honeywell and its employees and representatives in connection with such control, defense, negotiation or settlement of the Honeywell Filter Litigation, at Honeywells expense.

 Section 5.5. Required Approvals; Consents.

   (a) Sellers and Purchaser shall each use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using all reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary waivers, consents, and approvals, and/or submitting any necessary notices, including those required by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976 (the "HSR Act") or applicable foreign antitrust or foreign investment Laws. Without limiting the foregoing, each Seller and Purchaser agrees (i) to submit the required HSR Act filing as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, but in no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the date hereof, and to submit promptly thereafter any filings required by antitrust regulations of other jurisdictions including foreign countries or required by foreign investment Laws; (ii) to use reasonable best efforts to comply as expeditiously as possible with all lawful requests of the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, or other governmental competition authorities outside of the United States (the "Antitrust Agencies") for additional information or documents; (iii) to use reasonable best efforts to cause the expeditious termination of the HSR Act and any other regulatory waiting period; (iv) to inform promptly the other parties of any material communications from any Antitrust Agency regarding the transaction contemplated by this Agreement and provide copies to the other party of all correspondence with any Antitrust Agency relating to this Agreement; (v) and to provide promptly to the other parties such information as the other parties may reasonably request in order to enable them to prepare the filings, reports, documents and other materials referred to in this _Section 5.5(a)_. Purchaser shall timely pay all fees in connection with any filings with Antitrust Agencies.

  

 (b) Sellers shall, to the extent requested by Purchaser, give promptly such notices to third parties and use its or their reasonable best efforts (which shall not include any obligation of Sellers to pay any consideration therefor or agree to relinquish or modify any rights in exchange therefor, except as set forth in the following sentence) to obtain the consents listed on  _Section 3.4(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule and Purchaser shall cooperate with Sellers in their efforts to obtain such consents, _provided_ , that, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, Purchaser shall not be required to pay any costs or expenses in obtaining such consents. With respect to the Contracts set forth on _Schedule 5.5(b)_ , Sellers and Purchaser agree to pay up to $1,000,000 in the aggregate to third parties to obtain (at Purchasers direction) any required consents, with Sellers bearing 30% of the aggregate amount of such payments to the extent made after the date hereof and prior to the six month anniversary of the Closing Date. Purchaser shall give promptly such notices to third parties and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the consents listed on _Section 4.3(b)_ of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule and Sellers shall cooperate with Purchaser in Purchasers efforts to obtain the consents listed on _Schedule 4.3(b)_ , _provided_ , that, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, Sellers shall not be required to pay any costs or expenses in obtaining such consents. 

  

 (c) Without limiting _Section 5.5(a)_, Sellers and Purchaser shall each use their reasonable best efforts to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust or foreign investment Laws that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction Documents so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible. In furtherance of the foregoing, Purchaser and each of its Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall, if necessary or desirable to obtain any required 

   approvals, use its reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any action,
including any legislative, administrative or judicial action, and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that
restricts, delays, prevents or prohibits the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under any applicable antitrust Law. For the
avoidance of doubt, as used in this _Section 5.5(c)_ , "reasonable best
efforts" shall include engaging in, and defending against, litigation until
such time as a preliminary or permanent injunction that materially restricts
or delays, or prevents or prohibits the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement has been issued pursuant to a judgment, ruling
or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

  

 (d) From the date of this Agreement through the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not and shall cause its Affiliates not to, make any acquisition or agree to make any acquisition or enter into or agree to enter into any joint venture or similar arrangement (which shall, in each case, include any letter of intent, or other arrangement, whether purporting to be binding or not), with respect to any business competing with the Business in the U.S. automotive aftermarket business or take any other action that could reasonably be expected to hinder or delay the obtaining of clearance or the expiration of the required waiting period under the HSR Act or any other applicable foreign antitrust Law, provided that nothing in this Agreement shall limit the ability of Affiliates of Purchaser to consummate the acquisition of UCI International, Inc. 

  

 Section 5.6. Further Action.

  

 (a) From the date hereof until the Closing, Sellers and Purchaser shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions (within their respective control) necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from time to time after the Closing Date, and for no further consideration, Sellers and Purchaser shall execute, acknowledge and deliver such assignments, transfers, consents, assumptions and other documents and instruments and take such other actions as may reasonably be necessary to appropriately consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including (i) transferring back to Honeywell or any Seller or its designated Subsidiaries any asset or liability which was not contemplated by this Agreement to be transferred to Purchaser at the Closing but was so transferred at the Closing and (ii) transferring to Purchaser any asset or liability contemplated by this Agreement to be transferred to Purchaser and which was not so transferred at the Closing. To the extent there are any Contracts under which benefits accrue to both the Business and to other businesses or business units of the Sellers, Sellers and Purchaser shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to continue to cause the benefits (and related Liabilities) to be available to the Business or such other businesses or business units in the same manner after the Closing. To the extent that a Contract that was transferred to Purchaser at Closing as a Purchased Asset is necessary to the Sellers operation of other businesses or business units in addition to the Business, Purchaser and Sellers shall cooperate in good faith to make available to Sellers the benefits that were necessary to conduct such other businesses or business units prior to the Closing (and related Liabilities) to be available to Sellers in the same manner after the Closing at prices consistent with historical practice of the Business. Sellers shall comply with all requirements and obligations under ISRA, and, prior to Closing, shall provide Purchaser documentation confirming Sellers compliance with ISRA.

   (b) Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall use reasonable efforts to make internal arrangements such that the services contemplated to be provided by Purchaser post-Closing identified on Schedule B to the Transition Services Agreement will not need to be provided and, in such event, such services shall be deleted from the Transition Services Agreement. 

  

 Section 5.7. Expenses; Transfer Taxes and VAT. 

  

 (a) Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (other than Retained Taxes and Transfer Taxes) shall be paid by the party hereto incurring such expenses. 

  

 (b) Each of Honeywell and Purchaser shall pay one-half of any transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar Taxes incurred as a result of the transactions contemplated by _Section 1.1(c)_ of this Agreement (all such items so incurred are referred to herein collectively as "Transfer Taxes"); provided that the foregoing shall not apply and Transfer Taxes shall not include (i) any Taxes incurred in connection with the transfer of Transferred Entities Retained Assets (which shall be Retained Taxes and borne 100% by Sellers), (ii) any Taxes incurred in connection with the transfer of any asset not contemplated by this Agreement to be transferred to Purchaser at the Closing but was so transferred at the Closing and which is required to be transferred back to Honeywell or any Seller or its designated Subsidiaries pursuant to _Section 5.6_ (which Taxes shall be borne 100% by Sellers) and (iii) any value-added or similar Taxes ("VAT") (which are covered by _Section 5.7(c)_ ). Any necessary Tax Return or other documentation with respect to any such Transfer Taxes shall be filed by the party required by applicable law to file such Tax Return or other documentation. In the event that either party receives a refund of any Transfer Taxes, such party shall pay an amount equal to half of (i) the amount of such refund less (ii) any out-of-pocket expenses or Taxes incurred by the party in connection with the receipt of such refund, to the other party. Appropriate reconciliation payments shall be made if an adjustment is made to the amounts taken into account under this _Section 5.7(b)_. 

  

 (c) Sellers and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to secure that the transfer of Purchased Assets pursuant to _Section 1.1(c)_ of this Agreement is treated as neither a supply of goods nor a supply of services for the purposes of any VAT. If nevertheless any VAT is payable on the transfer of any of the Purchased Assets under _Section 1.1(c)_ of this Agreement then Purchaser shall pay to the applicable Seller the amount of such VAT (excluding any interest and penalties imposed) within five (5) Business Days of written demand by Sellers, Sellers shall remit such VAT (and any interest and penalties imposed) and the applicable Seller shall issue to Purchaser a valid VAT invoice in respect of that VAT and shall provide reasonable evidence of the basis on which such VAT is payable. If and to the extent Purchaser is unable to recover the VAT paid under this _Section 5.7(c)_ from the relevant Taxing Authority within three (3) months from the date of payment under this _Section 5.7(c)_, Sellers shall pay Purchaser 50% such non-recovered VAT. To the extent any such non-recovered VAT is subsequently recovered by Purchaser after Sellers have paid their share of such VAT to Purchaser, Purchaser shall pay over to Sellers 50% of any such recovered VAT (but in no event shall such payment exceed the amount paid by Sellers to Purchaser with respect to such VAT). Appropriate reconciliation 

   payments shall be made if an adjustment is made to the amounts taken into
account under this _Section 5.7(c)_.

  

 Section 5.8. Employees and Employee Benefit Plans. This _Section 5.8_ contains the covenants and agreements of the parties with respect to (i) the status of employment of the employees employed in the Business as of the Closing Date, including Shared Employees but excluding Retained Employees ("Employees"), upon the sale of the Business to Purchaser, and (ii) the employee benefits and employee benefit plans provided or covering such Employees and former employees of Honeywell and its Affiliates who terminated employment with Honeywell and its Affiliates while employed in the Business or who retired from the Business prior to the Closing Date ("Former Employees"). 

  

 (a)  _United States Employees_. This _Section 5.8(a)_ applies to Employees employed in the United States Business as of the Closing Date, and Former Employees who terminated employment with Honeywell and its Affiliates while employed in the United States Business or retired from the United States Business prior to the Closing Date.

    |  

 (i)  _Continuation of Employment; Assumption of Current Liabilities for  Employees_. Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall  cause an Affiliate to, (A) employ or continue to employ each and every  Employee of the Transferred Entities, regardless of whether such Employee is  actively employed on such date, and (B) offer employment to all other  salaried and hourly persons who are designated on the records of any Seller  and any Affiliate of Honeywell other than a Transferred Entity (each such  Seller or Affiliate, an "Employee Transferor") as of the Closing  Date as Employees with respect to the United States Business and all Shared  Employees, in either case if then actively at work, or on any form of leave  (provided such leave was approved by the Employee Transferor consistent with  past practice and, for the avoidance of doubt, except as required under _Section  5.8(c)_ , not including any laid-off Employee) other than non-union  represented employees on long-term disability leave or leave for military  service. Such Employees accepting Purchasers or its Affiliates offer,  together with the Employees of the Transferred Entities as of the Closing  Date, will become "Transferred  U.S. Employees" as of the Effective Time. For those  non-union Employees who would otherwise be required to be employed by  Purchaser or an Affiliate pursuant to this _Section 5.8(a)(i)_ but  who are on long-term disability leave as of the Effective Time, Purchaser  shall, or shall cause its Affiliate to, offer employment to each such  Employee to the extent such Employee recovers from such Employees disability  and presents himself or herself to Purchaser or such Affiliate for active  employment within six months of the Closing Date. For those non-union  Employees who would otherwise be required to be employed by Purchaser or an Affiliate  pursuant to this _Section 5.8(a)(i)_ but who are on leave for  military service as of the Effective Time, Purchaser shall, or shall cause  its Affiliate to, offer employment to each such Employee to the extent such  Employee presents himself or herself to Purchaser or such Affiliate for  active employment within the period such Employees reemployment rights are  guaranteed by applicable Law. Each Employee described in the two preceding  sentences who accepts Purchasers (or its Affiliates) offer of employment  will become a Transferred U.S. Employee as of the date such Employee returns  to work with Purchaser or its Affiliate. Terms of employment continuation for  each Transferred U.S. Employee

    |  

shall (A) require employment at the same work location, (B) pay a  base wage
rate no less than each such Transferred U.S. Employees base wage  rate in
effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, (C) provide a cash  incentive
compensation opportunity no less than each such Transferred U.S.  Employees
cash incentive compensation opportunity in effect immediately  prior to the
Closing Date, substituting such performance goals and criteria,  if any, as
Purchaser may reasonably determine for any such goals and criteria  that are
based on Honeywells performance, (D) as of the time the Employees  become
Transferred U.S. Employees, provide health (including medical, dental  and
vision care), life insurance, disability, vacation, flexible spending 
account, and retirement savings (but not defined benefit retirement)
benefits  that are not materially less favorable in the aggregate than those
provided  to the Transferred U.S. Employees by Honeywell and its Affiliates
immediately  prior to the Closing Date, and (E) otherwise comply with all
other applicable  provisions of this _Section 5.8(a)_. Purchaser shall
credit, or shall  cause its Affiliates to credit, each Transferred U.S.
Employees service with  Honeywell and its Affiliates for all purposes,
including eligibility,  participation, benefit accrual and vesting. Purchaser
and its Affiliates  shall honor any recall or re-employment rights mandated
by applicable Law or  by contract of any Employees or Former Employees. On
and after the Closing Date,  Purchaser shall comply at its expense with all
employment Laws with respect  to the period of employment with Purchaser or
its Affiliates of the  Transferred U.S. Employees, including the Family and
Medical Leave Act, the  Americans with Disabilities Act and federal or state
Laws on military leave.  Purchaser shall likewise honor and assume all
liability for accrued but  unpaid wages, commitments to tuition
reimbursement, and current year bonus  entitlement, for all Transferred U.S.
Employees. Nothing in this Agreement  shall, or shall be construed to, limit
the ability of Purchaser to terminate the  employment of any Transferred U.S.
Employee at any time after the Closing  Date.

    |  

 (ii)  _Severance Protection_. From and after the Closing Date, Transferred  U.S. Employees shall be entitled to the benefit of such severance plan or policy,  if any, as Purchaser or its Affiliates may have in effect from time to time; _provided_ ,  that service with Honeywell, Purchaser, and their respective Affiliates shall  be taken into account in computing the amount of such benefit; and, _provided_   _further_ , that if Purchaser or any of its Affiliates terminates the  employment of any Transferred U.S. Employee on or before the first  anniversary of the Closing Date (including as a result of refusal of any  Transferred U.S. Employee to accept a work relocation that is greater than  fifty (50) miles from such Transferred U.S. Employees work location as of  the Closing Date), Purchaser or its Affiliate shall provide a severance  benefit consisting of salary continuation and continued insurance coverage  that shall be no less than the severance benefit the Transferred U.S.  Employee would have received under the terms of an Employee Transferors or a  Transferred Entitys severance plan(s), as applicable, in effect on the  Closing Date, calculated as though the Transferred U.S. Employee worked  continuously (by combining such Transferred U.S. Employees service for  Honeywell and its Affiliates on the one hand, and Purchaser and its  Affiliates on the other hand) until such Transferred U.S. Employees  termination date with Purchaser or its Affiliate.

 (iv)  _Savings Plan and Pension Plan_.

    
  

 (A)  _Savings Plan_. Effective as of the time the Employees become Transferred U.S. Employees, Transferred U.S. Employees shall cease to be eligible to contribute to the Honeywell Savings and Ownership Plan ("Sellers Savings Plan"). Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall establish or otherwise maintain, or shall cause its Affiliate to establish or otherwise maintain, one or more tax-qualified defined contribution savings plans ("Purchasers Savings Plans") that shall (i) permit immediate participation as of the Closing Date for the Transferred U.S. Employees who were eligible to participate in Sellers Savings Plan as of the day before the Closing Date; (ii) credit all service that was credited under Sellers Savings Plan for purposes of the eligibility, vesting and match eligibility requirements of the Purchasers Savings Plans; (iii) provide for tax-deferred contributions pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Code, and (iv) accept elective direct rollovers of Transferred U.S. Employees accounts under Sellers Savings Plan to the extent payable in cash. The Purchasers Savings Plans shall initially provide for employer matching contributions that are no less favorable than those provided under the terms of Sellers Savings Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchasers Savings Plan shall not be required to offer participation to any Transferred U.S. Employee prior to the date such Employee becomes a Transferred U.S. Employee. In accordance with the terms of Sellers Savings Plan, as of the Closing Date, the accounts under the Sellers Savings Plan for all Transferred U.S. Employees shall be 100% vested.

  

 (B)  _Pension Plans_. Effective as of the time the Employees become Transferred U.S. Employees, Transferred U.S. Employees shall no longer be eligible to accrue benefits under any defined benefit pension plan sponsored by an Employee Transferor ("Sellers U.S. Pension Plan"). The Employee Transferors shall retain all assets and liabilities related to Sellers U.S. Pension Plan, and Purchaser shall have no obligation to replicate the benefits of Sellers U.S. Pension Plan, except as follows. Prior to or as soon as administratively practicable following, but in any event effective as of, the Closing Date and in accordance with applicable Law, Honeywell shall establish a plan that qualifies under Code Section 401(a) and a trust that qualifies under Code Section 501(a) ("Purchasers U.S. Pension Plan") for the exclusive benefit of those Transferred U.S. Employees whose terms and conditions of employment are governed by the collective bargaining agreements pertaining to production and maintenance workers at Sellers Fostoria, Ohio and Greenville, Ohio facilities ("Union Pension Participants"), the identified sponsor of which shall be Purchaser or such Transferred Entity as Purchaser shall have previously identified. Purchasers U.S. Pension Plan shall be identical in all relevant respects to the terms of Sellers U.S. Pension Plan applicable to the Union Pension Participants and on its establishment shall have and assume all liabilities of Sellers U.S. Pension Plan in respect of the Union Pension Participants and their dependents and beneficiaries. Simultaneously with the establishment of Purchasers U.S. Pension Plan, Honeywell shall cause the trust forming a part of Sellers U.S. Pension Plan to transfer to the trust forming a part of Purchasers U.S. Pension Plan an amount of assets in cash, cash equivalents or other assets of the trust to which Purchaser has no reasonable objection, determined in accordance with the provisions of _Schedule F_ to this Agreement.

   (v)  _Employee Welfare Plans_.

  

 (A) Purchaser or its Affiliates shall, not later than the Closing Date, provide the Transferred U.S. Employees and their spouses, dependents and beneficiaries with health and life insurance, disability, severance, and other welfare benefit plans and programs as Purchaser or its Affiliates shall determine, subject to the requirements of this _Section 5.8_. Subject to any specific provision of this _Section 5.8_ to the contrary, Sellers shall remain solely responsible for liabilities or obligations incurred with respect to each Former Employee and their spouses, dependents and beneficiaries under any of Sellers health (including medical, dental and vision care) and life insurance, disability, severance and other welfare benefit plans and programs for liabilities or obligations incurred prior to, on or following the Closing Date and with respect to each Transferred U.S. Employee and their spouses, dependents and beneficiaries under any of Sellers health (including medical, dental and vision care) and life insurance, disability, severance and other welfare benefit plans and programs for liabilities or obligations incurred prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be solely responsible for liabilities or obligations incurred with respect to each Transferred U.S. Employee and their spouses, dependents and beneficiaries under any of Purchasers, or any Transferred Entitys health (including medical, dental and vision care) and life insurance, disability, severance and other welfare benefit plans and programs for liabilities incurred on or after the Closing Date. For purposes of this _Section 5.8(a)(v)(A)_ , a liability or obligation shall be deemed to be incurred upon the occurrence of an injury or the diagnosis of an illness and the liability or obligation will include any covered expenses for any related claims or series of related claims giving rise to such liability or obligation, _provided_ , that in the case of medical and dental expenses, including under any flexible spending account plan, a liability and obligation shall be deemed to be incurred only as and when claim for payment of the same is received.

  

 (B) Any plans or programs established or maintained by Purchaser or its Affiliates to provide health (including medical, dental and vision care) and life insurance, disability, severance, vacation, cafeteria, flexible spending, dependent care and other welfare benefits for the benefit of the Transferred U.S. Employees shall, (i) credit all service with Honeywell and its Affiliates for purposes of eligibility, participation, benefit accrual and benefit entitlement, (ii) waive any pre-existing condition limitation or exclusion or any actively-at-work requirement, and (iii) credit all payments made for healthcare expenses during the current plan year for purposes of deductibles, co-payments and maximum out-of-pocket limits and (iv) subject to _Section 5.8(c)_ and _Section 5.8(a)(v)(C)_ below, until the first anniversary of the Closing Date provide health (including medical, dental and vision care), life insurance, disability, vacation, flexible spending account, and retirement savings (but not defined benefit retirement) benefits that are not materially less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to the Transferred U.S. Employees by Honeywell and its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date. 

  

 (C) For those Transferred U.S. Employees whose terms and conditions of employment are governed by the Labor Contracts pertaining to production and maintenance workers at Sellers Fostoria, Ohio and Greenville, Ohio facilities, and their eligible spouses, dependents and beneficiaries, Purchaser shall or shall cause its Affiliates to, establish and maintain health and life insurance coverage (1) providing OPEB Benefits on the same terms and subject to the same conditions as those in effect as of the Closing Date under the U.S.

   Benefit Plans and required by the applicable Labor Contract, and (2) offering
the opportunity to qualify for such OPEB Benefits on the same terms and
subject to the same conditions as those in effect as of the Closing
Date under the U.S. Benefit Plans and required by the applicable Labor
Contract in the case of such of those Transferred U.S. Employees (and their
eligible spouses, dependents and beneficiaries) who have not become entitled
to such coverage under the U.S. Benefit Plans and applicable Labor Contract
prior to the Closing Date. After the Effective Time, Purchaser shall not, nor
shall it permit any of its Affiliates to, modify (whether to reduce or
increase) any of the OPEB Benefits or opportunities to earn such OPEB
Benefits described in this  _Section 5.8(a)(v)(C)_ if as a result Honeywell
or any of its Affiliates would incur any Liability, whether under any U.S.
Benefit Plan or applicable Labor Contract (and even if otherwise permitted,
only after any required bargaining under an applicable Labor Contract).

  

 (vi)  _Severance and WARN Act Liability_. Purchaser agrees to pay and be responsible for (i) all liability, cost or expense for severance, salary continuation, special bonuses and like costs under Purchasers severance pay plans, retention agreements, policies or arrangements, (ii) any payment obligations described in _Section 5.8(a)(ii)_ with respect to any of the Transferred U.S. Employees that arise and are in respect of the Transferred U.S. Employees services performed for Purchaser or any of its Affiliates on or after the Closing Date, and (iii) any severance obligations that arise on or after January 1, 2011 in connection with any Sellers repositioning projects approved by Purchaser under _Section 5.1_. Except as provided in the foregoing sentence, Sellers shall be solely responsible and pay for all liability, cost or expense, if any, for severance, salary continuation, special bonuses and the like under the Employee Transferors or the Transferred Entities severance pay plans, retention agreements, expatriate agreements, employment agreements, policies or arrangements with respect to employees of the Business that arise before the Closing, in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or a termination of employment of any such individual by an Employee Transferor or a Transferred Entity, including but not limited to, to the extent not satisfied nor required to be satisfied prior to Closing, under the agreements set forth on or as otherwise set forth on _Section 5.8(a)(vi)_ of the Disclosure Schedule Sellers agree to pay and be responsible for all liability, cost, expense and sanctions resulting from any failure to comply with the WARN Act, and the regulations thereunder, in connection with events which occur prior to the Closing Date that relate to the Business. Purchaser agrees to pay and be responsible for all liability, cost, expense and sanctions resulting from any failure to comply with the WARN Act, and the regulations thereunder, in connection with events which occur on or after the Closing Date that relate to the Business. 

  

 (vii)  _Health Care Continuation Coverage_. With respect to all health plans maintained for Transferred U.S. Employees, Purchaser agrees to provide (directly or through its Affiliates) continuation coverage required by COBRA to all Transferred U.S. Employees and their covered beneficiaries who are entitled to COBRA coverage with respect to qualifying events that occur after the Closing Date. Purchaser agrees to pay and be responsible for all liability, cost, expense, taxes and sanctions under Section 4980B of the Code, and interest and penalties imposed upon, incurred by, or assessed against Purchaser or an Employee Transferor that arise with respect to the Transferred U.S. Employees and their covered beneficiaries after the Closing Date by reason of, or relating to, any failure by Purchaser and its Affiliates to comply with the health care continuation coverage requirements of COBRA as provided in the immediately preceding sentence. 

   (viii)  _Worker s Compensation_. Purchaser shall be responsible for the administration and the financial obligation of all workers compensation claims with respect to the Transferred U.S. Employees arising out of or relating to occurrences on or after the Closing Date and Sellers shall be responsible for the administration and the financial obligation of all workers compensation claims arising out of or relating to occurrences before the Closing Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the following specific principles shall apply to the following specific claims:

  

 (A)  _Modified Duty_. If, prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Purchaser fails to continue to accommodate the modified or alternative work arrangements that are in place as of the Closing Date for a Transferred U.S. Employee (the "Modified Duty Employees"), except if such failure to accommodate is the result of a termination of such Modified Duty Employees employment for cause, then the Employee Transferors and Purchaser shall share the applicable workers compensation liability, as determined by the applicable workers compensation state Law, in proportion to the length of time such Modified Duty Employee was on modified duty with an Employee Transferor or Transferred Entity before the Closing Date and Purchaser after the Closing Date. If such failure to accommodate described in the preceding sentence occurs with respect to a Modified Duty Employee following the first anniversary of the Closing Date or if a Modified Duty Employee voluntarily leaves employment at any time for any reason other than an unjustified failure by Purchaser to accommodate, then the Employee Transferors shall bear all applicable workers compensation liability with respect to such Modified Duty Employee and Purchaser shall not share any of such liability with the Employee Transferors.

  

 (B)  _Aggravated Injury_. In the event that a Transferred U.S. Employee notifies Purchaser after the Closing Date of a workers compensation injury that is the result of an aggravation of an injury that occurred prior to the Closing Date, the responsibility for the administration and financial obligation of this claim (i.e., the allocation between Sellers workers compensation coverage and Purchasers workers compensation coverage) will be determined by the applicable workers compensation Law and is subject to the final interpretation of the appropriate court. 

  

 (ix)  _No Assumption of Plans_. Except for the assumption of the Labor Contracts as provided in _Section 5.8(c)_ , and except as set forth on _Section 5.8(a)(ix)_ of the Disclosure Schedule (the "Transferred U.S. Benefit Plans"), neither Purchaser nor its Affiliates nor any Transferred Entity shall assume, or have any liability in connection with, any U.S. Benefit Plan. Purchaser shall or shall cause one or more of its Affiliates to assume all Liabilities under or in respect of the Transferred U.S. Benefit Plans. Sellers shall cause each Transferred Entity to (i) withdraw from or otherwise terminate its participation under each U.S. Benefit Plan (other than the Transferred U.S. Benefit Plans), or (ii) if any U.S. Benefit Plan other than a Transferred U.S. Benefit Plan is maintained or sponsored solely by one or more Transferred Entities, terminate such plan, with such withdrawal or termination of participation or plan termination effective no later than the Closing Date. 

  

 (x)  _Vacation_. Effective with the date an Employee becomes a Transferred U.S. Employee, Purchaser shall assume liability for any earned but not taken 

   vacation time (including any non-forfeitable vacation entitlement otherwise
payable only on termination of employment) of the Transferred U.S. Employees.

  

 (xi)  _Flexible Spending Accounts_. Effective as of the Closing Date, Transferred U.S. Employees shall no longer be eligible to contribute to the health care flexible spending account or accounts sponsored by Sellers except as otherwise provided by and in accordance with COBRA. Effective as of the Closing Date, the Transferred U.S. Employees shall no longer be eligible to contribute to the dependent care flexible spending accounts sponsored by the Employee Transferors (such health and dependent care accounts, "Sellers FSAs"). Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall establish or otherwise maintain, or shall cause its Affiliate to establish or maintain, health care and dependent care flexible spending accounts which shall (i) permit immediate participation as of the Closing Date for all Transferred U.S. Employees who were eligible to participate in the Employee Transferors FSAs as of the day before the Closing Date and (ii) accept for reimbursement any claims related to the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs and eligible for reimbursement on the basis of participant elections initially made under the Employee Transferors FSAs for such year. Sellers shall pay to Purchaser an amount in cash equal to the excess, if any, of (x) the aggregate accumulated contributions to the Sellers FSAs made during the year in which the Closing Date occurs by the Transferred U.S. Employees over (y) the aggregate reimbursement payouts made for such year from Sellers FSAs in respect of such Transferred U.S. Employees. 

  

 (xii)  _Employment Taxes_ _._ Sellers and Purchaser will treat Purchaser as a "successor employer" and Sellers as a "predecessor," within the meaning of sections 3121(a)(1) and 3306(b)(1) of the Code, with respect to Transferred U.S. Employees who are employed by Purchaser (or any of its Affiliates) for purposes of Taxes imposed under the United States Federal Unemployment Tax Act or the United States Federal Insurance Contributions Act and any applicable Tax law relating to employment, unemployment insurance, social security, disability, workers compensation, payroll, health care or other similar Tax for which comparable treatment is reasonably determined to be available without undue administrative burden on either Party. 

  

 (b)  _Non-U.S. Employees_. This _Section 5.8(b)_ applies only to Employees employed in the Non-United States Business as of the Closing Date, and Former Employees who terminated employment with Honeywell or its Affiliates while employed in the Non-United States Business or retired from the Non-United States Business prior to the Closing Date. 

  

 (i)  _Employment_. Each Employee employed by the Employee Transferors or the Transferred Entities or any Affiliate of either in the Non-United States Business, whether hourly or salaried, and who is actively at work on the Closing Date, or who is absent on the Closing Date due to a recognized leave of absence, whether paid or unpaid, shall be referred to as a "Non-U.S. Employee." Wherever legally permissible, on the Closing Date, Non-U.S. Employees shall become employees of Purchaser or continue to be employees of a Transferred Entity by operation of the applicable Laws or regulations of the jurisdiction in which such employment is located (the "National Laws", which term shall include the EU Acquired Rights Directive, where applicable) and/or pursuant to the terms of any agreed transfer agreement relating to that jurisdiction. Where such continuation of employment or transfer is not possible in the manner described in the previous sentence, Purchaser shall offer the Non-U.S. 

   Employees employment in accordance with any procedures required by applicable
National Laws to effectuate their employment with Purchaser or a Transferred
Entity commencing on the Closing Date. Each Non-U.S. Employee who, as of the
Closing Date, is employed by, or otherwise has such Employee employment
continued with, a Transferred Entity, otherwise transfers to the employ of
Purchaser or a Transferred Entity pursuant to National Laws or accepts
Purchasers offer of employment shall be referred to as a "Transferred
Non-U.S. Employee." No provision herein shall impair, deny or limit the right
of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to change the employment terms or to
terminate the employment of any Transferred Non-U.S. Employee at any time, to
the extent permissible under applicable National Laws and any applicable
Labor Contract.

  

 (ii)  _Compensation and Benefits; Severance Protection_. Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser or its Affiliates shall provide Transferred Non-U.S. Employees with terms and conditions of employment, compensation and employee benefits that are consistent with those (i) required to be provided by Purchaser or its Affiliates under the Transferred Non-U.S. Employees employment contract, if applicable, or (ii) if more favorable (or if the Transferred Non-U.S. Employee does not have a contract), required by applicable National Laws or an applicable Labor Contract. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject to _Section 5.8(b)(iii)(C)_ below, if applicable, from and after the Closing Date, Transferred Non-U.S. Employees shall, if required by applicable National Laws or an applicable employment contract or Labor Contract, be entitled to at least the benefit of such severance plan or policy, if any, as Purchaser or its Affiliates may have in effect from time to time; _provided_ that service with Honeywell, Purchaser, and their respective Affiliates shall be taken into account in computing the amount of any such benefit, and, _provided_ _further_ , that if Purchaser or any of its Affiliates terminates the employment of any Transferred Non-U.S. Employee on or before the first anniversary of the Closing Date (including as a result of refusal of any Transferred Non-U.S. Employee to accept a work relocation that is greater than fifty (50) miles from such Transferred Non-U.S. Employees work location as of the Closing Date), Purchaser or its Affiliate shall, if required by applicable National Laws or an applicable employment contract or Labor Contract, provide at least a severance benefit consisting of salary continuation and continued insurance coverage, if any, that shall be no less than the severance benefit and insurance coverage the Transferred Non-U.S. Employee would have received under the terms of an Employer Transferors or a Transferred Entitys severance plan(s), as applicable, in effect on the Closing Date, calculated as though the Transferred Non-U.S. Employee worked continuously (by combining such Transferred Non-U.S. Employees service for Honeywell and its Affiliates on the one hand, and Purchaser and its Affiliates on the other hand) until such Transferred Non-U.S. Employees termination date with Purchaser or its Affiliate. 

  

 (iii)  _Foreign Benefit Plans_. "Sellers Foreign Benefit Plans" means those Foreign Benefit Plans listed on _Section 3.12(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule to the extent they cover the Transferred Non-U.S. Employees. 

  

 (A) Except to the extent otherwise required by Law and except for those of Sellers Foreign Benefit Plans set forth on _Section 5.8(b)(iii)(A)_ of the Disclosure Schedule (the "Transferred Foreign Benefit Plans"), as of the Closing Date, each Transferred Non-U.S. Employee shall cease to be an active participant in Sellers Foreign Benefit Plans. 

   Purchaser shall or shall cause one or more of its Affiliates to assume all
Liabilities under or in respect of the Transferred Foreign Benefit Plans.

  

 (B) As of the Closing Date, Purchaser or its Affiliates shall provide employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements outside of the United States in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and applicable National Laws that, in accordance with the obligation to provide total compensation and employee benefits as provided in _Section 5.8(b)(ii)_ , (1) provide employee benefits on the terms and conditions required to be provided by Purchaser or its Affiliates under the Transferred Non-U.S. Employees employment contract, if applicable, or (2) if more favorable than the employee benefits described in subclause (1) (or if the Transferred Non-U.S. Employee does not have a contract), provide employee benefits as required by applicable National Laws. The Transferred Foreign Benefit Plans and the Employee Transferors insurance contracts providing benefits that are maintained exclusively for the benefit of employees of a Transferred Entity who become on the Closing Date Transferred Non-U.S. Employees (inclusive of applicable assets, insurance contracts, property or funds underlying, supporting or otherwise to be used or applied to fund or pay benefits or liabilities under or with respect to such plans) will be transferred or assigned to Purchaser or its Affiliates (or, in the case of such assets, property or funds, to the applicable plan or plans so established or maintained) no later than the Closing Date. With respect to any Sellers Foreign Benefit Plans that are not transferred to Purchaser as provided in the preceding sentence and to the extent not otherwise required by Law, Sellers shall cooperate to cause each Transferred Entity to (x) withdraw from or otherwise terminate its participation under such Foreign Benefit Plans or, (y) if any such Sellers Foreign Benefit Plan is maintained or sponsored solely by one or more Transferred Entities, terminate such plan or merge such plan with another plan of an Employee Transferor such that the obligations of the Transferred Entity are assumed by an Employee Transferor, with such withdrawal or termination of participation or plan termination or merger effective no later than the Closing Date. 

  

 (C) Purchaser shall provide each Transferred Non-U.S. Employee with credit for service with Honeywell and its Affiliates and Purchaser for purposes of eligibility to participate, and vesting and solely with respect to the Transferred Foreign Benefit Plans (inclusive of related asset, contracts, property and funds) that are transferred or assigned to Purchaser, benefit accrual under Purchasers Non-U.S. Employee Benefits Plans. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Purchaser shall not be obligated to recognize prior service with Honeywell and its Affiliates in the case of any Non-U.S. Employee employed in China and Singapore, or in the case of any Non-U.S. Employee employed in Germany declining a transfer of employment to Purchaser or an Affiliate. In respect of those Non-U.S. Employees in China, Singapore and Germany, Sellers shall pay, and Purchaser shall directly reimburse Sellers at the Closing Date for, the total severance amount set out in _Section 5.8(b)(iii)(C)_ of the Disclosure Schedule or, if greater, any severance required to be paid to such Non-U.S. Employees in China, Singapore and Germany by applicable National Law or Labor Contract. 

  

 (D) Purchaser or its Affiliates shall establish or otherwise maintain pension, retirement and/or savings plans for Transferred Non-U.S. Employees ("Purchasers Foreign Retirement Plans") that shall (i) permit immediate participation as of the Closing Date, (ii) credit all service with both Honeywell and Purchaser and their respective Affiliates for purposes of the eligibility, vesting and employer contribution levels, and (iii) 

   otherwise fulfill the obligations of Purchaser as set forth in
_Section 5.8(b)(iii)(B)_. With respect to those Transferred Non-U.S.
Employees who were eligible to participate in the pension, retirement and
savings plans set forth on _Section 5.8(b)(iii)(D)(i)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule (collectively "Sellers Foreign Retirement Plans") as of the
Closing Date, the applicable Purchasers Foreign Retirement Plans shall, as
applicable, offer credit for service that was credited under Sellers Foreign
Retirement Plans, along with future service with Purchaser, for purposes of
the eligibility, vesting, and early retirement eligibility, and such other
terms and conditions, if any, as may be required in the case of Transferred
Foreign Benefit Plans or as expressly provided on _Section 5.8(b)(iii)(D)(i)_
of the Disclosure Schedule. With respect to those Transferred Non-U.S.
Employees who were eligible to participate in the Foreign Benefit Plans set
forth on _Section 5.8(b)(iii)(D)(ii)_ of the Disclosure Schedule as of the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall establish, and shall maintain for so long as
such Transferred Non-U.S. Employees remain employed at the facilities
locations such Transferred Non-U.S. Employees were employed at as of the
Closing Date, a new defined contribution benefit plan (funded only
by Purchaser, i.e., a Purchaser provided benefit equal to percentage of
pay determined by Purchaser) and offer credit for service that was credited
under such Foreign Benefit Plans, along with future service with Purchaser,
for purposes of the eligibility, vesting, and early retirement eligibility.

  

 (E) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no provision herein shall impair Purchasers ability to amend or terminate any such plan at any time to the extent permissible under applicable National Laws or Labor Contracts. 

  

 (iv)  _Termination and Severance Liabilities_. Purchaser shall be responsible for all amounts becoming payable to Non-U.S. Employees under applicable National Laws, Purchasers severance plans or arrangements or any employment contracts as a result of their being dismissed by Purchaser at any time on or after the Closing Date, notwithstanding that such amounts are calculated under applicable National Laws, plans, arrangements or employment contracts by reference to periods of employment with Honeywell and its Affiliates as well as periods of employment with Purchaser and its Affiliates. After the Closing, Purchaser shall be responsible for any severance obligations with respect any employees of the Business outside of the United States that arise on or after January 1, 2011 in connection with any Sellers repositioning projects approved by Purchaser under _Section 5.1_. 

  

 (v)  _Responsibility for Non-U.S. Employees_. Except as otherwise set forth herein, for employees who are Transferred Non-U.S. Employees as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall assume and thereafter pay, perform and discharge when due any and all employment, compensation and employee benefit liabilities, responsibilities and obligations with respect to such Transferred Non-U.S. Employees, including any and all claims under National Laws, which liabilities, responsibilities and obligations are incurred as the result of incidents, events, acts or failures to act, occurring on or after the Closing Date. 

  

 (vi)  _Foreign Benefit Plan Asset Transfers_. Sellers may agree to transfer, and Purchaser may agree to accept, assets from or with respect to certain of Sellers Foreign Benefit Plans other than Transferred Foreign Benefit Plans. If any such plan asset transfers are agreed, Sellers and Purchaser shall mutually agree upon the terms and conditions of such transfers, subject to the provisions of each such plan and the requirements of National 

   Laws. In addition, Sellers and Purchaser may mutually agree to transfer the
liability with respect to benefits accrued or account balances accumulated as
of the applicable transfer date by Transferred Non-U.S. Employees under
such Sellers Foreign Benefit Plans other than Transferred Foreign Benefit
Plans. Where any transfer of assets or liability is agreed to in respect of a
defined benefit pension plan, Sellers actuaries and Purchasers actuaries
will agree to the liabilities and assets to be allocated to each of the
transferee and transferor plan or plans consistent with applicable National
Laws. Following the payment or transfer of agreed assets, and solely to the
extent of the liability attributable to such payment or transfer, Sellers and
Sellers Foreign Retirement Plans will be discharged from such liability
under such Sellers Foreign Benefit Plans, and Purchasers or its Affiliates
plan or plans shall assume and be solely responsible for such liability.

  

 (vii)  _Non-U.S. Employee Communications_. Each party to this Agreement shall comply with all obligations under applicable National Laws to provide information to the other parties for onward transmission to Non-U.S. Employees or their representatives and/or to provide such information directly to the Non-U.S. Employees or their representatives. Each party to this Agreement shall comply with all obligations under applicable National Law to inform and/or consult Employees, trade unions, works councils or other employee representative bodies in connection with the matters contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (viii)  _Cooperation_. To the extent permitted by Law, Purchaser shall give to the Employee Transferors, and Sellers shall give, or cause to be given, to Purchaser, on a timely basis, all requisite and pertinent information which the Employee Transferors and Purchaser, respectively, may require in order to comply with their respective obligations with respect to Employees and Former Employees. 

  

 (ix)  _Employee Refusal to Transfer_. Any Non-U.S. Employee lawfully rejecting the transfer to or employment by Purchaser or its Affiliates shall remain (or, in the case of an employee of a Transferred Entity, shall be) employed by the Employee Transferors; provided, however, that the Employee Transferors may terminate such Non-U.S. Employee immediately after Closing, subject to applicable legal constraints, if any, and shall be solely responsible for any severance payment or compensation or other benefit to or with respect to such Non-U.S. Employee. Purchaser shall be responsible for all costs with respect to such terminations to the extent such costs arise as a result of Purchasers failure to comply with the obligations set forth in _Sections 5.8(b)(i)_  and _(ii)_. 

  

 (x)  _Section 75 Debt_. As provided in _Section 5.8(b)(iii)(A)_ and _(B)_ , with effect from Closing, Holt UK will withdraw as a participating employer from those pension schemes in the United Kingdom in which it is a participating employer, including the Honeywell UK Pension Scheme (collectively, the "UK Pension Scheme") and employees of Holt UK will cease to be active members of the UK Pension Scheme. Sellers shall pay or shall cause to be paid directly to the trustees of the UK Pension Scheme any Section 75 Debt that arises as a result of Holt UK withdrawing as a participating employer under the UK Pension Scheme. 

  

 (c)  _Labor Contracts_. 

   (i) In respect of the Transferred U.S. Employees and the Transferred Non-U.S. Employees, Purchaser shall, or shall cause an Affiliate to, assume each of (A) the collective bargaining agreements pertaining to production and maintenance workers at Sellers Fostoria, Ohio and Greenville, Ohio facilities, (B) the labor agreement pertaining to employees of Honeywell Mexico 2, (C) those employment, retention, and expatriate agreements set forth on _Section 5.8(c)_  of the Disclosure Schedule, and (D) any national collective bargaining agreements under applicable National Law, or Works Council agreements, with respect to the Non-U.S. Business (individually, a "Labor Contract" and collectively, the "Labor Contracts"), and to honor and fulfill all of the Employee Transferors obligations under each of the Labor Contracts in accordance with and subject to their terms. Purchaser and Honeywell shall each cooperate for the purposes of, including providing the relevant representative of any group covered by a Labor Contract with required notices, bargaining with the representative, if required by the terms of the Labor Contract or any applicable Law or National Law, and taking any other necessary actions in connection with negotiating any changes in the terms of employment of the Employees covered by such Labor Contract necessary or appropriate to effectuate the transfer of employment and Liabilities for such Employees on terms and conditions consistent with this _Section 5.8_. Purchaser shall be exclusively responsible for any Liability incurred in connection with any change negotiated by or at the direction or with the prior written approval of Purchaser in respect of such Labor Contracts. 

  

 (ii) Purchaser shall, or shall cause an Affiliate to, employ each Employee whose terms of employment are covered by a Labor Contract on all of the terms and conditions of employment of the applicable Labor Contract on the Closing Date, including wages, benefits, severance protection (if any), provision of pension, health and other benefit plans, vacation, leave, hours or work and other terms and conditions of employment in effect with respect to such Employee on the Closing Date, and honor and fulfill all applicable obligations under the applicable Labor Contract in respect to such Employee, except as the same may be modified consistent with applicable Law or National Law. 

  

 (iii)  _Effect_. This _Section 5.8(c)_ shall supersede any contrary provisions of _Section 5.8(a)_. 

  

 (d)  _Stock Award Plans_. With respect to any outstanding stock options or equity awards granted to Transferred U.S. Employees and Transferred Non-U.S. Employees, such Employees shall be able to exercise vested options and receive any vested awards under the Employee Transferors equity plan in accordance with the terms of the applicable plan and award agreement. Except as otherwise required by Law, Employees shall incur a termination date under the Employee Transferors equity and stock purchase plans as of the Closing Date. To the extent required under applicable National Laws, each Transferred Non-U.S. Employee who was, immediately prior to the Closing Date, a member of an Employee Transferors equity or stock purchase plan will be provided remuneration by Purchaser or its Affiliates of an equivalent value to such membership, with effect from the Closing Date. Nothing contained in this _Section 5.8_ shall require Purchaser or its Affiliates to grant any stock options or equity awards to any Transferred U.S. Employee or Transferred Non.-U.S. Employee on or after the Closing Date. 

  

 (e)  _Non-U.S. Employee Communications_. Each party to this Agreement shall comply with all obligations under applicable National Laws to provide information to the other 

   parties for onward transmission to Non-U.S. Employees or
their representatives and/or to provide such information directly to the
Non-U.S. Employees or their representatives.

  

 (f)  _Temporary, Etc. Employees_. Prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall take steps to enter into an agreement with the provider of subcontracted employees to the Business to enable the transfer of such subcontracted employees from the related contract of the Employee Transferors to a contract of Purchaser as of the Closing Date. Sellers will cooperate with Purchaser to affect this transfer. 

  

 Section 5.9. Intercompany Accounts. Prior to the Closing Date, Sellers will use reasonable best efforts to cause any amounts owed to or by a Transferred Entity or a Seller related to the Business from or to Sellers or other divisions or Affiliates of Sellers (other than a Transferred Entity or another part of the Business) to be settled. Prior to Closing, Sellers may (but are not required to) cause any amounts owed to or by a Transferred Entity or a Seller related to the Business from or to a Transferred Entity or another part of the Business to be settled. 

  

 Section 5.10. Non-Solicitation of Employees. Honeywell agrees that for a period of three years from the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of Purchaser, it will not, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment any Transferred Employee (other than clerical or non-salaried employees and except as set forth on _Schedule 5.10_ );  _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not prohibit Honeywell from (a) engaging in the general solicitation (whether by newspaper, trade publication or other periodical or pursuant to the use of an executive search consultant) of employees (or hiring any Transferred Employees that respond to such general solicitation) so long as such solicitation is not directed specifically at any Transferred Employee or any other employees of the Business after the Closing, (b) soliciting any employee of the Business after the Closing (other than clerical or non-salaried employees) who has not been employed by Purchaser during the three-month period preceding such solicitation or who was involuntarily terminated by Purchaser, or (c) employing the Retained Employees after the Closing Date. Purchaser agrees that for the same period and subject to the same exceptions, it will not, directly or indirectly, solicit any Retained Employee or any other Employee who does not become a Transferred U.S. Employee or a Transferred Non-U.S. Employee (other than clerical or non-salaried employees). 

  

 Section 5.11. Non-Competition Covenant. 

  

 (a) For a period of three (3) years from the Closing Date, Honeywell and each Seller agrees that it will not, and each Seller will cause its Controlled Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, engage in the design, distribution, manufacture, marketing or sale of Business Products (a "Competing Business"); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 5.11(a)_ shall be deemed to limit in any way (i) the conduct of any Excluded Business, (ii) the activities of Honeywell or its Affiliates with respect to component elements of any of the items included within the definition of a Competing Business or (iii) the sale by Honeywell or its Affiliates of any parts or products to the extent such parts or products are sourced from a third party and incorporated into products other than Business Products that are manufactured or sold by businesses operated by Honeywell or its Affiliates or the manufacturing by Honeywell or its Affiliates of any parts or products to the extent such parts or products are manufactured for internal use by Honeywell or its Affiliates. The restrictions set forth in this  _Section 5.11(a)_ shall 

   not be construed to prohibit or restrict any Seller or any of its Controlled
Affiliates from acquiring any Person or business that engages in
any Competing Business; _provided_ that (i) the engagement in such
Competing Business does not constitute the principal part of the activities
of the Person or business to be acquired (based on total revenues expressed
in US dollars or calculated in U.S. dollars utilizing the relevant and then
applicable current foreign currency exchange rate, of all sales of such
Person or business during the consecutive four (4) full calendar quarters
immediately preceding the effective date of acquisition of such Person or
business), and (ii) if the Competing Business constitutes in excess of 20% of
the revenues of the Person or business acquired, Sellers will use their
commercially reasonable efforts to divest that portion of such Person or
business that engages in the Competing Business within 12 months after its
acquisition of the Competing Business and, prior to offering such portion to
any third party, shall first offer to and negotiate in good faith for a
period not to exceed 30 days with Purchaser or its Affiliates for the
acquisition of such portion by Purchaser or its Affiliates; _provided_
_further_ , that to the extent participation in such Competing Business
involves the acquisition of or the right to acquire any class of the voting
securities of such Competing Business, this covenant shall not be violated if
the percentage of such voting securities acquired or to be acquired does not
exceed 5% at the time of such acquisition.

  

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the prohibitions in  _Section 5.11(a)_ shall not apply to (i) any businesses or operations of Sellers or any of their Subsidiaries which are transferred to any third party after the date hereof, (ii) any Subsidiaries of any Seller the stock of which is transferred to any third party after the date hereof, (iii) any Affiliate of Sellers who becomes an Affiliate as a result of a change of control of Honeywell or (iv) any acquisition of securities by any Sellers pension trust or similar employee benefit plan investment vehicle, _provided_ , that any securities acquired shall be held for investment purposes only and such benefit plans comply with the ERISA requirements as to the independence of investment decisions. 

  

 (c) Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that the remedy at law for any breach, or threatened breach, of any of the provisions of this _Section 5.11_ may be inadequate and, accordingly, each Seller covenants and agrees that Purchaser shall, in addition to any other rights and remedies which Purchaser may have at Law, be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunctive relief, and to the remedy of specific performance with respect to any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this _Section 5.11_ , as may be available from any court of competent jurisdiction without the need to post bond or any other security. In addition, Sellers and Purchaser agree that the provisions of this _Section 5.11_ are fair and reasonable in light of Purchasers plans for the Business and are necessary to accomplish the full transfer of the goodwill and other intangible assets contemplated hereby. In the event that any of the provisions of this _Section 5.11_ shall be determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable for any reason whatsoever, then all other provisions of this _Section 5.11_ shall remain in full force and effect, and the parties hereto agree that such unenforceable provision may be modified by the court so as to comply with applicable Law and that the provisions of this _Section 5.11_ shall be amended in accordance with said modification. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding any provision of this _Section 5.11_ , the ownership and operation by Sellers of the Delayed Transfer Assets for the benefit of Purchaser and its Affiliates 

   from the Closing Date until the Delayed Closing Date in accordance with 
_Section 10.13_ shall not constitute a violation of _Section 5.11_.

  

 Section 5.12. Confidential Information. Each Seller hereby agrees that for a period of three (3) years from the Closing Date it shall hold, and shall cause its Affiliates to hold and maintain the confidentiality of all information relating to trade secrets, processes, patent applications, product development, price, customer and supplier lists, pricing and marketing plans, policies and strategies, details of client and consultant contracts, operations methods, product development techniques, business acquisition plans, new personnel acquisition plans and all other confidential or proprietary information concerning the Business or the Purchased Assets (the "Confidential Information"), and shall not use for the benefit of themselves or others, or disclose or cause or permit to be used or disclosed any of the Confidential Information for any reason or purpose whatsoever, except and to the extent any disclosure of Confidential Information is required by Law or appropriate court order and sufficient advance written notice thereof, if reasonably practicable, is provided to Purchaser to permit Purchaser to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy, _provided_ , _however_ , that the term "Confidential Information" shall not include information that (i) does not relate to the Business, (ii) relates to any Retained Asset, Retained Liability, any Excluded Business or, if applicable, the Retained Interests, (iii) becomes available to any Seller or any of its Affiliates after the Closing on a non-confidential basis from a source other than Purchaser, (iv) is independently developed by any Seller, any of its Affiliates or their respective employees under circumstances not involving a breach of this _Section 5.12_ , (v) is publicly disclosed pursuant to a lawful requirement or request from a Governmental Authority acting within its jurisdiction, or non-confidential disclosure is otherwise required by Law after any Seller or any of its Affiliates has exercised its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to such information, (vi) is publicly available as of the date of this Agreement, or which becomes publicly available after the date of this Agreement through no disclosure of any Seller or its Affiliates, (vii) disclosed on a confidential basis to Sellers attorneys, accountants, lenders and investment bankers, or (viii) disclosed or used by Sellers or any of their Affiliates to protect or enforce their rights or perform their obligations under this Agreement and the Transaction Documents, in connection with tax or other regulatory filings, litigation, financial reporting or other reasonable business purposes, or the conduct of their own businesses if, and to the extent, not otherwise prohibited by _Section 5.11_. 

  

 Section 5.13. Payments Received. Sellers and Purchaser agree that, after the Closing Date, they shall hold and shall promptly transfer and deliver to the other party, from time to time as and when received by it and in the currency received, any cash, checks with appropriate endorsements (using commercially reasonable efforts not to convert such checks into cash), or other property that they may receive after the date hereof which property belongs to the other party, including any payments of accounts receivable and insurance proceeds, and shall account to the other party for all such receipts. In the event of a dispute between the parties regarding any partys obligations under this _Section 5.13_ , the parties shall cooperate and act in good faith to promptly resolve such dispute and, in connection with such cooperation, allow each other reasonable access to the records of the other relating to such disputed item. 

  

 Section 5.14. Sellers Marks. Except as expressly set forth herein, each of Purchaser and each of its Subsidiaries and Affiliates and its and their respective directors, officers, 

   successors, assigns, agents, or representatives shall not register or own, or
attempt to register or own, and shall not directly or indirectly use, in any
fashion, including in signage, corporate letterhead, business cards, internet
websites, marketing material and the like, or seek to register or own, in
connection with any products or services anywhere in the world in any medium,
any Intellectual Property that includes, is identical to or is confusingly
similar to, any of the trademarks, service marks, domain names, trade names,
trade dress, trade styles or other indicia of origin that are characterized
as a Retained Asset or constitute Excluded Intellectual Property including
the HONEYWELL mark or any derivation therefrom or any corporate symbols or
logos incorporating "HONEYWELL" either alone or in combinations or any
goodwill represented thereby and pertaining thereto (collectively,
"Sellers Marks"), nor shall any of them challenge or assist any third
party in opposing the rights of Honeywell anywhere in the world in any
such Intellectual Property. Subject to the restrictions set forth herein,
Honeywell hereby extends to Purchaser effective as of the Closing Date, a
personal, nonexclusive, royalty-free transition license (i) for one (1) year
after the Closing Date to continue to use the Sellers Marks on existing
signage included in the Purchased Assets and in the Business Inventory as of
the Closing Date, (ii) for one (1) year after the Closing Date to continue to
use the Sellers Marks on marketing materials and other materials included in
Purchased Assets as of the Closing Date, and (iii) for five (5) years on
Business Inventory included in the Purchased Assets as of the Closing Date or
manufactured within 180 days after the Closing Date. No new use of Sellers
Marks shall be made by Purchaser and Purchaser shall in any event transition
away from all use of Sellers Marks as soon as is reasonably practicable
after the Closing Date. All use of Sellers Marks as permitted hereunder
shall inure solely to the benefit of Honeywell. Purchaser shall incur all
costs associated with re-branding of Business Inventory with signage, symbols
and marks not constituting Sellers Marks or Excluded Intellectual Property
during the term, and after the expiration, of the licenses granted under this
_Section 5.14_.

  

 Section 5.15. Tax Matters. 

  

 (a)  _Tax Indemnity_. From and after the Closing, Sellers shall indemnify Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities) and hold them harmless from and against all Retained Taxes and related Losses. Purchaser and Sellers agree that the Transferred Entities shall be deemed, for the purpose of Sellers and their Affiliates obligations under this _Section 5.15(a)_ , not to have the benefit of any net operating loss, net capital loss or other Tax attribute, credit or benefit that is attributable to, arises from or relates to any Post-Closing Tax Period. The indemnification made pursuant to this _Section 5.15(a)_ shall not be subject to the limitations on indemnification contained in _Section 9.4_. All payments made pursuant to this _Section 5.15(a)_ shall be deemed to be adjustments to the Purchase Price.

  

 (b)  _Tax Returns_. 

  

 (i) Sellers will prepare, or cause to be prepared, (A) all Tax Returns for Income Taxes of any Transferred Entity for any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, (B) all Tax Returns for Taxes (other than Income Taxes) of any Transferred Entity for any taxable period ending on or prior to December 31, 2010, (C) all Tax Returns for Taxes (other than Income Taxes) with respect to the Business (other than a Transferred Entity) or the Purchased Assets for any taxable period ending on or prior to December 31, 2010, (D) all Tax Returns for Taxes (other than Income Taxes) with respect to the Business (other than a 

   Transferred Entity) or the Purchased Assets required by Law to be filed by
Sellers or their Affiliates (other than the Transferred Entities), (E) all
Tax Returns of any Transferred Entity organized in the United Kingdom
relating to U.K. corporation tax for any Straddle Period and (F) any other
Tax Returns for Taxes (other than Income Taxes) of any Transferred Entity or
with respect to the Business or the Purchased Assets due (taking into account
all available extensions) prior to the Closing Date.

  

 (ii) Following the Closing, Purchaser will prepare, or cause to be prepared, all Straddle Period Tax Returns that are required to be filed by the Transferred Entities or in respect of the Business or the Purchased Assets other than any such Straddle Period Tax Return required to be prepared by Sellers pursuant to _Section 5.15(b)(i)_. 

  

 (iii) Each Tax Return described in this _Section 5.15(b)_ shall (to the extent it relates to the Business or the Purchased Assets) be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice, including as to Tax elections and Tax accounting methods, unless such inconsistency or change (A) would not have a detrimental effect on the other party or its Affiliates (including, in the case of Purchaser, the Transferred Entities) or (B) is otherwise required by applicable Law. Each Tax Return described in this _Section 5.15(b)_ shall be filed by the Person required by Law to file such Tax Return.

  

 (iv) Each party responsible for the preparation of a Tax Return for Income Taxes of a Transferred Entity under this _Section 5.15(b)_ shall submit such Tax Return to the other party (together with schedules, statements and, to the extent required by such other party, supporting documentation) at least forty (40) days prior to the due date (including extensions) of such Tax Return, _provided_  that (i) in the case of a Tax Return for Income Taxes of a Transferred Entity which is required to be prepared by Sellers under _Section 5.15(b)(i)_ , will be filed by Sellers or their Affiliates (other than a Transferred Entity), and is a consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return that includes entities other than Transferred Entities, Sellers shall not be required to submit to Purchaser such consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return but shall be required to submit a pro forma Tax Return of the Transferred Entity (together with supporting documentation and workpapers) and (ii) in the case of a Tax Return for Income Taxes of a Transferred Entity which is required to be prepared by Purchaser under _Section 5.15(b)(ii)_ , will be filed by Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities), and is a consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return that includes entities other than Transferred Entities, Purchaser shall not be required to submit to Sellers such consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return but shall be required to submit a pro forma Tax Return of the Transferred Entity (together with supporting documentation and workpapers). If such other party objects to any item on any such Tax Return, it shall, within thirty (30) days after delivery of such Tax Return, notify the party responsible for the preparation of such Tax Return in writing that it so objects, specifying with particularity any such item and stating the specific factual or legal basis for any such objection. If a notice of objection is duly delivered, the parties shall negotiate in good faith and use their reasonable best efforts to resolve such items. In the event of any disagreement that can not be resolved by the parties, such disagreement shall be resolved by an accounting firm of international reputation mutually agreeable to Sellers and Purchaser (the "Tax Accountant"), and any such determination by the Tax Accountant shall be final. The fees and expenses of the Tax Accountant shall be borne equally by Sellers and Purchaser. If the Tax Accountant does not resolve any differences between Sellers and Purchaser with respect to such 

   Tax Return at least five days prior to the due date therefor, such Tax Return
shall be filed as prepared by the party preparing such Tax Return and amended
to reflect the Tax Accountants resolution.

  

 (v) Sellers consolidated federal Income Tax Returns for the taxable period that includes the Closing Date shall be filed in accordance with Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(i) of the Treasury Regulations (determined using the closing of the books method), with no election under Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)(D) of the Treasury Regulations. Sellers shall make or cause to be made (and shall refrain from making or causing to be made, as applicable) Tax elections (including on a protective basis) so that no Transferred Entity shall suffer any reduction in tax basis or other attributes pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-36. Sellers shall not make (or permit to be made) any election under Section 108(i) of the Code (or any similar provision under state, local or foreign Law) that applies to any income or deduction realized by any Transferred Entity prior to the Closing.

  

 (vi) For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and payable for a taxable period that includes (but does not end on) a given date, the portion of such Tax which relates to the portion of such taxable period ending on such date shall (i) in the case of any real and personal property Taxes, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on such date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire taxable period, and (ii) in the case of any other Tax, be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant taxable period ended on such date. Any credits (including prepayments and deposits of Taxes) relating to a taxable period that begins on or before and ends after given date shall be taken into account as though the relevant taxable period ended on such date. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this _Section 5.15(b)(vi)_ , (i) in the case of any Income Tax attributable to the ownership of an entity that is taxed as a partnership or of any other entity that is treated as a "flow-through" entity for Tax purposes (excluding a "controlled foreign corporation" within the meaning of Section 957(a) of the Code), the portion of such Income Tax that relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount that would be payable if the relevant Tax period of such "flow-through" entity ended on the Closing Date and (ii) in the case of a Straddle Period Tax Return for any Transferred Entity organized in the United Kingdom, any tax deduction for the Section 75 Debt shall be deemed to be allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period of the relevant U.K. Transferred Entity or Entities. 

  

 (c)  _U.K. Group Tax Returns_. Where a Transferred Entity is, for U.K. Tax purposes, a member of a combined, unitary or affiliated group or in a fiscal unity with Honeywell, other Sellers or their Affiliates for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date, Honeywell, other Sellers or their Affiliates (i) shall, if required or permitted by applicable Law, use any of their losses, credits or other Tax attributes (in each case for U.K. Tax purposes) to reduce the U.K. Tax liability of the Transferred Entity (at no cost to Purchaser, the Transferred Entity or their Affiliates) for taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date and (ii) may, if required or permitted by applicable U.K. Law, use any losses, credits or other Tax attributes (in each case for U.K. Tax purposes) of the Transferred Entity arising in a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date to reduce their own U.K. Tax liability and shall not be required to compensate the 

   Transferred Entity, Purchaser of their Affiliates for any such losses,
credits or other Tax attributes. No inference shall be drawn from this
_Section 5.15(c)_  regarding any other Taxes.

  

 (d)  _Refunds_. If Purchaser or any Transferred Entity receives a refund (or a credit of Taxes paid in lieu of a refund) of Retained Taxes (other than to the extent such refund or credit results from the carryback of a Tax attribute arising from a Post-Closing Tax Period), Purchaser will pay to the applicable Seller, within thirty (30) days following the receipt of such refund (or the application of such credit), an amount equal to such refund (or credit) less Purchasers reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with obtaining such refund. If Honeywell or any of its Affiliates receives a refund (or a credit of Taxes paid in lieu of a refund) of Taxes of or with respect to the Business or any Transferred Entity that (i) are not Retained Taxes or (ii) are Retained Taxes but are attributable to the carryback of a Tax attribute arising from a Post-Closing Tax Period (but only if Purchaser is required by Law to (and unable to elect not to) carry back such Tax attribute in order to preserve such Tax attribute), Honeywell will pay to Purchaser, within thirty (30) days following the receipt of such refund (or the application of such credit), an amount equal to such refund (or credit) less its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with obtaining such refund. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 5.15(d)_ shall not apply to any amounts covered by  _Section 5.7_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event of any inconsistency between this _Section 5.15(d)_ and _Section 1.1(c)(xvi)_ or _Section 1.2(j)_ , this _Section 5.15(d)_ shall govern.

  

 (e)  _Settlement of Deficiencies and Adjustments_. 

  

 (i)  _In General_. If any Taxing Authority issues to Purchaser or a Transferred Entity a notice of deficiency or any other type of proposed adjustment of Taxes of the Transferred Entity that could give rise to Retained Taxes, Purchaser shall notify Sellers within thirty (30) Business Days of receipt of the notice of deficiency or other proposed adjustment, _provided_ that failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided pursuant to _Section 5.15(a)_ except to the extent Sellers shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. If any Taxing Authority issues to a Seller or any Affiliate of any Seller a notice of deficiency or any other type of proposed adjustment that could give rise to Taxes (other than Income Taxes of a Seller) of or with respect to the Business or any Purchased Asset, Seller shall notify Purchaser within thirty (30) Business Days of receipt of the notice of deficiency or other proposed adjustment. Except as otherwise provided herein, (A) Sellers (at their own expense) shall control any Tax Proceeding relating to the Business or any Purchased Asset to the extent such Tax Proceeding relates to (x) a Tax Return for Income Taxes of a Seller or (y) a Tax Return described in _Section 5.15(b)(i)(A)-(E)_ and (B) Purchaser (at its own expense) shall control any Tax Proceeding relating to the Business or any Purchased Asset that is not described in clause (A). 

  

 (ii)  _Participation Rights_. In the case of any Tax Proceeding relating to a Tax Return described in _Section 5.15(b)(i)_ or _(ii)_ , the party controlling such Tax Proceeding shall (to the extent related to the Business or any Purchased Asset) (A) notify the other party of significant developments with respect to such Tax Proceeding and keep the other party reasonably informed and consult with the other party as to the resolution of any issue that would materially affect such other party, (B) give to the other party a copy of any Tax adjustment proposed in writing with respect to such Tax Proceeding and copies of any other written 

   correspondence with the relevant Tax authority relating to such Tax
Proceeding, (C) not settle or compromise any issue without the consent of
such other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, (D)
otherwise permit the other party to participate in all aspects of such Tax
Proceeding, at such other partys own expense; _provide_ d that (w) this
_Section 5.15(e)(ii)_ (other than the last sentence hereof) shall not apply
to a Tax Proceeding relating to an Income Tax Return of any Seller (except to
the extent it includes items of a Transferred Entity), (x) _Section
5.15(e)(ii)(C)_ shall not apply to any settlement or compromise of a Tax
Proceeding relating to non-Income Taxes of a Seller if such Tax Proceeding
involves Taxes unrelated to the Business or the Purchased Assets and could
not give rise to any Taxes related to the Business or the Purchased Assets
(other than Retained Taxes), (y) if a Tax Proceeding (i) relates to non-
Income Taxes of a Seller, (ii) involves Taxes unrelated to the Business or
the Purchased Assets and (iii) could give rise to Taxes related to the
Business or the Purchased Assets (other than Retained Taxes), Sellers may
settle the Tax Proceeding without Purchasers consent and Sellers
shall indemnify Purchaser from any Taxes described in (iii) (which Taxes
shall be treated as Retained Taxes for purposes of the last sentence of this
_Section 5.15(e)_ ), and (z) if a Tax Proceeding (other than a Tax Proceeding
relating to a Tax Return described in _Section 5.15(b)(i)(E)_ ) relates
solely to Retained Taxes of a Transferred Entity or solely to Retained Taxes
(other than Income Taxes) of a Seller that relate solely to the Business or
the Purchased Assets, and if the Seller is able to settle the Tax Proceeding
for a specific amount, Purchaser may withhold its consent to such settlement
only if Purchaser agrees to take control of such Tax Proceeding at its
expenses and Purchaser agrees that Sellers indemnification obligation under
_Section 5.15(a)_  with respect to such Retained Taxes shall be limited to
the settlement amount for which such Seller could have settled such Retained
Taxes if Purchaser had not objected to the proposed settlement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any Tax Proceeding
described in clause (w), (x) (y) or (z), Sellers shall not enter into any
agreement with a Taxing Authority or otherwise take any action that would
legally bind Purchaser, any Transferred Entity or any of their Affiliates as
to (or that would have the effect of making a legally-binding admission as
to) any Tax that is not a Retained Tax without the consent of Purchaser,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

  

 (f)  _Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. Sellers and Purchaser shall provide each other with such cooperation and information as either of them reasonably may request of the other in filing any Tax Return, amended return or claim for refund, determining a liability for Taxes or a right to refund of Taxes, compiling any tax information packages or in conducting any audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes. Such cooperation and information shall include (i) providing copies of all relevant Tax Returns, together with accompanying schedules and related workpapers, documents relating to rulings or other determinations by taxing authorities and records concerning the ownership and tax basis of property, which either party may possess and (ii) to the extent reasonably feasible, compiling and submitting any tax data packages requested by the other party consistent with the past practices of, and within the time periods requested by, the requesting party. Each party shall make its employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide explanation of any documents or information provided hereunder. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the party requesting assistance hereunder shall reimburse the other for any reasonable out of pocket costs incurred in providing any return, document or other written information, and shall compensate the other for any reasonable costs (excluding wages and salaries) of making employees available, upon receipt of 

   reasonable documentation of such costs. Each party will retain and maintain
all returns, schedules and workpapers and all material records, computer
software and data maintained there under, or other documents relating
thereto, until the expiration of the statute of limitations (including
extensions) of the taxable years to which such returns and other documents
relate and, unless such returns and other documents are offered to the other
party, until the final determination of any payments which may be required in
respect of such years under this Agreement and to give the other party
reasonable notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such
book and records or computer software and data maintained there under, and,
if the other party so requests, shall allow the other party to take
possession of such books and records or computer software and data maintained
there under. Any information obtained under this _Section 5.15(f)_ shall be
kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with
the filing of returns or claims for refund or in conducting any audit or
other proceeding. Purchaser and Sellers further agree, upon request and at
the cost of the requesting party, to use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Authority or any other person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby).

  

 (g)  _Termination of Prior Tax Sharing Agreements and Powers of Attorney_. Effective as of the Closing Date, all Tax sharing agreements, whether or not written, to which any Seller or any Transferred Entity is party shall be terminated, and the Transferred Entity shall have no further rights or obligations thereunder, and the provisions of this Agreement shall govern the rights and obligations of Sellers, Purchaser and the Transferred Entities to make or receive payments with respect to Taxes or refunds of Taxes of the Transferred Entities. Any and all existing powers of attorney with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns to which any Transferred Entity is a party shall be terminated as of the Closing Date. Sellers shall execute (and shall cause the Transferred Entities to execute) any documents that may be reasonably required to evidence agreement with this _Section 5.15(g)_.

  

 (h)  _Code Section 338(g) Elections_. It is understood and agreed that Purchaser may _not_ make an election under Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to any of Holts South Africa, Holt New Zealand, Holt Japan, Prestone and Alsip Packaging, Inc. unless requested to do so pursuant to _Section 5.15(i)_ below or otherwise with the prior written consent of Honeywell, but Purchaser may make an election under Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to any other Transferred Entity without the consent of Honeywell.

  

 (i)  _Post-Closing Transactions._ If Holt Japan, Holts South Africa or Holt New Zealand makes a distribution governed by Section 301 of the Code during the period beginning after the Closing Date and ending on December 31, 2011 ("Short Period"), or if Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities) engages in a transaction which will result in Holt Japan, Holts South Africa or Holt New Zealand being treated for U.S. federal income Tax purposes as having made a distribution governed by Section 301 of the Code during the Short Period, then (i) Purchaser shall promptly give notice to Honeywell of such action (and any details available to Purchaser with respect thereto), _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser shall be under no obligation under this _Section 5.15(i)_ to make any computations regarding the amount of the earnings and profits of any entity and (ii) if Honeywell requests in a written notice given to Purchaser no later than the 15th day of the eighth month beginning after 

   the Closing Date, then Purchaser shall make an election under Section 338(g)
of the Code with respect to its acquisition of the stock of whichever of Holt
Japan, Holts South Africa or Holt New Zealand actually or was deemed to have
made a distribution governed by Section 301 of the Code.

  

 Section 5.16. Bulk Sales Laws. Sellers and Purchaser each hereby waive compliance by Honeywell with the provisions of the "bulk sales," "bulk transfer" or similar Laws of any state.

  

 Section 5.17. Notice of Developments. Prior to the Closing, Sellers and Purchaser shall promptly notify each other in writing of all events, circumstances, facts and occurrences arising subsequent to the date of this Agreement which would be reasonably likely to result in any condition in _Article VI_ or _Article VII_ becoming incapable of being satisfied by such party.

  

 Section 5.18. Conduct of Incidents Subject to Parent Insurances. Purchaser acknowledges that coverage for the Business under the insurance policies set forth on _Schedule 5.18_ (the "Parent Insurances"), will cease as of the Closing Date, and that neither the Sellers nor any of their Affiliates will purchase any "tail" policy or other additional or substitute coverage for the benefit of Purchaser relating to the Parent Insurances or the Business applicable in any period after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding this provision, Honeywell and the Sellers agree that Honeywell, or one of its Affiliates, shall, with respect to any incident from which an Assumed Liability arises or that relates to any damage, impairment or loss of a Purchased Asset or an asset of Transferred Entity, that is potentially covered by a Parent Insurance policy in effect prior to the Closing Date, (i) report such incident to the appropriate insurer as promptly as practicable and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Parent Insurance policy after such incident is reported to a member of Honeywells Corporate Risk Management group, (ii) include Purchaser on material correspondence and possible litigation proceedings relating to such incident and (iii) instruct that such proceeds are paid directly to the injured party in settlement of any claims relating to such incident, rather than to Honeywell or its Affiliates, or, if such proceeds are received by Honeywell or any of its Affiliates, pay such proceeds over to Purchaser; _provided_ that Purchaser shall notify Honeywell Corporate Risk Management group promptly of any potential claim, shall cooperate in the investigation and pursuit of any claim, shall have the right to effectively associate in the pursuit of any claim, including but not limited to the ability to withhold its consent to any proposed claim settlement (such consent not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed) and shall bear all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Sellers or its Affiliates in connection with the foregoing and _provided_ _further_ that the Sellers and their Affiliates shall be obligated to use only commercially reasonable efforts to pursue any claims that are potentially covered by available Parent Insurance and shall not, for the avoidance of doubt, have any obligation to commence any litigation with respect to any matter potentially covered by any Parent Insurance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Honeywell nor any Seller makes any representation or warranty as to whether any recovery under any Parent Insurance will be received with respect to any particular incident arising before or after the Closing Date. Purchaser agrees that no Seller shall have any liability under this Agreement or otherwise for any Liabilities for failure by Purchaser to report in a timely manner or for delays in reporting by Purchaser or its Affiliates that void any available coverage under Parent Insurance. 

   Section 5.19. Replacement Letters of Credit; Replacement Guarantees. Purchaser covenants and agrees that it shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain new letters of credit to substitute for and replace the letters of credit extended by Sellers or their Affiliates (other than a Transferred Entity) on behalf of a Transferred Entity or the Business ("Sellers Letters of Credit") effective as of the Closing Date that have been identified to Purchaser for substitution or replacement prior to the date hereof (including the Sellers Letters of Credit set forth on _Schedule 5.19_ ), or that have been entered into in the ordinary course of business after the date hereof, it being the intention and understanding of Purchaser and Sellers that such Sellers Letters of Credit shall, to the extent agreed by the beneficiaries thereof, be canceled and terminated as of the Closing Date, and, to the extent agreed by the beneficiaries thereof, Sellers and their Affiliates shall have no further obligation or liability (contingent or otherwise) under such Sellers Letters of Credit from and after the Closing Date. Purchaser further covenants and agrees that it shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the release of the guarantees extended by a Seller or its Affiliates (other than a Transferred Entity) on behalf of a Transferred Entity or the Business ("Sellers Guaranties") effective as of the Closing Date that have been identified to Purchaser for release prior to the date hereof (including the Sellers Guarantees set forth on _Schedule 5.19_ ) or that have been entered into in the ordinary course of business after the date hereof. Following the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold Sellers and the Subsidiaries and Affiliates that are a party to such Sellers Letter of Credit or Sellers Guaranty harmless from any and all payments required to be made under, and costs and expenses incurred in connection with, such Sellers Letter of Credit or Sellers Guaranty. For purposes hereof, "commercially reasonable efforts" shall include Purchasers (i) obtaining a letter of credit for which the relevant Seller is a beneficiary (on terms identical to the corresponding Sellers Letter of Credit) if the beneficiaries of such Sellers Letter of Credit do not agree to a substitution or replacement and (ii) extending a guarantee of which the relevant Seller is a beneficiary (on terms identical to the corresponding Seller Guaranty) if the beneficiaries of such Seller Guaranty do not agree to a release of such Seller or applicable Affiliate.

  

 Section 5.20. Affiliate Agreements. Subject to _Section 5.9_ , prior to the Closing Date, Sellers and their Affiliates will cause all Contracts or other transactions between Sellers and their Affiliates (other than the Transferred Entities), on the one hand, and the Transferred Entities, on the other, as set forth on _Section 3.20_ of the Disclosure Schedule or with respect to which there could be further or continuing Liability or obligation on the part of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities after the Closing) to be settled or terminated prior to the Closing without any further or continuing Liability on the part of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including Liability arising from such termination) so that no Related Party Transaction remains in effect.

  

 Section 5.21. Exclusivity. Each Seller and each of its respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates agrees that from the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing Date and the date that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_ , each such Person shall not, and shall instruct its agents, representatives and Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly (a) Make Available any non-public information to any third party (including via access to any data room or other records), other than Purchaser, or their agents, representatives and Affiliates with respect to the Business in connection with any Competing Business Transaction, (b) solicit, facilitate, initiate, respond to or encourage proposals, offers or inquiries from a third party, other than Purchaser, with respect to any Competing Business Transaction, (c) solicit, facilitate, initiate, respond to or 

   participate in any negotiations or discussions with any third party, other
than Purchaser, or its agents, representatives and Affiliates with respect to
any Competing Business Transaction, or (d) enter into a letter of intent or
other agreement or arrangement with a third party, other than Purchaser, with
respect to any Competing Business Transaction. Honeywell shall immediately
upon execution hereof terminate any and all discussions, negotiations or
communications involving itself, a Seller or any of their respective
agents, representatives, Subsidiaries and Affiliates regarding any Competing
Business Transaction and immediately request the return or destruction of
any confidential or proprietary information regarding the Business, a Seller
or its Subsidiaries previously Made Available to any third party in
connection with discussions or the evaluation of any Competing Business
Transaction.

  

 Section 5.22. Financing. Rank Group has and will have at the Closing, cash on hand and/or undrawn amounts available under existing credit facilities necessary to allow Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and deliver the Purchase Price at the Closing. Rank Group shall provide such amount in immediately available funds to Purchaser at the Closing to the extent Purchaser does not as of such time have immediately available funds available from other sources to be used to deliver the Purchase Price. Prior to the Closing, Rank Group will keep Honeywell reasonably informed of its plans to obtain the Debt Financing and the progress of the financing efforts. Rank Group has Made Available to Honeywell true and complete copies of its unaudited, consolidated financial statements for the period ended June 30, 2010, which statements give a true and fair view of the financial position and performance of Rank Group and its Subsidiaries as of the date thereof and for the period covered thereby, in accordance with New Zealand GAAP, consistently applied.

 (d) by Purchaser, on the one hand, or Honeywell, on the other, if there has been a material breach on the part of Honeywell or any Seller, on the one hand, or Purchaser, on the other, of the representations and warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement (provided that such breach is not the result of any breach of any covenant, representation or warranty of any other party to this Agreement), which breach has not been cured within thirty (30) days following receipt of written notice of such breach, and such breach renders the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ or _Article VII_ , as the case may be, incapable of being satisfied.

  

 Section 8.2. Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall become null and void and of no further force and effect, and none of the parties hereto (nor their respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors, shareholders, officers, employees, agents, consultants, attorneys in fact or other representatives) shall have any liability in respect of such termination; _provided_ , _however_ , that no termination of this Agreement shall relieve any party from liability for any willful breach of this Agreement prior to such termination. The provisions of this _Section 8.2_ and _Article VIII_ shall survive any termination of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, "willful breach" means a material breach that (a) is a consequence of an act undertaken or omitted by a party with the knowledge (actual or constructive) that the taking or omitting of such act would, or would be reasonably expected to, cause a breach of this Agreement and (b) would prevent or materially delay the Closing or give another party to this Agreement the right not to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby. 

  

ARTICLE IX

  

SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION

  

 Section 9.1. Survival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements. The representations and warranties of the parties contained in _Articles III_ and _IV_ , shall, subject to the proviso to this sentence, terminate on the date that is 18 months after the Closing Date, _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the representations and warranties in _Sections 3.1_, _3.2_ , _3.3_  and _3.19_ , and in Section _4.1_ , _4.2_ and _4.7_ , shall survive indefinitely and (ii) the representations and warranties in _Section 3.7_ shall survive until thirty (30) days following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitation in question (the representations of Honeywell described in clause (i), the "Seller Fundamental Representations and Warranties" and each a "Seller Fundamental Representation and Warranty"). All covenants and agreements contained herein which by their terms are required to be performed or complied with prior to the Closing (each, a "Pre-Closing Covenant") shall survive the Closing Date for a period of twelve (12) months from the Closing Date, and all other respective covenants and agreements of contained herein, as well as Pre-Closing Covenants to the extent they contemplate performance following the Closing, shall survive the Closing and remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, _provided_ , that all covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement relating to Taxes shall survive the 

   Closing and remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.
The period of time a representation or warranty or covenant or
agreement survives the Closing pursuant to this _Section 9.1_ shall be the
"Survival Period" with respect to such representation or warranty or
covenant or agreement. In the event notice of any claim for indemnification
under this _Article IX_ shall have been given within the applicable Survival
Period and such claim has not been finally resolved by the expiration of such
Survival Period, the representations or warranties or covenants or agreements
that are the subject of such claim shall survive, but only to the extent and,
if known, in the amount of, such claim, until such claim is finally resolved.

  

 Section 9.2. Indemnification. Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations set forth in this _Article IX_, from and after the Closing Date:

  

 (a) Honeywell shall, indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, members, partners, managers, employees, agents, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Purchaser Indemnified Parties") from and against any Losses, whether or not arising from a third party claim, arising out of or in connection with (i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Sellers in _Article III_ as of the date of the Agreement or the breach as of the Closing Date of the representations and warranties of Honeywell in _Sections 3.1_ , _3.2_ ,  _3.3_ , _3.4_ , _3.10_ (other than in the representations in clauses _(a)(ii)_ and _(c)(iv)_ ), the last sentence of Section _3.15_ ,  _3.16_ and _3.19_ and (ii) any failure to perform any covenant or agreement of Sellers set forth in this Agreement, (iii) the Retained Liabilities, or (iv) the Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities.

  

 (b) Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Honeywell, each Seller and their Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, members, partners, managers, employees, agents, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties") from and against any Losses, whether or not arising from a third party claim, arising out of (i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Purchaser in _Article IV_ as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date, (ii) any failure to perform any covenant or agreement of Purchaser set forth in this Agreement or (iii) the Assumed Liabilities; _provided_ , that this Section 9.2(b) shall not limit Purchasers right to make a claim under _Section 9.2(a)_. 

  

 Section 9.3. Indemnification Procedures.

  

 (a) In order for a party (the "Indemnified Party") to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under this _Article IX_ in respect of a claim made against the Indemnified Party by any Person who is not a party to this Agreement (a "Third-Party Claim"), such Indemnified Party must notify the indemnifying party hereunder (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing of the Third-Party Claim promptly following receipt by such Indemnified Party of notice of the Third-Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly following the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third-Party Claim, other than those notices and documents separately addressed to the Indemnifying Party.

   (b) The Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third-Party Claim which relates to any Losses indemnifiable hereunder and to select counsel of its choice. If the Indemnifying Party (i) does not within 20 business days of its receipt of notice of a Third-Party Claim pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)_ elect to defend against or negotiate any Third-Party Claim which relates to any Losses indemnifiable hereunder or (ii) after assuming such control fails to diligently defend against such Third-Party Claim in good faith, then the applicable Indemnified Party may defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Third-Party Claim with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third-Party Claim, the applicable Indemnified Party may participate, at its own expense, in the defense of such Third-Party Claim; provided that if there exists or is reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest that would make it inappropriate in the judgment of the Indemnified Party in its reasonable discretion for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain one counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party at the expense of the Indemnifying Party.

  

 (c) If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall (and shall cause the applicable Indemnified Parties to) cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof and make available to the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnified Partys possession or under the Indemnified Partys control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. Similarly, if the Indemnified Party is defending or prosecuting such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall (and shall cause the applicable Indemnified Parties to) cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof and make available to the Indemnified Party, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, all such witnesses, records, materials and information in the Indemnifying Partys possession or under the Indemnifying Partys control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third-Party Claim, no such Third Party-Claim may be settled, compromised or discharged by the Indemnifying Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), unless any such settlement, compromise or discharge (i) obligates the Indemnifying Party (or its Affiliates) to pay the full amount of the Loss in connection with such Third-Party Claim, (ii) imposes no injunctive or other equitable relief against any Indemnified Party, and (iii) unconditionally releases all Indemnified Parties from all further liability in respect of such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim or is not permitted to assume such defense, the applicable Indemnified Parties shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third-Party Claim without the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  

 (d) Any Third Party Claim relating to Taxes shall be governed by _Section 5.15(e)_. 

  

 (e) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any Indemnifying Party under this _Article IX_ that does not involve a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim to the Indemnifying Party promptly following a management level employee, with supervisory responsibility for the subject matter 

   of the claim, of the Indemnified Party (or its Subsidiaries) acquiring actual
knowledge of the same. The failure by any Indemnified Party to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from
any liability that it may have to such Indemnified Party under this _Article
IX_, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has been actually
prejudiced by such failure.

  

 (f) The Indemnified Party shall take, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to take, all reasonable steps to mitigate or otherwise minimize any Losses that form the basis of a claim for indemnification under this _Article IX_.

  

 (g) For the avoidance of doubt, the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party with respect to any claim (other than any claim involving a De Minimis Loss) as to which indemnification is sought hereunder even though the amount thereof plus the amount of other claims previously notified by the Indemnified Party in aggregate is less than the Threshold Amount.

  

 Section 9.4. Indemnification Limitations.

  

 (a) In no event shall Honeywell be liable for indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ and _Section 9.2(a)(iv)_ unless and until the aggregate amount of all Losses with respect to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ and _Section 9.2(a)(iv)_  that are imposed on or incurred by Purchaser exceeds 1% of the Purchase Price (the "Threshold Amount"), in which case Purchaser shall be entitled to indemnification for all Losses in excess of the Threshold Amount; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the limitation set forth in this sentence shall not apply with respect to any claim for indemnification in respect of any breach of a Seller Fundamental Representation and Warranty, and _provided_ _further_  that in no event shall Honeywell be liable for indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ with respect to breaches of Seller Fundamental Representations and Warranties for any Losses in excess of the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Honeywell shall not (x) be required to make payments for indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ and _Section 9.2(a)(iv)_ in an aggregate amount in excess of 11.25% of the Purchase Price or (y) be liable for indemnification with respect to any Loss by an Indemnified Party of less than $125,000 or, with respect to a claim under _Section 3.11_  or _Section 9.2(a)(iv)_ , $150,000, for each individual matter for which a claim is made hereunder (each, a "De Minimis Loss") and all such Losses shall be disregarded and shall not be aggregated for purposes of the Threshold Amount; _provided_ , _however_ , that the limitations set forth in clauses (x) and (y) of this sentence shall not apply with respect to any claim for indemnification in respect of any Seller Fundamental Representation and Warranty.

  

 (b) In calculating amounts payable to an Indemnified Party hereunder, the amount of any indemnified Losses shall be determined without duplication of any other Loss for which an indemnification claim has been made under any other representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, shall be determined without giving effect to any "materiality" (including the word "material") or "Business Material Adverse Effect" limitations or qualifications set forth in any representations and warranties of the parties made in this Agreement (other than clause (ii) of _Section 3.6(a)_ ) (but for the avoidance of doubt such materiality and Business Material Adverse Effect qualifications shall be considered for purposes of determining whether a breach of a representation has occurred) and shall be computed net of (i) amounts actually recovered by 

   the Indemnified Party under indemnification agreements or arrangements with
third parties or under any insurance policy with respect to such
Losses (each, a "Collateral Source"), (ii) any actual prior recovery by the
Indemnified Party from any Person with respect to such Losses and (iii) any
reserves set forth in the Closing Statement specifically for such Loss. In
the event of any indemnification claim paid, the Indemnifying Party may, in
its sole discretion, require any Indemnified Party to grant to such
Indemnifying Party an assignment of the right of such Indemnified Party to
assert a claim against any Collateral Source. If the amount to be netted
hereunder from any payment required under _Article IX_ is determined after
payment of any amount otherwise required to be paid to an Indemnified Party
under this _Article IX_, the Indemnified Party shall repay to the
Indemnifying Party, promptly after such determination, any amount that the
Indemnifying Party would not have had to pay pursuant to this _Article
IX_ had such determination been made at the time of such payment.

  

 (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement other than _Section 5.15(a)_ , in no event shall Honeywell or any Seller be liable for (i) any punitive damages or any damages that are not reasonably foreseeable or that are speculative or remote, unless, in each case, such damages are recovered by a third party in a Third Party Claim pursuant to an order entered against a Purchaser Indemnified Party or in a settlement agreement to which a Purchaser Indemnified Party is a party or (ii) any Losses to the extent arising from any Environmental Investigation voluntarily conducted by the Purchaser or any Transferred Entity or any third party acting on their behalf after the Closing, including Environmental Investigations voluntarily conducted in connection with operational changes or incident to construction activities, unless an Environmental Investigation is required by a Governmental Authority, required pursuant to applicable Environmental Laws, or conducted in connection with an Environmental Claim, _provided_ , that Sellers shall not be liable for Losses to the extent resulting from Environmental Investigations conducted in connection with closure activities, except for Environmental Investigations performed in connection with or as a result of closure activities at the Fostoria, Ohio or Greenville, Ohio facilities. 

  

 (d) Purchaser acknowledges that the consents to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement identified on _Section 3.4_ of the Disclosure Schedule may be required from parties to Contracts, leases, licenses or other agreements to which Honeywell, any Seller or any Transferred Entity is a party (including the Material Contracts) and such consents have not been obtained and may not be obtained. Purchaser agrees that neither Honeywell nor any Seller shall have any liability (other than, if breached, under _Sections 3.4_ , _5.1_ , or _5.5(b)_ ) whatsoever to Purchaser (and Purchaser shall not be entitled to assert any claims except as aforesaid) arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any consents that may have been or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or, because of the default, acceleration or termination of or loss of right under any such Contract, lease, license or other agreement as a result thereof. Purchaser further agrees that no representation, warranty or covenant of the Sellers contained herein (other than, if breached, _Sections 3.4_ , _5.1_ , or _5.5(b)_ ) shall be breached or deemed breached and (except as aforesaid) no condition of Purchaser shall be deemed not to be satisfied as a result of the failure to obtain any consent or as a result of any such default, acceleration or termination or loss of right or any lawsuit, action, claim, proceeding or investigation commenced or threatened by or on behalf of any Person arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any consent or any such default, acceleration or termination or loss of right.

   (e) Except with respect to fraud, notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement to the contrary, after the Closing, indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties from and after the Closing Date with respect to any and all claims arising out of or in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including in respect of any misrepresentation or breach of any warranty, covenant or other provision contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto. Without limiting the generality or effect of the foregoing, as a material inducement to the other parties hereto entering into this Agreement, each party hereto hereby waives, from and after the Closing, any claim or cause of action, known and unknown, foreseen and unforeseen, which it or any of its Affiliates may have against the other parties hereto (including rights to indemnification or contribution, or any other rights or remedies), including under the common law or federal or state securities Laws, trade regulation Laws or other Laws (including any relating to Tax, environmental, real estate or employee matters), by reason of this Agreement, the events giving rise to this Agreement and the transactions provided for herein or contemplated hereby or thereby, except for claims or causes of action brought under and subject to the terms and conditions of the provisions contained in this Agreement and fraud. Nothing contained in this _Section 9.4(e)_ shall in any manner limit the representations of the parties made in  _Sections 3.23_ and _4.7_.

  

 (f) All payments made pursuant to this _Article IX_ or any other indemnification provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to be adjustments to the Purchase Price.

  

 (g) The indemnity set forth in _Section 9.2(a)(iv)_ (Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities) shall expire eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date. In connection with any indemnification claim made pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(iv)_ or _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ with respect to breaches of the representations and warranties contained in _Section 3.11_ (Environmental Matters), Purchaser shall have the right to (i) obtain any tests and studies reasonably necessary to define or delineate the extent of any contamination or noncompliance with Environmental Laws, (ii) prepare the work plan for any Remedial Action or correction of noncompliance, and (iii) conduct or direct any such Remedial Action or correction of noncompliance. Purchaser shall notify the Sellers prior to conducting any Remedial Action, promptly provide the Sellers with copies of all environmental, engineering or other studies and data prepared by or collected by Purchaser or its agents, consult with the Sellers regarding the nature, extent and anticipated cost of such Remedial Action, provide the Sellers with reasonable advance notice of and opportunity to attend meetings with the applicable Governmental Authorities, and provide the Sellers with copies of all correspondence with such Governmental Authorities. In connection with any indemnification claim made pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_ (Retained Liabilities) with respect to Liabilities identified in _Sections 1.4(h)_ and _(i)_ , the Sellers shall have the right to (i) obtain any tests and studies reasonably necessary to define or delineate the extent of any contamination or noncompliance with Environmental Laws, (ii) prepare the work plan for any Remedial Action or correction of noncompliance, (iii) conduct or direct any such Remedial Action or correction of noncompliance, and (iv) record and implement Engineering and Institutional Controls as necessary to meet applicable industrial standards regarding the presence of Materials of Environmental Concern, so long as such Engineering and Institutional Controls are acceptable to the Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the Remedial Action and do not unreasonably interfere with the use of any property for commercial or industrial purposes. The Sellers shall

   notify Purchaser prior to conducting any Remedial Action, promptly provide
Purchaser with copies of all environmental, engineering or other studies and
data prepared by or collected by the Sellers or their agents, consult with
Purchaser regarding the nature, extent and anticipated cost of such Remedial
Action, provide Purchaser with reasonable advance notice of and opportunity
to attend meetings with the applicable Governmental Authorities, and provide
Purchaser with copies of all correspondence with such
Governmental Authorities. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 9.4(g)_
to the contrary, neither the Sellers nor their agents shall take any action
that unreasonably interferes with the operations of the Business or the
Purchased Assets. The Sellers shall only be liable for Remedial Action
associated with Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities and with Retained
Liabilities identified in _Sections 1.4(h)_ and _(i)_ to the extent that
Losses (A) are required to bring the Business or any Purchased Assets into
compliance with applicable Environmental Laws, (B) are necessary to respond
to the presence of Materials of Environmental Concern exceeding applicable
industrial standards, (C) meet the requirements of a Governmental Authority
or applicable Environmental Laws, or (D) utilize the remedial criteria that
are least stringent as required by applicable Environmental Law and
acceptable to the Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the Remedial
Action.

  

 (h) In connection with any indemnification claim pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_  with respect to Liabilities identified in _Section 1.4(i)_ in connection with the obligation to conduct Remedial Action pursuant to ISRA, (A) Sellers and the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall comply with all ISRA requirements, as amended by the Site Remediation Reform Act, N.J.S.A. 58:10C-1 et seq. ("SRRA"), and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Sellers shall be entitled to engage a Licensed Site Remediation Professional as defined at N.J.A.C. 7:26C-1.3 ("LSRP") and obtain a Response Action Outcome, as defined in the SRRA, applicable to the Property pursuant to ISRA (collectively, "RAO") or, if Sellers do not obtain the RAO prior to Closing, Sellers shall obtain or otherwise complete and duly file on or before Closing (i) a Remediation Certification in accordance with N.J.A.C. 7:26B-4.3, or (ii) such other authorization which permits Sellers to complete this transaction (collectively, a "Closing Approval") provided, in each case, such Closing Approval does not create any liability or obligation on the part of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties other than the duty to cooperate. The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall grant Sellers, their agents and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection ("NJDEP") a non-exclusive license to enter the Purchased Owned Real Property in Freehold, New Jersey, following Closing, upon reasonable notice, in order to conduct any investigation, sampling or remediation necessary in order to secure the RAO. Sellers, in Sellers discretion, may choose any remedial alternative which will result in an RAO, including the least costly and most restrictive alternative so long as such remedial alternative is acceptable to the NJDEP and does not unreasonably limit use of the Purchased Owned Real Property in Freehold, New Jersey. Seller shall be entitled to rely upon the use of Engineering and Institutional Controls, including deed notices, caps, and/or clean fill over contaminated soil, in connection with any such remediation as permitted by applicable statutes and regulations, provided, however, any such Engineering and Institutional Controls shall not unreasonably interfere with the use of such property for commercial or industrial purposes. Seller shall post, maintain, and from time-to-time adjust the amount of, financial assurances required pursuant to ISRA, if any. The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall assume all future obligations related to the Engineering and Institutional Controls and any maintenance requirements required under ISRA, it being understood that the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall have no obligation to

   conduct any investigation, remediation or corrective action required under
ISRA, the SRRA, the Technical Requirements for Site Remediation,
N.J.A.C. 7:26E, the Administrative Requirements for the Remediation of
Contaminated Sites, N.J.A.C. 7:26C, and/or other applicable statute or
regulation.

  

 (i) In connection with any indemnification claim pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_  with respect to Liabilities identified in _Section 1.4(i)_ in connection with the obligation to conduct any Environmental Investigation or Remedial Action pursuant to Connecticut General Statutes ("C.G.S.") § 22a-134 et. seq., as amended by Public Act 01-204) ("Connecticut Property Transfer Law"), (A) Sellers and the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall comply with all Connecticut Property Transfer Law requirements, and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Sellers in their discretion shall be entitled to determine whether the Business Leased Real Properties located in Danbury, Connecticut ("Danbury Facilities") are subject to the Connecticut Property Transfer Law. Should Sellers determine that the Danbury Facilities are subject to the Connecticut Property Transfer Law, Sellers shall file an Environmental Conditions Assessment Form, as defined at C.G.S. §22a-134(17) and shall in their discretion determine whether to file a Connecticut Property Transfer Program Form I, II, III, or IV, as defined at C.G.S. §22a-134(10), (11), (12), and (13) respectively, with the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection ("CTDEP"). Sellers shall, if necessary, be entitled to engage a Licensed Environmental Professional ("LEP") as defined at C.G.S. § 22a-134(16) in order to file either a Form II, Form III, or Form IV. Should Sellers determine that a Form I or Form II filing is appropriate, Sellers shall notify Purchaser Indemnified Parties of the filing as required under the Connecticut Property Transfer Law. Should CTDEP fail to approve of Sellers filing of either a Form I or Form II, Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall grant Sellers, their agents and CTDEP a non-exclusive license to enter the Danbury Facilities following Closing, upon reasonable notice, in order to conduct any investigation, sampling, or remediation necessary in order to secure CTDEP approval of the Form I or Form II filing. Should Sellers determine that either a Form III or Form IV filing is appropriate, Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall grant Sellers, their agents and CTDEP a non-exclusive license to enter the Danbury Facilities following Closing, upon reasonable notice, in order to conduct any investigation, sampling, or remediation necessary or desirable in order to secure CTDEP approval that Remedial Actions specified in the Form III or Form IV filing, or Remedial Actions required by CTDEP in order for Sellers to meet all Connecticut Property Transfer Law and CTDEP requirements subsequent to the Form III or Form IV filing. Sellers, in Sellers discretion, may choose any remedial alternative which will result in CTDEP approval of a Form I, Form II, Form III, or Form IV filing, including the least costly and most restrictive alternative, as long as such remedial alternative is acceptable to the CTDEP and does not unreasonably limit use of the Danbury Facility for commercial or industrial purposes. Sellers shall be entitled to rely upon the use of Engineering and Institutional Controls, including deed notices, caps, and/or clean fill over contaminated soil, in connection with any such remediation as permitted by applicable statutes and regulations, _provided_ , _however_ , any such remedial alternative and Engineering and Institutional Controls shall not unreasonably interfere with the ability of Purchaser Indemnified Parties to utilize the Danbury Facilities for commercial or industrial purposes; and (B) the Purchaser Indemnified Parties hereby agree to comply with all restrictions and requirements as contained in any permitted Engineering and Institutional Controls utilized by Sellers in connection with Sellerss efforts to obtain CTDEP approval of Form I, Form II, Form III, or

   Form IV filings (which shall constitute Permitted Encumbrances).
The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall assume all future obligations related
to the Engineering and Institutional Controls and any maintenance,
monitoring, or reporting requirements required under the Connecticut Property
Transfer Law and/or other applicable regulation, it being understood that the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall have no obligation to conduct any
investigation, remediation, or corrective action required under the
Connecticut Property Transfer Law and/or other applicable statute or
regulation.

  

 (j) Notwithstanding any other provision of _Section 9.4_ , in no event shall Honeywell be liable for any Losses associated with Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities or any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in _Section 3.11_ (Environmental Matters) to the extent such Loss or Losses (i) arise from or are exacerbated by any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties after Closing, in connection with (A) any Management of any Materials of Environmental Concern by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties; (B) failure by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties following the Closing to comply with any Environmental Law; and (C) the negligent actions of any Purchaser Indemnified Parties or (ii) relate to a Remedial Action that (x) is not required by a Governmental Authority or pursuant to any Environmental Law or (y) is required by a cleanup or remediation standard other than an industrial standard, unless such other cleanup or remediation standard is required by the Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the Remedial Action.

  

 Section 9.5. No Rights of Offset. Purchaser waives and relinquishes any and all rights to set off or to apply any monies held or indebtedness or other obligations now or hereafter owing by Purchaser to Sellers or any of their Affiliates against any obligations of Sellers or any of their Affiliates now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument, certificate or similar document required to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement.
