2\. _Purchase and Sale; Purchase Price_. At the Closing, and upon the terms
and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the Seller agrees to sell and
convey to the Buyer all of its Properties, and the Buyer agrees to purchase,
accept and pay for the Properties and to assume all of the Assumed
Obligations. In consideration for the sale of the Properties, the Buyer will
pay to the Seller the purchase price of FIVE BILLION THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY-
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ($5,375,000,000.00) (the "Purchase Price", subject to
adjustments as provided in this Agreement) in immediately available funds at
Closing (pursuant to wire transfer instructions designated in advance by the
Seller to the Buyer in writing). Within two (2) Business Days after the
Execution Date, the Buyer will pay to the Seller an earnest money deposit
equal to five percent (5%) of the unadjusted Purchase Price (the "Deposit").
At Closing, the Deposit will be applied against the Purchase Price payable to
the Seller in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. The Purchase
Price will be adjusted (without duplication) as set forth below in this
Section 2.



     | 2.1. |

_Title and Environmental Defects_. The Purchase Price will be (a) decreased
only for those uncured Title Defects and uncured Environmental Defects that
are in excess of the respective Individual Defect Thresholds and the Aggregate
Defect Threshold and (b) increased for Title Benefits, in each case, in
accordance with this Section 2.1. The Buyer may deliver to the Seller, on or
before the Defect Notice Date, one or more written notices specifying each
defect associated with the Sellers Properties that the Buyer asserts
constitutes a Title Defect or an Environmental Defect, a specific description
of each such Title Defect or Environmental Defect and the basis for such
assertion under the terms of this Agreement, the amount of the adjustment to
the Purchase Price that the Buyer asserts based on such Title Defect or
Environmental Defect and its method of calculating such adjustment, together
with all data and information reasonably necessary for the Seller to verify
the existence of the alleged Title Defect or

     |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT |  | 19 |  | Notice Date" means (i) 5:00 p.m. Central Time on the one hundred twentieth
(120th) day following the Closing Date in the case of Title Defects and (ii)
5:00 p.m. Central Time on the fifth (5th) Business Day prior to the Closing
Date in the case of Environmental Defects. Any matters that may otherwise
constitute Title Defects or Environmental Defects, but of which the Seller has
not been notified by the Buyer in writing by the respective Defect Notice
Date, shall be deemed to have been waived by the Buyer for all purposes;
provided, however, that no failure to provide any such notice by the
respective Defect Notice Date shall be deemed a waiver of any right or remedy
under the Assignment with respect to any breach of the special warranty of
title to be given by the Seller in the Assignment. All adjustments to the
Purchase Price based on Title Defects will be based on the Allocated Values
attributable to the affected Properties. Upon timely delivery of a Defect
Notice under this Section 2.1, the Buyer and the Seller will in good faith
negotiate the validity of the claim and the amount of any adjustment to the
Purchase Price using the following criteria: 
---|--- 
 



     | 2.1.1 | No single Title Defect or Title Benefit shall be taken
into account unless the value of such defect or benefit is determined to be
more than (i) Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) with respect to any Well
or (ii) Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000) with respect to any Real Property
Interest, and no single Environmental Defect shall be taken into account
unless the value of such defect is determined to be more than Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($50,000) (each an "Individual Defect Threshold"). 
---|---|--- 



     | 2.1.2 | No adjustment will be made to the Purchase Price for
either uncured Title Defects or for uncured Environmental Defects unless the
total of all individual adjustments for such Title Defects and Environmental
Defects that exceed the respective Individual Defect Thresholds exceeds one
and one-tenth (1.1%) of the unadjusted Purchase Price in the aggregate (the
"Aggregate Defect Threshold") after first offsetting any Title Benefits. In
the event that the total of all such individual adjustments for uncured Title
Defects and uncured Environmental Defects exceeds the Aggregate Defect
Threshold, the adjustment to the Purchase Price shall only be for the amount
by which the total of all such individual adjustments for uncured Title
Defects and uncured Environmental Defects exceeds the Aggregate Defect
Threshold plus the total value of all individual adjustments for any Title
Benefits. In no event will the aggregate amount of Title Defect adjustments
with respect to a Property exceed the Allocated Value of such Property. With
respect to any Title Defects or Environmental Defects for which an adjustment
equal to the entire Allocated Value of the affected Property is made to
the Purchase Price hereunder, at the Sellers option, as a condition
precedent to such adjustment, the Buyer will execute and deliver to the Seller
an assignment (in substantially the same form as the Assignment) of such
Property.  
---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT |  | 20 |  | in a Real Property Interest or Well which is less than that shown on _Exhibit
A_ , then the downward adjustment with respect to such Property shall
be calculated by multiplying the Allocated Value shown for such Property on
_Exhibit A_ by a fraction, the numerator of which is an amount equal to the
NRI shown for such Property on _Exhibit A_ less the NRI to which the Seller
is actually entitled taking such Title Defect into account, and the
denominator of which is the NRI shown for such Property on _Exhibit A_. 
---|---|--- 



     | 2.1.4 | If the adjustment is based on the Seller owning a Working
Interest in a Well which is larger than the Working Interest shown for such
Property on _Exhibit A_ , but without a proportionate increase in the NRI
for such Property, then the downward adjustment shall be calculated by
determining the effective NRI that results from such larger Working Interest,
determining what the NRI would be using such effective NRI and the Working
Interest shown for such Property on _Exhibit A_ and then calculating the
adjustment in the manner set forth in Section 2.1.3. 
---|---|--- 



     | 2.1.5 | If the adjustment is based on the Seller owning fewer Net
Acres in a Real Property Interest than those shown for such Real Property
Interest on _Exhibit A_ , then the downward adjustment shall be calculated
by multiplying the Allocated Value shown for such Property on _Exhibit A_ by
a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Net Acres shown for such
Property on _Exhibit A_ minus the actual Net Acres actually owned in such
Property, and the denominator of which is the number of Net Acres shown for
such Property on _Exhibit A_. 
---|---|--- 



     | 2.1.6 | If the adjustment is based on a Lien upon the Sellers
Real Property Interest or Well that is liquidated in amount, then the downward
adjustment is the lesser of the amount necessary to remove such Lien from
such Property or the Allocated Value of such Property. 
---|---|--- 



     | 2.1.7 |

If the adjustment is based on an Early Lease Expiration, then the downward
adjustment shall be calculated by multiplying the Allocated Value shown
for such Real Property Interest on _Exhibit A_ by a fraction, (a) the
numerator of which is (i) the lesser of 547 days and the number of days within
the period beginning on the Effective Time and ending on the expiration date
of the Real Property Interest as set forth on _Exhibit A_ , minus (ii) the
number of days within the period beginning on the Effective Time and ending on
the actual expiration date of the Real Property Interest as set forth in the
applicable lease, and (b) the denominator of which is the lesser of 547 days
and number of days within the period beginning on the Effective Time and
ending on the expiration date of the Real Property Interest as set forth on
_Exhibit A_. Alternatively, if an adjustment is based on a Late Lease
Expiration, then the upward adjustment shall be calculated by multiplying the
Allocated Value shown for such Real Property Interest on _Exhibit A_ by a
fraction, (a) the numerator of which is (i) the lesser of 

---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT |  | 21 |  | on the Effective Time and ending on the actual expiration date of the Real
Property Interest as set forth in the applicable lease, minus (ii) the number
of days within the period beginning on the Effective Time and ending on the
expiration date of the Real Property Interest as set forth on _Exhibit A_ ,
and (b) the denominator of which is the number of days within the period
beginning on the Effective Time and ending on the expiration date of the Real
Property Interest as set forth on _Exhibit A_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , no
adjustment based on a Late Lease Expiration shall exceed an amount equal to
the Allocated Value shown for the respective Real Property Interest on
_Exhibit A_. 
---|--- 



     | 2.1.8 | If the adjustment is based on a liability to remediate or
otherwise cure an Environmental Defect related to a Real Property Interest,
then the downward adjustment with respect to such Property is that portion of
the amount necessary to implement and complete any remedial, removal,
response, construction, closure, disposal or other corrective actions, or
monitoring required under Environmental Laws to correct or remove such
Environmental Defect in the most cost effective manner reasonably available
and consistent with common industry practices for which the Buyer would be
liable after Closing. 
---|---|--- 



     | 2.1.9 | If the Seller determines that a Real Property Interest is
subject to a Late Lease Expiration or that its ownership of (a) any Well
entitles the Seller to a larger NRI or a smaller Working Interest (without
a proportionately smaller NRI) than that shown for such Property on _Exhibit
A_ or (b) any Real Property Interest entitles the Seller to a larger NRI or a
greater number of Net Acres than that shown for such Property on _Exhibit A_
 (each, a "Title Benefit"), then the Seller shall notify the Buyer of such
Title Benefit in writing on or before the Defect Notice Date for Title
Defects, which notice shall include a reasonably detailed description of such
Title Benefit, the Dollar value that the Seller asserts is attributable to
such Title Benefit and the Sellers method of calculating such amount. The
Seller shall be deemed to have conclusively waived any Title Benefits of which
it fails to notify the Buyer in the manner and by the date specified in the
preceding sentence. The upward adjustment to the Purchase Price in respect of
each Title Benefit shall be determined using the same principles as provided
in this Section 2.1 with respect to Title Defects. For the avoidance of
doubt, a single matter shall be treated as a single Title Benefit even if
affecting more than one Property. 
---|---|--- 



     | 2.1.10 |

If a Title Defect or an Environmental Defect is reasonably susceptible of
being cured, then the Seller will have the right to cure such defect for
a period of up to sixty (60) days after the respective Defect Notice Date
(such period for Title Defects and such period for Environmental Defects, the
respective "Cure Period"). The Buyer shall provide the Seller and
its representatives access to the Properties and the Records after Closing in 

---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT |  | 22 |  | The Seller will be deemed to have adequately completed the cure of an
Environmental Defect after the implementation and completion of any remedial,
removal, response, construction, closure, disposal or other corrective actions
required under Environmental Laws to correct or remove such Environmental
Defect. 
---|--- 
 



     | 2.1.11 |

If after the respective Cure Period the Seller and the Buyer are not in
agreement as to (a) whether a Defect Notice or notice of Title
Benefit complies with the terms hereof, (b) the existence of or value
attributable to a Title Defect, Title Benefit or Environmental Defect, (c)
whether a Title Defect or Environmental Defect has been cured during the
respective Cure Period, or (d) the amount of any adjustments to be made to
the Purchase Price in respect of any uncured Title Defect, Title Benefit or
uncured Environmental Defect, then the Seller and the Buyer will submit the
dispute to arbitration as provided in this Section following written notice
from one Party to the other Party on or before the date thirty (30) days after
the end of the respective Cure Period that such Party is initiating dispute
resolution in accordance with this Section, such notice to describe in
reasonable detail the nature and specifics of the dispute. The Buyer, with
respect to Environmental Defects, shall be deemed to have conclusively waived
any unresolved Environmental Defect, or cure thereof, which is not submitted
for resolution as provided in this Section on or before the date one hundred
twenty (120) days after the end of the Cure Period applicable to Environmental
Defects. The Buyer, with respect to Title Defects, and the Seller, with
respect to Title Benefits, shall be deemed to have conclusively waived any
unresolved Title Defect, or cure thereof, or any unresolved Title Benefit
which is not submitted for resolution as provided in this Section on or before
the date one hundred twenty (120) days after the end of the Cure Period
applicable to Title Defects. The matter to be arbitrated shall be submitted to
a title attorney licensed to practice in the state in which the applicable
Property is located selected by the Seller and the Buyer, in the case of a
Title Defect or Title Benefit, or to an environmental expert in the state in
which the applicable Property is located selected by the Seller and the Buyer,
in the case of an Environmental Defect (each such title attorney or
environmental expert hereinafter, a "Consultant"). If the Seller and the Buyer
are unable to agree on any Consultant within thirty (30) days after receipt of
the initiating notice, then the Seller on the one hand and the Buyer on the
other hand will each appoint one Consultant within ten (10) days thereafter
and the two Consultants so appointed will appoint a third Consultant within
ten (10) days after the second Consultant is appointed, and the
three Consultants so appointed will resolve such matter. The cost of each
Consultant shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by the Seller and fifty percent
(50%) by the Buyer. The Seller and the Buyer shall each present to the
Consultant(s), with a simultaneous copy to the other Party, a single written
statement of its position on the defect or benefit in question, 

---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT |  | 23 |  | material that such Party desires to furnish, not later than the fifth (5th)
Business Day after appointment of the Consultant(s). In making their
determination, the Consultant(s) shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement
and, without any additional or supplemental submittals by either Party, may
consider available legal and industry matters as in their opinion are
necessary or appropriate to make a proper determination. By the
twentieth (20th) day following the submission of the matter to the
Consultant(s), applying the principles set forth in this Section 2.1, the
Consultant(s) shall make a determination of the matter submitted. The
decision of the Consultant(s) shall be in writing and conclusive and binding
on the Seller and the Buyer and shall be enforceable against the Parties in
any court of competent jurisdiction. The Consultant(s) shall act as
experts for the limited purpose of determining the specific title or
environmental dispute presented to them, shall not act as arbitrators, may not
hear or decide any matters except the specific title or environmental disputes
presented to them and may not award damages, interest, costs or penalties to
either Party. 
---|--- 



     | 2.1.12 | If the Parties have mutually agreed upon (or the
Consultant(s) shall have finally determined) the amount of any Purchase Price
adjustment required to be made pursuant to the terms of this Section 2.1 in
respect of a Title Benefit or in respect of an Title Defect or Environmental
Defect that the Seller have elected not to cure or that otherwise remains
uncured after expiration of the respective Cure Period, in each case, (a)
prior to the date the Closing Statement is initially delivered by the Seller
to the Buyer pursuant to Section 2.7, then such amount will be included in the
Purchase Price adjustments to be made at Closing in accordance with the
Closing Statement, or (b) after the foregoing date but prior to the date the
Final Statement is initially delivered by the Seller to the Buyer pursuant to
Section 2.8, then such amount will be included in the Purchase Price
adjustments to be made after Closing in accordance with the Final Statement,
or (c) after both such dates, then such amount will be paid after the Closing
in accordance with Section 2.9. 
---|---|--- 



     | 2.2. |

_Preferential Purchase Rights; Required Consents_. Within ten (10) Business
Days (two (2) Business Days in the case of SUSA) after the Execution Date,
the Seller shall provide any required notifications of a preferential purchase
right, right of first refusal or other agreement which gives a Third Party a
right to purchase a Real Property Interest or Well (or any part
thereof) ("PPR"), requesting waivers thereof, in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and otherwise in material compliance with the
contractual provisions applicable to such PPR. Within ten (10) Business Days
(two (2) Business Days in the case of SUSA) after the Execution Date, the
Seller will send letters seeking (a) the SUSA consents, agreements and waivers
described in Sections 6.4 and 7.5 and (b) all applicable Required Consents,
excluding Customary Post-Closing Consents. The Seller will thereafter use
commercially reasonable efforts (at no cost to the Seller) to ensure 

---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT |  | 24 |  | after Closing, the Buyer will reasonably assist the Seller in obtaining any
remaining waivers and consents. 
---|--- 
 



     | 2.2.1 | If, as of the Closing Date, (i) a holder of a PPR has
notified the Seller that it elects to exercise its PPR with respect to the
Properties (or portions thereof) to which its PPR applies (determined by and
in accordance with the agreement under which the PPR arises), or (ii) no
waiver, consent or exercise notice has been received by the Seller from the
holder of a PPR but the time for exercising such PPR has not expired, then in
each such case the Properties (or portions thereof) covered by the applicable
PPR will not be sold to the Buyer (subject to the remaining provisions in this
Section 2.2), and the Purchase Price will be reduced by the Allocated Value of
the Properties (or portions thereof) subject to such PPR. If, as of the
Closing Date, a holder of a Required Consent has not yet delivered such
Required Consent, then the Properties (or portions thereof) covered by that
Required Consent (i) will not be conveyed to the Buyer at Closing but shall
still be considered part of the Properties in accordance with the provisions
of Section 2.2.2, (ii) adjustments to the Purchase Price will still be made
pursuant to Sections 2.5 and 2.6 with respect to such Property, and (iii) the
Purchase Price will not be reduced as a result of such non-conveyance. 
---|---|--- 



     | 2.2.2 |

If Properties (or portions thereof) have been excluded from the Properties
sold to the Buyer at the Closing (i) due to a pre-Closing exercise of a PPR,
and if for any reason the purchase and sale of such Properties is not or
cannot be consummated with the holder of such PPR that exercised such PPR and
the Seller is thereby permitted to transfer such Properties (or portions
thereof) to the Buyer pursuant to the terms of such PPR, or (ii) due to the
Seller having not received a waiver, consent or exercise notice from the
holder of a PPR and the time for exercising such PPR had not expired as of the
Closing Date, and if the Seller subsequently receives such a waiver or
consent, or if the Seller does not receive an exercise notice from the holder
of the PPR with in the period for exercising such PPR, then in each such case
the Seller shall so notify the Buyer and, within ten (10) Business Days after
the Buyers receipt of such notice, the Seller shall sell, assign, and convey
to the Buyer and the Buyer shall purchase and accept from the Seller such
Properties pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and for the Allocated
Value of such Properties, subject to adjustments in accordance with Sections
2.5 and 2.6. If Properties (or portions thereof) have been excluded from the
Properties conveyed to the Buyer at the Closing due to the Seller having not
received a Required Consent as of the Closing Date in accordance with Section
2.2.1, and if the Required Consent has been received or deemed received
pursuant to the terms of the underlying agreement on or before the one (1)
year anniversary of the Closing Date, then in each such case the Seller shall
so notify the Buyer and, within ten (10) Business Days after the Buyers 

---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT |  | 25 |  | the Buyer and the Buyer shall accept from the Seller such Properties pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement. As between the Buyer and the Seller, with
respect to any Property for which a Required Consent has not been obtained by
the Closing, (a) the Seller shall hold such Property as nominee for the Buyer,
effective as of the Effective Time, (b) the Buyer shall pay any costs and
expenses associated with that Property, and (c) the Seller shall pay the Buyer
any revenues received by the Seller that are associated with such Property for
time periods from and after the Effective Time. If any Required Consent has
not been received or deemed received on or before the one (1) year anniversary
of the Closing Date, then the Seller shall no longer hold such Property as
nominee for the Buyer, and each Party shall repay to the other Party any
amounts previously paid hereunder in respect of the Property, and such
Property will be deemed not to have been conveyed to the Buyer hereunder and
shall be an Excluded Asset. From the Closing until the date of conveyance (or
until the one year anniversary, if not to be conveyed pursuant to this
Section 2.2.2 due to expiration of such period), with respect to those
Properties not conveyed at Closing solely pursuant to Section 2.2.1 and which
Seller continues thereafter to operate, Seller will continue to conduct its
operations with respect to such Properties consistent with the provisions of
Section 5.2, subject to the caveats and liability limitations contained
therein. 
---|--- 
 



     | 2.2.3 | Properties excluded pursuant to this Section 2.2 will not
be deemed to be affected by Title Defects or be subject to Section 2.1. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 2.3. | _Gas Imbalances_. The Purchase Price will be adjusted
upward or downward, as applicable, by (a) the net mcf amount of the Sellers
aggregate wellhead gas imbalances as of the Effective Time multiplied
by $2.75 per mcf (upward for underage and downward for overage); and (b) the
mmbtu amount of any pipeline imbalances or unsatisfied throughput obligations
attributable to the Seller or the Properties as of the Effective Time
multiplied by $2.75 per mmbtu (upward for over deliveries and downward for
under deliveries). 
---|---|--- 



     | 2.4. | _Casualty Loss_. If, after the Execution Date but prior to
the Closing Date, any portion of the Properties is damaged, destroyed or taken
by condemnation or eminent domain or suffers a reduction in value as a result
of a Casualty (a "Casualty Loss"), the Buyer will nevertheless be required to
close and the Purchase Price will be adjusted in an amount equal to the lesser
of (a) the Allocated Value of the Property affected by such Casualty Loss or
(b) the amount of such Casualty Loss. 
---|---|--- 



     | 2.5. |

_Certain Upward Adjustments_. The Purchase Price shall be increased by the
following (without duplication): (a) the value of all merchantable allowable
oil or other liquid Hydrocarbons in storage above the pipeline connection at
the Effective Time that is credited to the Properties in accordance with
gauging and other customary industry procedures, such value to be the current
market price at 

---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT |  | 26 |  | deducted by the purchaser of such oil or other liquid Hydrocarbons; (b) the
amount of all expenditures incurred and paid by or on behalf of the Seller in
connection with the ownership, operation and maintenance of the Properties
(including rentals, overhead, royalties, prepayments, operating, drilling and
completion costs and other charges and expenses billed under
applicable operating agreements) attributable to the period on or after the
Effective Time, excluding any such amounts to cure or remediate any Title
Defect or Environmental Defect; (c) all expenses of the type referenced in (b)
paid by or on behalf of the Seller in connection with unleased interests and
incurred subsequent to the Effective Time; (d) the amount of any proceeds from
the sale of Hydrocarbons produced prior to the Effective Time from the
Properties that are received by Buyer on behalf of the unleased interests;
and (e) any other amount agreed upon by the Buyer and the Seller, or otherwise
required to be reflected pursuant to the other provisions of this Section 2\.

no liability to the Buyer or any of the Buyers successors or assigns for its
reliance on any information regarding the Seller or the Properties that is not
contained in the Transaction Documents. The Buyer is acquiring the Properties
for its own account and not with the intent to make any distribution of
undivided interests thereof which would violate any applicable Laws. 
---|--- 



     | 4.12. | _Compliance with Anti-Bribery Laws_. The Buyer is not in
violation of and no event has occurred or that would constitute a violation of
any applicable State or Federal statute prohibiting bribery in any form.  
---|---|--- 

5\. _Covenants_. The Parties hereby covenant and agree to perform the
following:

 



     | 5.1. | _Access to Properties and Information_. Buyer will have
the opportunity to conduct, prior to the Defect Notice Date and at its sole
risk and expense, an environmental assessment of the Properties, including a
Phase I assessment as that term is defined by the ASTM E1527-13 All
Appropriate Inquiry Standard. Seller will provide reasonable access for this
purpose to Properties operated by Seller. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, Buyer shall not conduct any ASTM Phase II environmental review
or any test drilling or sampling or other invasive activities without prior
notice to and consent of Seller (which notice shall be sent at least fifteen
(15) days prior to the Defect Notice Date, and which consent Seller may give
or withhold in its sole discretion, and which consent will be considered
denied by Seller if Seller fails to respond within five (5) Business Days
after receiving such notice). Buyer shall provide Seller with a minimum of
three (3) Business Days advance notice of its proposed environmental
assessment activities prior to entering the Property to be assessed and Buyer
shall (a) coordinate the conduct of such environmental assessment
with Sellers representatives, (b) not interfere with the normal operation of
the Properties, and (c) comply with all applicable Laws and all requirements
and safety policies of Seller and, if Seller is not the operator of the
Properties, the operator of the Properties. If Buyer or any of its
consultants, agents and representatives prepares an environmental assessment,
Buyer will furnish a copy thereof to Seller upon request and (until and unless
Closing occurs and Buyer purchases the relevant Properties) will keep (and
cause its consultants, agents and representatives to keep) any and all such
assessments and reports strictly confidential. In connection with the granting
of such access, Buyer represents that it is adequately insured and, except to
the extent caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Seller
Indemnified Parties, Buyer waives, releases and agrees to defend and indemnify
the Seller Indemnified Parties against any and all claims for injury to, or
death of, persons or for damage to property arising in any way from the access
afforded to Buyer hereunder or the activities of Buyer related to such access
or any environmental assessment. This waiver, release and indemnity by Buyer
shall survive termination of this Agreement. If Buyer conducts a Phase I
assessment that indicates that a Phase II assessment as that term is defined
by 
---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT |  | 37 |  | requests the consent of Seller to such a Phase II assessment but Sellers
consent is denied (or deemed denied as provided above), then Buyer may
exclude the affected Property from the Transaction Documents, in which case
the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value
of the affected Property and that Property shall thereafter constitute an
Excluded Asset. 
---|--- 

Insofar as related to the Properties, the Seller will give to the Buyer and
its agents and representatives, reasonable access to all of the Records and
the Seller will cause its officers and employees to furnish to the Buyer and
its agents and representatives such operating data and other information with
respect to the Properties as the Buyer may, from time to time, reasonably
request; _provided_ , _however_ , (a) any such investigation will be conducted
in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the operation of the
business of the Seller, and (b) the Seller shall not be required to provide
any of the foregoing information to the extent that the Seller is prohibited
by any Third Party agreement from sharing such information with the Buyer
(provided that the Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts (at no
cost to the Seller) to obtain the consent of such Third Parties to the sharing
of such information). Buyer acknowledges that, pursuant to its right of access
to the Records, Buyer will become privy to confidential and other information
of the Seller and that such confidential information shall not be used for any
purpose other than assessing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and shall be held confidential by Buyer in accordance with the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement. If the Closing should occur, the foregoing
confidentiality restriction on Buyer, including those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement to the extent related to the Records, shall
terminate (except as to (a) any Properties that are excluded from the
transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement,
(b) the Excluded Assets and (c) information related to any assets other than
the Properties, which confidentiality obligations shall terminate in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement).



     | 5.2. | _Conduct of Business_. 
---|---|--- 



     | 5.2.1 | From and after the Execution Date until Closing, the
Seller will: 
---|---|--- 



     | (a) | to the extent the Seller operates any Properties, operate
such Properties as a prudent operator in accordance with all Contracts and all
applicable Laws in the Ordinary Course of Business; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | maintain its books of account and records relating to the
Properties in the usual, regular and ordinary manner, in accordance with the
usual accounting practices of the Seller and GAAP; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | pay, as they become due, that portion of the expenses
related to the Properties that are attributable or allocated to the Sellers
interest in the Properties, except for amounts contested in good faith;  
---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT |  | 38 |  | to make under any Contract, specifying the nature and time period associated
with such election, and consult with the Buyer (and attempt in good faith to
reach a mutually acceptable agreement with the Buyer regarding such
election); 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | notify Buyer, in a timely manner, of any Real Property
Interest expirations or intention not to conduct any continuous drilling or
other operations obligations that would result in any termination or
expiration of any Real Property Interest prior to the Closing Date, and
consult with the Buyer (and attempt in good faith to reach a mutually
acceptable agreement with the Buyer regarding actions, if any, to be taken in
connection therewith); and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (f) | act in a reasonably prudent manner to maintain in full force
and effect its Permits. 
---|---|--- 



     | 5.2.2 | Except as provided in the Contracts, as required by Law or
Permit, or as specifically contemplated by this Agreement, from and after the
Execution Date until Closing, the Seller shall not: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (a) | convey, encumber (except for Permitted Encumbrances),
abandon or otherwise dispose of any part of the Properties, other than: (i)
the sale of Hydrocarbons or obsolete machinery and equipment in the Ordinary
Course of Business, unless the Buyer shall otherwise consent in writing (such
consent not to be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld) or (ii) the
assignment of interests to another joint working interest owner to the extent
such assignments do not, individually or in the aggregate, reduce the
Sellers Net Revenue Interest or increase the Sellers Working Interest
(without at least a proportionate corresponding increase in the Sellers Net
Revenue Interest) in any Well or Real Property Interest or reduce the
Sellers Net Acres with respect to any Real Property Interest from that shown
for the Seller on _Exhibit A_; 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | except in emergencies, enter into any material agreement,
contract or commitment which, if entered into prior to the Execution Date,
would be required to be listed in a Schedule attached to this Agreement, or
materially amend or change the terms of, or terminate, extend, violate,
breach or default under any such agreement, contract or commitment, or waive
any right thereunder, in each case, without first consulting with the Buyer
(and attempting in good faith to reach a mutually acceptable agreement with
the Buyer regarding such agreement, contract or commitment); 
---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT |  | 39 |  | to reduce the Sellers NRI in a Property from that shown on _Exhibit A_ ;
provided, however, for clarity, this Section 5.2.2(c) shall not apply to any
decision to become a non-consenting party in any operation proposed with
respect to any of the Properties; 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | become a non-consenting party in any operation proposed with
respect to any of the Properties without first consulting with the Buyer (and
attempting in good faith to reach a mutually acceptable agreement with the
Buyer regarding such election); 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | relinquish voluntarily its position as operator with respect
to any Property without first consulting with the Buyer (and attempting in
good faith to reach a mutually acceptable agreement with the Buyer regarding
the operatorship of such Property); 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | except for those existing as of the Execution Date, encumber
any Property of the Seller with any Required Consent or PPR in favor of any
Third Party; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (g) | waive, compromise or settle any material claim involving the
Properties without first consulting with the Buyer (and attempting in good
faith to reach a mutually acceptable agreement with the Buyer regarding
such claim). 
---|---|--- 

The Buyer acknowledges that the Seller owns an undivided interest in certain
of the Properties with respect to which the Seller is not the operator, and
Buyer agrees that the acts or omissions of the other Working Interest owners
(including the operators) who are not the Seller or an Affiliate of the Seller
shall not constitute a breach of the provisions of this Section 5.2, nor
shall any action required by a vote of Working Interest owners constitute such
a breach so long as the Seller, in either case, has voted its interest in a
manner that complies with the provisions of this Section 5.2. 

Without expanding any obligations which Seller may have to Buyer, it is
expressly agreed that Seller shall never have any liability to Buyer with
respect to any breach or failure of Section 5.2 greater than that which it
might have as the operator to a non-operator under the applicable operating
agreement (or, in the absence of such an agreement, under the AAPL 610
(1989 Revision) form Operating Agreement), IT BEING RECOGNIZED THAT, UNDER
SUCH AGREEMENTS AND SUCH FORM, THE OPERATOR IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS OWN
NEGLIGENCE, AND HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY OTHER THAN FOR GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR
WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.

 



     | 5.3. | _Revenues Held For Benefit of the Other Party_. In the
event either (a) the Buyer receives production or other revenues attributable
to any of the Properties for any 
---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT |  | 40 |  | receives production or other revenues attributable to any of the Properties
for any periods after the Effective Time, the receiving Party will hold such
revenues for the exclusive benefit of the Party entitled thereto and, if not
taken into account for purposes of the Final Statement, shall promptly deliver
such funds to the appropriate Party. 
---|--- 
 



     | 5.4. | _Revenues and Expenses_. For all purposes, including
adjustments to the Purchase Price under Section 2 of this Agreement, the
Seller and the Buyer will properly allocate revenues and expenses before and
after the Effective Time and will make payments to each other to the extent
necessary for such proper allocation. All expenses incurred in the operation
of the Properties before the Effective Time will be borne by the Seller and
all proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from or attributable to
the Properties prior to the Effective Time will be the property of the Seller,
and all expenses incurred in the operation of the Properties after the
Effective Time will be borne by the Buyer and all proceeds from the sale of
Hydrocarbons produced from or attributable to the Properties after the
Effective Time will be the property of the Buyer. Ad valorem Taxes, property
Taxes and other similar obligations will be prorated between the Seller
and the Buyer as of the Effective Time. 
---|---|--- 



     | 5.5. | _Suspended Funds_. As part of the final accounting in
connection with the Final Statement pursuant to Section 2.8, the Seller will

containing the owner name, owner number, social security or federal ID number,
reason for suspense, and the amount of Suspended Funds payable for each entry,

information, the Buyer shall administer all such accounts and assume all
payment obligations relating to the Suspended Funds in accordance with all
applicable Laws, and shall be liable for the payment thereof to the proper
parties, except that the Seller will retain all responsibility and liability
for (a) statutory penalties and interest, if any, owing to any interest owner
attributable to the Suspended Funds accruing prior to the Effective Time and
(b) penalties and interest, if any, attributable to the Suspended Funds
accruing prior to the Effective Time, payable to any state under existing
escheat or unclaimed property statutes. If any such penalties or interest are
due to the respective suspense account owner or any state under such statutes
and the Seller fails to promptly reimburse such sums to the Buyer, then the
Buyer shall return to the Seller the Suspended Funds in such account that
existed as of the Effective Time, and the Seller shall thereupon assume all
obligations for the final payment and settlement of any such claims and
accompanying Suspended Funds. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 5.6. | _HSR Act_. In the event the Parties determine that filings
by the Parties are required under the HSR Act, within ten (10) days following

     |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT |  | 41 |  | the Seller agree to respond promptly to any inquiries from the DOJ or the FTC

in connection with the Buyers and the Sellers compliance with the HSR Act.
The Buyer and the Seller shall keep each other fully advised with respect to
any requests from or communications with the DOJ or FTC concerning such

thereto. Each of the Seller and the Buyer shall use its reasonable efforts to
take all actions reasonably necessary and appropriate in connection with any
HSR Act filing to consummate the transactions consummated hereby. All filing
fees incurred in connection with the filings made pursuant to this Section 5.6
shall be borne by the Buyer. 
---|--- 



     | 5.7. | _Governmental Bonds_. Buyer acknowledges that none of the
bonds, letters of credit and guarantees, if any, posted by Seller or its
Affiliates with Governmental Authorities or other Third Parties and relating
to the Properties will be transferred to Buyer. Prior to Closing, Buyer shall
post all bonds and other security with all applicable Governmental Authorities
(in each case meeting the requirements of such authorities) as are necessary
for Buyer to own and operate the Properties. In addition, at or immediately
following Closing, Buyer shall replace those bonds, letters of credit and
guarantees of Seller or its Affiliates related to the Properties and of which
Buyer has been notified by Seller at least ten (10) Business prior to
Closing. Thereafter, if either Party identifies any additional bond, letter of
credit or guarantee of Seller or its Affiliates related to any Properties and
which has not been released, then such Party shall promptly notify the other
Party and promptly thereafter Buyer shall replace such bond, letter of credit
or guarantee. Promptly following request by Seller, Buyer shall deliver to
Seller evidence of Buyers posting of the bonds, security, letters of credit
and guarantees required to be posted or replaced by Buyer pursuant to this
Section 5.7.

     | 5.8. | _Gathering Agreements_. 
---|---|--- 



     | 5.8.1 |

_ATEX Agreement_. The Buyer and the Seller will jointly contact Enterprise
(defined below) to request Enterprises consent to the Seller partially
assigning to the Buyer a portion of the Transportation Services Agreement
dated November 17, 2011 (the "ATEX Agreement"), between Enterprise Liquids
Pipeline LLC (as assigned to Enterprise TE Products Pipeline Company, LLC
("Enterprise") and CEMI, and if Enterprise refuses to consent to such partial
assignment of the ATEX Agreement to Buyer upon terms acceptable to both the
Seller and the Buyer in each Partys sole discretion, the ATEX Agreement will
not be assigned to the Buyer, however, the Buyer will be responsible for the
volume as detailed in _Schedule 5.8.1_ (the "Buyer ATEX Volume") under the
ATEX agreement as set forth below. If Enterprise refuses to consent to such
partial assignment of the ATEX Agreement to Buyer upon terms 

---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT |  | 42 |  | sole discretion, prior to Closing, the Buyer will enter into and the Seller
will cause CEMI to enter into: (a) a capacity use agreement with Enterprise,
wherein the Buyer, as agent for CEMI, transports the Buyer ATEX Volume under
the ATEX Agreement and delivers such Buyer ATEX Volume at the delivery points
under the ATEX Agreement for sale or marketing by the Buyer; and (b) an
agreement detailing CEMIs and the Buyers obligations to each other under the
capacity use agreement, including, without limitation, the Buyers obligations
to reimburse costs and expenses under the ATEX Agreement that are
attributable to the Buyer ATEX Volume to CEMI. If Enterprise does not agree to
enter into a capacity use agreement with the Buyer and CEMI, then the Buyer
will enter into, and Seller will cause CEMI to enter into, a buy-sell
agreement, whereby CEMI will purchase the Buyer ATEX Volume at the inlet to
the ATEX pipeline and redeliver to the Buyer the Buyer ATEX Volume at any
delivery point available (without additional cost and with the Buyer
responsible for all ATEX Agreement charges attributable to the Buyer ATEX
Volume) to CEMI per the Buyers instructions. CEMI will not be responsible for
any incremental storage, transfer, or other handling fees the Buyer may be
subject to under the buy-sell agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, if the Buyer is unable to take assignment of the
Ethane Purchase Agreement between CEMI and Westlake Petrochemicals LLC dated
January 17, 2012 (the "Westlake Agreement"), then the Buyer will sell to CEMI
(or CEMI will not sell back to the Buyer if a buy-sell agreement is in effect)
the volumes necessary to fulfill the Buyers share of the obligations retained
by CEMI under the Westlake Agreement at the price in effect under the
Westlake Agreement net of midstream fees and deductions.

     | 5.8.2 |

_Consents_. Within seven (7) Business Days after the Execution Date, the
Seller will send letters seeking consents to the assignment of the Contracts
listed on _Schedule 5.8.2_ ("Midstream Consent Contracts"). The Seller and the
Buyer will thereafter use commercially reasonable efforts (at no cost to the
Seller) to obtain such consents. At or prior to Closing, the Buyer will use
its commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to the Seller a written
acknowledgement from the counterparty to each Midstream Consent Contract that
(a) any required consent thereunder to assignment of such Midstream
Consent Contract has been granted, (b) the Buyer meets the creditworthiness
standard, if any, set forth in such Midstream Consent Contract, and (c) upon
the Sellers assignment of such Midstream Consent Contract to the Buyer, the
Seller and/or CEMI, as applicable, will be released from all obligations
under such Midstream Consent Contracts (with respect to each Midstream Consent
Contract, the "Applicable Consent"). The Buyer agrees to supply such
guaranties or other credit support necessary to replace the credit support
provided by CEMI or its Affiliates or otherwise reasonably required by such
counterparty to meet any such creditworthiness standard. If the Buyer is
unable or otherwise  

---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT |  | 43 |  | Applicable Consent with respect to any Midstream Consent Contract, then, in
any such event, such Midstream Consent Contract will not be assigned and, if
the applicable Midstream Consent Contract is a gas sales contract, processing
contract or similar contract for the sales of hydrocarbons, the Buyer will
sell all hydrocarbons currently flowing under such Midstream Consent
Contract to CEMI at the receipt points under such Midstream Consent Contract
for a price equal to 100% of CEMIs sale price of such hydrocarbons less the
Applicable Deductions (as hereinafter defined), and if the applicable
Midstream Consent Contract is a gathering contract, field services contract
or other contract for the provision of gathering, transportation, compression
or treating services for a fee or rate, CEMI will schedule, nominate and
purchase all volumes delivered by Buyer in accordance with such Midstream
Consent Contract at the inlet to the applicable system and redeliver to the
Buyer the volume or quantity to which CEMI is entitled under the applicable
Midstream Consent Contract at any delivery point available (less Applicable
Deductions) to CEMI per the Buyers instructions, until the earlier of: (i)
the termination of such Midstream Consent Contract; (ii) the expiration of the
term of such Midstream Consent Contract; or (iii) the counterparties consent
to the assignment to the Buyer and the release of the Seller and/or CEMI, as
applicable, under such Midstream Consent Contract. As used herein, "Applicable
Deductions" means (x) during the period from the Closing Date through the end
of the second month after the month the Closing occurs, reimbursement to CEMI
for all fees and deductions charged to or paid by CEMI in connection therewith
(the "Initial Period"); and (y) commencing on the first day of the month
following the end of the Initial Period, an amount equal to one and one-half
percent (1 1⁄2 %) of the sales price of such Hydrocarbons plus all midstream
fees and deductions charged to or paid by CEMI in connection therewith. 
---|--- 



     | 5.8.3 | _Form of Assignment_. Prior to Closing, the Seller and
the Buyer will negotiate in good faith mutually acceptable forms of
assignment, assumption and, as applicable, and consent and release agreements
to effect, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the assignments to
the Buyer at Closing of the Midstream Consent Contracts (subject to Section
5.8.2) and all other gathering Contracts set forth on _Exhibit C_
(collectively, the "Midstream Agreements" and such assignment, assumption and
consent agreements for the Midstream Agreements, collectively, the "Midstream
Assignments"). Upon Closing, the Seller will assign (and cause CEMI to
assign) its rights and obligations contained in the Midstream Agreements
(subject to Section 5.8.2), and the Buyer will assume (and, upon delivery by
the Seller of the Assignment, the Buyer shall be deemed to have assumed), and
thereafter will be bound by and comply with and perform, all of the
obligations of CEMI and the Seller contained in the assigned Midstream
Agreements; in such each case, from and after the Effective Time and solely to
extent pertaining to the Properties.

rate, the Buyer or its designee will have the right to match any higher
bid pursuant to the tariffs of the interstate pipelines providing

Seller or its Affiliates to release that FERC Jurisdictional Contract at a
rate that results in the permanent release of the Seller or its Affiliate,

5.11.3, Seller agrees to exercise any rights of first refusal or extension
options under the FERC Jurisdictional Contract(s) involved at
Buyers direction, cost and expense. After the date that is six (6) months

obtaining the Buyers request or consent.

contracts. Without limiting Sellers obligations under Section 8.4, if Closing
occurs, then for a period of one (1) year after the Closing Seller shall
maintain in confidence those Records to the extent related to the Properties
that are conveyed to Buyer. The foregoing obligations of confidentiality shall
not apply to (a) any information that is or becomes generally available to
the public through no fault of Seller, or that is or was communicated to
Seller by a Third Party free of any obligation of confidence known to Seller,
or (b) any Records to the extent related to any Property not conveyed to
Buyer or to the extent related to any Retained Liabilities. Seller may

foregoing to the contrary, the indemnified party will be entitled to select
its own counsel and assume the defense of any action brought against it if the
indemnifying Party fails to assume or diligently prosecute such defense, the

liability with respect to such claim. No indemnified party shall consent to
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement of any such action, the

pursuant to Section 10.2(a) shall be made hereunder unless the amount of such
claim exceeds an amount equal to Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000.00)
(each an "Individual Claim"). No claim of the Buyer or the Buyer Indemnified
Parties pursuant to Section 10.2(a) shall be made hereunder until the total of
all Individual Claims exceeds one and one-tenth percent (1.1%) of
the unadjusted Purchase Price (the "Basket"). If the total amount of all of
the Buyers or the Buyer Indemnified Parties Individual Claims exceeds the
Basket, then the Sellers obligations under Section 10.2(a) shall be limited
to the amount by which the aggregate amount of such Individual Claims exceeds
the Basket. All of the representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement or any certificate that are qualified as to
"material," "materiality," "material respects," "material adverse effect,"
"Material Adverse Effect" or words of similar import or effect shall be deemed
to have been made without any such qualification solely for purposes of
determining whether a claim exceeds the Individual Claim threshold or Basket
or whether the Buyer is entitled to indemnification under Section 10.2(a) for
a breach by the Seller of a representation or warranty contained in Section
3.6 (and, for the avoidance of doubt, not for purposes of determining whether
a Closing condition has been satisfied or whether the Buyer is entitled to
indemnification under Section 10.2(a) for a breach by the Seller of any
other representation or warranty contained in Section 3). 
---|---|--- 



     | 10.7.2 | In no event will the Sellers aggregate liability under
Section 10.2(a), other than claims for breaches of the representations and
warranties made in _Sections 3.1_ , _3.2_ , _3.3(a)(i)_ ,  _3.10_ and _3.11_
, exceed twenty percent (20%) of the unadjusted Purchase Price. 
---|---|--- 



     | 10.7.3 | The amount of any indemnification provided under Section
10.2 or 10.3 shall be net of any corresponding insurance proceeds, from
insurance policies carried by the Party otherwise entitled to such
indemnification or its Affiliates, in each case, that are actually realized
by such Party. 
---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  |  |

other Partys indemnified parties under this Section 10 with respect to
any item for which an adjustment has already been made to the Purchase Price
under the terms of this Agreement; and (b) the Seller will have no liability
to the Buyer or the Buyer Indemnified Parties under this Section 10 for any
matter (including any breach of a representation or warranty under Section 3)
which constitutes a Title Defect or an Environmental Defect. Claims for Title
Defects or Environmental Defects, whether or not resulting in a Purchase Price
adjustment because the applicable Aggregate Defect Threshold is not exceeded,
are not subject to the terms of this Section 10, may not be claimed under this
Section 10, may not be included for purposes of determining whether the
limitations set forth in this Section 10.7 have been met and may not be
included in the Basket for purposes of the limitations set forth in this
Section 10.7. 
---|---|--- 



     | 10.7.5 | The Parties specifically agree that the Buyer will not
have any right to pursue a claim under the special warranty of title in the
Assignment with respect to any matters which existed on or before the
Effective Time that were raised by the Buyer as a Title Defect under Section
2.1 of this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 

11\. _Termination_. The Parties agree that this Agreement is subject to
termination as follows:



     | 11.1. | _Right to Terminate_. Subject to Section 11.2, this
Agreement may be terminated (except for the provisions referenced in Section
11.2) at any time prior to the consummation of the Closing upon
the occurrence of any one or more of the following: (a) by mutual consent of
the Seller and the Buyer; (b) by the Buyer, if the Seller has materially
breached this Agreement and such breach causes any of the conditions to
Closing set forth in Section 6 not to be satisfied (or, if prior to Closing,
is of such a magnitude or effect that it will not be possible for such
condition to be satisfied); _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of a
breach that is capable of being cured, the Seller shall have a period of ten
(10) days following receipt of such notice to attempt to cure the breach and
the termination under this Section 11.1(b) shall not become effective unless
the Seller fails to cure such breach prior to the end of such ten (10) day
period; (c) by the Seller if the Buyer has materially breached this Agreement
and such breach causes any of the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 7
not to be satisfied (or, if prior to Closing, is of such a magnitude or
effect that it will not be possible for such condition to be satisfied);
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of a breach that is capable of being
cured, the Buyer shall have a period of ten (10) days following receipt of
such notice to attempt to cure the breach and the termination under this
Section 11.1(c) shall not become effective unless the Buyer fails to cure such
breach prior to the end of such ten (10) day period; (d) by the Seller or the
Buyer 
---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT |  | 58 |  | 2015, _provided that_ such failure does not result primarily from the
terminating Partys material breach of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained in this Agreement; or (e) by either the Seller or the
Buyer, if under the HSR Act or otherwise, the FTC or the DOJ shall have
commenced or threatened to commence any proceeding to delay or enjoin or seek
damages in respect of the transactions evidenced by this Agreement
("threatened," for purposes of this Section 11.1(e), means an actual vote of
the Commissioners of the Federal Trade Commission to commence such
a proceeding). 
---|--- 



     | 11.2. | _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination,
written notice thereof will be given to the other Party or Parties specifying
the provision pursuant to which such termination is made. Except as
specifically provided in Section 12, on the termination of this Agreement the
Deposit will be refunded to the Buyer. If this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with Section 11.1, the provisions contained in this Section 11.2
and in Sections 8.5, 9, 12, 13, 14.1, 14.2, 14.5 through 14.17, and such
defined terms in Section 1 as may be required to give meaning to such
sections, shall survive termination of this Agreement. No termination of this
Agreement under Section 11 shall relieve any Party of liability for breach of
this Agreement arising prior to such termination. 
---|---|--- 

12\. _Default_. If any Party fails to perform any material obligation
contained in this Agreement that is to be performed at or prior to Closing,
and Closing has not yet occurred, the Party claiming default will serve
written notice to the other Party specifying the nature of such default and
demanding performance. If such a material default by the Seller has not been
cured within the sooner of ten (10) days after receipt of such default notice
or the date specified in Section 11.1(d) above, and each of the conditions
contained in Section 7 has been either fulfilled in all material respects or
waived in writing (other than conditions pertaining to the execution and
delivery of documents and payment of monies by the Buyer the fulfillment of
which is expressly provided to occur at the Closing), then the Buyer will be
entitled to exercise all remedies arising at law or in equity by reason of
such default, including termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 11\.
If such a material default by the Buyer has not been cured within the sooner
of ten (10) days after receipt of such default notice or the date specified in
Section 11.1(d) above, and each of the conditions contained in Section 6 has
been either fulfilled in all material respects or waived in writing (other
than conditions pertaining to the execution and delivery of documents the
fulfillment of which is expressly provided to occur at the Closing), then the
Seller will be entitled to retain the Deposit as liquidated damages in lieu
of all other damages (and as the Sellers sole remedy in such event, other
than termination of this Agreement). The Parties hereby acknowledge that the
extent of damages to the Seller occasioned by such failure or refusal by the
Buyer would be impossible or extremely impractical to ascertain and that the
amount of the Deposit is a fair and reasonable estimate of such damages under
the circumstances.

 

13\. _Arbitration_. Except with respect to disputes and matters required to be
resolved by the Consultant(s) or the Accounting Referee, which will be
resolved as provided in Sections 2.1.11 or 2.8, any and all Arbitrable
Disputes must be resolved through the use of binding arbitration in accordance
with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA, as supplemented to 

 



     |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT |  | 59 |  |  the extent necessary to determine any procedural appeal questions by the
Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United States Code). If there is any
inconsistency between this Section 13 and the Commercial Arbitration Rules or
the Federal Arbitration Act, the terms of this Section 13 shall control the
rights and obligations of the Parties.



     | 13.1. | _Consolidation_. If there is more than one (1) Arbitrable
Dispute that involves the same facts and Parties as the facts and Parties with
respect to which arbitration has been initiated pursuant to this Agreement,
such disputes shall be consolidated into the first arbitration initiated
pursuant to this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | 13.2. | _Initiation; Selection of Arbitrators_. Arbitration may
be initiated by a Party ("Claimant") serving written notice on the other Party
("Respondent") that the Claimant has referred the Arbitrable Dispute to
binding arbitration. Claimants notice initiating binding arbitration must
describe in reasonable detail the nature of the Arbitrable Dispute and the
facts and circumstances relating thereto and identify the arbitrator Claimant
has appointed. Respondent shall respond to Claimant within thirty (30) days
after receipt of Claimants notice, identifying the arbitrator Respondent has
appointed. All arbitrators must be neutral parties who have never
been officers, directors or employees of, or have performed material work
for, any of the Parties or their Affiliates within the preceding five (5) year
period. Arbitrators must have a formal education or training in the area of
dispute resolution and must have not less than seven (7) years experience as
a lawyer in the energy industry with experience in exploration and production
issues. The two (2) arbitrators so chosen shall select a third arbitrator
within thirty (30) days after the second arbitrator has been appointed. If
either the Respondent fails to name its Party-appointed arbitrator within the
time permitted, or if the two arbitrators are unable to agree on a third
arbitrator within thirty (30) days from the date the second arbitrator has
been appointed, then the missing arbitrator(s) shall be selected by the AAA
with due regard given to the selection criteria above and input from the
Parties and other arbitrators. The AAA shall select the missing arbitrator(s)
not later than ninety (90) days from initiation of arbitration. In the event
the AAA should fail to select the third arbitrator within ninety (90) days
from initiation of arbitration, then either Party may petition the Chief
United States District Judge for the Northern District of Texas to select the
third arbitrator. Such selection shall be consistent with the selection
criteria above and with due regard given to input from the Parties and
other arbitrators. 
---|---|--- 



     | 13.3. | _Expenses_. Claimant and Respondent shall each pay one-
half of the compensation and expenses of the AAA and the arbitrator(s). 
---|---|--- 



      | 13.4. | _Procedure_. The hearing shall be conducted in Dallas,
Texas and commence within sixty (60) days after the selection of the third
arbitrator, unless delayed by order of the arbitrators. The hearing shall
be based upon written position papers submitted by Claimant and Respondent
within twenty (20) Business Days after the selection of the third arbitrator,
stating such Partys proposed resolution of the dispute. The Parties and the
arbitrators shall proceed diligently and in good faith in order that the
award may be made as promptly as possible. The arbitrators 
---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT |  | 60 |  | award on or before thirty (30) days following the completion of the hearing.
The arbitrators decision shall be in writing and set forth the reasons for
the award. In rendering the award the arbitrators shall abide by (a) the terms
and conditions of this Agreement including, without limitation, any and all
restrictions, prohibitions or limitations on damages or remedies set forth in
this Agreement and (b) the law of the State of Texas. The arbitrators shall
not have jurisdiction or authority to add to, detract from or alter in any way
the provisions of this Agreement. 
---|--- 
 



     | 13.5. | _Enforcement; Remedies_. A Party may, prior to the
appointment of the third arbitrator, seek temporary injunctive relief from any
court of competent jurisdiction, provided that the Party seeking such relief
shall (if arbitration has not already been commenced) simultaneously commence
arbitration. Such court-ordered relief shall not continue more than ten (10)
days after the appointment of the arbitrators and in no event for longer than
ninety (90) days. In order to prevent irreparable harm, the arbitrators shall
have the power to grant temporary or permanent injunctive or other equitable
relief. Except as provided in the Federal Arbitration Act, the decision of the
arbitrators shall be binding on and non-appealable by the Parties. Each Party
agrees that any arbitration award against it may be enforced in any court of
competent jurisdiction and that any Party may authorize any such court to
enter judgment on the arbitrators decisions. The arbitrators may not grant
or award indirect, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages or damages for
lost profits. 
---|---|--- 



     | 13.6. | _Award of Fees_. In any action under this Agreement, the
prevailing Party or Parties (or other indemnified Persons) shall be entitled
to recover arbitration and court costs and attorneys fees in addition to any
other relief to which such Party or Persons are entitled. 
---|---|--- 

14\. _Miscellaneous_. It is further agreed as follows:

 



     | 14.1. | _Time_. Time is of the essence of this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | 14.2. | _Notices_. All notices and communications required or

_Survival_. The representations and warranties of the Seller contained in this
Agreement or in any certificate delivered in connection with this Agreement
(other than the representations and warranties in Sections 3.1, 3.5, 3.10,
3.11, 4.1, 4.4 and 4.8), together with the indemnification rights with respect
thereto, will survive the Closing Date for a period of twelve (12) months
and shall thereafter be of no further force or effect (the "Expiration
Date"); _provided_ , _however_ , any representation or warranty as to which a
claim shall have been asserted prior to the Expiration Date shall survive
until such claim and the indemnity with respect thereto are resolved. The
representations and warranties in Sections 3.1, 3.5, 

---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT |  | 62 |  | the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. Except as otherwise
set forth in this Agreement, the remainder of this Agreement shall survive
the Closing without time limit. The special warranty of title set forth in the
Assignment will survive the Closing Date for a period of five (5) years and
shall thereafter be of no further force or effect except that any claim under
such special warranty of title which has been asserted prior to the end of
such five (5) year period shall survive until such claim with respect thereto
is resolved. The intended effect of termination of representations
and warranties (and the indemnification rights with respect thereto) and the
special warranty of title is to bar, from and after the date of termination,
any claim or cause of action based on the alleged inaccuracy of such
representation or breach of such warranty, or with regard to claims for
indemnity with respect thereto or with respect to such special warranty of
title. 
---|--- 



     | 14.4. | _Cooperation_. Prior to termination of this Agreement and
at all times following the consummation of this Agreement, the Parties agree

     | 14.5. | _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except for the
indemnification rights of the Seller Indemnified Parties and the Buyer
Indemnified Parties under Section 10, nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to confer upon anyone, other than the Parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns, any rights or remedies under or by
reason of this Agreement or to constitute any Person a third party beneficiary
of this Agreement; provided, however that the Financing Sources are intended
beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to enforce, Sections 14.10, 14.21 and
this Section 14.5. 
---|---|--- 



     | 14.6. | _Cumulative Remedies_. Subject to the other provisions
hereof, no failure on the part of any Party to this Agreement to exercise and
no delay in exercising any right thereunder will operate as a waiver thereof,
nor will any single or partial exercise by any Party hereto of any right
hereunder preclude any other or further right of exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 14.7. | _Choice of Law_. This Agreement will be interpreted,
construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas,

     | 14.11. | _Severability_. If any clause or provision of this
Agreement is illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future
law, the remainder of this Agreement will not be affected thereby. It is the
intention of the Parties that if any such provision is held to be illegal,
invalid or unenforceable, there will be added in lieu thereof a provision as
similar in terms to such provisions as is possible to make such provision
legal, valid and enforceable.

     | 14.12. | _Attorney Fees_. If any Party institutes an action or
proceeding against any other Party relating to the provisions of this

obligation or a waiver of any future default.

presumption that this instrument was prepared solely by any Party. 
---|---|--- 



     | 14.18. | _Schedules_. The inclusion of any information (including
dollar amounts) in any section of the disclosure Schedules hereto shall not be
deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment by the Seller that
such information is required to be listed on such Schedule or is material to
or outside the Ordinary Course of Business of the Seller. The information
contained in this Agreement, the Exhibits and the Schedules hereto is
disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained

---|---|---|---|--- 
  PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT |  | 65 |  | Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"); provided, that the Closing
shall not be delayed or affected by reason of the Exchange. Each Party agrees

any such Exchange, any exchange accommodation title holder shall have taken
all steps necessary to own the Properties under applicable Law. Each Party

Partys Exchange election.

Statements, including, as requested, representations regarding internal
accounting controls and disclosure controls. As used in this Section 14.20,
the term "Financial Records" means all ledgers, books, data, files, and

be confidential and proprietary, or (b) that may be protected by an attorney-
client privilege, or (c) that cannot be disclosed to the Buyer or its
representatives as a result of confidentiality arrangements with third
parties.

     | 14.20.2 | The obligations of the Seller under this Section 14.20
shall expire on the earlier of (a) termination of this Agreement or (b) ninety
(90) days after the close of the 2014 fiscal year of the Seller unless a
request with respect to Financial Statements has been made prior to such time,
in which event the obligations of the Seller shall continue until the
preparation of such Financial Statements has been completed. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 14.21. | _No Recourse to Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement, the Seller agrees on its behalf and on behalf of
its Affiliates that no Financing Source or Finance Related Parties under
any Financing Commitment nor any other Financing Source shall have any
liability or obligation to the Seller and its Affiliates relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the

each case, whether arising, in whole or in part, out of comparative,
contributory or sole negligence by any Financing Source or any Finance Related
Party.
