Closing Statement"), certified by the President of the Company (the "Estimated
Closing Statement"), setting forth, in good faith (i) an estimate of the

the amount by which the Estimated Closing Working Capital is greater than the

Capital Excess"), or the absolute amount by which the Estimated Closing
Working Capital is less than the Closing Working Capital Target, if at all
(the "Estimated Closing Working Capital Shortfall"), (iii) an estimate of the
Closing Indebtedness (the "Estimated Closing Indebtedness"), (iv) an estimate
of the Transaction Costs (the "Estimated Transaction Costs") and (v) the

\- 11 - 2.5 _Final Purchase Price Adjustment_

 

(a) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing, Buyer shall cause to be prepared
and delivered to Seller a statement, in the form of the Illustrative Closing
Statement (the "Final Closing Statement"), setting forth (i) the actual
Working Capital ( the "Final Closing Working Capital"), (ii) the amount by
which the Final Closing Working Capital is greater than the Closing Working
Capital Target, if at all (the "Closing Working Capital Excess") or the
absolute amount by which the Final Closing Working Capital is less than the
Closing Working Capital Target (the "Closing Working Capital Shortfall"),
(iv) the actual Closing Indebtedness, (iii) the actual Transaction Costs, and
(iv) Buyers calculation of the Purchase Price.

 

(b) During the thirty (30) calendar day period following delivery of the Final
Closing Statement to Seller, Buyer will allow Sellers designated
representatives reasonable access to such books, records, work papers,
employees, and accountants of the Company used in or who have information used
in calculating the amounts set forth in the Final Closing Statement as Seller
may reasonably request (including by electronic means, to the extent
available), and shall provide such other cooperation in connection with its
review of the Final Closing Statement as reasonably requested by Seller.

 

(c) If Seller disagrees with Buyers calculation of the Final Closing
Statement (or any component thereof) or any line item of the Final Closing
Statement, in each case solely on the basis that such amounts were not
calculated or prepared in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement
or on the basis of arithmetic errors, Seller shall, within thirty (30) days
following receipt by Seller of the Final Closing Statement, deliver written
notice (a "Dispute Notice") to Buyer of any such dispute (such thirty (30)
calendar day period, the "Dispute Notification Period"). Such Dispute Notice
shall specify in detail those calculations and/or amounts that Seller
disputes, the specific bases of its disputes and its proposed calculation of
each such amount. If Seller does not notify Buyer of a dispute with respect to
the Final Closing Statement within such Dispute Notification Period, the
Final Closing Statement (and the matters contained therein, including the
Purchase Price) will be final, conclusive, and binding on the Parties. All
items set forth on the Final Closing Statement that are not identified on the
Dispute Notice as being in dispute will be final conclusive and binding on the
Parties. In the event of such notification of a dispute, Buyer and Seller
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. If Buyer and Seller
fail to resolve any such dispute within fifteen (15) calendar days after
Seller notified Buyer of its dispute, then Buyer and Seller jointly shall
engage PricewaterhouseCoopers, or another independent certified
public accountants of internationally recognized standing acceptable to Buyer
and Seller (the "Independent Accounting Firm") to resolve such dispute. The
Independent Accounting Firm shall make all determinations (acting as an
expert, not as an arbitrator) in accordance the requirements of this
Agreement (including the definitions), shall make a determination of only
those items remaining in dispute between Buyer and Seller within thirty (30)
calendar days of having the items referred to it pursuant to such procedures
as it may require. In resolving any such dispute, the Independent Accounting
Firm shall only be permitted or authorized to determine an amount that is the
same as or between the 

 



\- 12 -  values asserted by the Buyer and Seller with respect to the applicable item
in dispute. All costs, fees, and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm
shall be allocated between Seller and Buyer in the same proportion that the
aggregate amount of the disputed items so submitted to the Independent
Accounting Firm that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as finally
determined by the Independent Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of
such disputed items so submitted. The determination by the Independent
Accounting Firm of any disputed items submitted by Buyer and Seller for
resolution shall be final and binding on the Parties and non-appealable.

(d) If the Purchase Price as finally determined in accordance with this 
_Section 2.5_ is less than the Closing Payment (the absolute amount of such
shortfall, the "Negative Adjustment Amount"), Buyer shall be entitled to be
paid the Negative Adjustment Amount from the Escrow Amount (and Seller and
Buyer shall execute and deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow
Agent instructing that an amount equal to the Negative Adjustment Amount be
released from the Escrow Account to the Buyer). If the Negative Adjustment
Amount exceeds the Escrow Amount, Seller shall pay or cause to be paid to
Buyer within five (5) Business days of the date on which the Purchase Price
and the Final Closing Statement is finally determined such excess, to an
account designated in writing by Buyer to Seller upon at least two (2)
calendar days notice.

(e) If the Purchase Price as finally determined in accordance with this 
_Section 2.5_ is greater than the Closing Payment (the amount of such excess,
the "Positive Adjustment Amount"), then as part of the Purchase Price Buyer
shall pay or cause to be paid to Seller within five (5) Business Days of the
date on which the Purchase Price and the Final Closing Statement is finally
determined the Positive Adjustment Amount to an account designated in writing
by Seller to Buyer upon at least two (2) calendar days notice.

2.6 _Allocation of Purchase Price_.

 

(a) Buyer and Seller agree that the purchase and sale of the Company Interests
hereunder shall be treated as a sale of the Companys assets by the Company
and a purchase of the Companys assets by the Buyer for federal, state and
local U.S. income Tax purposes. Buyer and Seller agree to allocate the
Purchase Price (together with other relevant amounts) among the assets of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries in accordance with _Schedule 2.6_
attached hereto (the "Allocation Schedule"), which has been prepared in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder. No later than sixty (60) calendar days
after the Purchase Price is finally determined hereunder, Seller shall deliver
to Buyer an allocation of the Purchase Price (and all other relevant amounts)
as of the Closing Date determined in a manner consistent with the Allocation
Schedule and Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder (the "Sellers Allocation"). If Buyer disagrees with Sellers
Allocation, Buyer may, within thirty (30) calendar days after delivery of
Sellers Allocation, deliver a notice (the "Buyers Allocation Notice") to
Seller to such effect, specifying those items as to which Buyer disagrees
and setting forth Buyers allocation of the Purchase Price (and all other
relevant amounts). If Buyers Allocation Notice is duly delivered, Buyer and
Seller shall, during the twenty (20) calendar days following such delivery,
use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed
items or amounts in order to determine the allocation of the Purchase Price
(together with other relevant amounts) (the

 



\- 13 -  allocation it so agreed, if any, or, if Seller does not deliver a Buyers
Allocation Notice, Sellers Allocation, the "Allocation"). The Allocation (if
any) shall be conclusive and binding on all parties and Buyer and Seller
agree (and agree to cause their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates) to
prepare and file IRS Form 8594 and all federal, state, local and foreign Tax
Returns in accordance with the Allocation. Each party shall provide the other
promptly with any other information required to complete Form 8594\. None of
the Buyer, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates shall take any
position inconsistent with the Allocation (if any) on any Tax Return or in
any Tax proceeding, in each case, except as may be required pursuant to a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any
analogous provision of state, local or foreign Law). Notwithstanding any of
the foregoing, if Buyer and Seller are unable to agree on the allocation of
the Purchase Price (and other relevant amounts), then Buyer and Seller shall
each be entitled to use their own allocation of the Purchase Price (and other
relevant amounts), provided that such allocations are consistent with the
Allocation Schedule and Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder.

 

(b) With respect to the Companys fulfillment obligations from and after
Closing for Deferred Revenue, the parties agree that for all income tax
purposes, an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Deferred Revenue,
calculated in accordance with GAAP in a manner consistent with the Companys
historical practices (the "Fulfillment Value"), will be treated as an assumed
liability and added to the Purchase Price, and that Seller will be deemed to
have paid an amount of cash equal to the Fulfillment Value to Buyer as a
payment to Buyer for its assumption of such liability and for its
fulfillment of such services. The parties acknowledge and agree that, for all
income tax purposes, the assumption of the Fulfillment Value will be treated
as additional consideration paid by Buyer to Seller, the deemed payment by
Seller to Buyer will be treated as subscription fulfillment revenue to Buyer
of cash equal to the Fulfillment Value.

ARTICLE III - CLOSING DATE.

 

Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Articles VII_ and
_VIII_ hereof (or the written waiver thereof by the party entitled to waive
that condition), the closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the
"Closing") shall take place at the offices of Greenberg Traurig, LLP, 1750

specified by the parties, which date shall be no later than the second

subject to the satisfaction or written waiver (by the applicable party) of
such conditions), unless (i) Buyer has provided notice to Seller that it
requires more time to complete its financing of the Purchase Price, in which
case, subject to the satisfaction of the portion of this sentence preceding

shall be no later than the forty-fifth (45th) day after the date hereof, or

Agreement. The date on which the Closing shall occur is referred to in this
Agreement as the ("Closing Date").

the Company or any Company Subsidiary which is required under applicable
Environmental Laws to be addressed or remediated by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary. There are no past or present conditions, events,
circumstances or facts that can reasonably be expected to form the basis of

Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to Seller or any Interested Party
other than under this Agreement and the Transition Services Agreement.

and (iii) cooperate with each other in connection with any such filing
(including, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, providing copies of all
such documents to the non-filing parties prior to filing and considering all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith)
and in connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry of any of
the FTC, the Antitrust Division or other Governmental Body under any
Antitrust Laws with respect to any such filing or any such transaction. Each
such party shall use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to each other all
information required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant
to any applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Each such party shall promptly inform the other parties hereto
of any substantive oral communication with, and provide copies of written
communications with, any Governmental Body regarding any such filings or any
such transaction. No party hereto shall independently participate in any
substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any
Governmental Body in respect of any such filings, investigation, or other
inquiry without giving the other parties hereto prior notice of the meeting
and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Body, the opportunity to
attend and/or participate. Subject to the limitations of applicable Law, the
parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another in connection with
any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments,

Laws or Orders applicable to Seller, any Company Subsidiary, Buyer or its
parent corporation under the Laws of the European Union, that are designed to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, the "Antitrust Laws").
Each of Buyer and Seller shall use its

 



\- 36 -  reasonable best efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the
expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws
with respect to such transactions as promptly as possible after the execution
of this Agreement and to request "early termination" of the HSR waiting
period.

(c) Without limiting any other obligation under this Agreement, during the
period from the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date, each of Buyer
and Seller shall not, and Seller shall cause the Company and Company
Subsidiaries not to, take or agree to take any action that would reasonably
be expected to prevent the parties from obtaining any Governmental Body
consents in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
which, in the case of Buyer, shall be construed as only an obligation to not
announce or enter into any agreement with respect to the acquisition of a
commodity price reporting services business.

take all actions necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions

(a) The information provided by the parties in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby is subject to the terms of the

December 10, 2015 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), the terms of which are
incorporated herein by reference. Effective upon the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate.

 

(b) After the Closing, Seller and its Affiliates will hold, and will use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective officers,
directors, employees, accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors and agents
to hold, in confidence, unless compelled to disclose by judicial or
administrative process or by other requirements of applicable Law, all 

 



\- 37 -  confidential documents and information concerning the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, except to the extent that such information can be shown
to have been (i) in the public domain through no fault of Seller or its
Affiliates or (ii) later lawfully acquired by Seller from sources other than
those related to its prior ownership of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries.

 

6.7 _Publicity_.

Prior to the Closing, neither Seller nor Buyer shall issue any press release
or public announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions

otherwise required by applicable Law or by the applicable rules of any stock
exchange on which Buyer lists its securities, provided that, the
party intending to make such release shall, consistent with applicable Law,

less favorable to the Company Employees than as in effect on the Closing Date
and (ii) employee benefit plans and programs that are comparable, in the
aggregate, with the employee benefit plans and programs provided to similarly

are fair and reasonable

 



\- 39 -  and are reasonably required for the protection of the Company and Buyer. If

invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Agreement,

and interpret or reform this _Section 6.10_ to provide for a covenant having
the maximum enforceable geographic area, time period and other provisions (not
greater than those contained herein) as shall be valid and enforceable under
such applicable Law. Seller acknowledges that Buyer would be irreparably
harmed by any breach of this _Section 6.10_ and that there would be no

interfere with the conduct of its business or unreasonably disrupt its normal
operations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
neither party shall be required to disclose any information to the other party
if such disclosure would, in the disclosing partys sole discretion (y)
jeopardize any attorney-client privilege; or (z) contravene any applicable
Law or binding agreement ( _provided_ that the disclosing party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to disclose such information in a way that
would not jeopardize such privilege or to obtain the consent of third parties
to permit such disclosure, as applicable).

for prior periods. Seller shall provide Buyer with substantially final draft
Tax Returns required to be prepared by Seller pursuant to this _Section
6.12(b)_ at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the due date for filing
such return (or, if such Tax Return is required to be filed within thirty (30)
calendar days after the Closing Date, as soon as practicable after preparation
but prior to filing thereof), for Buyers review and comment and approval,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In the event of

period of ten (10) calendar days or such shorter or longer period as they may

shown on that Tax Return that is allocable to Seller under _Section 6.12(a)
_(the "Statement") at least thirty (30) calendar days before the due date for
filing that Tax Return for the review, comment and approval of Seller which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In the event of any
dispute with respect to such Tax Return or Statement, Seller and Buyer shall
negotiate in good faith to attempt to reach a resolution thereof for a period
of ten (10) calendar days or such shorter or longer period as they may agree
upon. Not later than five (5) Business Days before the due date for payment of
Taxes with respect to that Tax Return, Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount

\- 41 -  the Closing, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiaries, shall amend
or cause to be amended any Tax Return that relates to any Tax period or
portion thereof that ends on or before the Closing Date without the consent
of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

(e) After the Closing Date, Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller on the other
hand, shall provide each other with reasonable cooperation in connection with
the preparation of Tax Returns of the Company and shall make available to the
other and to any Taxing authority, as reasonably requested, all information,
records or documents in their possession relating to Tax liabilities or
potential Tax liabilities of the Company for all periods prior to or including
the Closing Date and shall preserve all such information, records and
documents in accordance with their regular document retention policies or as
provided above in _Section 6.11_.

 

(f) Any Tax refund of the Company or any Company Subsidiary received by Buyer,
its Affiliates or the Company to the extent that such refund relates to Taxes
paid by the Company or any Company Subsidiary for any Tax period or portion
thereof ending on the Closing Date is for the account of Seller (other than
(x) any such refunds to the extent they are reflected as Current Assets
for purposes of determining Final Closing Working Capital), together with
interest received from the applicable Taxing authority with respect to any
such refund or portion thereof, and Buyer shall pay over to Seller any such
refund net of any Taxes or other costs incurred in connection with receipt or
obtaining such refund within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt or
recognition thereof.

 

(g) Buyer and Seller shall each be responsible for fifty percent (50%) of all
sales, use, stamp, recordation and similar transfer Taxes imposed with
respect to the sale of the Company Interests and related transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(h) Buyer and Seller intend to treat the Escrow Amount as an installment
obligation for purposes of Section 453 of the Code, and except to the extent
required by applicable Law, neither Buyer nor Seller shall take any action or
filing position inconsistent with such characterization; _provided_ ,
_however_ , Seller may, in its sole determination, elect out of such
installment sale treatment.

 

(i) The parties agree that Change in Control Payments shall (A) be reported by
the Company, Buyer, Seller and any other recipients of such payments as
payments by the Company of compensation; (B) be paid through Company payroll;
and (C) to the extent paid to current or former employees, be treated as
"wages" subject to income and employment tax withholding. All deductions
arising from such payments, including with respect to any federal and state
income and employment Tax obligations arising in connection with such payments
and any deductions arising from the payment of Transaction Costs shall be
allocated to pre-Closing periods, and the parties shall file all Tax Returns
and reports consistent with such allocation to the extent permitted under
applicable Law.

 

(j) In the case of any Tax proceeding after the Closing Date involving any
Taxes of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries for any period prior
to the Closing for which Seller is liable under the terms of this Agreement,
Seller shall, upon written notice to Buyer, have the right to control, at its
own expense, the conduct of such Tax proceeding as a Third Party Claim under 
_Section 11.4(b)_.

arising before, on or after the Closing Date, including the distribution or
transfer of such entities to Seller or one or more of its Affiliates prior to

\- 49 - 11.3 _Obligation of Buyer to Indemnify._

 

Subject to the terms and conditions of this _Article XI_ , from and after the
Closing, Buyer agrees to indemnify Seller and its Affiliates and their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns in
respect of, and hold them harmless against, any and all Losses, based upon,
resulting from, arising out of or otherwise in respect of:

 

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any Warranty made by Buyer in this
Agreement or any certificate delivered hereunder (determined without regard
to any qualification or exception contained therein relating to materiality or
Material Adverse Effect or similar qualification or standard); or

 

(b) any breach or nonperformance of any covenants, obligations or agreements
made by Buyer or, after the Closing, the Company in this Agreement.

11.4 _Notice and Opportunity to Defend_.

 

(a) A party entitled to indemnification hereunder (an "Indemnified Party")
shall give the indemnifying party (an "Indemnifying Party") notice of any
matter which an Indemnified Party has determined has given or would give rise
to a right of indemnification under this Agreement, within thirty (30) days of
such determination, stating the Indemnified Partys reasonable estimate of
the amount of the Loss, if known and based on the facts then known, and method
of computation thereof, and containing a reference to the provisions of this
Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification is claimed or
arises; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to provide such notice shall
not release an Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this
_Article XI_, except to the extent Indemnifying Party is materially
prejudiced by such failure.

(b) If the matter specified in the notice provided in _Section 11.4(a)_
relates to a claim by a third party (a "Third Party Claim"), then such
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section 11.4(b)_, assume
and control the defense of such Third Party Claim at its expense and through
counsel of its choice (and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party)
if it gives notice of its intention to do so to the Indemnified Party within
twenty (20) calendar days of the receipt of such notice from the Indemnified
Party; _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume
or maintain control of the defense of any Third Party Claim (including any
settlement thereof) and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel retained
by the Indemnified

 



\- 50 -  Party if (w) the Indemnifying Party does not deliver to the Indemnified
Party an acknowledgement that it would have an indemnity obligation for the
Losses resulting from such Third Party Claim as provided under, and subject
to the terms and conditions of, this _Article XI_ within twenty (20) days of
receipt of notice of the Third Party Claim, (x) the Third Party Claim relates
to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action indictment,
allegation or investigation, (y) the Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or
equitable relief against the Indemnified Party that if granted would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Indemnified
Party, or (z) the Indemnifying Party has failed or is failing to prosecute or
defend vigorously the Third Party Claim. In the event that the Indemnifying
Party has not assumed the defense of such Third Party Claim within
a reasonable period after its notice of its intention to do so or does not
provide notice that it intends to do so within the required time, (i) the
Indemnified Party may defend against the Third Party Claim in any manner it
reasonably may deem appropriate; (ii) the Indemnifying Party will reimburse
the Indemnified Party promptly for the costs of defending against such Third
Party Claim (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses); and (iii) the
Indemnifying Party will remain responsible for any Losses the Indemnified
Party may incur resulting from such Third Party Claim, in each of (ii) and
(iii) to the extent the Indemnified Party is actually entitled to
indemnification hereunder for such costs or Losses. In the event an
Indemnifying Party exercises the right to undertake any such defense against
any such Third Party Claim as provided above, the Indemnified Party shall
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to
such Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, all witnesses,
pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnified Partys
possession or under the Indemnified Partys control relating thereto as
is reasonably required by such Indemnifying Party. Similarly, in the event
the Indemnified Party is, directly or indirectly, conducting the defense
against any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with the
Indemnified Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnified
Party, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, all such witnesses, records,
materials and information in the Indemnifying Partys possession or under the
Indemnifying Partys control relating thereto as is reasonably required by
the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense as
provided above, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in
the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from
the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it being understood, however,
that the Indemnifying Party shall control such defense and the Indemnifying
Party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by
the Indemnified Party for any period during which the Indemnifying Party has
not assumed the defense thereof to the extent such fees and expenses are
Losses for which the Indemnified Party is actually entitled to indemnification
hereunder. No such Third Party Claim may be settled by the Indemnifying Party
without the approval of the Indemnified Party, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

11.5 _Limitations on Liability._

(a)  _Inconsistencies_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement
to the contrary (other than _Section 6.12_ (Tax Matters)), the liability of
Buyer or Seller as an Indemnifying Party under every provision of this
Agreement (other than Sellers liability under _Section 6.12_ (Tax
Matters)), including without limitation the Warranties, shall be limited only
in the manner, and to the extent, set out in this _Section 11.5_. If there is
any inconsistency between the provisions of this _Section 11.5_ and any
other provision of this Agreement (other than _Section 6.12_ (Tax Matters)),
then the provisions of this _Section 11.5_ shall prevail.

 



\- 51 - (b) _Claim Value Limits_. Except with respect to Losses arising from breach of
the Fundamental Seller Representations (other than in respect of Losses
arising from breach of the representations or warranties in _Section 4.9(b)_,
to which the De Minimis Amount shall apply) or the Fundamental Buyer
Representations (as applicable), (i) neither Seller nor Buyer shall be liable
for indemnification under _Section 11.2(a)_ or _Section 11.3(a)_,
respectively, (other than, in the case of Seller, with respect to breaches of
the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.10_ (Taxes)) in
respect of any Losses unless and until the total aggregate amount of such
Losses exceeds Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) (the "Deductible"), in which
event Seller or Buyer, as applicable, shall only be liable for the Losses in
excess of the Deductible, and (ii) no Losses may be claimed for purposes of
_Section 11.2(a)_ or _Section 11.3(a)_ other than Losses in excess of Twenty
Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) (the "De Minimis Amount") resulting from any
single claim ( _provided_ that claims arising out of similar facts, events or
circumstances shall be aggregated for purposes of calculating the De
Minimis Amount). The total aggregate liability of (i) Seller under _Section
11.2(a)_ (other than with respect to breaches of representation and warranties
set forth in _Section 4.10_ (Taxes)) or (ii) Buyer under  _Section
11.3(a)_, shall not in any event exceed an amount equal to Sixty Five Million
Dollars ($65,000,000) in the aggregate (the "Cap"); _provided_ that the Cap
shall not apply to Losses in connection with a breach of the Fundamental
Seller Representations (excluding the representations and warranties in
_Section 4.9(b)_, to which the Cap shall apply) or the Fundamental Buyer
Representations (as applicable) or fraud. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, (A) in no event shall the respective
aggregate liability of each of Seller and Buyer (subject to the following
clause (B)) under or relating to this Agreement exceed an amount equal to the
Base Purchase Price, and (B) for the avoidance of doubt, none of the
foregoing limitations in this _Section 11.5(b)_ shall apply to Buyers
obligation to pay in full the Purchase Price owed pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(c) _Limitation of Damages_. NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR (I) SPECIAL,
PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY (EXCEPT FOR SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY DAMAGES AWARDED
IN A THIRD PARTY CLAIM), (II) CONSEQUENTIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES (OTHER THAN TO
THE EXTENT REASONABLY FORESEEABLE), WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT
LIABILITY, OTHER LAW OR OTHERWISE AND WHETHER OR NOT ARISING FROM ANY OTHER
PARTYS SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT.

(d) _Exclusive Remedy_. Except as set forth in _Sections 2.5(c_ ), _6.10_ and
_12.12_ , and except for fraud, from and after the Closing, the remedies
provided in this _Article XI_ shall be the sole recourse of Buyer or Seller
hereto for all Losses based upon, arising from or relating to any breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, except as set forth in _Sections
2.5(c),_ _6.11_ and _12.12_ , and except for fraud, from and after the
Closing, each party hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted under Law,
any and all rights, claims, and causes of action for any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, or obligation set forth herein
or otherwise relating

 



\- 52 -  to the subject matter of this Agreement it, its Affiliates and their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns may
have against the other party and its Affiliates and their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns arising under
or based upon any Law, except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set
forth in this _Article XI_.

 

(e) _Calculation of Losses_. The amount of any claims or Losses subject to
indemnification under this _Article XI_ shall be calculated net of any
amounts recovered by the party seeking indemnification or its Affiliates
(including the Company after the Closing) under applicable insurance policies
(but taking into account any deductible or retention and initial
premium increase resulting therefrom), and such party agrees to make or cause
to be made all commercially reasonable claims for insurance under such
policies that may be applicable to the matter giving rise to the
indemnification claim hereunder. The amount of any such Losses shall be
calculated net of the present value of any Tax benefits to the party seeking
indemnification and its Affiliates (including the Company after the Closing)
resulting from the matter giving rise to the indemnification claim hereunder
(computed at the highest effective marginal tax rates at which such Person is
then paying Taxes and limited to the extent that the Tax benefits are actually
recognized with respect to the tax year or prior tax years of such Person,
in which such Loss is claimed).

(f) _No Duplication_. Buyer and the Company shall not be entitled to
indemnification from Seller hereunder to the extent there has been included
in the calculation of the Purchase Price adjustment (pursuant to _Section
2.5_) a specific liability or reserve relating to such matter, including (i) a
Current Liability included in the calculation of the Final Closing Working
Capital, or (ii) Closing Indebtedness or Transaction Costs included in the
final calculation of the Purchase Price.

 

(g) _Satisfaction of Claims_. Except for Losses indemnified under _Section
11.2(f)_, for which the Buyer may elect in its sole discretion to be
satisfied either from the Escrow Amount or directly by Seller, the
indemnification obligations of Seller pursuant to this _Article XI_ shall be
satisfied, subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement,
first from the Escrow Amount and then directly by Seller.

(h) _Release_. Except as contemplated by the terms of this Agreement or
any other agreement to be executed pursuant to the terms hereof, or any other
ordinary course commercial agreements between the parties hereto or their
respective Affiliates, Seller hereby waives, releases and discharges, from and
after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any
and all rights, liabilities, claims and causes of action, howsoever arising,
they may have against Buyer, its Affiliates (including the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries) and their respective officers, directors, employees,
agents, successors and assigns (as applicable) that arose during or relate to
any period prior to the Closing.

failure on the part of any party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any

\- 56 - 12.8 _Severability._

 

If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or
incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy, all other terms or
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to
the greatest extent possible.

 

12.9 _Binding Effect; Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries._

 

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Except as set forth in
_Article XI_ , nothing in this Agreement shall create or be deemed to create
any third party beneficiary rights in any person or entity not a party to this
Agreement. No assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or
obligations hereunder may be made by any party, directly or indirectly (by
operation of Law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other
parties hereto (which may be withheld in their sole discretion) and any
attempted assignment without the required consents shall be void, except that
Buyer may transfer or assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement,
in whole or from time to time in part, to (i) one or more of its Affiliates at
any time and (ii) on or after the Closing Date, to any Person.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no assignment of any obligations hereunder
shall relieve the parties hereto of any such obligations.

 

12.10 _Counterparts._

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which
will be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement and all of which, when
taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same agreement.

 

12.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial._

EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL
PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS AGREEMENT, OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. Each party
hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other
party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would
not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and
(b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to
enter into this Agreement, Seller Documents and Buyer Documents, as
applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in
this _Section 12.11_.

 



\- 57 - 12.12 _Specific Performance_.

 

The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the
Parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

 

12.13 _Disclosure Schedules._

The Disclosure Schedules have been arranged for purposes of convenience only,
in sections corresponding to the Sections of _Article IV_. Any exception or
qualification set forth in the Disclosure Schedules with respect to a
particular representation or warranty contained in _Article IV_ of this
Agreement shall be deemed to be an exception or qualification with respect to
all other applicable representations and warranties contained in _Article IV_
of this Agreement to which the relevance of such exception or qualification
is reasonably apparent on its face to be applicable, whether or not such
exception or qualification is so numbered. To the extent that any
representation or warranty contained in _Article IV_ of this Agreement is
limited or qualified by the materiality of the matters to which the
representation or warranty is given, the inclusion of any matter in the
Disclosure Schedules does not constitute a determination by Seller that
such matters are material. In addition, under no circumstances shall the
disclosure of any matter in the Disclosure Schedules where a representation or
warranty in _Article IV_ of this Agreement is limited or qualified by the
materiality of the matters to which the representation or warranty is given
imply that any other undisclosed matter having a greater value or other
significance is material.

 

12.14 _No Recourse to Lenders._

 

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, Seller agrees on its behalf
and on behalf of the Company and their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates
that (i) none of the Buyers lenders or other debt financing sources nor their
respective Affiliates, successors or assigns, nor their respective current,
former or future officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives,
stockholders, limited partners, managers, members or partners (collectively,
the "Lender Related Parties") shall have any liability or obligation (whether
at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) to Seller, Company and
their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated herein (including any
financing thereof) and (ii) the Lender Related Parties are express
third party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, any of the provisions set
forth in this _Section 12.14_, and in _Section 12.2_ and _Section 12.11_,
all of which shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the Seller; 
_provided_ , _however_ , the waivers of liability and obligation in clause (i)
shall not apply with respect to any Legal Proceedings initiated or pursued by
any Lender Related Parties.
