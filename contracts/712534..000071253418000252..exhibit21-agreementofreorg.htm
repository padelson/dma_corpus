SECTION 3



CONSIDERATION TO BE DISTRUBUTED



3.1 Consideration. Upon and by reason of the Merger becoming effective, the
holders of record, on the Effective Date, of MBT common stock, without par
value ("MBT Common Stock") shall be entitled to receive, in exchange for each
share of MBT Common Stock held, a 0.2750 (the "Exchange Ratio") share of First
Merchants' common stock ("First Merchants Common Stock"). The Exchange Ratio
shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 3.3.



3.2 Fractional First Merchants Common Shares. Certificates for fractional
shares of First Merchants Common Stock shall not be issued in respect of
fractional interests arising from the Exchange Ratio. Each holder of MBT
Common Stock who would have otherwise been entitled to a fraction of a share
of First Merchants Common Stock, upon surrender of all such shareholder's
certificates representing MBT Common Stock, shall be paid in cash (without
interest), an amount rounded to the nearest whole cent, determined by
multiplying the First Merchants Average Price (as defined below) by the
fractional share of First Merchants Common Stock to which such holder of MBT
Common Stock would otherwise be entitled. No such holder of MBT Common Stock
shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights, or any other rights in respect
of any fractional share. The term "First Merchants Average Price" shall mean
the average closing price of a share of First Merchants Common Stock as
reported by Bloomberg, L.P. for the ten (10) days that First Merchants Common
Stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market preceding the fourth (4th)
calendar day prior to the Effective Date. The First Merchants Average Price
shall be appropriately and proportionately adjusted to reflect any share
adjustment as contemplated by Section 3.3 hereof. 



3.3 Recapitalization. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Date, First Merchants issues a stock dividend with respect to its shares of
common stock, combines, subdivides, or splits up its outstanding shares or
takes any similar recapitalization action, then the Exchange Ratio shall be
adjusted so that each holder of MBT Common Stock shall receive such number of
shares of First Merchants Common Stock as represents the same percentage of
outstanding shares of First Merchants Common Stock at the Effective Date as
would have been represented by the number of shares of First Merchants Common
Stock such shareholder would have received if the recapitalization had not
occurred.



3.4 Distribution of First Merchants' Common Stock.



(a)Each share of common stock of First Merchants outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Date shall remain outstanding unaffected by the Merger.

(b)On or prior to the Effective Date, First Merchants shall (i) authorize the
issuance of and shall make available to American Stock Transfer and Trust
Company, LLC or such other exchange agent selected by First Merchants (the
"Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the registered shareholders of MBT
Common Stock for exchange in accordance with this Section 3, certificates or
book entry for shares (as requested by the registered shareholder of MBT) of
First Merchants Common Stock (the "First Merchants Stock Certificates") to be
issued pursuant to Section 3.1, and (ii) shall deposit with the Exchange Agent
sufficient cash for payment of cash in lieu of any fractional shares of First
Merchants Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.2. Such First Merchants
Stock Certificates and cash are referred to in this Section 3 as the "Exchange
Fund." First Merchants shall be solely responsible for the payment of any fees
and expenses of the Exchange Agent.



(c)Within three (3) business days following the Effective Date, the Exchange
Agent shall mail to each holder of MBT Common Stock a letter of transmittal
(the "Letter of Transmittal") providing (i) with respect to MBT shareholders
whose shares of MBT Common Stock are held in certificate form that delivery
shall be effected and risk of loss of title to the certificates representing
MBT Common Stock shall pass only upon delivery of the certificates to the
Exchange Agent and (ii) with respect to MBT shareholders whose shares of MBT
Common Stock are held in certificate form instructions as to the transmittal
to the Exchange Agent of certificates representing shares of MBT Common Stock
and, with respect to all holders of MBT Common Stock, instructions as to the
issuance of shares of First Merchants Common Stock in exchange therefor
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Distribution of shares of First
Merchants Common Stock Certificates (or book entry) and cash payments in lieu
of fractional shares shall be made by the Exchange Agent to each former holder
of MBT Common Stock within five (5) business days following the later of the
Effective Date or with respect to MBT shareholders whose shares of MBT Common
Stock are held in certificate form, the date of such shareholder's delivery to
the Exchange Agent of such shareholder's certificates representing MBT Common
Stock, and with respect to all holders of MBT Common Stock a properly
completed and executed Letter of Transmittal. Interest shall not accrue or be
payable with respect to any cash payments.



(d)Following the Effective Date, stock certificates representing MBT Common
Stock shall be converted to, and deemed to evidence only the right to receive
such number of shares of First Merchants Common Stock as determined in
accordance with Sections 3.1 and 3.2 above (for all corporate purposes other
than the payment of dividends) and cash for fractional shares, as applicable.
No dividends or other distributions otherwise payable subsequent to the
Effective Date on shares of 



First Merchants Common Stock shall be paid to any shareholder entitled to
receive the same until such shareholder has surrendered such shareholder's
certificates for MBT Common Stock to the Exchange Agent in exchange for First
Merchants Common Stock. Upon surrender or compliance with the provisions of
Section 3.4(c), there shall be paid to the record holder of First Merchants
Common Stock the amount of all dividends and other distributions, without
interest thereon, withheld with respect to such common stock.



(e)From and after the Effective Date, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of MBT of any shares of MBT Common Stock.



(f)Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
MBT Common Stock for twelve (12) months after the Effective Date shall be
paid, distributed, or otherwise released to First Merchants, or its successors
in interest. Any shareholders of MBT who have not theretofore complied with
this Section 3 shall thereafter look only to First Merchants, or its
successors in interest, for the issuance of shares of First Merchants Common
Stock and any unpaid dividends and distributions on First Merchants Common
Stock deliverable in respect of each share of MBT Common Stock such
shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of First Merchants, the Exchange Agent or any other person
shall be liable to any former holder of shares of MBT Common Stock for any
amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.



(g)First Merchants shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books of
MBT to establish the persons entitled to receive shares of First Merchants
Common Stock, which books, in the absence of actual knowledge by First
Merchants of any adverse claim thereto, shall be conclusive with respect to
the ownership of such stock.



(h)With respect to any certificate for MBT Common Stock which has been lost,
stolen, or destroyed, First Merchants shall be authorized to issue First
Merchants Common Stock to the registered owner of such certificate upon
receipt of an affidavit of lost stock certificate, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to First Merchants, and upon compliance by such
registered owner with all procedures historically required by MBT in
connection with lost, stolen, or destroyed certificates, with any costs
incurred at the shareholder's expense.



3.5 Employee Equity Awards. Immediately prior to the Closing, each then
outstanding stock appreciation right (SOSAR) and restricted stock unit (RSU),
whether unvested or vested, shall be exchanged for shares of MBT Common Stock
according to their respective award agreement terms. The number of RSU's
subject to each award shall assume MBT performance at the full payout at the
Target level for all relevant future periods. Upon issuance of the shares of
MBT Common Stock to a holder of SOSARs or RSUs any award agreement between MBT
and such holder and the holder's rights thereunder shall terminate and be of
no further force or effect. 



SECTION 4



NO DISSENTING SHAREHOLDERS



Holders of shares of MBT Common Stock, pursuant to the Michigan Business
Corporation Act, MBT's articles of incorporation or bylaws, contract or
otherwise, do not have, and the Board of Directors of MBT have not taken any
action that would cause any holder of shares of MBT Common Stock to have, the
right of a shareholder to dissent and obtain payment for shares under Section
450.1762 of the Michigan Business Corporation Act or any successor statute.

will (i) conflict with, result in a breach of, or constitute a default under
MBT's or any Subsidiary's organizational documents; (ii) conflict with, result
in a breach of, or constitute a default under any federal, foreign, state or
local law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation or court or administrative

For the purpose of this Agreement, a "Material Adverse Effect" means any
effect, circumstance, occurrence or change that (i) is material and adverse to
the financial position, results of operations or business of MBT and the
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or First Merchants and FMB taken as a whole, as
applicable or (ii) would materially impair the ability of MBT or First

by courts or governmental authorities, (b) changes in generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP") or regulatory accounting requirements
applicable to banks or their holding companies generally, (c) any

circumstances relating to or that affect either the United States economy,
financial or securities markets or the banking industry, generally, (f)
changes resulting from expenses (such as legal, accounting and investment
bankers' fees) incurred in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated herein, including without limitation payment of any amounts due
to, or the provision of any benefits to, any officers or employees under
agreements, plans or other arrangements in existence on the date of or
contemplated by this Agreement and disclosed to First Merchants, (g) the
impact of the announcement of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, and compliance with this Agreement on the business, financial
condition or results of operations of MBT and the Subsidiaries, or First
Merchants and FMB, as applicable and (h) the occurrence of any military or
terrorist attack within the United States or any of its possessions or
offices; provided that in no event shall a change in the trading price of the
First Merchants Common Stock, by itself, be considered to constitute a
Material 



Adverse Effect on First Merchants (it being understood that the foregoing
proviso shall not prevent or otherwise affect a determination that any effect
underlying such decline has resulted in a Material Adverse Effect).

(c) Other than required filings with NASDAQ and FINRA and the filing of
articles of merger (the "Articles of Merger") with the Indiana Secretary of
State and a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the
Corporations Division of the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory

or consent or approval of, any third party is necessary for the consummation
by MBT or the Bank of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except

Adverse Effect.

MBT and the Subsidiaries in effect as of the date of this Agreement.



5.5 Compliance with Law. Except as disclosed on the MBT Disclosure Schedule,
to the Knowledge of MBT's Management (as defined below), neither MBT nor any

which has resulted or could reasonably be expected to result, in the violation
of any local, state, federal or foreign law, statute, rule, regulation or
ordinance or of any order, injunction, judgment or decree of any court or
government agency or body, the violation of which could reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on MBT. MBT and each Subsidiary possess all
licenses, franchises, permits and other authorizations necessary for the
continued conduct of their respective businesses without material interference
or interruption, except where the failure to possess such licenses or other
authorizations would not be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse

be transferred to First Merchants on the Effective Date without any material
restrictions or limitations thereon or the need to obtain any consents of
third parties, except as otherwise 



set forth in the MBT Disclosure Letter. Neither MBT nor any Subsidiary is

applicable to MBT. The Bank received a rating of "satisfactory" or better in
its most recent examination or interim review with respect to the Community
Reinvestment Act.



5.6 Accuracy of Statements. No information which has been or shall be supplied
by MBT with respect to its businesses, operations and financial condition for
inclusion in the proxy statement, registration statement, or regulatory
applications relating to the Merger or the Bank Merger contains or shall
contain (in the case of information relating to the proxy statement at the
time it is mailed and for the regulatory applications and registration
statement, and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any, at the time it
becomes effective) any untrue statement of a material fact or omits or shall
omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements contained
therein not misleading.



5.7 Litigation and Pending Proceedings. Except as set forth in the MBT
Disclosure Letter, there are no claims of any kind, nor any action, suits,
proceedings, arbitrations or investigations pending or, to the knowledge of
MBT's Management, threatened in any court or before any government agency or
body, arbitration panel or otherwise (nor does MBT's Management have any
knowledge of a basis for any claim, action, suit, proceeding, arbitration or
investigation) which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. To the knowledge of MBT's Management, there are no uncured violations,
criticisms or exceptions, or violations with respect to which refunds or
restitutions may be required, cited in any report, correspondence or other
communication to MBT or any Subsidiary as a result of an examination by any
regulatory agency or body which could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.



5.8 Financial Statements.



(a) MBT's consolidated audited balance sheets as of the end of the two (2)
fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the unaudited consolidated
balance sheet for the period ended June 30, 2018 and the related consolidated
statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for the years or
period then ended (hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Financial
Information") present fairly the consolidated financial condition or position
of MBT as of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of
operations of MBT for the respective periods covered thereby and have been
prepared in conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent basis.



(b) All loans reflected in the Financial Information and which have been made,
extended or acquired since June 30, 2018 (i) have been made for good, valuable
and adequate consideration in the ordinary course of business; (ii) constitute
the legal, valid and binding obligation of the obligor and any guarantor named
therein; (iii) are evidenced by notes, 



instruments or other evidences of indebtedness which are true, genuine and
what they purport to be; and (iv) to the extent that the Bank has a security
interest in collateral or a mortgage securing such loans, are secured by
perfected security interests or mortgages naming the Bank as the secured party
or mortgagee, except for such unperfected security interests or mortgages
naming the Bank as secured party or mortgagee which, on an individual loan
basis, would not materially adversely affect the value of any such loan and
the recovery of payment on any such loan if the Bank is not able to enforce
any such security interest or mortgage.



5.9 Absence of Certain Changes. Except for events and conditions relating to
the business and interest rate environment in general, the accrual or payment
of Merger-related expenses, or as set forth in the MBT Disclosure Letter,
since June 30, 2018, no events have occurred which could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in the MBT
Disclosure Letter, between the period from June 30, 2018 to the date of this
Agreement, MBT and each Subsidiary have carried on their respective businesses
in the ordinary and usual course consistent with their past practices
(excluding the incurrence of fees and expenses of professional advisors
related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby) and there

(a) Except as set forth in the MBT Disclosure Letter, there is no loan of the
Bank in excess of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($250,000.00)
that, as of June 30, 2018, (i) has been classified by MBT, applying applicable
regulatory examination standards, as "Other Loans Specially Mentioned,"
"Substandard," "Doubtful" or "Loss;" (ii) has been identified by accountants
or auditors (internal or external) as having a significant risk of
uncollectibility, or (iii) has been identified by MBT Management to be ninety
(90) days or more past due with respect to principal or interest or has placed

(b) The reserves for loan and lease losses and the carrying value for other
real estate owned which are shown on each of the balance sheets contained in
the Financial Information were adequate in the judgment of MBT's Management

charged off, on loans and leases outstanding and other real estate owned
(including accrued interest receivable) as of the applicable date of such

reflected in the Financial Information and none of the investments made by MBT

to any repurchase agreements with respect to securities.



5.13 Employee Benefit Plans.

contributed to by MBT, any Subsidiary or any other entity, trade or business
that, together with MBT, would be treated as a single employer under the
provisions of Sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code ("MBT ERISA
Affiliate"), and covers any employee, director or former employee or director
of MBT, any Subsidiary or any MBT ERISA Affiliate under which MBT or any MBT
ERISA Affiliate has any liability. The MBT Disclosure Letter also contains a
list of all "employee benefit plans" as defined under ERISA which have been
terminated by MBT, any Subsidiary or any MBT ERISA Affiliate since January 1,
2013. Copies of such plans (and, if applicable, related trust agreements or
insurance 



contracts) and all amendments thereto and written interpretations thereof have
been furnished to First Merchants together with the three (3) most recent
annual reports (Form 5500) prepared in connection with any such plan and the
current summary plan descriptions (and any summary of material modifications
thereto). Such plans are hereinafter referred to individually as an "Employee
Plan" and collectively as the "Employee Plans." The Employee Plans which
individually or collectively would constitute an "employee pension benefit
plan" as defined in Section 3(2)(A) of ERISA are identified as such in the
list referred to above.

applicable laws, regulations, rulings and other requirements, as well as

statutory or administrative exemption exists, and no "reportable event," as
defined in Section 4043(c) of ERISA, for which a notice is required to be
filed, has occurred with respect to any Employee Plan that could subject MBT
to material taxes or penalties. Neither MBT, any Subsidiary nor any MBT ERISA
Affiliate has any material liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation ("PBGC"), to the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), to the
Department of Labor ("DOL"), to the Employee Benefits Security Administration,
with respect to any Employee Plan, except for routine premium payments to the
PBGC.



(d) To the knowledge of MBT's Management, no "fiduciary," as defined in
Section 3(21) of ERISA, of an Employee Plan has failed to comply with the
requirements of Section 404 of ERISA in such a way as to cause material
liability to MBT, any Subsidiary or any MBT ERISA Affiliate.



(e) Each of the Employee Plans which is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has been timely amended to comply in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Code. Except as set forth in the MBT

letters with respect to any such Employee Plan that is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.



(f) Except as disclosed in the MBT Disclosure Letter, no Employee Plan has
incurred an "accumulated funding deficiency," as determined under Section 412
of the Code and Section 302 of ERISA. MBT has at all times met the minimum
funding standard, and has made all contributions required, under Section 412
of the Code and Section 302 of ERISA. No facts or circumstances exist that may
subject MBT, any Subsidiary, or any MBT ERISA Affiliate, to any liability
under Sections 4062, 4063 or 4064 of ERISA. Neither MBT, any Subsidiary nor
any MBT ERISA Affiliate ever has engaged in any transaction within the meaning
of Section 4069 of ERISA. Except as disclosed in the MBT Disclosure Letter,
there exist no facts or circumstances which could subject MBT, or any MBT
ERISA Affiliate thereof, to withdrawal liability within the meaning of Section
4201 of ERISA or to contingent 



withdrawal liability under Section 4204 of ERISA. Neither MBT nor any MBT
ERISA Affiliate ever has been a party to a transaction within the meaning of
Section 4212(c) of ERISA.



(g) No Employee Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA has been terminated or
incurred a partial termination (either voluntarily or involuntarily), in such
a way as to cause material additional liability to MBT, any Subsidiary or any
MBT ERISA Affiliate.



(h) No claims involving an Employee Plan (other than normal benefit claims)
have been filed in a court of law or, to the knowledge of MBT's Management,
have been threatened to be filed in a court of law.



(i) Except as set forth in the MBT Disclosure Letter, there is no contract,
agreement, plan or arrangement covering any employee, director or former
employee or director of MBT or any Subsidiary that, individually or
collectively, could give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be
deductible by reason of Section 280G or Section 162(a)(1) of the Code.



(j) To the knowledge of MBT's Management, no event has occurred that would
cause the imposition of the tax described in Section 4980B of the Code on MBT.
To the knowledge of MBT's Management, MBT has materially complied with all
requirements of Section 601 of ERISA, as applicable, with respect to any
Employee Plan.



(k) The MBT Disclosure Letter contains a list of each employment, severance or
other similar contract, arrangement or policy and each plan or arrangement
(written or oral) providing for insurance coverage (including any self-insured
arrangements), workers' compensation, disability benefits, supplemental

compensation, profit sharing, bonuses, stock options, stock appreciation or
other forms of incentive compensation or post-retirement insurance,

into, maintained or contributed to, as the case may be, by MBT or any
Subsidiary and (iii) covers any employee, director or former employee or
director of MBT or any Subsidiary. Such contracts, plans and arrangements as
are described above, copies or descriptions of all of which have been
furnished previously to First Merchants, are hereinafter referred to
collectively as the "Benefit Arrangements." Each of the Benefit Arrangements
has been maintained in compliance in all material respects with its terms and
with the requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, orders, rules and
regulations which are applicable to such Benefit Arrangements.



(l) Except as set forth in the MBT Disclosure Letter or as required by

former employees or directors of MBT, any Subsidiary or any MBT ERISA
Affiliate.



(m) Except as set forth in the MBT Disclosure Letter, there has been no
amendment to, written interpretation or announcement (whether or not written)
by MBT, any Subsidiary or any MBT ERISA Affiliate relating to, or change in
employee participation or coverage under, any Employee Plan or Benefit
Arrangement administered by MBT or any MBT ERISA 



Affiliate which would increase materially the expense of maintaining such
Employee Plans or Benefit Arrangements above the level of the expense incurred
in respect thereof for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.



(n) Except as otherwise provided in the MBT Disclosure Letter, the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement will not cause acceleration of
vesting in, or payment of, any material benefits under any Employee Plan or
Benefit Arrangement and will not otherwise materially accelerate or increase
any obligation under any Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement.



(o) With respect to any nonqualified deferred compensation plan that is
subject to Section 409A of the Code, such plan has been identified on the MBT

adequate accruals and/or reserves for payment thereof would not have a
Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in the MBT Disclosure Letter, all
obligations and liabilities of MBT and the Subsidiaries, whether arising by
operation of law, by contract, or by past custom, for all forms of
compensation which are or may be payable to their current or former directors,

accruals and/or reserves for payment therefore have been and are being made in
accordance with GAAP, except where the failure to pay any such obligations and
liabilities or to maintain adequate accruals and/or reserves for payment
thereof would not have a Material Adverse Effect. All accruals and reserves
referred to in this Section 5.14 are correctly and accurately reflected and
accounted for in the books, statements and records of MBT and the
Subsidiaries, except where the failure to correctly and accurately reflect and
account for such accruals and reserves would not have a Material Adverse

applicable laws, statutes, rules, regulations and ordinances applicable
thereto.

business that, together with First Merchants, would be treated as a single
employer under the provisions of Sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code
("First Merchants ERISA Affiliate"), and covers any employee, director or
former employee or director of First Merchants or any First Merchants ERISA
Affiliate under which First Merchants or any First Merchants ERISA Affiliate
has any liability. The First Merchants Disclosure Letter also contains a list
of all "employee benefit plans" as defined under ERISA which have been

interpretations thereof have been furnished to MBT together with the three (3)
most recent annual reports (Form 5500) prepared in connection with any such
plan and the current summary plan descriptions (and any summary of material
modifications thereto). Such plans are hereinafter referred to individually as
a "First Merchants Employee Plan" and collectively as the "First Merchants
Employee Plans." The First Merchants Employee Plans which individually or
collectively would constitute an "employee pension benefit plan" as defined in
Section 3(2)(A) of ERISA are identified as such in the list referred to above.

defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA, of a First Merchants Employee Plan has
failed to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of ERISA in such a way
as to cause material liability to First Merchants or any First Merchants ERISA
Affiliate.



(e) Each of the First Merchants Employee Plans which is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has been timely amended to comply

Merchants ERISA Affiliate ever has engaged in any transaction within the
meaning of Section 4069 of ERISA. Except as disclosed in the First Merchants

First Merchants, or any First Merchants ERISA Affiliate thereof, to withdrawal
liability within the meaning of Section 4201 of ERISA or to contingent
withdrawal liability under Section 4204 of ERISA. Neither First Merchants nor
any First Merchants ERISA Affiliate ever has been a party to a transaction
within the meaning of Section 4212(c) of ERISA.

terminated or incurred a partial termination (either voluntarily or
involuntarily), in such a way as to cause material additional liability to
First Merchants or any First Merchants ERISA Affiliate.



(h) No claims involving a First Merchants Employee Plan (other than normal
benefit claims) have been filed in a court of law or, to the knowledge of
First Merchants' Management, have been threatened to be filed in a court of
law.



(i) There is no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement covering any
employee, director or former employee or director of First Merchants or any

of any amount that would not be deductible by reason of Section 280G or
Section 162(a)(1) of the Code.



(j) To the knowledge of First Merchants' Management, no event has occurred
that would cause the imposition of the tax described in Section 4980B of the

deferred compensation, profit sharing, bonuses, stock options, stock
appreciation or other forms of incentive compensation or post-retirement
insurance, compensation or benefits which (i) is not a First Merchants
Employee Plan, (ii) was entered into, maintained or contributed to, as the
case may be, by First Merchants or any First Merchants Subsidiary and (iii)
covers any employee, director or former employee or director of First
Merchants or any First Merchants Subsidiary. Such contracts, plans and

have been furnished previously to First Merchants, are hereinafter referred to

material respects with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by any
and all statutes, orders, rules and regulations which are applicable to such
First Merchants Benefit Arrangements.

written) by First Merchants or any First Merchants ERISA Affiliate relating
to, or change in employee participation or coverage under, any First Merchants
Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement administered by First Merchants or any
First Merchants ERISA Affiliate which would increase materially the expense of
maintaining such First Merchants Employee Plans or First Merchants Benefit
Arrangements above the level of the expense incurred in respect thereof for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.



(n) Except as otherwise provided in the First Merchants Disclosure Letter, the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement will not cause acceleration of
vesting in, or payment of, any material benefits under any First Merchants
Employee Plan or Benefit Arrangement and will not otherwise materially
accelerate or increase any obligation under any First Merchants Employee Plan
or Benefit Arrangement.



(o) With respect to any nonqualified deferred compensation plan that is

income taxes and franchise fees) that may become payable in future years with
respect to any transactions consummated prior to June 30, 2018. Neither First

certain date, which shall have been true and correct as of such date), and no
such filings, at the time they were filed, contained any untrue statement of a

rights of its customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the
entity in possession or control of such information or contravene any law,
rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties will make
appropriate and reasonable substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.



7.4 Preservation of Business. On and after the date of this Agreement and
until the Effective Date or until this Agreement is terminated as herein
provided, MBT and the Subsidiaries shall (a) carry on their business
diligently, substantially in the same manner as heretofore conducted, and in
the ordinary course of business; (b) use commercially reasonable efforts to
preserve their business organizations intact, to keep their present officers
and employees and to preserve their present relationship with customers and
others having business dealings with them; and (c) not do or fail to do
anything which will cause a material breach of, or material default in, any
contract, agreement, commitment, obligation, understanding, arrangement, lease
or license to which they are a party or by which they are or may be subject or
bound.



7.5 Other Negotiations.



(a) MBT shall not, and shall cause the Bank to not, during the term of this
Agreement, directly or indirectly, solicit, encourage or facilitate inquiries
or proposals or enter into any agreement with respect to, or initiate or
participate in any negotiations or discussions with any person or entity
concerning, any proposed transaction or series of transactions involving or
affecting MBT or the Subsidiaries (or the securities or assets of the
foregoing) that, if effected, would constitute an acquisition of control of
either MBT, or the Subsidiaries within the meaning of 12 U.S.C. ยง1817(j)
(disregarding the exceptions set forth in 12 U.S.C. ยง1817(j)(17)) and the
regulations of the Federal Reserve Board thereunder (each, an "Acquisition
Proposal"), or furnish any information to any person or entity proposing or
seeking an Acquisition Proposal.



(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that MBT's Board of Directors
determines in good faith and after consultation with outside counsel, that in
light of an Acquisition Proposal, it is necessary to provide such information
or engage in such negotiations or discussions in order to act in a manner
consistent with such Board's fiduciary duties, MBT's Board of Directors may,
in response to an Acquisition Proposal which was not solicited by or on behalf
of MBT or the Bank or which did not otherwise result from a breach of Section
7.5(a), subject to its compliance with Section 7.5(c), (i) furnish information
with respect to MBT or the Bank to such person or entity making such
Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement that is
no less restrictive than the Confidentiality Agreement between MBT and First
Merchants and (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such
Acquisition Proposal. In the event that MBT's Board of Directors determines in
good faith and after consultation with outside counsel, that the Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Acquisition Proposal (as defined below) and that it is
necessary to pursue such Superior Acquisition Proposal in order to act in a
manner consistent with such Board's fiduciary duties, MBT may (A) withdraw,
modify or otherwise change in a manner adverse to First Merchants, the
recommendation of MBT's Board of Directors to its shareholders with respect to
this Agreement and the Merger, and/or (B) terminate this 



Agreement in order to concurrently enter into an agreement with respect to
such Superior Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that MBT's Board of
Directors may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.5(b)
unless and until (x) ten (10) business days have elapsed following the
delivery to First Merchants of a written notice of such determination by MBT's
Board of Directors and during such ten (10) business-day period, MBT and the
Bank otherwise cooperate with First Merchants with the intent of enabling the
parties to engage in good faith negotiations so that the Merger and other
transactions contemplated hereby may be effected and (y) at the end of such
ten (10) business-day period MBT's Board of Directors continues reasonably to
believe the Acquisition Proposal at issue constitutes a Superior Acquisition
Proposal. A "Superior Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any Acquisition
Proposal containing terms which MBT's Board of Directors determines in its
good faith judgment (based on the advice of an independent financial advisor)
to be more favorable to MBT's shareholders than the Merger and for which
financing, to the extent required, is then committed or which, in the good
faith judgment of MBT's Board of Directors, is reasonably capable of being
obtained by such third party, but shall exclude any Acquisition Proposal the
terms of which were made known to MBT's Board of Directors prior to the date
of this Agreement.



(c) In addition to the obligations of MBT set forth in Section 7.5(a) and (b),
MBT shall advise First Merchants orally and in writing as soon as reasonably
practicable of any request (whether oral or in writing) for information or of
any inquiries, proposals, discussions or indications of interest (whether oral
or in writing) with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, the material terms
and conditions of such request or Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the
person or entity making such request or Acquisition Proposal. MBT shall keep
First Merchants reasonably informed of the status and details (including
amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request or Acquisition
Proposal, including the status of any discussions or negotiations with respect
to any Superior Acquisition Proposal.



7.6 Announcement; Press Releases. In connection with the execution of this
Agreement, MBT and First Merchants intend to jointly issue a press release
mutually acceptable to the parties. Except as otherwise required by law,
neither MBT nor the Bank shall issue any additional press releases or make any
other public announcements or disclosures relating to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior approval of First Merchants
provided, however, that nothing in this Section 7.6 shall be deemed to
prohibit any party from making any disclosure that its counsel deems necessary
in order to satisfy such party's disclosure obligation imposed by law.



7.7 MBT Disclosure Letter. MBT shall supplement, amend and update as of the
Effective Date the MBT Disclosure Letter with respect to any matters hereafter
arising which, if in existence or having occurred as of the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in the MBT
Disclosure Letter. If, at any time prior to the Effective Date, MBT becomes
aware of a fact or matter that might indicate that any of the representations
and warranties of MBT herein may be untrue, incorrect or misleading in any
material respect, MBT shall promptly disclose such fact or matter to First
Merchants in writing.





7.8 Confidentiality. MBT and the Subsidiaries shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause their respective officers, employees, and
authorized representatives to hold in strict confidence all confidential data
and information obtained by them from First Merchants, unless such information
(a) was already known to MBT and the Subsidiaries, (b) becomes available to
MBT and the Subsidiaries from other sources, (c) is independently developed by
MBT and the Subsidiaries, (d) is disclosed by MBT or the Subsidiaries with and
in accordance with the terms of prior written approval of First Merchants, or
(e) is or becomes readily ascertainable from public or published information
or trade sources or public disclosure of such information is required by law
or requested by a court or other governmental agency, commission, or
regulatory body. MBT and the Subsidiaries further agree that, in the event
this Agreement is terminated, they will return to First Merchants, or destroy,
all information obtained by MBT and the Subsidiaries from First Merchants or a
First Merchants Subsidiary, including all copies made of such information by
MBT and the Subsidiaries. This provision shall survive the Effective Date or
the earlier termination of this Agreement.



7.9 Cooperation. MBT and the Bank shall generally cooperate with First
Merchants and its officers, employees, attorneys, accountants and other
agents, and, generally, do such other acts and things in good faith as may be
reasonable, necessary or appropriate to timely effectuate the intents and
purposes of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, (a) MBT shall cooperate
and assist First Merchants in the preparation of and/or filing of all
regulatory applications, the Registration Statement, and all other
documentation required to be prepared for consummation of the Merger and the
Bank Merger and obtaining all necessary approvals, and (b) MBT shall furnish
First Merchants with all information concerning itself and the Subsidiaries
that First Merchants may request in connection with the preparation of the
documentation referenced above.



7.10 MBT Fairness Opinion. On the date hereof or as soon as reasonably
practicable following the date hereof, MBT shall use its reasonable best
efforts to procure the written opinion from Sandler O'Neill and Partners, L.P.
to the Board of Directors of MBT to the effect that, as of the date of this
Agreement, the Exchange Ratio is fair, from a financial point of view, to the
holders of MBT Common Stock (the "MBT Fairness Opinion"). The MBT Fairness
Opinion shall be included in the Proxy Statement (as defined below).



7.11 Financial Statements and Other Reports. Promptly upon its becoming
available, MBT shall furnish to First Merchants one (1) copy of each financial
statement, report, notice, or proxy statement sent by MBT to its shareholders
generally or filed with any MBT Regulatory Authorities.



7.12 Adverse Actions. Neither MBT nor any Subsidiary shall (a) take any action
while knowing that such action would, or is reasonably likely to, prevent or
impede the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368 of the Code; or (b) knowingly take any action that is intended or
is reasonably likely to result in (i) any of its representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement being or becoming untrue in any
material respect at any time at or prior to the Effective Date, (ii) any of
the conditions to the Merger set forth in Section 9 not being satisfied, (iii)
a material violation of any provision of this Agreement, or (iv) a material
delay in the consummation of the Merger except, in each case, as may be
required by applicable law or regulation.

Bank to execute and deliver the Bank Merger Agreement contemporaneously
herewith.

MBT may amend the MBT change in control and severance agreements as more fully
described in the MBT Disclosure Letter (the "Change in Control Agreements") to

their terms following the Effective Date.

its reasonable best efforts to obtain necessary consents from grantees of

sixty (60) days following execution and delivery of this Agreement, First
Merchants will file an application with each of the Federal Reserve Board and
the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions (the "Indiana DFI") for
approval of the Merger and an application with each of the Indiana DFI and the
FDIC for approval of the Bank Merger, and take all other appropriate actions
necessary to obtain the regulatory approvals referred to herein, and MBT will
use all reasonable and diligent efforts to assist in obtaining all such
approvals. In advance of filing any applications for such regulatory
approvals, First Merchants shall provide MBT and its counsel with a copy of
such applications (but excluding any information 



contained therein regarding First Merchants and its business or operations for
which confidential treatment has been requested) and provide an opportunity to
comment thereon, and thereafter shall promptly advise MBT and its counsel of
any material communication received by First Merchants or its counsel from any
regulatory authorities with respect to such applications. In addition, First
Merchants agrees to prepare, in cooperation with and subject to the review and
comment of MBT and its counsel, a registration statement on Form S-4,
including a prospectus of First Merchants (the "Registration Statement"), to
be filed no later than sixty (60) days after the date hereof by First
Merchants with the SEC in connection with the issuance of First Merchants
Common Stock in the Merger (including the proxy statements and prospectus and
other proxy solicitation materials of, and to be filed by, MBT and First
Merchants constituting a part thereof (the "Proxy Statement") and all related
documents). First Merchants agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to have
the Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC and to keep the
Registration Statement effective so long as is necessary to consummate the
Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. First Merchants agrees to
advise MBT, promptly after First Merchants receives notice thereof, of the
time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or
amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order or the suspension
of the qualification of First Merchants Common Stock for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threat of any proceeding for any such
purpose, or of the receipt of any comment letters from the SEC regarding, or
of any request by the SEC for the amendment or supplement of, the Registration
Statement, or for additional information. First Merchants agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to list, prior to the Effective Date, on the NASDAQ
Global Select Market (subject to official notice of issuance), the shares of
First Merchants Common Stock to be issued to the holders of shares of MBT
Common Stock in the Merger.



8.2 Employee Benefit Plans.



(a) First Merchants shall take such action as may be necessary so that, as
soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Date, employees of MBT
and the Subsidiaries shall be entitled to participate in the employee benefit
plans of First Merchants. With respect to each employee benefit plan or
benefit arrangement maintained by First Merchants in which employees of MBT or
the Subsidiaries subsequently participate, for purposes of determining
eligibility, vesting, vacation and severance entitlement, First Merchants will
ensure that service with MBT or the Subsidiaries will be treated as service
with First Merchants; provided, however, that service with MBT or the
Subsidiaries shall not be treated as service with First Merchants for purposes
of benefit accrual, except with respect to severance benefits. At its
discretion, First Merchants shall either (a) cause the MBT Retirement Plan and
related money purchase pension Plan (the "401(k) Plan") to be merged with and
into the First Merchants' Retirement Income and Savings Plan, with employees
of MBT and the Subsidiaries eligible to participate in such First Merchants
plan subject to and pursuant to the terms thereof; (b) assume sponsorship of
the 401(k) Plan effective as of the Effective Date; or (c) direct MBT to take
such reasonable steps to terminate the 401(k) Plan prior to the Effective Date
(which MBT hereby agrees to take), in which case, First Merchants agrees that
any outstanding participant loans under the 401(k) Plan may be rolled over to
the First Merchants' Retirement Income and Savings Plan so that participants
can continue to repay outstanding loans via payroll deduction, if permitted
under the terms of the respective plans. 



(b) Coverage Under First Merchants' Health and Welfare Plan. With respect to
First Merchants' health and welfare plans under which employees of MBT or the
Subsidiaries and their eligible dependents become participants, First
Merchants agrees to (i) waive all restrictions and limitations for pre-
existing conditions, (ii) honor any deductible, co-payments and out-of-pocket
maximums incurred by MBT's or the Subsidiaries' employees and their eligible
dependents under the health plans in which they participated immediately prior
to the Effective Date during the portion of the calendar year prior to the
Effective Date in satisfying any deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket
maximums under health plans of First Merchants in which they are eligible to
participate after the Effective Date in the same plan year in which such
deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums were incurred, and (iii)
waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement
that would otherwise be applicable to an employee of MBT or the Subsidiaries
and his or her eligible dependents on or after the Effective Date, in each
case to the extent such employee or eligible dependent had satisfied any
similar limitation or requirement under an analogous plan prior to the
Effective Date.



(c) Severance. For any employee of MBT who did not have an employment
agreement, change in control agreement or severance agreement, who is not
offered employment with First Merchants or FMB with salary and bonus
opportunities substantially the same as the salary and bonus opportunities of
their current employment with MBT or whose employment is terminated by First
Merchants or FMB (other than for cause) on or within six (6) months of the
Effective Date, First Merchants agrees that it shall provide such employees
with severance and outplacement benefits identical to those offered to First
Merchants employees as listed on the First Merchants Disclosure Letter;
provided, however, the minimum severance benefit will be four (4) weeks.

continuation coverage to any qualified employee or former employee of MBT or
the Subsidiaries and to their respective qualified beneficiaries, on and after
the Effective Date, regardless of when the qualifying event occurred.

Disclosure Schedule First Merchants shall work with MBT to find a mutually
agreeable transition or termination with respect to the MBT supplemental
executive retirement agreement (SERP) together with the related SERP split
dollar plan and director deferred compensation plans.



8.3 Announcement; Press Releases. In connection with the execution of this
Agreement, MBT and First Merchants intend to jointly issue a press release
mutually acceptable to the parties. Except as otherwise required by law,
neither First Merchants nor a First Merchants Subsidiary shall issue any
additional press releases or make any other public announcements or
disclosures relating to the Merger or the Bank Merger without the prior
approval of MBT provided, however, that nothing in this Section 8.3 shall be
deemed to prohibit any party from making any disclosure that its counsel deems
necessary in order to satisfy such party's disclosure obligation imposed by
law. 





8.4 Confidentiality. First Merchants shall, and shall use its best efforts to
cause the First Merchants Subsidiaries and its officers, employees, and
authorized representatives to, hold in strict confidence all confidential data

already known to First Merchants prior to entering into merger discussions
with MBT, (ii) becomes available to First Merchants from other sources, (iii)
is independently developed by First Merchants, (iv) is disclosed by First
Merchants with and in accordance with the terms of prior written approval of
MBT, or (v) is or becomes readily ascertainable from public or published
information or trade sources or public disclosure of such information is
required by law or requested by a court or other governmental agency,
commission, or regulatory body. First Merchants further agrees that in the
event this Agreement is terminated, it will return to MBT, or will destroy,
all information obtained by it regarding MBT or the Bank, including all copies
made of such information by First Merchants. This provision shall survive the
Effective Date or the earlier termination of this Agreement.

policy to cover the present and former officers and directors of MBT and the
Bank (determined as of the Effective Date) with respect to claims against such
directors and officers arising from facts or events which occurred before the
Effective Date, which insurance shall contain at least the same coverage and
amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous, as that
coverage currently provided by MBT; provided however, that if First Merchants
is unable to obtain such endorsement, then First Merchants may purchase tail
coverage under MBT's existing director and officer liability insurance policy
for such claims; provided further that in no event shall First Merchants be
required to expend more than 1.5 times the annual amount paid by MBT for its
director and officer liability insurance coverage prior to the Effective Date
for each year of the Tail Coverage Period purchased (the "Insurance Amount");
provided further, that if First Merchants is unable to maintain or obtain the
insurance called for by this Section 8.5, First Merchants shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance as is available
for the Insurance Amount; provided, further, that officers and directors of
MBT or the Bank may be required to make application and provide customary
representations and warranties to First Merchants' insurance carrier for the
purpose of obtaining such insurance.



(b) Following the Effective Date, First Merchants will provide any MBT or
Subsidiary officers, directors and employees who become officers, directors
and employees of the Continuing Company or its subsidiaries with the same
directors and officers liability insurance coverage and indemnification
protections that First Merchants provides to other officers, directors and
employees of First Merchants or its subsidiaries. In addition, First Merchants
further agrees to indemnify and advance expenses to the current and former
directors and officers of MBT and the Subsidiaries after the Effective Date,
for all actions taken by them prior to the Effective Date in their respective

and Bylaws (as applicable) to such directors and officers immediately prior 

to the Effective Date and as permitted under applicable law. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the indemnity obligations contained herein shall be limited as

(c) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Date now existing in favor of
the current or former directors or officers of MBT and the Subsidiaries as
provided in their respective Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and any
existing indemnification agreements or arrangements of MBT or the Subsidiaries
described in the MBT Disclosure Letter, shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms to the extent
permitted by law, and shall be honored by First Merchants following the
Effective Date with respect to acts or omissions of such individuals occurring
or alleged to occur on or prior to the Effective Date.



(d) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including,
without limitation, any such claim, action suit, proceeding or investigation
in which any individual who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date
of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Date, a director or
officer of MBT or any Subsidiary (the "Indemnified Parties"), is, or is
threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in
whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a
director, officer or employee of MBT or a Subsidiary or any of their
predecessors or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, whether in any case asserted or arising before or on or after the
Effective Date, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their best
reasonable efforts to defend against and respond thereto.



(e) If First Merchants shall consolidate with or merge into any other entity
and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or
merger or shall transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any entity,
