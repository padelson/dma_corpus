 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound by this Agreement, the Parties agree as follows:

Unless the context of this Agreement clearly requires otherwise: (a) the singular includes the plural and the plural includes the singular wherever and as often as may be appropriate, (b) the words "includes" or "including" means "including without limitation," (c) the word "or" is not exclusive and (d) the words "hereof," "herein," "hereunder" and similar terms in this Agreement refer to this Agreement as a whole and not any particular section or article in which such words appear.

ARTICLE II THE 
 MERGER 

   

 Section 2.1 _The Merger._ At the Effective Time and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation") under the Legal Requirements of the State of Delaware. 

   

 Section 2.2 _Closing; Effective Time._  

    

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place on a date as soon as practicable but in no event later than the second Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI, or at such other time and place as Parent and the Company may mutually agree (the "Closing Date"). By agreement of the Parties, the Closing may take place by conference call, telecopy and e-mail with exchange of original signatures by overnight mail. 

   

 (b) On the Closing Date and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a duly executed Certificate of Merger substantially in the form of _Exhibit B_ attached hereto (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Secretary of State"). 

   ##### 

  

   

The Merger shall become effective upon such time as the Certificate of Merger
has been accepted for record by the Secretary of State (the "Effective
Time"). 

  

 Section 2.3 _Effects of the Merger._ At the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 Section 2.4 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws._  

    

 (a) The Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation in effect at the Effective Time will be amended and restated as set forth on _Exhibit A_ to the Certificate of Merger until amended or amended and restated in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements. 

   

 (b) The Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation in effect at the Effective Time will be amended and restated to read the same as the bylaws of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time until amended or amended and restated in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements. 

  

 Section 2.5 _Directors and Officers._ The Company shall cause to be delivered to Parent, promptly after the date hereof, resignations of all the directors and officers of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries to be effective upon the consummation of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the directors and officers of Merger Sub shall continue in office as the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries to serve until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. 

   

 Section 2.6 _Dissenters  Rights. _Shares of Company Capital Stock (as defined below) that have not been voted in favor of this Agreement and with respect to which a demand for payment and appraisal have been properly made in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL ("Dissenting Shares"), will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration otherwise payable with respect to such shares of Company Capital Stock at or after the Effective Time, but will be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the laws of the State of Delaware. Shares of Company Capital Stock with respect to which dissenters rights have not terminated (as evidenced by the failure of the holder of such shares of Company Capital Stock to vote for approval of this Agreement or to submit a letter of transmittal in the form of _Exhibit G_ attached hereto (a "Letter of Transmittal") to the Paying Agent in accordance with _Section 2.7(i)_ with respect to such shares of Company Capital Stock) will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration otherwise payable with respect to such shares of Company Capital Stock at or after the Effective Time until the earliest of approval of this Agreement by such holder, submission of a Letter of Transmittal by such holder or the expiration of the statutory period for demand for payment and appraisal. If a holder of Dissenting Shares (a 

    ##### 

  

    

"Dissenting Stockholder") withdraws his, her or its demand for such payment
and appraisal or becomes ineligible for such payment and appraisal, then, as
of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event of withdrawal or
ineligibility, whichever last occurs, such holders Dissenting Shares will
cease to be Dissenting Shares and will be converted into the right
to receive, and will be exchangeable for, the Merger Consideration into which
such shares of Company Capital Stock would have been converted pursuant to
_Section 2.7_. The Company will give Parent prompt notice of any demand
received by the Company from a holder of Dissenting Shares for appraisal of
shares of Company Capital Stock, and Parent (and the Stockholders
Representative post-Closing, at his expense) shall have the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demand.
The Company agrees that, except with the prior written consent of Parent, or
as required under the DGCL, it will not voluntarily make any payment
with respect to, or settle or offer or agree to settle, any such demand for
appraisal. Each Dissenting Stockholder who, pursuant to the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL, becomes entitled to payment of the value of the
Dissenting Shares will receive payment therefor from the Company but only
after the value therefor has been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant
to such provisions. Any portion of the Merger Consideration that would
otherwise have been payable with respect to Dissenting Shares if such Shares
were not Dissenting Shares will be retained by Parent. 

   

 Section 2.7 _Merger Consideration and Payment Thereof; Effect on Capital Stock._  

    

 (a) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. 

   

 (i) _Pre-Closing Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. No later than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall prepare and deliver to Parent an estimated unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the end of Closing Date, which balance sheet will be prepared in accordance with GAAP, as applied in a manner consistent with the past practices and principles of the Company and its Subsidiaries. The balance sheet prepared in accordance with the foregoing is referred to as the "Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet" which shall have attached to it a schedule showing the difference, if any, between the Net Working Capital shown on the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet (the "Estimated Net Working Capital") and the Net Working Capital Threshold and the estimated amount of Excess Cash as of the end of the Closing Date (the "Estimated Excess Cash"). If the Net Working Capital Threshold exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital by more than $750,000, then the entire amount of such excess over the Estimated Net Working Capital shall be referred to as the "Estimated Net Working Capital Decrease". If the Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds the Net Working Capital Threshold by more than $750,000, then the entire amount of such excess over the Net Working Capital Threshold shall be referred to as the "Estimated Net Working Capital Increase". 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) _Post-Closing Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. 

   

 (A) No later than 90 days after the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to the Stockholders Representative an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date, which balance sheet will be prepared in accordance with GAAP, as applied in a manner consistent with the past practices and principles of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Final Closing Date Balance Sheet") and which shall have attached to it a schedule showing the difference, if any, between the Net Working Capital shown on the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet (the "Final Net Working Capital"), the Estimated Net Working Capital and the actual amount of Excess Cash as of the end of the Closing Date. If the Net Working Capital Threshold exceeds the Final Net Working Capital by more than $750,000, then the entire amount of such excess over the Final Net Working Capital shall be referred to as the "Final Net Working Capital Decrease". If the Final Net Working Capital exceeds the Net Working Capital Threshold by more than $750,000, then the entire amount of such excess over the Net Working Capital Threshold shall be referred to as the "Final Net Working Capital Increase". 

   

 (B) The Stockholders Representative shall have the right for 30 days following the Stockholders Representatives receipt of the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet to object to the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet, or the proposed calculations of the Final Net Working Capital, the Final Net Working Capital Decrease, the Final Net Working Capital Increase, or the actual amount of Excess Cash as of the end of the Closing Date, as appropriate, attached thereto by delivering a written notice to Parent specifying whether the Stockholders Representative has any objections to the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet and the proposed calculations of the Final Net Working Capital, the Final Net Working Capital Decrease, the Final Net Working Capital Increase, or the actual amount of Excess Cash as of the end of the Closing Date, as appropriate, attached thereto and describing in reasonable detail such objections. Failure to give such timely objection notice (or written notification from the Stockholders Representative that it has no such objection) shall constitute acceptance and approval of such proposed Final Closing Date Balance Sheet and the proposed calculations of the Final Net Working Capital, the Final Net Working Capital Decrease, the Final Net Working Capital Increase, or the actual amount of Excess Cash as of the end of the Closing Date, as appropriate, attached thereto and the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet and the proposed calculations of the Final Net Working Capital, the Final Net Working Capital Decrease, the Final Net Working Capital Increase, or the actual amount of Excess Cash as of the end of the Closing Date, as appropriate, attached thereto shall be final and binding upon the Parties. After delivery of the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet, if requested by the Stockholders Representative, Parent shall provide the 

   ##### 

  

   

Stockholders Representative and its representatives reasonable access to
the financial books and records pertaining to the Company and its
Subsidiaries solely to confirm or audit the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet
and the proposed calculations of the Final Net Working Capital, the Final Net
Working Capital Decrease, the Final Net Working Capital Increase, or the
actual amount of Excess Cash as of the end of the Closing Date, as
appropriate, attached thereto. The Stockholders Representative and its
representatives may make reasonable inquiries of Parent regarding questions
concerning, or disagreements with the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet and
the proposed calculations of the Final Net Working Capital, the Final Net
Working Capital Decrease, the Final Net Working Capital Increase, or the
actual amount of Excess Cash as of the end of the Closing Date, as
appropriate, attached thereto arising in the course of their review of the
Final Closing Date Balance Sheet and the proposed calculations of the Final
Net Working Capital, the Final Net Working Capital Decrease, the Final Net
Working Capital Increase, or the actual amount of Excess Cash as of the
end of the Closing Date, as appropriate, attached thereto. Parent shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its accountants to cooperate
with the Company Stockholders and his representatives and to respond to such
inquiries. The Stockholders Representative and Parent will work diligently
and in good faith to resolve any objections of the Stockholders
Representative pursuant to this _Section 2.7(a)(ii)_. If Parent and the
Stockholders Representative are unable to agree upon the Final Closing Date
Balance Sheet and the proposed calculations of the Final Net Working Capital,
the Final Net Working Capital Decrease, the Final Net Working Capital
Increase or the actual amount of Excess Cash as of the end of the Closing
Date, as appropriate, attached thereto within 30 days of Parents receipt of
the Stockholders Representatives written objections, if any, Parent or the
Stockholders Representative shall resolve such matters in accordance with
the procedures set forth in _Section 2.7(a)(ii)(C)_ below to resolve the
Stockholders Representatives remaining objections to the Final Closing Date
Balance Sheet and the proposed calculations of the Final Net Working Capital,
the Final Net Working Capital Decrease, the Final Net Working Capital
Increase, or the actual amount of Excess Cash as of the end of the Closing
Date, as appropriate, attached thereto (the "Remaining Disputed Items"). 

   

 (C) In the event that the Stockholders Representative and Parent are unable to resolve on the Remaining Disputed Items, the Stockholders Representative and Parent shall each have the right to require that the Remaining Disputed Items be submitted to Ernst and Young LLP, or if such accounting firm is not available for any reason, such other national independent certified public accounting firm as Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall mutually agree and designate in writing (the "Accounting Firm"). Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall each present in writing to the Accounting Firm (A) its proposed 

   ##### 

  

   

resolution of each of the Remaining Disputed Items (on an item by item
basis) and (B) any materials it wishes to present to justify the resolution
it so presents. The Accounting Firm shall review each of the proposed
resolutions submitted by Parent and the Stockholders Representative
concerning each of the Remaining Disputed Items together with the supporting
materials submitted in favor of the proposed resolutions. The Accounting Firm
shall be required to accept the position of the party that is closest to what
the Accounting Firm believes to be the correct position. In reaching its
determination, the only alternatives available to the Accounting Firm will be
to (i) accept the position of the Stockholders Representative or (ii) accept
the position of Parent. Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall
instruct the Accounting Firm to reach its final decision within 30 days after
the presentation of the Remaining Disputed Items to the Accounting Firm. The
Accounting Firms determination shall be binding upon the Parties. If at any
time Parent and the Stockholders Representative resolve their dispute with
respect to one or more Remaining Disputed Items prior to the Accounting
Firms determination, then notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this
_Section 2.7(b)(iv)_, the Accounting Firms resolution procedures promptly
shall be discontinued and the calculation of the affected items shall be
revised by Parent and the Stockholders Representative, if necessary, to
reflect such resolution and thereupon shall be final and binding on the
Parties. The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be
allocated between Parent, on the one hand, and the Company Stockholders, on
the other hand, in the same proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of
the Remaining Disputed Items so submitted to the Accounting Firm that is
unsuccessfully disputed by such party (as finally determined by the
Accounting Firm) bears to the total dollar amount of such disputed items so
submitted. 

   

 (D) Upon final determination of the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Final Net Working Capital and the actual amount of Excess Cash as of the end of the Closing Date: 

   

 (1) if comparing the Final Net Working Capital Increase or Final Net Working Capital Decrease to the Estimated Net Working Capital Increase or Estimated Net Working Capital Decrease and comparing the actual Excess Cash to the Estimated Excess Cash shows that the original calculation of the Initial Cash Amount was understated, then the deficiency shall be paid by Parent to the Company Owners by check within ten days after the Final Net Working Capital and the determination of the actual Excess Cash becomes binding on the Parties. Each Company Owner shall be entitled to receive such amount in proportion to the Owners Percentage Ownership, or 

   

 (2) if comparing the Final Net Working Capital Increase or Final Net Working Capital Decrease to the Estimated Net 

   ##### 

  

   

Working Capital Increase or Estimated Net Working Capital Decrease and
comparing the actual Excess Cash to the Estimated Excess Cash shows that the
original calculation of the Initial Cash Amount was overstated, then the
excess shall be owing to Parent and the Company Owners shall satisfy such
payment obligation to Parent in proportion to the Owners Percentage
Ownership through (i) in the case of the holders of Cash-Out Options, from
the Cash-Out Adjustment Escrow Amount in the Escrow Account, if sufficient,
and (ii) in the case of all other Company Owners, from reduction in the
principal amount of the Twelve Month Promissory Notes, if sufficient. If the
Cash-Out Adjustment Escrow Amount and the principal amount of the Twelve
Month Promissory Notes is insufficient to satisfy such overstatement, then
the holders of the Cash-Out Options and Company Owners shall be responsible
for any deficiency in proportion to the to Cash-Out Ownership Percentage with
respect to the holders of Cash-Out Options and in proportion to the Owners
Percentage Ownership with respect to the Company Owners. 

   

 (E) Within 10 days of the final determination of the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Final Net Working Capital and the actual amount of Excess Cash as of the end of the Closing Date, Parent and Stockholders Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver to the Company (for distribution to the Cash-Out Option Holders, less applicable tax withholding) the amount, if any, of the Cash-Out Adjustment Escrow Amount remaining after deducting any payment to be made therefrom pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)(ii)(D)(2)_. Such amount shall be promptly paid by the Company by check to the holders of the Cash-Out Options in proportion to the Cash-Out Option Percentage of each such holder.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if as a result of the calculations required hereby, a Company Stockholder or holder of Twelve Month Promissory Notes is entitled to receive fractional shares of TCS Common Stock, then (i) if the fraction is less than one-half, the number of shares of TCS Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this Agreement or the Twelve Month Promissory Notes shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share and the Company Stockholder shall not be entitled to any further compensation and (ii) if the fraction is greater than or equal to one-half, then the number of shares of TCS Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this Agreement or the Twelve Month Promissory Notes shall be rounded up to the nearest whole share. 

   

 (e) _Company Options_. As of the Effective Time, each stock option ("Company Options") granted pursuant to the Networks in Motion 2005 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Company Plan") shall terminate by virtue of the Merger and each holder of a Company Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, other than as described in this _Section 2.7(e)_. The Company has amended the Company Plan to provide for certain Company Options to be cashed-out and terminated prior to the Effective Time ("Cash-Out Options") and for the holders of such Cash-Out Options to receive Cash-Out Option Payments promptly following the Effective Time and Cash-Out Escrow Payments, if any, pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. Immediately prior to the Effective Time (i) Company Options that are not Cash-Out Options (whether or not then vested) shall vest, and (ii) each holder of Company Options that are not Cash-Out Options shall be deemed to have exchanged all such holders Company Options for the right to receive the Option Merger Consideration, subject to the same adjustments 

   ##### 

  

   

applicable to holders of Company Common Stock receiving the Merger
Consideration. Any amounts withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing
authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent will be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of Cash-Out Options or Company Options in respect of whom such deduction
and withholding was made. If the exercise price per share of any such Company
Option is equal to or greater than the aggregate consideration payable to
holder of a Company Option at the Closing, such Company Option shall be
canceled without any payment being made in respect thereof. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions required by the Company
Plan under which such Company Options were granted to cause such Company Plan
and all Company Options granted thereunder to terminate at the Effective
Time, including adopting any plan amendments and resolutions and obtaining
any required consents, without paying any consideration or incurring any
debts or obligations on behalf of the Company or the Surviving Corporation.
Not later than the time at which the Company gives notice of the Merger and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to Company Stockholders, the
Company shall notify each holder of Company Options, in writing, of the
proposed Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
"Option Holder Notice"). The Option Holder Notice shall apprise the holders
of the Company Options (i) of the proposed amendment to the Company Plan and
(A) which holders will be entitled to the Cash-Out Option Payment and Cash-
Out Escrow Payments, if any, and (B) which holders will be entitled to the
Option Merger Consideration, (ii) that the holders of such Company Options
that are not Cash-Out Options will be deemed to have exchanged all such
holders Company Options immediately prior to the Effective Time for the
Option Merger Consideration, and (iii) that all Company Options will
terminate at the Effective Time and no longer be outstanding. At the Closing,
Parent shall deliver to the Escrow Agent out of the Initial Cash Amount the
Cash-Out Escrow Amount for deposit into an escrow account (the "Escrow
Account") in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. 

   

 (f) _Company Warrants_. As of the Effective Time, each warrant to purchase shares of the Companys Capital Stock ("Company Warrants") shall terminate by virtue of the Merger and each holder of a Company Warrant shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, other than as described in this _Section 2.7(f)_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time (i) all Company Warrants (whether or not then vested) shall vest, and (ii) each holder of Company Warrants shall be deemed to have exchanged all such holders Company Warrants for the right to receive the Warrant Merger Consideration, subject to the same adjustments applicable to holders of Company Common Stock receiving the Merger Consideration. Not later than the time at which the Company gives notice of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to Company Stockholders, the Company shall notify each holder of Company Warrants in writing, of the proposed Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the terms of the Warrants (the "Warrant Holder Notice"). The Warrant Holder Notice shall apprise the holders of the Company Warrants (i) that the holders of such Company Warrants will be deemed to have exchanged all such holders Company Warrants immediately prior to the Effective Time for the right to receive the Warrant Merger Consideration, and (ii) that all Company Warrants not so exchanged will terminate at the Effective Time and no longer be outstanding. If the exercise price per share of any such 

   ##### 

  

   

Company Warrant is equal to or greater than the aggregate consideration
payable to a holder of Company Warrants at the Closing, such Company Warrant
shall be canceled without any cash payment being made in respect thereof.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions required to
cause all Company Warrants to terminate at the Effective Time, including
adopting any Company Warrant amendments and resolutions and obtaining any
required consents, without paying any consideration or incurring any debts or
obligations on behalf of the Company or the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (g) _Company Treasury Stock_. Each Share held in the treasury of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, will, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company or the holder thereof, be canceled, retired and cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor. 

   

 (h) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_.

 (i) _Appointment of Paying Agent; Exchange Procedures_. 

   

(i) _Appointment of Paying Agent_. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall appoint American Stock Transfer and Trust Company,
LLC ("AST") to act as paying agent for the payment of the Equity
Consideration. Parent shall act as a paying agent for the Non-Equity Merger
Consideration. No Merger Consideration shall be paid with respect to holders
of Company Common stock represented by Certificates until the surrender of
the Certificates to AST pursuant to this Section 2.7(i). The cash portion of
the Merger Consideration is sometimes referred to herein as the "Exchange
Fund." The Exchange Fund shall be used solely for purposes of paying the
Merger Consideration in accordance with this ARTICLE II and shall not be used
to satisfy any other obligation of the Company. 

   

(ii) _Exchange Procedures_. 

   

 (A) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time but in no event more than ten Business Days after the Effective Time, AST shall mail to the respective address specified on the Spreadsheet to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock subsequently converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, as set forth in _Section 2.7:_ (i) a Letter of Transmittal (A) specifying that delivery shall be effected and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to AST (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof, together with any indemnity Contract, as contemplated by _Section 2.7(i)(ii)(G)_) and (B) in such form and have such 

   ##### 

  

   

other provisions as the Surviving Corporation may reasonably specify;
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration and (iii) certificates
relating to the non-foreign status of the holder. 

   

 (B) Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to AST, as applicable, together with a Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and executed, certificates relating to the non-foreign status of the holder, duly completed and executed, and any other documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, (i) the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to such holders portion of the Initial Cash Amount, the Equity Consideration, the Twelve Month Promissory Notes Consideration and the Indemnification Promissory Notes Consideration in the amounts and forms specified on the Spreadsheet and (ii) the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. The holder of such Certificate shall also be entitled to such holders portion of the Final Net Working Capital Increase, if any, when such amount is finally determined in accordance with _Section 2.7(a)(ii)_. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amounts payable upon surrender of the Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.7(i)_, each such Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration. 

   

 (C) In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Capital Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the appropriate amount of the Merger Consideration may be paid to a transferee if the Certificate representing such shares of Company Capital Stock is presented to AST properly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers and otherwise in proper form for transfer and accompanied by all documents reasonably required by AST and Parent to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable Taxes have been paid. 

   

 (D) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of the Certificates representing shares of Company Capital Stock, or paid with respect to outstanding Company Options or Company Warrants in accordance with the terms hereof, shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Capital Stock, Company Options or Company Warrants and, after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Capital Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this ARTICLE II, subject to applicable Legal Requirements in the case of Dissenting Shares. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (E) Any former holder of shares of Company Capital Stock, Company Option or Company Warrant who has not submitted a Letter of Transmittal on the date 12 months after the Effective Time shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Legal Requirements) and not to AST for payment of claims with respect to the Equity Consideration and only as a general creditor thereof. 

   

 (F) None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or Merger Sub shall be liable to any holder of Company Options, Company Warrants, or shares of Company Capital Stock for any part of the Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Legal Requirement. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any such Company Options, Company Warrants or shares of Company Capital Stock two years after the Effective Time or at such earlier date as is immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements or Order, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders or their successors, assigns or personal representatives previously entitled thereto. 

   

 (G) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by and at the discretion of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, delivery by such Person of an indemnity Contract in such form as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may direct, in each case as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, AST and Parent, as appropriate, shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the appropriate amount of the Equity Consideration and the Non-Equity Merger Consideration, respectively. 

   

 (H) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate thereof, or AST shall be entitled, at the time of payment, to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Options or Company Warrants such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate thereof or AST is then required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state or local Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate thereof, or AST, such withheld amounts shall be (a) paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements or Order and (b) treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder or participant, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate thereof, or AST, as the case may be. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (I) After the Effective Time, within five Business Days following the delivery to Parent of a duly completed and executed Stockholder Representation and Warranties Agreement and Selling Stockholder Agreement by a holder of Company Options (other than Cash-Out Options) or Company Warrants, the holder of such Company Options or Company Warrants shall be entitled to such holders portion of the Merger Consideration, as provided herein, and Parent shall instruct AST to deliver to such holder such holders Per Share Equity Consideration based upon the number of Company Options or Company Warrants held. 

   

 (j) _Reserve Account_. At the Closing, Parent shall deliver to the Stockholders Representative the sum of $200,000 (the "Reserve Amount") for deposit into a bank account (the "Reserve Account") controlled by the Stockholders Representative to be used to pay costs and expenses, if any, incurred by the Stockholders Representative in defending and/or resolving any indemnification claims brought by any Parent Indemnitee under Article VIII, the expenses incurred by the Company Stockholders in connection with _Section 2.7(a)(ii)_, and any other costs or expenses incurred by the Stockholders Representative in the performance of its obligations as the Stockholders Representative. The Stockholders Representative shall distribute all amounts remaining in the Reserve Account to the Company Owners in proportion to their Owners Percentage Ownership, upon the later of (i) the date which is 24 months following the Closing Date, and (ii) the resolution of all indemnification claims against the Company Stockholders still pending as of the date which is 24 months following the Closing Date. To the extent the above described costs and expenses incurred by the Stockholders Representative exceed the Reserve Amount, the Stockholders Representative may present a written request to Parent for reimbursement of such amount from the funds, if any, that otherwise would be paid to the Company Owners upon final payment on the Indemnification Promissory Notes. Parent shall offset from the final payment of each Company Owners Indemnification Promissory Note an amount equal to Stockholders Representative requested reimbursement amount, if any, multiplied by the Owners Percentage Interest. 

   

 (k) _Delivery of Company Owner Representations and Warranties Agreement_. No Company Stockholder shall be entitled to such Company Owners portion of the Merger Consideration unless and until such Company Owner delivers a duly completed and executed Company Owner Representations and Warranties Agreement.

   ##### 

  

   

other which began at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date,
and relevant tax items for the Straddle Period shall be allocated between
such two taxable years or periods on a "closing of the books basis" by
assuming that the relevant books were closed at the close of the Closing
Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) transactions occurring on the Closing
Date that are properly allocable to the portion of the Closing Date after the
Closing shall be allocated to the taxable year or period that is deemed to
begin at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date, and (B)
exemptions, allowances or other attributes that are calculated on an annual
basis shall be apportioned between such two taxable years or periods on
a calendar-day daily basis and Taxes that are computed on a periodic basis,
such as property Taxes, shall also be so apportioned on a daily basis. Sales
and use Taxes shall be deemed to accrue in accordance with the accounting
methods used for the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet.

After the applicable period, Company may dispose of such information, books and records, provided that prior to such disposition, Company Stockholders shall give Parent the opportunity to take possession of such information, books and records; 

   

 (iii) upon reasonable notice and without undue interruption to the business of such party or the Company and any Subsidiary, as the case may be, provide access during normal business hours to the books and records of such party or the Company and any Subsidiary relating to the Taxes of the Company and any Subsidiary prior to the Closing Date;

 (ii) The Stockholders Representative shall have the sole right to control, contest, resolve and defend against any Tax matters relating to Taxes imposed on the Company and any Subsidiary for Pre-Closing Periods, in each case provided the Company Stockholders are obligated to indemnify Parent for such Taxes (or a portion of such Taxes with respect to a Straddle Period) under this _Section 5.6_, and to employ counsel of his choice at his own expense; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) the Stockholders Representative shall keep Parent informed with respect to the commencement, status and nature of any such Tax matter, notify Parent of significant developments with respect to such Tax matter and consult with Parent with respect to any issue that reasonably could be expected to materially affect Parent, any of its Affiliates or any of the Company and any Subsidiary, (B) the Stockholders Representative shall give Parent a copy of any Tax adjustment proposed in writing with respect to such Tax matter and copies of any other correspondence with the relevant Taxing Authority relating to such Tax matter, (C) the Stockholders Representative shall otherwise permit Parent to participate in such Tax matter at Parents own expense, (D) neither the Company Stockholders, the Stockholders Representative nor any of their respective Affiliates shall enter into any settlement of or otherwise compromise any such Tax matter which adversely affects or may adversely affect the Tax Liability of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, any Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the foregoing without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and (E) the Stockholders Representative may decline to control any Tax matters by providing Parent with written notice of such decision.

   ##### 

  

    

Consents") the Requisite Stockholder Approval from such holders and together
with a Company Owner Representations and Warranties Agreement substantially
in the form of _Exhibit E-1_ attached hereto (the "Company Owner
Representations and Warranties Agreement") for the purpose of obtaining
customary representations from such holders to Parent as to whether the holder
of Company Capital Stock, Company Warrants or Company Options (other than
Cash-Out Options) is an "accredited investor" as such term is defined in Rule
501 under Regulation D. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable
best efforts to promptly secure the Requisite Stockholder Approval and use
its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly obtain executed copies of
the Company Owner Representations and Warranties Agreement and shall take all
other action necessary or advisable to secure the Requisite Stockholder
Approval no more than three Business Days following the date the Solicitation
and Investor Representation Statement is sent by the Company pursuant to this
_Section 5.9_ (the "Stockholder Written Consent Delivery Deadline").
The Solicitation and Investor Representation Statement shall describe this
Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company
shall also send to each holder of Company Capital Stock, Company Warrants or
Company Options (other than Cash-Out Options), together with the Solicitation
and Investor Representation Statement and Company Owner Representations
and Warranties Agreement, a Selling Stockholder Agreement substantially in
the form of _Exhibit E-2_ attached hereto (the "Selling Stockholder
Agreement") for the purpose of enabling such holder of Company Capital Stock
the right to enjoy the benefits (and be subject to the obligations
of) ARTICLE IX hereof and the provisions of the Selling Stockholder
Agreement. 

   

 (b) The Solicitation and Investor Representation Statement shall also constitute a disclosure document for the offer and issuance of the Securities Consideration to be received by the holders of Company Capital Stock, Company Warrants or Company Options (other than Cash-Out Options) in the Merger. The Company will promptly advise Parent, and Parent will promptly advise the Company, in writing if at any time prior to when the Requisite Stockholder Approval has been obtained, either the Company or Parent shall obtain knowledge of any facts that might make it necessary or appropriate to amend or supplement the Solicitation and Investor Representation Statement in order to make the statements contained or incorporated by reference therein not misleading or to comply with applicable Legal Requirements. The information supplied by the Company for inclusion in the Solicitation and Investor Representation Statement shall not, on the date the solicitation statement is first mailed to the Company Stockholders or at the time prior to when the Requisite Stockholder Approval has been obtained, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no representation, warranty or covenant with respect to any information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub that is contained in the Solicitation and Investor Representation Statement. The information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Solicitation and Investor Representation Statement shall not, on the date the Solicitation and Investor Representation Statement is first mailed to Company Stockholders or at the time prior to when the Requisite Stockholder Approval has been obtained, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a 

   ##### 

  

    

material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub make no representation, warranty or covenant
with respect to any information supplied by the Company that is contained in
any of the foregoing documents. 

   

 (c) Subject to _Section 5.10(b)_, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, the Company Board shall recommend adoption of this Merger Agreement by the Company Stockholders and include such recommendation in the Solicitation and Investor Representation Statement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) the Company agrees that its obligation to solicit the Requisite Stockholder Approval, as required by this _Section 5.9_, shall not be affected by the withdrawal, amendment or modification of the recommendation by the Company Board or committee thereof and (ii) the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to this _Section 5.9_ shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal. 

  

 Section 5.10 _No Solicitation of Transactions._  

    

 (a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, except as set forth in this _Section 5.10(b)_, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, nor shall they authorize or permit any of their respective directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors or representatives (such directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, other advisors and representatives, collectively, "Representatives") to, directly or indirectly: 

   

 (i) solicit, initiate, or knowingly or intentionally encourage or facilitate, any inquiries, offers or proposals that constitute, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (including, without limitation, amending or granting any waiver or release under any standstill or similar Contract with respect to any Company Capital Stock); or 

   

 (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, furnish to any Person any information with respect to, assist or participate in any effort or attempt by any Person with respect to, or otherwise knowingly or intentionally cooperate in any way with, any Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ , _however_ , that providing notice of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.10_ to a third party in response to any such inquiry, request or Acquisition Proposal shall not be deemed a breach of this Section). 

   

 Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, prior to the time that the Requisite Stockholder Approval has been obtained (the "Company Specified Time"), the Company may, to the extent required by the fiduciary obligations of the Company Board, as determined in good faith by the Company Board after consultation with outside counsel, in response to a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal made or received after the date of this Agreement that the Company Board determines in good faith after 

   ##### 

  

    

consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor is reasonably
likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, in each case that did not result from
a breach by the Company of, or actions by its Representatives inconsistent
with, this _Section 5.10_, and subject to compliance with _Section
5.10(c)_, (x) furnish information with respect to the Company or
its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and its
Representatives, and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations with such
Person and its Representatives regarding such Acquisition Proposal, if, in
the case of either clause (x) or (y), prior to taking such action the Company
enters into a customary confidentiality Contract not less restrictive of the
other party than the Confidentiality Agreement. Without limiting
the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth
in this _Section 5.10(a)_ by any Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, and any conduct by any Representatives which the Company is not
permitted to authorize or permit hereunder, whether or not such Person is
purporting to act on behalf of the Company or otherwise, shall be deemed to
be a breach of this _Section 5.10(a)_ by the Company. 

  

 (b) No Change in _Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall: 

    

 (i) except as set forth in this _Section 5.10_, withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the approval or recommendation by the Company Board or any such committee of the adoption of this Agreement (a "Company Adverse Recommendation Change"); 

   

 (ii) adopt, approve or recommend, or propose to adopt, approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal; or 

   

 (iii) authorize, cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, Contract in principle, acquisition Contract, merger Contract or other Contract (an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement") constituting or relating to any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality Contract referred to in _Section 5.10(a)_ entered into in the circumstances referred to in _Section 5.10(a))_. 

   

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the Company Specified Time and subject to compliance with _Section 5.10(c)_, the Company Board may, in response to an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel and its financial advisor) constitutes a Superior Proposal and that did not result from a breach of this  _Section 5.10_, make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if the Company Board has concluded in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that, in light of such Superior Proposal, the failure of the Company Board to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Legal Requirements; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this sentence unless the Company has: (A) complied in all material respects with this  _Section 5.10_, (B) provided to Parent five Business Days prior written notice (such notice, a "Notice of Superior 

   ##### 

  

    

Proposal"), which notice shall not be deemed to be a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, advising Parent that the Company Board intends to take
such action and specifying the reasons therefor, including the then current
material terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal that is the basis of
the proposed action by the Company Board and the identity of the Person
making the proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the
financial terms or any material amendment to any other material term of any
such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and a
new three Business Day period), (C) during such five Business Day period (or
three Business Day period, in the case of an amendment) if requested by
Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this
Agreement in such a manner that any Acquisition Proposal which was determined
to constitute a Superior Proposal no longer is a Superior Proposal and (D) at
the end of such period, such Acquisition Proposal has not been withdrawn and
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal (taking into account any changes
to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent following a Notice of
Superior Proposal, as a result of the negotiations required by clause (C) or
otherwise). 

   

 In addition, and notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this _Section 5.10_, at any time prior to the Company Specified Time the Company Board may, in response to a material development or change in circumstances occurring or arising after the date hereof (and not relating to any Acquisition Proposal) (such material development or change in circumstances, a "Company Intervening Event"), make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if the Company Board has concluded in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that, in light of such Company Intervening Event, the failure of the Company Board to effect such a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Legal Requirements; provided that, the Company Board shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this sentence unless the Company has (x) provided to Parent at least three Business Days prior written notice advising Parent that the Company Board intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable detail and (y) during such three Business Day period, if requested by Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as a result of the Company Intervening Event. Any Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall not change the approval of this Agreement or any other approval of the Company Board, including in any respect that would have the effect of causing any state (including Delaware) corporate takeover statute or other similar statute to be applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including the Merger. 

   

 (c) _Notices to Parent; Additional Negotiations_. The Company shall promptly advise Parent orally (within 12 hours) and in writing (within 24 hours), upon the Company gaining Knowledge of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for information in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, or of any inquiry with respect to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or communication and the identity of the Person making any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or communication. 

   ##### 

  

    

Neither the Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, nor shall they
authorize or permit any of their respective Representatives, to provide any
information to or participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person
making any Acquisition Proposal until after the Company has first notified
Parent of such Acquisition Proposal as required by the preceding sentence.
The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed in all material respects of
the status of any such Acquisition Proposal and shall (i) promptly notify
Parent orally (within 12 hours) and in writing (within 24 hours) if it has
begun to furnish information to, or to participate in discussions or
negotiations with, a Person making any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry
or communication and shall promptly advise Parent orally (within 12 hours)
and in writing (within 24 hours) of any material change in the terms of any
such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, (ii) provide to Parent as soon as
practicable after receipt or delivery thereof any correspondence or proposed
transaction documents received from or on behalf of any Person relating to
any Acquisition Proposal and (iii) if Parent shall make a counterproposal
(including, without limitation, following delivery of a written notice to
Parent pursuant to _Section 5.10(b)_), consider and cause its financial and
legal advisors to consider in good faith the terms of such counterproposal.
Contemporaneously with providing any correspondence, other written materials
or other non-public information to a third party in connection with any such
Superior Proposal, inquiry or communication, the Company shall furnish a copy
of such information to Parent (to the extent not already previously
provided). Neither of the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall enter
into any confidentiality Contract with any Person subsequent to the date
hereof which prohibits the Company from providing such information to
Parent. 

   

 (d) _Cessation of Ongoing Discussions_. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall, and shall cause their Representatives to, cease immediately all discussions and negotiations regarding any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal.

 (a) The Parties acknowledge and agree that the shares of TCS Common Stock issuable to the Company Stockholders pursuant to _Section 2.7_ hereof shall constitute "restricted securities" within the Securities Act. The certificates of TCS Common Stock shall bear the legends set forth in _Section 2.7(c)_. 

   

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, neither the Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, nor shall they authorize or permit any of their respective Representatives, to (i) take any action that would cause the number of Company Stockholders who are not "accredited investors" pursuant Regulation D to increase to more than 35 during the term of this Agreement, or (ii) engage in any form of general solicitation or general advertising (as those terms are defined in Regulation D) in connection with the offer and sale of the Securities Consideration or in any manner involving a public offering within the meaning of Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. 

   #####

 Section 8.4 _Limitations and Other Indemnity Claim Matters_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this ARTICLE VIII or elsewhere in this Agreement, the following terms shall apply to any Claim arising out of this Agreement or related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents: 

    

 (a) _Deductible_. The Company Stockholders will not have any liability under _Section 8.1_ until Parent Indemnitees have suffered Losses in excess of $750,000 (the "Indemnity Deductible") in the aggregate arising from Claims under _Section 8.1_, and then the Company Stockholders will only be liable under _Section 8.1_ to the extent Losses arising from Claims under _Section 8.1_ exceed the Indemnity Deductible. The Company 

   ##### 

  

    

Stockholders will not have any liability under _Section 8.1(a)(vi)_ (and such
Losses shall not reduce the Indemnity Deductible) until Parent Indemnitees
have suffered Losses in excess of $2,200,000 (the "Existing IP Claims
Deductible") in the aggregate arising from Claims under  _Section
8.1(a)(vi)_, and then the Company Stockholders will only be liable under
_Section 8.1(a)(vi)_ to the extent Losses arising from Claims under _Section
8.1(a)(vi)_ exceed the Existing IP Claims Deductible. 

   

 (b) _Cap_. The Company Stockholders maximum liability under this Agreement shall not exceed $20,000,000 (the "Cap Amount"); _provided_ , _however_ , that: (i) after the date which is 12 months following the Closing Date, the Cap Amount shall be reduced solely with respect to those Claims brought after the first anniversary of the Closing Date to $10,000,000 (less the amount of Claims in excess of $10,000,000 applied against the Cap Amount within the 12 months following the Closing); and (ii) after the date which is 18 months following the Closing Date, the Cap Amount shall be reduced solely with respect to those Claims brought during the period commencing on the first anniversary of the Closing Date and continuing until 18 months following the Closing Date to $5,000,000 (less the amount of Claims in excess of $15,000,000 applied against the Cap Amount within the 18 months following the Closing). The maximum liability amounts specified in this Section 8.4(b) are inclusive of any amounts paid or payable from the Cash-Out Indemnity Escrow Amount in the Escrow Account. 

   

 (c) _Manner of Payment_. Any indemnification obligations of the Company Stockholders pursuant to _Section 8.1_ hereof shall be made solely by Parent offsetting the amount of any Loss against any present or future payments under the Indemnification Promissory Notes and by payment to Parent by Escrow Agent from the Cash-Out Indemnity Escrow Amount in the Escrow Account. With respect to each Claim paid pursuant to this Section 8.4(c)(i): the offset shall reduce the principal amount of each Indemnification Promissory Note in an amount equal to each Company Stockholders pro rata share of the Loss based on the ratio of (x) the original principal amount of each such Indemnification Promissory Note, over (y) $20,000,000; and (ii) the payment to Parent by Escrow Agent from the Cash Out Indemnity Escrow Amount in the Escrow Account shall be an amount equal to the product of (x) the aggregate amount of the Claim paid and offset pursuant to this Section 8.4(c), multiplied by (y) the ratio of (A) the Cash-Out Indemnity Escrow Amount over (B) $20,000,000. Any amounts withheld from amounts otherwise payable under the Indemnification Promissory Notes with respect to an unresolved Claim prior to the final resolution of such Claim must be an objectively reasonable estimate of the anticipated Loss. In the event Stockholders Representative disputes any amount withheld from amounts otherwise payable under the Indemnification Promissory Notes for unresolved Claims as being not an objectively reasonable estimate of the anticipated Loss, the Parties agree to resolve such issue through binding arbitration before a single arbitrator administered in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association and such arbitration shall take place in New York City, New York. The arbitrators determination shall be limited to the question of reasonableness with respect to such estimate of the anticipated Loss and shall be final and binding on the Parties. The expenses of the arbitrator shall be paid one half by Parent and one half by the Stockholders Representative.

 (d) _Exclusions_.

The limitation set forth in _Section 8.4(a)_ shall not be applicable to Claims arising from any matter set forth in _Section 8.1(a)(vi)_ and  _Section 8.1(a)(vii)_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any indemnification obligations of any Company Stockholder shall first be satisfied in the manner set forth in Section 8.4(c). Losses satisfied by the Company Stockholders without the benefit of the Indemnity Deductible shall not reduce the Indemnity Deductible. 

   

 (e) _Other Limitations_. No Company Stockholder shall be liable for any Loss in excess of the amount of such Company Stockholders Owners Percentage Ownership multiplied by the total amount of such Loss, except to the extent that such Loss arises solely out of or results solely from (i) such Company Stockholders fraud or intentional misrepresentation in connection with this Agreement, or (ii) any inaccuracy in, or breach of, the representations and warranties of such Company Stockholder set forth in Sections 2.a (Title to Shares), 2.b (Authority) and 2.c (Investment Representations), 2.d (Accredited Investor Representations) in the Stockholder Representation and Warranties Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall the aggregate amount of all indemnification obligations of any Company Stockholder hereunder exceed the amount of the Merger Consideration actually received by such Company Stockholder. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company Stockholders shall not have any liability for Losses relating to or arising from patent infringement (other than Disclosed IP Matters) which respect to which the Company had no Knowledge of such infringement on the date hereof and the Closing Date. 

  

 Section 8.5 _Calculation of Losses; No Duplication of Recovery_. The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this ARTICLE VIII shall be reduced by (a) any amounts recovered by any Indemnitee under insurance policies or from third Persons with respect to such Losses and (b) any tax benefit that would not have arisen but for such Loss. Any liability for indemnification under this Agreement shall be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. Each Indemnitee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect and pay over to an Indemnifying Party any insurance proceeds available with respect to Losses for which indemnification has been provided by such Indemnifying Party under this ARTICLE VIII; _provided_ , _however_ , no Party shall be obligated to make any claim for Losses with any applicable insurer prior to collecting or attempting to collect such Losses from the Indemnifying Party. 

   

 Section 8.6 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_.

    ##### 

  

  

 Section 8.7 _Claim Procedures._  

    

 (a) Each Indemnitee agrees that promptly after it becomes aware of facts giving rise to a claim by it for indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII, such Indemnitee must assert its claim for indemnification under this ARTICLE VIII (each, a "Claim") by providing a written notice (a "Claim Notice") to the Indemnifying Party (as defined below) allegedly required to provide indemnification protection under this ARTICLE VIII specifying, in reasonable detail, the nature and basis for such Claim (e.g., the underlying representation, warranty or covenant alleged to have been breached). Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Indemnitees failure to send or delay in sending a third party Claim Notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability hereunder with respect to such Claim unless the Indemnifying Party can show actual material prejudice resulting from such failure and then only to the extent of such actual material prejudice. 

   

 (b) Promptly after the receipt by an Indemnitee of notice of any Loss asserted by any third party against any Indemnitee (each, an "Action"), which Action is subject to indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnitee will give reasonable written notice to the party from whom indemnification is claimed (the "Indemnifying Party") including, without limitation, copies of any notices or other materials received in connection with such claim for indemnification; _provided_ , _however_ , that any failure of an Indemnitee to give timely notice pursuant to this _Section 8.7(b)_ shall not preclude a claim by the Indemnitee for indemnification hereunder unless the Indemnifying Party can show actual material prejudice resulting from such failure and then only to the extent of such actual material prejudice. The Indemnifying Party will be entitled, at the sole expense and liability of the Indemnifying Party, to exercise full control of the defense, compromise or settlement of any Action by notifying the Indemnitee in writing of the Indemnifying Partys intention to assume such defense. The other party will cooperate with party assuming the defense of any Action in accordance with this Agreement in any manner that such party reasonably may request. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Action, as provided above, it will do so diligently and in good faith and the Indemnitee will have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in (but not control) the defense, compromise or settlement of the Action, but the fees and expenses of such counsel will be at the expense of the Indemnitee. No Indemnitee will settle or compromise any Action for which it is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. No Indemnifying Party will settle or compromise any such Action without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee unless the judgment or proposed settlement involves only the payment of money damages by the Indemnifying Party and does not otherwise impose any other Loss, injunction or equitable relief on the Indemnitee, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. 

  

 Section 8.8 _Exclusive Remedy After Closing_. The rights of indemnity provided in this Article VIII are the parties sole and exclusive remedy after the closing relating in any way to the subject matter of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
