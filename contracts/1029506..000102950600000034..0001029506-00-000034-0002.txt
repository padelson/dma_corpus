    3.4.  SURRENDER  AND  PAYMENT.
          -----------------------
          (a)     Prior  to  the  Effective  Time,  Agribrands and Ralcorp shall
cause  Holding  Company  to  appoint  an  agent  as designated by Agribrands and
Ralcorp  (the  "Exchange  Agent") for the purpose of exchanging the Certificates
                ---------------
for  the Merger Consideration.  Immediately after the Effective Time, Agribrands
and Ralcorp shall cause Holding Company to deposit with or make available to the
Exchange Agent the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares (the
"Exchange  Fund").  If  deposited,  upon receipt, the Exchange Agent will invest
---------------
the  cash  portion  of  the Exchange Fund in United States government securities
maturing  at  the Election Deadline or such other investments as Holding Company
may  direct.  Promptly  after  the Effective Time, Holding Company will send, or
will  cause  the  Exchange Agent to send, (A) to each record holder of shares of
Agribrands  Common  Stock  and  Ralcorp  Common  Stock, at the Effective Time, a
letter  of  transmittal  and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery
shall  be  effected,  and  risk  of  loss and title shall pass, only upon proper
delivery  of  the  Certificates to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange,
and  (B)  to each record holder of shares of Agribrands Common Stock and Ralcorp
Common  Stock, an election form (the "Election Form") providing for such holders
                                      -------------
to  make  a  Stock  Election  or  a  Cash  Election.  Any Stock Election or Cash
Election shall be validly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have received by
5:00  p.m.,  St.  Louis time, on a date (the "Election Deadline") to be mutually
                                              -----------------
agreed  upon  by  Agribrands and Ralcorp (which date shall not be later than the
twentieth  Business  Day  after  the  Effective Time), an Election Form properly
completed  and  executed (with the signature or signatures thereon guaranteed to
the  extent  required  by  the Election Form) by such holder accompanied by such
holder's  Certificates,  or  by  an  appropriate  guarantee  of delivery of such
Certificates  from a member of any registered national securities exchange or of
the  National  Association  of  Securities Dealers, Inc. or a commercial bank or
trust  company  in  the  United  States as set forth in such Election Form.  Any
holder  of  Agribrands  Common  Stock  or  Ralcorp  Common Stock who has made an
election by submitting an Election Form to the Exchange Agent shall be deemed to
have  irrevocably  made such election.  Any holder of Agribrands Common Stock or
Ralcorp  Common  Stock who fails to properly make the required election shall be
deemed  to  have  made  a  Stock Election with respect to the shares (other than
Dissenting  Shares)  owned  by  such  holder for which no such election has been
made.

     (b)     Upon  surrender  to  the Exchange Agent of his Certificate together
with  a  properly  completed  letter  of  transmittal,  each holder of shares of
Agribrands  Common Stock (the "Agribrands Holders") or Ralcorp Common Stock (the
                               ------------------
"Ralcorp  Holders")  will  be  entitled  to  receive promptly after the Election
-----------------
Deadline  the  Merger  Consideration  in respect of the shares of the Agribrands
Common  Stock  or Ralcorp Common Stock represented by his Certificate.  Until so
surrendered, each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time, for
all  purposes,  only  the  right  to  receive  the  Merger  Consideration.

     (c)     If  any  portion  of  the  Merger  Consideration is to be paid to a
Person  other  than  the  Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered,  it shall be a condition to such payment that such Certificate shall
be  properly  endorsed  or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the
Person  requesting  such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or
other  taxes  required  as  a  result of such payment to a Person other than the
registered  holder  of such Certificate, or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange  Agent  that  such  tax  has  been  paid  or  is  not  payable.

     (d)     Any  portion  of  the  Exchange Fund made available to or deposited
with  the  Exchange  Agent pursuant to Section 3.4 that remains unclaimed by the
Agribrands  Holders  and  Ralcorp  Holders,  six months after the Effective Time
shall  be  returned to Holding Company, upon demand, and any such holder who has
not  exchanged  his  shares for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this

<PAGE>

Section 3.4 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Holding Company for
payment of such consideration, and any dividends and distributions in respect of
such  shares,  in  each  case without any interest thereon.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing,  Holding  Company  shall  not  be  liable to any Agribrands Holder or
Ralcorp  Holder for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.  Any amounts remaining unclaimed by
the  Agribrands  Holders  or Ralcorp Holders five years after the Effective Time
(or  such  earlier  date,  immediately prior to such time when the amounts would
otherwise  escheat  to  or  become property of any Governmental Authority) shall
become,  to  the  extent  permitted  by  applicable law, the property of Holding
Company  free  and  clear  of  any  claims  or interest of any Person previously
entitled  thereto.

     (e)     No  dividends  or  other  distributions with respect to any Holding
Company  Common  Stock  and  no  cash  payment  in  lieu of fractional shares as
provided  in  Section  3.6,  shall  be  paid  to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificates until such Certificates are surrendered as provided in Section 3.4.
Following  such  surrender, there shall be paid, without interest, to the Person
in  whose name such Holding Company Common Stock has been registered, (i) at the
time  of such surrender, (A) in the case of Certificates, the amount of any cash
payable  in  lieu of fractional shares to which such Person is entitled pursuant
to  Section 3.6, and (B) the amount of all dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time previously paid or payable on the date of
such  surrender,  with respect to such Holding Company Common Stock, and (ii) at
the  appropriate  payment  date,  the amount of dividends or other distributions
with  a  record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender, and with a
payment  date  subsequent  to  surrender,  payable  with respect to such Holding
Company  Common  Stock.

     (f)     (i)  If  the  percentage  of  shares  of  Agribrands  Common  Stock
outstanding  immediately  prior to the Effective Time for which Agribrands Stock
Elections  were made (the "Agribrands Stock Election Percentage") is equal to or
                           ------------------------------------
greater  than  80%,  then  all  shares  of  Agribrands  Common  Stock covered by
Agribrands  Stock  Elections shall be converted into the right to receive shares
of  Holding  Company  Common  Stock,  and  all shares of Agribrands Common Stock
covered  by  Agribrands  Cash  Elections  shall  be  converted into the right to
receive  the  Agribrands  Cash  Consideration.

          (ii)  If  the  Agribrands  Stock Election Percentage is less than 80%,
then all shares of Agribrands Common Stock covered by Agribrands Stock Elections
shall  be  converted  into the right to receive shares of Holding Company Common
Stock,  and  the  shares  for which each holder made an Agribrands Cash Election

       ----------------------------------

               (A) Such holder shall be deemed to have made the Agribrands Stock
Election  in  respect  of  a  fraction  (not  greater than one) of such holder's
Agribrands Cash Election Shares, (x) the numerator of which is the difference of
80%  minus  the Agribrands Stock Election Percentage, and (y) the denominator of

403(a), such Benefit Plan has received a favorable determination letter from the
IRS  that  it  so  qualifies,  and  its trust is exempt from taxation under Code
Section  501(a)  and, to the knowledge of Agribrands, nothing has since occurred
to  cause  the loss of the Benefit Plan's qualification; (ii) except for payment

not been made have been properly recorded on the Agribrands Financial Statements
in a manner satisfying the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards 87 and
88  except, in each case, for any deviations from the foregoing which do not and
would  not reasonably be expected to have an Agribrands Material Adverse Effect.

     (d)     No  Benefit  Plan is a pension plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or
Section  412  of  the  Code.  Each  of  the Benefit Plans has been maintained in

intended  to  meet the requirements for tax-favored treatment under Subchapter B
of  Chapter  1  of  the  Code  meets  such  requirements.

     (f)     Except  as  provided  in Section 6.9 below, the consummation of the

pay,  (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting of benefits or increase the
amount  of compensation due to any individual; or (iii) give rise to the payment

required  to  be  maintained  by  the  law  or  applicable custom or rule of the
relevant jurisdiction outside of the United States (the "Foreign Plans") except,
in  each  case,  for  any  deviations  from the below which do not and would not
reasonably  be  expected  to  have  an  Agribrands  Material  Adverse  Effect:

under  the Foreign Plans, for any period ending before the Closing Date that are
not yet, but will be, required to be made, are reflected as an accrued liability
on  the  Balance  Sheet;

     (iii)     All  reports, returns and similar documents, if any, with respect
to  any  Foreign  Plan  required  to  be  filed  with  any  governmental body or
distributed  to  any Foreign Plan participant have been duly and timely filed or
distributed  or will be filed or distributed by the Closing Date, and all of the
Foreign  Plans have obtained from the governmental body having jurisdiction with

          ------------------------
     (a)     There  are no Benefit Plans maintained or contributed to by Ralcorp

determination  letter from the IRS that it so qualifies, and its trust is exempt

nothing  has  since  occurred  to  cause  the  loss  of  the  Benefit  Plan's

value  of the assets of such Benefit Plan as determined pursuant to Code Section
412,  and  (ix)  neither  Ralcorp  nor  any Ralcorp Subsidiary has completely or
partially withdrawn from a Plan that is a Multi-employer Plan, and Ralcorp would
not  become  subject  to  liability  under  ERISA  if  Ralcorp  were to withdraw
completely  from  all  multi-employer  plans in which it currently participates,

Directors  of  Agribrands  determines  in  good  faith,  after consultation with
outside  counsel,  that  it  is  necessary  to  do  so to discharge properly its
fiduciary  duties  to shareholders, Agribrands may, in response to an Agribrands
Acquisition  Proposal  that  such  Board  determines in good faith is reasonably
likely  to  result  in  an  Agribrands  Superior Proposal (as defined in Section
6.10(c)),  and  subject  to  such  party's  compliance with Section 6.10(b), (A)
furnish  information  with  respect  to  Agribrands  to  the  person making such
Agribrands  Acquisition  Proposal  pursuant  to  a  customary  confidentiality
agreement  the  terms  of which are no more favorable to the other party to such
confidentiality  agreement  than those in place with Ralcorp and (B) participate
in  discussions  with  respect  to  such Agribrands Acquisition Proposal.  It is
expressly  understood  and  agreed  that  with respect to the foregoing proviso,
Agribrands'  legal  and  financial advisors shall be able to make inquiries, and

acquire  beneficial  ownership or any "group" (as such term is defined under the
Exchange Act) shall have been formed which beneficially owns or has the right to
acquire  beneficial  ownership of, 20% or more of the outstanding voting capital
stock of Agribrands. "Agribrands Superior Proposal" means a bona fide Agribrands
                      ----------------------------
Acquisition  Proposal  made  by  a  third  party  which  was  not  solicited  by
Agribrands,  its subsidiaries, representatives or other affiliates and which, in
the  good faith judgment of Agribrands' Board of Directors, taking into account,
to  the extent deemed appropriate by Agribrands' Board of Directors, the various
legal,  financial  and  regulatory aspects of the proposal and the person making
such  proposal  (A) if accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated, and (B)
if  consummated,  is  reasonably  likely to result in a transaction that is more
favorable  to Agribrands' shareholders (in their capacity as shareholders), from
a financial point of view, than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     (d)     If  the  Agribrands  Board  of  Directors  is prepared to accept an
Agribrands Superior Proposal, then Agribrands shall give Ralcorp 48 hours notice
that Agribrands is prepared to accept the Agribrands Superior Proposal, provided

is  or  may  be  an  "affiliate"  of  Agribrands  within the meaning of Rule 145
promulgated  under the Securities Act shall enter into an agreement in customary
form.

   6.13.  TAKEOVER  STATUTES.
          ------------------
     If  any  Takeover  Statute  is  or  may become applicable to the Agribrands
Merger  or  the  transactions contemplated hereby, Agribrands and the members of
its  Board  of  Directors  will  grant  such  approvals and will take such other
actions  as  are  necessary  so  that  the  Agribrands  Merger  and  the  other
transactions  contemplated  by  this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and will otherwise act to eliminate
or minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on the Agribrands Merger and any
of  the  transactions  contemplated  hereby.

an  opinion  of tax counsel in form and substance satisfactory to Ralston Purina
(which  opinion  shall  recite  that it may be relied upon by Ralcorp) or (ii) a
supplemental  ruling  from  the  IRS  that the transactions contemplated by this

Proposal.  It  is  expressly  understood  and  agreed  that  with respect to the

Superior  Proposal"  means  a  bona  fide Ralcorp Acquisition Proposal made by a
------------------
third  party  which  was  not  solicited  by  Ralcorp,  its  subsidiaries,
representatives  or  other  affiliates  and which, in the good faith judgment of
Ralcorp's  Board  of  Directors,  taking  into  account,  to  the  extent deemed
appropriate  by  Ralcorp's  Board of Directors, the various legal, financial and
regulatory  aspects  of  the proposal and the person making such proposal (A) if
accepted,  is  reasonably  likely  to be consummated, and (B) if consummated, is
reasonably likely to result in a transaction that is more favorable to Ralcorp's
shareholders  (in  their  capacity  as  shareholders), from a financial point of
view,  than  the  transactions  contemplated  by  this  Agreement.

     (d)     If  the  Ralcorp Board of Directors is prepared to accept a Ralcorp
Superior  Proposal,  then  Ralcorp  shall  give  Agribrands 48 hours notice that
Ralcorp  is  prepared  to  accept  the  Ralcorp Superior Proposal, provided that

Ralcorp  may  not definitively accept a Ralcorp Superior Proposal unless Ralcorp
concurrently  therewith  terminates  this  Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(f)

          ------------------
     If  any  Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to the Ralcorp Merger
or the transactions contemplated hereby, Ralcorp and the members of its Board of
Directors  will  grant  such  approvals  and will take such other actions as are
necessary  so that the Ralcorp Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this  Agreement  may  be  consummated  as  promptly  as practicable on the terms
contemplated  hereby and will otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects
of  any  Takeover  Statute  on  the  Ralcorp  Merger and any of the transactions

                                     ARTICLE VIII.

 ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF AGRIBRANDS AND RALCORP WITH RESPECT TO HOLDING COMPANY

     Agribrands and Ralcorp covenant and agree that they will take the necessary
actions  prior  to  the  Effective  Time  to  cause  Holding  Company  to do the
following:

    8.1.  DIRECTOR  AND  OFFICER  LIABILITY.
          (a)  Holding  Company  shall  indemnify  and hold harmless and advance
expenses  to  the  present  and  former officers and directors of Agribrands and
Ralcorp,  and  each person who prior to the Effective Time becomes an officer or
director  of Agribrands or Ralcorp (each an "Indemnified Person"), in respect of
                                             ------------------
acts  or  omissions by them in their capacities as such occurring at or prior to
the  Effective  Time  (including,  without  limitation,  for  acts  or omissions
occurring in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the Mergers)
to  the  fullest  extent  permissible  under  applicable  law (collectively, the
"Indemnified  Losses").  Without  limiting  the generality of the foregoing, the
--------------------
Indemnified  Losses  shall include reasonable costs of prosecuting a claim under
this  Section  8.1(a).  Holding  Company shall periodically advance or reimburse
each  Indemnified  Person  for  all  reasonable  fees  and  expenses  of counsel
constituting Indemnified Losses as such fees and expenses are incurred; provided
that  such  Indemnified  Person shall agree to promptly repay to Holding Company
the  amount  of  any  such reimbursement if it shall be judicially determined by

<PAGE>

judgment  or  order  not  subject to further appeal or discretionary review that
such  Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified by Holding Company in
connection  with  such  matter.

     (b)  For  six years after the Effective Time, Holding Company shall provide
officers'  and  directors'  liability  insurance in respect of acts or omissions
occurring  prior  to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, for acts
or omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of
the  Mergers)  covering  each  such  Indemnified  Person  currently  covered  by
Agribrands' officers' and directors' liability insurance policy (with respect to
officers  and  directors of Agribrands) or by Ralcorp's officers' and directors'
liability  insurance  policy (with respect to officers and directors of Ralcorp)
on  terms  with  respect  to  coverage and amount (including with respect to the
payment  of  attorney's  fees)  no  less  favorable than those of such policy in
effect on the date hereof (which policies have been made available by Agribrands
and  Ralcorp  to  each  other  and  to  Holding  Company);  provided that if the
aggregate  annual  premiums  for  such insurance during such period shall exceed
200%  of  the  per annum rate of premium paid by Agribrands (with respect to the
liability  insurance  policies  of  the officers and directors of Agribrands) or
Ralcorp  (with  respect  to the liability insurance policies of the officers and
directors  of  Ralcorp)  as  of the date hereof for such insurance, then Holding
Company shall provide a policy with the best coverage as shall then be available
at  200%  of  such  rate.

     (c)  The  rights  of each Indemnified Person and his or her heirs and legal
representatives  under  this Section 8.1 shall be in addition to any rights such
Person  may  have  under  the  articles of incorporation or bylaws of Agribrands
(with respect to the Agribrands officers and directors) or Ralcorp (with respect
to  the  Ralcorp  officers  and  directors),  any  agreement  providing  for
indemnification,  or  under  the  laws  of  the  State  of Missouri or any other
applicable Laws.  These rights shall survive consummation of the Mergers and are
intended  to  benefit,  and  shall  be  enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

    8.2.  LISTING  OF  STOCK.
          ------------------
          Holding Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause (i) the
shares of Holding Company Common Stock to be registered under the Securities Act
and  issued  in  connection  with the Mergers (and the shares of Holding Company
Common  Stock underlying the securities to be issued pursuant to Section 3.5) to
be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, and
(ii)  the  securities  of  Agribrands  and  Ralcorp to be de-listed from NYSE in
connection  with  the  Closing.

    8.3.  REGISTRATION  STATEMENT;  PROSPECTUS/PROXY  STATEMENT.
          -----------------------------------------------------
          Agribrands,  Ralcorp  and Holding Company shall cooperate and promptly
prepare  and  Holding  Company  shall file with the SEC as soon as practicable a
Registration  Statement  on  Form  S-4 or other applicable form (the "Form S-4")
                                                                      --------
under  the Securities Act, with respect to Holding Company Common Stock issuable
in  the  Mergers,  a portion of which Registration Statement shall also serve as
the joint proxy statement with respect to the Agribrands Shareholder Meeting and
Ralcorp  Shareholder Meeting (the "Proxy Statement/Prospectus").  The respective
                                   --------------------------
parties  will cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 to comply as
to  form  in  all  material  respects  with  the  applicable  provisions  of the
Securities  Act,  the  Exchange  Act  and  the rules and regulations thereunder.
Holding  Company  shall  use  all reasonable efforts, and Agribrands and Ralcorp
will  cooperate with Holding Company, to have the Form S-4 declared effective by
the SEC as promptly as practicable and to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as
is  necessary  to consummate the Mergers.  Holding Company shall, as promptly as
practicable,  provide  copies of any written comments received from the SEC with
respect  to  the  Form  S-4  to Agribrands and Ralcorp and advise Agribrands and
Ralcorp  of  any  verbal comments with respect to the Form S-4 received from the
SEC.  Holding  Company  shall  use  its  best  efforts  to  obtain, prior to the
effective date of the Form S-4, all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky"
permits or approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this

<PAGE>

Agreement  and  will  pay all expenses incident thereto.  Holding Company agrees
that  the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and each amendment or supplement thereto at
the  time  of  mailing  thereof  and  at  the time of the Agribrands Shareholder
Meeting  and  Ralcorp  Shareholder  Meeting, or, in the case of the Form S-4 and
each  amendment  or  supplement  thereto,  at  the  time  it is filed or becomes
effective,  will  not  include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state  a  material  fact  required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements  therein,  in  light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not  misleading;  provided,  however,  that the foregoing shall not apply to the
extent  that any such untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state a
material  fact  was  made  by Holding Company in reliance upon and in conformity
with  written  information  concerning  Agribrands  and/or  Ralcorp furnished to
Holding  Company  by Agribrands and/or Ralcorp specifically for use in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus.  Agribrands and Ralcorp agree that the written information
provided  by  them  for  inclusion  in  the  Proxy Statement/Prospectus and each
amendment  or supplement thereto, at the time of mailing thereof and at the time
of  the  Agribrands  Shareholder Meeting and Ralcorp Shareholder Meeting, or, in
the  case  of  written  information  concerning either Agribrands or Ralcorp for
inclusion in the Form S-4 or any amendment or supplement thereto, at the time it
is  filed  or  becomes  effective,  will  not  include  an untrue statement of a
material  fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary  to  make  the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which  they  were made, not misleading.  No amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus  will  be  made  by Holding Company without the approval of
Agribrands  and  Ralcorp.  Holding  Company  will advise Agribrands and Ralcorp,
promptly  after  it  receives  notice thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has
become  effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of
any  stop  order,  the  suspension  of  the qualification of the Holding Company
Common Stock issuable in connection with the Mergers for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction,  or  any  request  by  the  SEC  for  amendment  of  the  Proxy
Statement/Prospectus  or  the Form S-4 or comments thereon and responses thereto
or  requests  by  the  SEC  for  additional  information.  Whenever any event or
condition  affecting  Agribrands  or  Ralcorp  occurs that is required to be set
forth  in  an  amendment  or  supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, such
party  will promptly inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate in filing
with  the  SEC or its staff or any other government officials, and in mailing to
shareholders  of  Agribrands  and  Ralcorp,  such  amendment  or  supplement.

    8.4.  TAX  TREATMENT.
          --------------
     Holding  Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Ralcorp
Merger  and  the  Agribrands  Merger to qualify as either, and will not take any
action  which  to  its  knowledge  could  reasonably  be expected to prevent the
Ralcorp  Merger  and  the  Agribrands  Merger  from  qualifying  as  either,  a
reorganization  under Section 368(a) of the Code or as an exchange under Section
351(a) of the Code.   Prior to the Effective Time, Holding Company shall provide
tax  counsel  to Agribrands and Ralcorp rendering an opinion under Section 9.1.8
below  with  such  certificates  concerning such factual matters as such counsel
identifies  are  relevant  to  its  opinion.

to  the  Effective  Time  a  shareholder rights agreement so that the holders of

Company  Common  Stock pursuant to the terms hereof will also receive associated
rights  that  are  similar  to  the  rights as provided by the Agribrands Rights
Agreement  and  the  Ralcorp  Rights  Agreement.

Percentage, and (ii) the denominator of which is the percentage of shares of the
