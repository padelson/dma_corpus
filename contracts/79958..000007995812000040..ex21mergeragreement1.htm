used as defined in Section 9.12.

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company ("Company Board"), acting upon
the unanimous recommendation of a special committee of independent directors
of the Company (the "Special Committee") has unanimously determined (i) that
this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Support Agreement, on the
terms and subject to the conditions provided for in this Agreement and the
Support Agreement, are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of,
the Company and its stockholders and (ii) recommended that the holders of
Company Common Stock accept the Offer, tender their shares of Company Common
Stock to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer, and, to the extent applicable, adopt
this Agreement and thereby approve the Transactions;

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Purchaser, the Company and
Parent have approved this Agreement and the Transactions on the terms and
subject to the conditions provided for in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, Purchaser shall commence a tender offer to purchase all of the shares
of common stock, $.01 par value per share, of the Company ("Company Common
Stock") outstanding (each, a "Share" and, collectively, the "Shares") for
$16.50 per Share (such amount or any greater amount per Share paid pursuant to
the Offer being hereinafter referred to as the "Offer Price"), subject to any
required withholding of Taxes, net to the seller in cash, on the terms and
subject to the conditions provided for in this Agreement (such cash tender
offer, as it may be amended from time to time as permitted by this Agreement,
the "Offer");

WHEREAS, if the Offer Closing occurs, Purchaser shall merge with and into the
Company, with the Company being the surviving corporation, in accordance with
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), pursuant to
which the Shares (other than certain Shares as provided in Section 3.1) that
were not tendered and accepted pursuant to the Offer will be converted into
the right to receive the Offer Price, subject to any required withholding of
Taxes, on the terms and subject to the conditions provided for in this
Agreement (the "Merger"); and

WHEREAS, Parent has required as a condition to its willingness to enter into
this Agreement that certain stockholders of the Company (the "Supporting
Stockholders") enter into a Support Agreement, dated as of the date hereof
(the "Support Agreement"), simultaneously herewith, pursuant to which, among
other things, each Supporting Stockholder has agreed to (i) tender all Shares
it beneficially owns in the Offer and (ii) take certain other actions in
furtherance of the Merger, in each case, on the terms and subject to the
conditions provided for in the Support Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, Parent, Purchaser and the Company hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I 

THE OFFER

Section 1.1 The Offer.

(a) Commencement of the Offer. Purchaser shall commence (within the meaning of
Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Exchange Act")) the Offer
to purchase all of the outstanding Shares at a price per Share equal to the
Offer Price (as adjusted pursuant to Section 1.1(g), if applicable) as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, but no later
than November 20, 2012, provided that, if the Company fails to satisfy its
obligations under Section 1.2(b) in a timely manner to allow for Purchaser to
reasonably meet such deadline, then Purchaser shall have a reasonable
additional period of time in which to commence the Offer as promptly as
practicable after receiving the information from the Company under Section
1.2(b).

(b) Terms and Conditions of the Offer. The obligation of Purchaser to, and of
Parent to cause Purchaser to, accept for payment and pay for Shares tendered
pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to the satisfaction (or waiver by
Parent and Purchaser) of the conditions set forth in Annex A hereto (the
"Offer Conditions"). To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent and
Purchaser expressly reserve the right to waive any of the Offer Conditions
(other than the Minimum Tender Condition or the Notice Period Condition), to
increase the price per Share payable in the Offer and to make any other
changes in the terms of the Offer; provided, however, that no change may be
made without the prior written consent of the Company that (i) decreases the
price per Share payable in the Offer, (ii) changes the form of consideration
to be paid in the Offer, (iii) reduces the maximum number of Shares sought to
be purchased in the Offer, (iv) imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to
the Offer Conditions, (v) amends, modifies or waives the Minimum Tender
Condition, (vi) modifies or amends any of the Offer Conditions in any manner
adverse to the holders of Shares, (vii) amends, modifies or waives the Notice
Period Condition or (viii) except as provided in Section 1.1(c), extends the
Initial Offer Expiration Date or any other scheduled expiration of the Offer.

(c) Expiration and Extensions of the Offer. The Offer shall initially be
scheduled to expire at midnight, New York City time, on the twentieth (20th)
Business Day following the commencement of the Offer (for this purpose
calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange
Act) (the "Initial Offer Expiration Date"); provided, however, that (i) if at
the Initial Offer Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not then satisfied
or, to the extent permitted by this Agreement and applicable Law, waived, then
Purchaser shall extend the Offer for a period of Business Days selected by
Purchaser that would permit the Offer Closing to occur no later than December
31, 2012 if the Offer Conditions are satisfied as of the end of such
extension, (ii) if at any other scheduled expiration of the Offer, any Offer
Condition is not then satisfied or, to the extent permitted by this Agreement
and applicable Law, waived, then Purchaser



2

US_ACTIVE:\\\44126911\\\17\\\77626.0003 

shall extend the Offer on one or more occasions for consecutive periods of up
to ten (10) Business Days each (for this purpose calculated in accordance with
Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act), each as determined by
Parent in its sole discretion, or for such longer period(s) as Parent and the
Company may otherwise agree, up until the Walk-Away Date in order to permit
such Offer Condition(s) to be satisfied; provided, however, that if, at any
scheduled expiration of the Offer, all of the Offer Conditions, except for the
Minimum Tender Condition, are satisfied or have been waived, Purchaser shall
only be required to extend the Offer for a maximum of two additional periods
of ten (10) Business Days (for this purpose calculated in accordance with Rule
14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act); and (iii) Purchaser shall be
required to extend the Offer on one or more occasions for the minimum period
required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") or the staff thereof or of the New York
Stock Exchange applicable to the Offer. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing
contained in this Section 1.1(c), the extension of the Offer shall be subject
to the parties' respective rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Article VIII, and nothing contained herein shall require Purchaser to extend
the period during which the Offer remains open to any date after the Walk-Away
Date or the termination of this Agreement. The "Initial Offer Expiration Date"
as it may be extended is referred to as the "Offer Expiration Date."
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 1.1, if
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1 before the Offer Closing,
then Purchaser shall promptly (and, in any event, within one (1) Business Day
after such termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if at any Offer
Expiration Date, all Offer Conditions have been satisfied or, to the extent
permitted by this Agreement, waived, Purchaser may not extend the Offer and
shall promptly accept for payment and pay for Shares tendered pursuant to the
Offer.

(d) Subsequent Offering Period. If, as of the Offer Closing, all of the
conditions to the Offer have been satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by
this Agreement and applicable Law, waived by Purchaser) but the number of
Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, when taken
together with Shares, if any, then owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries,
constitutes less than 90% of the Shares then outstanding, Purchaser shall have
the right to provide for a "subsequent offering period" (as contemplated by
Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act) without the consent of the Company.

(e) Payment. Subject to the terms of the Offer and this Agreement and the
satisfaction or permitted waiver of all the Offer Conditions, Purchaser shall
accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to
the Offer promptly after the Offer Expiration Date and in any event in
compliance with Rule 14d-10 and Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act. Parent
shall provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser on a timely basis the funds
necessary to pay for all Shares that Purchaser becomes so obligated to pay for
pursuant to the Offer and the other terms and conditions of this Agreement.
The Offer Price shall, subject to any required withholding of Taxes, be net to
the seller in cash, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer.
The Company agrees that no Shares held by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries will be tendered to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer. The payment
for Shares accepted for payment pursuant to and subject to the conditions of
the Offer is referred to in this Agreement as the "Offer Closing."

(f) Termination of the Offer. The termination of the Offer pursuant to Section
1.1(c) is referred to in this Agreement as the "Offer Termination." If the
Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Purchaser, or this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with Section 8.1, in each case, before the Offer Closing,
Purchaser shall promptly return, and shall cause any depository acting on
behalf of Purchaser to return, all tendered Shares to the registered holders
thereof in accordance with the terms of the Offer and applicable Law.

(g) Adjustments to Offer Price. The Offer Price shall be adjusted to the
extent appropriate to reflect the effect of any stock split, division or
subdivision of shares, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution
of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), cash dividend (other
than Permitted Dividends), reverse stock split, consolidation or combination
of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction
with respect to the Shares occurring or having a record date on or after the
date of this Agreement and prior to the Offer Closing; provided, that this
Section 1.1(g) shall not affect or supersede the provisions of Section 6.1.

(h) Offer Documents. As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement of
the Offer, Parent and Purchaser shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer
Statement on Schedule TO (together with all amendments, supplements and
exhibits thereto, the "Schedule TO") with respect to the Offer. The Schedule
TO shall contain or incorporate by reference an offer to purchase and forms of
the related letter of transmittal, summary advertisement, notices to brokers,
dealers and clients, and all other ancillary Offer documents (collectively,
together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "Offer

securities Laws for inclusion in the Offer Documents. Parent and Purchaser
shall cause the Offer Documents (i) to be disseminated to the holders of the
Shares as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws and
(ii) to comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of
the Exchange Act, the applicable rules and regulations of the New York Stock
Exchange and all other applicable Laws. Unless previously withdrawn in
accordance with Section 6.2(e), Parent and Purchaser shall be entitled to
include the Recommendations in the Offer Documents. Parent and Purchaser, on
the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent
that it shall be or shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and Parent and Purchaser shall cause the Offer Documents as so
corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of the Shares,
in each case, as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities
Laws. The Special Committee and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon the Offer Documents before they are
filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, and Parent and
Purchaser shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions
or changes suggested thereto by the Special Committee and its counsel. In
addition, Parent and Purchaser agree to provide the Special Committee and its
counsel with any comments, whether written or oral, that Parent or Purchaser
or their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments, to

and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. Parent and
its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon

Section 1.3 Directors of the Company.

(a) Composition of the Company Board and Committees. Upon the Offer Closing
and for so long as Parent and its Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly,
beneficially own in the aggregate more than 50% of the outstanding Shares,
Parent, in accordance with applicable Law, shall be entitled to designate at
least that number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number,
constituting the Company Board that equals the product of (i) the total number
of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to the election of directors
designated and elected by Parent pursuant to this Section 1.3(a)) and (ii) the
percentage that the aggregate number of Shares directly or indirectly
beneficially owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries (including Shares purchased
pursuant to the Offer) bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding,
and the Company shall promptly, at the request of Parent, take all necessary
action to cause Parent's designees to be elected or appointed to the Company
Board, including, if necessary, by increasing the total number of Company
directorships, and seeking and accepting resignations of incumbent directors.
At such time, the Company shall also, at the request of Parent, take all
necessary action to cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute the
number of members, rounded up to the next whole number, that represents the

Parent supplies to the Company on a timely basis all information with respect
to Parent, the Purchaser, their respective officers, directors and affiliates
and proposed designees required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1, the Company
shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule
14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3(b), including
mailing to stockholders (together with the Schedule 14D-9) any information
required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 to enable Parent's designees to be
elected or designated to the Company Board at the time or times contemplated
by this Section 1.3. Parent shall supply or cause to be supplied to the
Company any information with respect to Parent, the Purchaser, their
respective officers, directors and affiliates and proposed designees to the
Company Board required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

to the Effective Time, the Company Board shall be composed of not less than
three (3) Independent Directors, and (i) if the number of Independent
Directors shall ever be fewer than three (3) for any reason (or if immediately
following Offer Closing there are not at least three (3) then-existing
directors of the Company who are willing to serve as Independent Directors),
then the remaining Independent Director(s) shall be entitled to designate any
Qualified Person to fill each such vacancy and each such designated Qualified
Person shall be deemed to be an Independent Director for all purposes of this
Agreement, or (ii) if no Independent Directors remain for any reason, the
other directors shall be required to designate three (3) Qualified Persons to
fill such vacancies, and such



6

US_ACTIVE:\\\44126911\\\17\\\77626.0003 

persons shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for all purposes of this
Agreement. Subject to the Offer Closing, the Company shall, if Parent shall so
request, take all action necessary to elect to be treated as a "Controlled
Company" for purposes of New York Stock Exchange Rule 303A (or any successor
provision) and make all necessary filings and disclosures associated with such
status.

(d) "Independent Director" means any member of the Company Board while such
person is such a member thereof, who was a member of the Special Committee
prior to the date of this Agreement, and any successor of an Independent
Director who meets the standards of an "independent director" under Section
301 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and who was recommended or elected to so
succeed by a majority of Independent Directors.

(e) "Qualified Person" means any person who meets the standards of an
"independent director" under Section 301 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

(f) Independent Director Approval. Following the election or appointment of
Parent's designees pursuant to Section 1.3(a) and until the Effective Time,
the approval or written consent of a majority of the Independent Directors (or
of the sole Independent Director if there shall be only one (1) Independent
Director) shall be required for the Company to authorize (and, subject to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, such authorization shall
constitute the authorization of the Company Board and no other action on the
part of the Company, including any action by any other director of the
Company, shall be required to authorize) (such authorization, the "Independent
Director Approval"): (i) any consent or action by the Company required under
this Agreement, including any amendment or termination of this Agreement by
the Company, (ii) any extension of the time for performance of any obligation
or action hereunder by Parent or Purchaser, (iii) any waiver of compliance
with any covenant of Parent or Purchaser or any waiver of any other agreements
or conditions contained herein for the benefit of the Company or (iv) any
exercise of the Company's rights or remedies under this Agreement.

(g) No Limitation of Rights. The provisions of this Section 1.3 are in
addition to and shall not limit any rights that Parent, Purchaser or any of
their respective Affiliates may have as a record holder or beneficial owner of
Shares as a matter of applicable Law with respect to the election of directors
or otherwise.

stockholders of such amendment or supplement.

Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any Shares, or any
shares of capital stock of Purchaser:

(a) Capital Stock of Purchaser. Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Purchaser shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.

owned by the Company as treasury stock, and any Shares owned by Parent or
Purchaser, shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist without
any conversion thereof and no distribution or consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefor.

(c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each Share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 3.1(b) and Dissenting Shares)
shall be converted automatically into the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to the Offer Price, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). As of
the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of: (i) a
certificate which represented any such Shares (each, a "Certificate"), or (ii)
any non-certificated Shares represented by a book-entry (each, a "Book-Entry
Share"), in each case, that were outstanding immediately prior to the

right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor
upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with
Section 3.2(b), without interest.

Section 3.2 Exchange of Company Common Stock.

(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent
for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the

Corporation to, deposit, for the benefit of holders of shares of Company
Common Stock, the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of shares of
Company Common Stock shall become entitled pursuant to Section 3.1(c) with the

Consideration deposited with the Paying Agent shall, pending its disbursement
to such holders, be invested by the Paying Agent in (i) short-term direct
obligations of the United States of America, (ii) short-term obligations for
which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to

(b) Payment Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(c) (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificates) or transfer
of Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent, and which shall be in such form and
shall have such other customary provisions (including customary provisions
with respect to delivery of an "agent's message" with respect to Book-Entry
Shares) as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange
for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate or
transfer of a Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions (and such other customary documents as may
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent), the holder of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration, without interest, for each share of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate or held in book-entry form, and the
Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. If
payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is
registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (1) the Certificate or
Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer and (2) the Person requesting such payment
shall have paid any transfer and other similar taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or shall have
established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 3.2, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article III, without
interest.

(c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock. The Merger
Consideration paid in respect of Shares upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article
III shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the Shares previously represented by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, and at the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration
of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
that evidenced ownership of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares,
except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. Subject to the
last sentence of Section 3.2(e), if, at any time after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation
for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
Article III.

(d) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of



10

US_ACTIVE:\\\44126911\\\17\\\77626.0003 

a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this
Article III.

(e) Termination of Fund. At any time following six (6) months after the
Closing Date, Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver
to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) that
had been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed
to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders
shall be entitled to look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general
creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that
may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by
such holders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest
thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which
such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the
property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

(f) No Liability. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

(g) Withholding Taxes. Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to a holder of shares of Company
Common Stock such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Code"),
or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, the
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made. The parties agree to provide and to make customary requests for
information and documentation allowing for the avoidance of withholding.

Section 3.3 Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a stockholder
who did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and
who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Stockholders"), shall not be converted into
or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration (the
"Dissenting Shares"), but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of
the fair value of such Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262
of the DGCL (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares



11

US_ACTIVE:\\\44126911\\\17\\\77626.0003 

in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and
until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost rights to appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting
Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn
or lost such right, such holder's Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they
had been converted into and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as
of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each such Share, in
accordance with Section 3.1, without any interest thereon. The Company shall
give Parent prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any Shares,
attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to stockholders'
rights of appraisal. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to,
or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

Section 3.4 Termination of Company Stock Plan. Following the Offer Closing and
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to
terminate all of its Company Stock Plan, such termination to be effective at
the Effective Time. After the Effective Time, the Company Stock Plan shall be
terminated and no further options or other rights with respect to shares of
Company Common Stock shall be granted thereunder.

Section 3.5 Adjustments. Notwithstanding any provision of this Article III to
the contrary, without duplication to the effects of Section 1.1(g), if between
the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares
or a different class by reason of the occurrence or record date of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination,
exchange of shares or similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or
similar transaction; provided, that this Section 3.5 shall not affect or
supersede the provisions of Section 6.1.

Company is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or
the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it

to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Material Adverse Effect" shall mean, with respect to the Company,
any development, change, event, condition, occurrence or effect which,
individually or when taken together with all other developments, changes,
events, conditions, occurrences or effects that exist at the date of
determination, (i) prevents or materially delays, or would reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay, consummation of the Offer or the

its obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions, other
than developments, changes, events, conditions, occurrences or effects

provided that such developments, changes, events, conditions, occurrences or
effects do not affect the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole in a
materially disproportionate manner as compared to other comparable
participants in such industry; (2) general economic, financial, debt, credit
or securities markets conditions, in the United States or elsewhere in the
world, provided that such developments, changes, events, conditions,
occurrences or effects do not affect the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as

companies operating in the industry in which the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries primarily operate; (3) changes in Law or in generally accepted
accounting principles or in accounting standards, or changes in general legal,
regulatory or political conditions, provided that such developments, changes,

to other comparable companies operating in the industry in which the Company
and each of its Subsidiaries primarily operate; (4) the announcement or
performance of this Agreement or the pendency of the Transactions, including
the impact thereof on relationships, contractual or otherwise, with customers,

Agreement or the Transactions; (5) any action taken by the Company or its
Subsidiaries as required by this Agreement or with Parent's consent, or any
failure by the Company to take any action as a result of the restrictions in

change in trading volume, of the capital stock of such party or any failure of
the Company to meet internal projections or forecasts, or projections or
forecasts of any other Person, of revenues, earnings or cash flow for any

the avoidance of doubt this clause (6) shall not preclude either party from
asserting that the underlying cause of any such change in stock price or
trading volume or failure can be taken into account for purposes of
determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred).

failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good standing would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(c) The Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of

involves management or other employees who have a significant



18

US_ACTIVE:\\\44126911\\\17\\\77626.0003 

role in the Company's or its Subsidiaries' internal controls. The Company has
made available to Parent all such disclosures made by management to the
Company's auditors and audit committee of the Company Board since December 31,
2010. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms "significant deficiency" and

or (xiv) of Section 6.1(b).

Section 4.7 Legal Proceedings. There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the

purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, in the absence of a Takeover

arising or changes occurring after the date of this Agreement (such facts,
circumstances or changes, an "Intervening Event"), and taking into account the
results of any negotiations with Parent as contemplated by subsection (ii)
below and any offer from Parent contemplated by subsection (iii) below, that

five (5) Business Days in advance (the "Intervening Event Notice Period"), of
the Company's intention to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (it

facts, circumstances and other conditions giving rise to such Company Adverse
Recommendation Change;

(ii) prior to effecting such Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the
Company shall, and shall cause the Company's Representatives to, during the

Recommendation Change; and

(iii) Parent shall not have, within the aforementioned five (5) Business Day
period, made a written, binding and irrevocable (through the expiration of
such period) offer to modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement, which
is set forth in a definitive written amendment to this Agreement delivered to
the Company and executed on behalf of Parent and the Purchaser, that the
Special Committee has in good faith determined (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) would obviate the need for the Special Committee or the
Company Board to effect such Company Adverse Recommendation Change. In the
event of any material change (including successive changes) to the Intervening
Event, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent
and to comply with the requirements of this Section 6.2(f) with respect to
such new written notice (but in lieu of the five (5) Business Day Intervening
Event Notice Period, the Intervening Event Notice Period therefor shall be
three (3) Business Days).



38

US_ACTIVE:\\\44126911\\\17\\\77626.0003 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.2, prior to the
Offer Closing, if the Company receives a Takeover Proposal that the Special

legal counsel and a financial advisor, constitutes a Superior Proposal, after
giving effect to all of the adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement that have been delivered to the Company by Parent in writing during
the Notice Period provided pursuant to this Section 6.2(g), that are binding
and have been committed to by Parent in writing, and if such written Takeover
Proposal did not result from the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' or any
of its or their respective Representatives' breach of this Section 6.2, the
Special Committee may advise the Company Board to, and the Company Board may
at any time prior to the Offer Closing, if the Special Committee determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would reasonably be expected to breach the fiduciary duties
owed by the Special Committee or the Company Board to the stockholders of the
Company under Delaware Law, effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change,
with respect to such Superior Proposal and enter into a Company Acquisition
Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal if the Company shall have
concurrently with entering into such Company Acquisition Agreement terminated
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii); provided, however, the Company
may not take any of the actions pursuant to the foregoing provision unless:

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
five (5) Business Days in advance (the "Notice Period"), of the Company's
intention to take such action with respect to such Superior Proposal (it being
understood that the delivery of such notice and any amendment or update
thereto and the determination to so deliver such notice, update or amendment
shall not, by itself, constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change),
which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party
making such Superior Proposal) and shall have contemporaneously provided a
complete unredacted copy of the relevant proposed or final transaction
agreements and documents with the party making such Superior Proposal,
including the definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal;

(ii) prior to effecting such Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the
Company shall, and shall cause the Company's Representatives to, during the
Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent
desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement so that such Takeover Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior
Proposal; and Parent shall not have, within the aforementioned five (5)
Business Day period, made a written, binding and irrevocable (through the
expiration of such period) offer to modify the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, which is set forth in a definitive written amendment to this
Agreement delivered to the Company and executed on behalf of Parent and the
Purchaser, that the Company Board has in good faith determined (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor) would
cause such Takeover Proposal to cease to constitute a Superior Proposal. In
the event of any revisions to the financial terms of or other material terms
of the Superior Proposal (including successive revisions), the Company shall
be required



39

US_ACTIVE:\\\44126911\\\17\\\77626.0003 

to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements
of this Section 6.2(g) with respect to such new written notice and to provide
a new Notice Period pursuant to this Section 6.2(g) (but in lieu of five (5)
Business Days the applicable Notice Period therefor shall be three (3)
Business Days); and

(iii) At the conclusion of any Notice Period provided herein and prior to
effecting any Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Special Committee
shall reasonably determine in good faith after consultation with outside legal
counsel and a financial advisor that such Takeover Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal, and shall, concurrently therewith, provide Purchaser and
Parent with written notice of that determination.

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

"Takeover Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person
(other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) relating to any (i) acquisition of
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including securities of
Subsidiaries, but excluding sales of assets in the ordinary course of
business) equal to 20% or more of the Company's consolidated assets or to
which 20% or more of the Company's revenues on a consolidated basis are
attributable, (ii) acquisition of 20% or more of the outstanding Company
Common Stock, (iii) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would
result in any Person beneficially owning 20% or more of the outstanding
Company Common Stock or (iv) merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction
involving the Company; in each case, other than the Transactions.

"Superior Proposal" means a proposal to acquire, directly or indirectly
(whether by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, recapitalization, tender or exchange offer, asset sale or
otherwise), for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, more than
50% of the equity securities of the Company or more than 50% of the assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, made by a third
party, and which is otherwise on terms and conditions which the Special
Committee (and the Company Board based on a recommendation from the Special
Committee) determines in good faith (after consultation with the Special
Committee's financial and legal advisors), taking into account all relevant
factors, including the price, form of consideration, closing conditions, the
ability to finance the proposal, the identity of the Person or Persons making
the proposal and other aspects of the proposal that the Company Board deems
relevant, to be (i) more favorable to the Company's stockholders from a
financial point of view than the Transactions (including the Offer and
Merger), including any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent pursuant to Section 6.2 and (ii) reasonably capable of being
consummated on the terms proposed.

(i) Nothing in this Section 6.2 shall prohibit the Special Committee from
recommending to the Company Board, or the Company Board from taking and
disclosing to the Company's stockholders, a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the
Exchange Act, or other applicable Law, if the Special Committee or the Company
Board, as applicable, determines, after consultation with outside



40

US_ACTIVE:\\\44126911\\\17\\\77626.0003 

counsel, that disclosure of such position is required under applicable Law
(including any fiduciary duties of the Special Committee or the Company Board
arising thereunder) subject to compliance with the provisions of this Section
6.2. In addition, it is understood and agreed that, for purposes of this
Agreement (including Article VIII), a factually accurate public statement by
the Company that describes the Company's receipt of a Takeover Proposal and
the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto, or any "stop, look and
listen" communication by the Special Committee or the Company Board pursuant
to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, or any similar communication to the
stockholders of the Company, shall not constitute a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or a proposal for a Company Adverse Recommendation.

(j) The Special Committee shall not grant any waiver or release under any
standstill agreement with respect to any class of equity securities of the
Company; provided, however, (i) at any time prior to the Offer Closing, the
Special Committee may grant a waiver or release under any standstill agreement
with respect to any class of equity securities of the Company if the Special
Committee determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (ii) from the date hereof until the
No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company may grant any such waiver in writing
solely to permit any counterparty to any such agreement to make non-public
inquiries, proposals or offers that constitute or may reasonably be expected
to lead to any Takeover Proposal, so long as such waiver prohibits, without
the Special Committee's consent, any open market purchases of equity
securities or securities convertible into equity securities of the Company,
any Takeover Proposal not approved by the Special Committee or other action,
including a proxy contest, not approved by the Special Committee. The Company
shall provide written notice to Parent of any waiver of any standstill by the
Company within one (1) day after such waiver is given, which notice shall
contain a copy of such waiver including the identity of the recipient thereof.
Except for the waiver of standstill as contemplated by this Section 6.2(j),
the Company shall enforce, and shall not release or permit the release of any
Person from, or amend, waive, terminate or modify, and shall not permit the
amendment, waiver, termination or modification of, any provision of, any
confidentiality or similar agreement or provision to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party or under which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has any rights. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any
of its Representatives to, enter into any confidentiality agreement subsequent
to the date of this Agreement which prohibits the Company from providing to
Parent the information specifically required to be provided to Parent pursuant
to this Section 6.2.

Section 6.3 Preparation of the Proxy or Information Statement.

(a) As soon as practicable after the filing of the Schedule 14D-9 pursuant to
Section 1.2(a), (i) the Company shall prepare the Information Statement, (ii)
Parent shall promptly provide to the Company any information required for
inclusion in the Information Statement, and shall promptly provide such other
information or assistance in the preparation thereof as may be reasonably
requested by the Company and (iii) at Parent's request (if Parent and the
Company mutually determine in good faith that such filing would be permitted),
the Company shall file the Information Statement, in preliminary form with the
SEC. The Company shall thereafter use its reasonable best efforts to respond
as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect to the
Information Statement, and to cause the definitive Information Statement to be
filed



41

US_ACTIVE:\\\44126911\\\17\\\77626.0003 

with the SEC and mailed to the stockholders of the Company as promptly as
practicable after the Offer Closing. The Company shall include the
Recommendations, the Fairness Opinion, together with a summary thereof in
accordance with Item 1015(b) of Regulation M-A (regardless of whether such
item is applicable), a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL and all other
information required to be included under the Exchange Act, in the Information
Statement, and shall cause the Information Statement to comply as to form in
all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and to satisfy
all rules of the New York Stock Exchange. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior
to filing or mailing the Information Statement (or any amendment or supplement
thereto), or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto,
Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment upon the Information Statement, or any response to SEC comments with
respect thereto, before it is filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company, and the Company shall give due consideration to
all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent and
its counsel.

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other upon the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC
or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Information Statement and
shall provide such other party with copies of all written correspondence (or
if oral correspondence, summaries thereof) between such party and its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other
hand. In the event that the Company or Parent receives any comments from the
SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or
supplements to the Information Statement, each such party shall promptly
provide to the other any information or assistance as may reasonably be
requested by the other party in connection with the response to such comments
or such request. The Company shall provide Parent and Purchaser and their
respective counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in the formulation
of any response to any such comments of the SEC or its staff.

(c) If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information should be
discovered by any party hereto which should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Information Statement, so that such document would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto and, to the extent required by applicable Law, an appropriate amendment
or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed by the
Company with the SEC and disseminated by the Company to the stockholders of
the Company as and to the extent required by applicable Laws.

(d) The obligations under this Section 6.3 and Section 6.4 shall apply
notwithstanding any Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

Section 6.4 Stockholders Meeting; Action by Written Consent.

(a) If the Company Stockholder Approval is required by applicable Law in order
to consummate the Merger, then the Company shall, as soon as practicable after
the Clearance Date, either, in the sole discretion of Parent:



42

US_ACTIVE:\\\44126911\\\17\\\77626.0003 

(i) (A) establish a record date for (which record date shall be as soon as
legally permissible following the Offer Closing and shall not be changed
without the prior written consent of Parent) and give notice of a meeting of
its stockholders, for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval (the "Company Stockholders Meeting"); and (B) mail to the holders of
Shares as of the record date established for the Company Stockholders Meeting
a Proxy Statement (the date the Company elects to take such action or is
required to take such action, the "Proxy Date"); or

(ii) comply with all applicable Laws and the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Company in connection with any Written Consent in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement, including (A) preparing, filing with the SEC and
delivering to the Company's stockholders the Information Statement as required
pursuant to the Exchange Act and (B) giving prompt notice of the taking of the
actions described in the Written Consent in accordance with Section 228 of the
DGCL to all holders of Company Common Stock not executing the Written Consent,
together with any additional information required by the DGCL.

(b) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to, if applicable,
solicit from the stockholders of the Company proxies in favor the adoption of
this Agreement and shall take all other action necessary or advisable to
secure the vote or consent of the holders of Shares required by applicable Law
in order to consummate the Merger.

(c) If a Company Stockholders Meeting is held pursuant to Section 6.4(a)(i),
then the Company shall duly call, convene and hold the Company Stockholders
Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Proxy Date; provided,
however, that in no event shall such meeting be held later than thirty-five
(35) calendar days following the date the Proxy Statement is disseminated to
the stockholders of the Company. Subject to Section 6.2(e) hereof, the Company
shall, through the Company Board, recommend to its stockholders adoption of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, once the Company Stockholders
Meeting has been called and noticed, the Company shall not adjourn or postpone
the Company Stockholders Meeting without the consent of Parent, except (i) for
the absence of a quorum or (ii) to the extent necessary to ensure that any
required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the
Company's stockholders; provided, however, that Parent may require the Company
to adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting, unless prior to such
adjournments or postponements, the Company shall have received an aggregate
number of proxies voting for the adoption of this Agreement, which have not
been withdrawn, such that the condition in Section 7.1(a) will be satisfied at
such meeting. The Company shall, upon the reasonable request of Parent, advise
Parent at least on a daily basis on each of the last ten (10) Business Days
prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting as to the aggregate
tally of proxies received by the Company with respect to the Company
Stockholder Approval. Without the prior written consent of Parent, (1) the
adoption of this Agreement and (2) if required by applicable Law, the vote, on
an advisory basis, on a proposal to approve the compensation that may be
payable to the Company's named executive officers in connection with the Offer
and the Merger as required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act shall be



43

US_ACTIVE:\\\44126911\\\17\\\77626.0003 

the only matters which the Company shall propose to be acted upon by the
stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, following the Offer Closing and, if
applicable, the expiration of any "subsequent offering period" as contemplated
by Section 1.1(d), Parent and its Affiliates shall own at least 90% of the
outstanding shares of each class and series of outstanding capital stock of
the Company, the parties shall take all necessary and appropriate action,
including with respect to the transfer to Purchaser of all Shares held by
Parent or its Affiliates, to cause the Effective Time to occur as soon as
practicable after the Offer Closing without the Company Stockholders Approval
in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

(e) Each of Parent and Purchaser shall affirmatively vote at the Company
Stockholders Meeting, by Written Consent or otherwise all Shares acquired in
the Offer, or otherwise beneficially owned by it or any of its respective
Subsidiaries as of any applicable record date, for the adoption of this
Agreement in accordance with applicable Law.

Section 6.5 Reasonable Best Efforts.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto shall cooperate with the other parties and use (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to
promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions to
Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable and to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Transactions,
including preparing and filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect
all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations,
submissions of information, applications and other documents (including any
required or recommended filings under applicable Antitrust Laws), and (ii)
obtain all approvals, consents, waivers, registrations, permits,
authorizations and other confirmations from any Governmental Authority or
third party necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Transactions.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, (i) each party
hereto agrees to make and effect as promptly as practicable all registrations,
filings and submissions required to be made or effected by it pursuant to the
Exchange Act and other applicable Law with respect to the Transactions,
including the making of an appropriate filing of a Form CO notification to the
European Commission pursuant to Council Regulation n°139/2004 as soon as
practicable after the date hereof, the making of an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
Transactions within five (5) Business Days of the date hereof, the supply as
promptly as practicable of any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and the use of its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions consistent with
this Section 6.5 necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act (including any extensions
thereof) as soon as practicable; and (ii) the Company and Parent shall each
use its reasonable best efforts to (A) take all action necessary to ensure
that no state takeover statute or similar Law is or becomes applicable to any
of the Transactions and (B) if any state takeover statute or similar Law
becomes applicable to any of the Transactions, take all action necessary to
ensure that the Transactions may



44

US_ACTIVE:\\\44126911\\\17\\\77626.0003 

be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise minimize the effect of such Law on the Transactions.

(c) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions
and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a
Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions, including any proceeding
initiated by a private party, and (ii) keep the other party informed in all
material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any material
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the
Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice,
the European Commission or any other Governmental Authority and of any
material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by
a private party, in each case regarding any of the Transactions. Subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, each party hereto
shall consult and cooperate with the other parties and will consider in good
faith the views of the other parties in connection with any analysis,
appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal
made or submitted in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation,
action or other legal proceeding. In addition, except as may be prohibited by
any Governmental Authority or by Law, in connection with any such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or other legal proceeding, each party hereto
shall permit authorized Representatives of the other parties (1) to be present
at each meeting or conference with a representative of a Governmental
Authority relating to such request, inquiry, investigation, action or other
legal proceeding and (2) to have access to and be consulted in connection with
any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental
Authority in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action
or other legal proceeding. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of
its Subsidiaries nor any of its or their Representatives to, compromise,
settle, come to a settlement arrangement regarding any Action hereby or
consent thereto unless Parent shall otherwise consent in writing, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 6.5, each of the parties hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted
by a Governmental Authority or other Person with respect to the Transactions.
Without limiting any other provision hereof, Parent and the Company shall each
use its reasonable best efforts to (i) avoid the entry of, or to have vacated
or terminated, any decree, order or judgment that would restrain, prevent or
delay the consummation of the Transactions, on or before the Walk-Away Date,
including by vigorously defending or contesting any Action in any court by any
Person that would otherwise prevent or materially impede, interfere with,
hinder or delay the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) avoid or eliminate each
and every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions so as to enable the
consummation of the Transactions to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and
in any event no later than the Walk-Away Date). Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Parent or any Affiliate of
Parent be required to (1) effect any divestiture or license of any assets of
Parent or any of its Affiliates or the assets of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, (2) hold separate any such assets or (3) agree to any
restrictions on the operations, business or assets of Parent or any of its
Affiliates or the Company or its Subsidiaries.

Section 6.6 Public Announcements. Neither the Company nor Parent, nor any of
their respective Subsidiaries, shall issue or cause the publication of any
press release with respect to the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement without
the prior consent of the other party, unless such party determines, after
consultation with outside counsel, that it is required by applicable Law or by
any listing agreement with or the listing rules of a national securities
exchange or trading market to issue or cause the publication of any press
release with respect to the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement, in which
event such party shall endeavor, on a basis reasonable under the
circumstances, to provide a meaningful opportunity to the other parties to
review and comment upon such press release and shall give due consideration to
all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto; provided,
however, that the party seeking to issue or cause the publication of any press
release with respect to the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement shall not be
required to provide any such review or comment to the other party in
connection with any disclosure relating to any Takeover Proposal or Adverse
Recommendation Change.

Section 6.7 Access to Information; Confidentiality. Subject to applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of information, the Company shall, and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries to, pursuant to the reasonable request of Parent and
Parent's Representatives furnish promptly to Parent (i) a copy of each report,
schedule and other document filed by it pursuant to the requirements of
federal or state securities Laws and (ii) such other information reasonably
requested in connection with the completion of the Transactions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to provide
information pursuant to this Section 6.7 if (x) the Company determines, in its
reasonable judgment, that doing so would violate applicable Law or a Contract
or obligation of confidentiality owing to a third-party, jeopardize the
protection of an attorney-client privilege, require disclosure of commercially
sensitive or personal information or result in the disclosure of any trade
secrets, or (y) such information relates to or includes the evaluation,
deliberations or minutes of the Special Committee or the Company Board (or any
committee thereof) related to the Transactions or any other strategic
alternatives involving the Company or any materials provided to the Special
Committee or the Company Board (or any committee thereof) in connection
therewith; provided however, the parties shall take reasonable efforts to
share information protected from disclosure under the attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other
privilege pursuant to this Section 6.7 in a manner so as to preserve the
applicable privilege or protection with respect to such information.

Until the Effective Time, any information provided pursuant to this Section
6.7 will be deemed "Confidential Information" (as such term is defined by the
Confidentiality Agreement) subject to the terms of that certain letter
agreement regarding, among other things, the confidentiality of certain
information provided to Parent in connection with its evaluation of the
Transactions, dated as of October 18, 2012, between Parent and the Company (as
it may be amended from time to time, the "Confidentiality Agreement"), and,
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall not, and shall
cause its Representatives not to, use such information for any purpose
unrelated to the consummation of the Transactions. No investigation, or
information received, pursuant to this Section 6.7 will modify any of the
representations and warranties of the Company.

Section 6.8 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i)
any notice or other communication



46

US_ACTIVE:\\\44126911\\\17\\\77626.0003 

received by such party from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
Transactions or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with the Transactions, if the subject matter of
such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could
be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, (ii) any
actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such
party's Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the
Transactions, (iii) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any fact, event or
circumstance known to it that is reasonably likely, individually or taken
together with all other existing facts, events and circumstances known to it,
to cause or result in any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article
VII or any conditions to the Offer not being satisfied, and (iv) the failure
of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any
representation or warranty, covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which would reasonably be
expected to result in any condition to the obligations of any party to effect
the Offer, the Merger or any other Transaction contemplated by this Agreement
not to be satisfied; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 6.8 shall not cure any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or otherwise limit
or affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

Section 6.9 Indemnification and Insurance.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to (i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the
Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director
or officer of the Company (each, an "Indemnitee" and, collectively, the
"Indemnitees") with respect to all claims, liabilities, losses, damages,
judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or
compromise) and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of legal
counsel) in connection with any claim, suit, action, proceeding or
investigation (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative)
(each, a "Claim"), whenever asserted, based on or arising out of, in whole or
in part, (A) the fact that an Indemnitee was a director or officer of the
Company (B) acts or omissions by an Indemnitee in the Indemnitee's capacity as
a director or officer of the Company, in each case under (A) or (B), at, or at
any time prior to, the Effective Time (including any claim, suit, action,
proceeding or investigation relating in whole or in part to the Transactions),
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, and (ii) assume all
obligations of the Company to the Indemnitees in respect of indemnification
and exculpation from liabilities (and advancement of expenses) for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as provided in the
Company Charter Documents. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent, from and
after the Effective Time until all applicable statutes of limitations have
expired, shall cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable to the
Indemnitees with respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and
officers, indemnification and advancement of expenses than are set forth as of
the date of this Agreement in the Company Charter Documents, which provisions
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees. In addition, from
and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
pay any reasonable expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of legal
counsel) of any Indemnitee under this Section 6.9 (including in connection
with enforcing the indemnity and other obligations referred to in this Section
6.9) as incurred to the fullest extent



47

US_ACTIVE:\\\44126911\\\17\\\77626.0003 

permitted under applicable Law, provided that the person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances to the extent required
by applicable Law.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase, and, following
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain with reputable
and financially sound carriers, fully pre-paid six-year "tail" policies to the
current directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciaries liability
insurance policies maintained as of the date hereof by the Company (the
"Current Policies"), which tail policies shall cover a period from the
Effective Time through and including the date six years after the Closing Date
with respect to claims arising from facts or events that existed or occurred
prior to or at the Effective Time, and which tail policies shall contain at
least the same coverage (including the scope and amount thereof) as, and
contain terms and conditions that are equivalent to, the coverage set forth in
the Current Policies; provided, however that (i) such "tail" policies shall
not require the payment of an aggregate premium in excess of two hundred-fifty
percent (250%) of the aggregate annual premium most recently paid by the
Company prior to the date hereof to maintain the Current Policies, (ii) prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall not enter into any Contract for a
"tail" policy without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and (iii) the Surviving
Corporation may substitute a policy or policies of comparable coverage for
such "tail" policies.

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.9 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or
her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have
by contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation under this Section 6.9 shall not be terminated or modified in such
a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this
Section 6.9 applies unless (1) such termination or modification is required by
applicable Law or (2) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing
to such termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the
Indemnitees to whom this Section 6.9 applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 6.9). Nothing in this Agreement is intended to,
shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to
directors' and officers' insurance claims under any policy that is or has been
in existence with respect to the Company or its officers or directors, it
being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this
Section 6.9 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any
such policies.

(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations thereof set
forth in this Section 6.9.

Section 6.10 Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses,
whether or not the Transactions are consummated.



48

US_ACTIVE:\\\44126911\\\17\\\77626.0003 

Section 6.11 Rule 16b-3. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to cause dispositions
of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a
director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

Section 6.12 Employee Matters.

(a) Employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries (the "Company Employees")
shall cease, as of the Offer Closing, to participate in The Employee 401(k)
Retirement Plan sponsored by Contran Corporation (the "Contran Plan"). At
Parent or the Surviving Corporation's request, the Supporting Stockholders
agree to facilitate a spin-off and asset transfer from the Contran Plan to a
new plan established by the Surviving Corporation or to a tax-qualified plan
of Parent.

(b) Parent shall assume sponsorship of, and all obligations and liabilities
with respect to, the TIMET Defined Benefit Retirement Plan (the "TIMET Plan").
The TIMET Plan is a pension plan sponsored and maintained by the Company whose
assets are held in Titanium Metals Corporation Master Retirement Trust (the
"TIMET Trust"), which TIMET Trust is sponsored and maintained by the Company
and qualifies under Section 501(a) of the Code. The TIMET Trust has invested
its assets in The Combined Master Retirement Trust (the "CMRT"), which CMRT is
a master trust sponsored and maintained by Contran and qualifies under Section
501(a) of the Code.

(c) As soon as practicable after the Offer Closing, and in any event within
thirty (30) days after the Offer Closing, the assets related to the TIMET Plan
(including the TIMET Trust), including all shares of common stock of Valhi,
Inc. ("Valhi Stock"), shall be transferred out of the CMRT to the TIMET Trust
and sponsorship of the TIMET Trust shall be retained by the Company or assumed
by Parent; provided, however, that all interests in private equity
partnerships credited to the TIMET Plan ("Partnership Interests") shall be
transferred when cash proceeds from the sale of such interests are received or
when transfers can be arranged in accordance with the governing partnership
documents. Assets to be transferred from the master trust will be cash only
except (i) shares of Valhi Stock, (ii) Partnership Interests credited to the
TIMET Plan for which an agreement to sell for cash is not obtained or (iii) as
the Parent and the trustee of the master trust mutually and reasonably agree
otherwise. Parent shall be provided with a valuation of all assets held in the
master trust with respect to the TIMET Plan as of the business day immediately
preceding the date of transfer, including methodology, the most recent master
trust audited financial statements, the most recent master trust monthly and
quarterly valuation reports (if daily reporting is not available) and the
daily valuation report as of the business day immediately preceding the date
of transfer (if daily reporting is available).

(d) If any of the TIMET Plan assets cannot be transferred on or before the
first business day following the Offer Closing, then the amount transferred
shall be adjusted for all investment earnings, interest, dividends, expenses
or losses of the master trust attributed to assets of the TIMET Plan for the
period between the Offer Closing and the business day immediately



49

US_ACTIVE:\\\44126911\\\17\\\77626.0003 

preceding the actual date of transfer, and reduced by the amount of any
benefit payments from such plan to prior to the asset transfer.

(e) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall be provided with any and all
original records reasonably necessary to determine the accrued benefits under
the TIMET Plan in the possession of the Supporting Stockholders, including
complete legal names of employees, beneficiaries, addresses, dates of birth,
dates of hire, dates of any status changes, termination dates and compensation
history of any person who may be entitled to a benefit under the TIMET Plan.

(f) Supporting Shareholders and the trustee of the master trust shall
reasonably cooperate in good faith with Parent and its representatives to
provide access to the TIMET Plan's actuaries, at Parent or the Company's
expense, and to information relating to the TIMET Plan's participation in the
master trust.

(g) This Section 6.12 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Article VI, express or
implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of
any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 6.12.

Section 6.13 Delisting. Parent shall take all steps required to cause the
Company's securities to be de-listed from the New York Stock Exchange and de-
registered under the Exchange Act as soon as practicable following the
Effective Time.

Section 6.14 Rule 14d-10. Prior to the expiration of the Offer, the Company
will take all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt under Rule
14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act any employment compensation, severance or
employee benefit arrangements that have been or will be entered into after the
date of this Agreement by the Company or its Subsidiaries with current or
future directors, officers or employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries and
to ensure that any such arrangements fall within the safe harbor provisions of
such rule.

Section 6.15 Control of Operations. After the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall establish a mechanism, subject to
applicable Law, reasonably acceptable to both Parties by which the Parties
will confer on a regular and continued basis regarding the general status of
the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and integration
planning matters.

Section 6.16 Termination of Agreements With Principal Stockholders. The
Contracts and other arrangements between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any Principal Stockholder, on the other
hand, described on Schedule 6.16 will be treated in the manner described in
Schedule 6.16 from and after the Offer Closing.

Section 6.17 Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any litigation
brought by stockholders of the Company against the Company and/or its
directors relating to the Transactions, and the Company shall not compromise,
settle, come to an arrangement regarding or agree to compromise, settle or
come to an arrangement regarding any litigation arising or resulting from the
Transactions or consent to the



50

US_ACTIVE:\\\44126911\\\17\\\77626.0003 

same without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

Section 6.18 Commercial Agreements. Neither this Agreement nor the
Transactions, nor any termination of this Agreement or the Transactions, shall
have any effect on any commercial agreements existing between Parent or any of
its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company or any of its Affiliates, on
the other hand, that were in effect before the execution and delivery of this
Agreement (the "Commercial Agreements"). The Commercial Agreements shall
remain in full force and effect from and after the date of this Agreement in
accordance with their terms unless and until they are amended or terminated in
accordance with their terms by the parties thereto.

ARTICLE VII 

CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

Section 7.1 Conditions to Each Party's Obligation to Effect the Merger. The
respective obligations of each party hereto to effect the Merger shall be
subject to the satisfaction (or waiver, if permissible under applicable Law)
on or prior to the Closing Date of the following conditions:

(a) Company Stockholder Approval. If required by Law, the Company Stockholder
Approval shall have been obtained; provided that this condition shall be
deemed to have been satisfied if the failure to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval is due to Parent's or Purchaser's failure to vote all Shares it
beneficially owns in favor of the Merger;

(b) No Injunctions or Restraints. No Law, injunction, judgment or ruling
enacted, promulgated, issued, entered, amended or enforced by any Governmental
Authority of competent jurisdiction (collectively, "Restraints") shall be in
effect enjoining, restraining, preventing or prohibiting consummation of the
Merger or making the consummation of the Merger illegal; and

(c) Offer Closing. The Offer Closing shall have occurred; provided, that this
condition shall be deemed satisfied with respect to Parent and Purchaser if
Purchaser shall have failed to purchase Shares pursuant to the Offer in breach
of its obligations under this Agreement.

Section 7.2 Frustration of Closing Conditions. None of the Company, Parent or
Purchaser may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.1,
to be satisfied if such failure was caused by such party's failure to use its
reasonable best efforts to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions,
as required by and subject to Section 6.5.

ARTICLE VIII 

TERMINATION

Section 8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the Transactions
abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval:



51

US_ACTIVE:\\\44126911\\\17\\\77626.0003 

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent duly authorized by
each of their respective boards of directors (which, in the case of the
Company, if the Offer Closing has occurred, shall be determined by the
Independent Directors, as provided in Section 1.3); or

(b) by either of the Company or Parent:

(i) if (A) the Offer Closing shall not have occurred on or before February 28,
2013 (the "Walk-Away Date") or (B) the Offer is terminated or withdrawn
pursuant to its terms and the terms of this Agreement without any shares of
Company Common Stock being purchased thereunder; provided, however, that
either the Company or Parent, by written notice to the other party prior to
such date, may extend the Walk-Away Date for an additional sixty (60) days, if
all Offer Conditions have been satisfied other than the conditions set forth
in clauses (ii) or (iii) of the second paragraph of Annex A hereto; provided,
further, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
8.1(b)(i) shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill in any
material respect any of its obligations under this Agreement has been the
cause of, or resulted in, the events specified in Section 8.1(b)(i); or

(ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in Section 7.1(b) shall be
in effect and shall have become final and non-appealable; provided, however,
that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(b)(ii) shall
not be available to a party if the issuance of such final, non-appealable
Restraint was primarily due to the failure of such party to perform any of its
obligations under this Agreement.

(c) prior to the Offer Closing, by Parent,

(i) if the Company shall have materially breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the
failure of an Offer Condition and (B) has not been waived by Parent or cured
by the Company within fifteen (15) days after the Company's receipt of written
notice thereof from Parent or is incapable of being cured by the Company by
the Walk-Away Date;

(ii) if a Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred (whether
or not in compliance with Section 6.2);

(iii) after a tender offer or exchange offer is commenced that, if successful,
would result in any Person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act) becoming a beneficial owner of 15% or more of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock (other than by Parent or Purchaser), and the
Company Board shall have failed to recommend that the Company's stockholders
not tender their Shares in such tender or exchange offer within ten (10)
Business Days after commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer;



52

US_ACTIVE:\\\44126911\\\17\\\77626.0003 

(iv) the Company Board shall have failed to reconfirm the Company
Recommendation promptly, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days,
following Parent's request that it do so, provided that Parent shall not make
more than two (2) such requests; or

(v) the Company shall have violated or breached (or be deemed pursuant to the
terms thereof, to have violated or breached) in any material respect any
provision of Section 6.2 and such violation or breach (or deemed violation or
breach) shall have materially and adversely affected Parent's ability to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the
terms hereof or otherwise had a material and adverse effect on Parent;

(d) prior to the Offer Closing, by the Company, if:

(i) Parent shall have materially breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the
failure of an Offer Condition and (B) has not been waived by the Company or
cured by Parent within fifteen (15) days after Parent's receipt of written
notice thereof from the Company or is incapable of being cured by Parent by
the Walk-Away Date, it being acknowledged and agreed that any termination by
the Company pursuant to this Section 8.1(d)(i) shall not constitute a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change;

(ii) (A) the Special Committee or the Company Board has made a determination
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with Section 6.2(g)
hereof and (B) the Company pays Parent the applicable termination fee set
forth in and pursuant to the terms of Section 8.3; or

(iii) if Purchaser shall have failed to commence the Offer on or prior to the
date provided therefor in Section 1.1(a) or consummate the Offer in accordance
with Section 1.1(c); provided, that the Company shall not be permitted to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d)(iii) if the reason
for Purchaser's failure to commence the Offer is due to the Company's material
breach of this Agreement.

(e) by either of the Company or Parent if the Support Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 4(e) thereof.

Section 8.2 Effect of Termination.

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in Section
8.1, written notice thereof shall be given to the other party or parties,
specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made,
and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void (other than Sections
6.10, 8.2 and 8.3, Article IX and the second to last sentence of Section 6.7,
and the Confidentiality Agreement in accordance with its terms, all of which
shall survive termination of this Agreement), and there shall be no liability
on the part of Parent, Purchaser or the Company or their respective directors,
officers and Affiliates, except that:



53

US_ACTIVE:\\\44126911\\\17\\\77626.0003 

(i) the Company may have liability as provided in Section 8.3; and

(ii) nothing shall relieve any party from liability for any Willful Breach of
any covenant set forth in this Agreement.

(b) In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1
prior to the expiration of the Offer, Parent and Purchaser will promptly
terminate the Offer upon such termination of this Agreement without the
purchase of Shares thereunder. If the Offer is terminated, all tendered Shares
not theretofore accepted for payment shall forthwith be returned to the
tendering stockholders.

Section 8.3 Fees and Expenses.

(a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 8.1(d)(ii), then, immediately upon such termination the Company shall
pay or cause to be paid to Parent, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds the Termination Fee.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(c)
(other than clause (i) thereof), then the Company shall promptly, but in no
event later than two (2) Business Days after termination of this Agreement,
pay Parent the Termination Fee.

(c) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) or 8.1(c)(i)
and (i) at any time on or after the date hereof and prior to such termination
a Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly announced and not publicly
withdrawn prior to such termination, and (ii) within twelve (12) months after
the date of such termination, the Company enters into a Company Acquisition
Agreement with respect to, or consummates, any transaction specified in the
definition of "Takeover Proposal", the Company shall pay Parent the
Termination Fee (less the amount of expenses previously reimbursed pursuant to
Section 8.3(e)) on the second (2nd) Business Day after the date of the first
to occur of the events referred to in clause (ii). For purposes of this
Section 8.3(c), "Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in
Section 6.2(h) except that references in Section 6.2(h) to "20%" shall be
replaced by "more than 50%" or, if the applicable transaction was not
recommended by the Special Committee or the Company Board and was not effected
pursuant to an agreement to which the Company is a party, "100%."

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event
that this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to and in accordance with

be required to pay and shall, subject to Section 9.8, pay in full to Parent
the Termination Fee pursuant to and in accordance with Section 8.3(a), Section
8.3(b) or Section 8.3(c), as applicable (less the amount of expenses
previously reimbursed pursuant to Section 8.3(e), if applicable), the payment
of such Termination Fee and the out-of-pocket cost and expenses of Parent
pursuant to Section 8.3(e) (if applicable) shall constitute the sole and
exclusive remedy of Parent and Purchaser with respect to any and all claims
against the Company and/or any of its Representatives, of whatever nature and
whenever arising, relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Offer or
the Merger.



54

US_ACTIVE:\\\44126911\\\17\\\77626.0003 

(e) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent
pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) or 8.1(c)(i) if, (i) at any time on or after the
date hereof and prior to such termination a Takeover Proposal shall have been
publicly announced and not publicly withdrawn prior to such termination and
(ii) the Offer Conditions (other than the Minimum Tender Condition) are
satisfied then, within two (2) Business Days after the receipt by the Company
of appropriate supporting documentation therefor, the Company shall pay or
cause to be paid to Parent an amount equal to the out-of-pocket costs and
expenses of Parent in connection with the Transactions in an amount not to
exceed $5,000,000.

(f) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3
are an integral part of the Transactions and that without such provisions
Parent and Purchaser would not have entered into this Agreement. If the
Company fails to pay the Termination Fee and Parent or Purchaser commences a
suit which results in an Order against the Company for the Termination Fee or
any portion thereof, the Company shall pay Parent and Purchaser their costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and disbursements) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the
Termination Fee or the unpaid portion thereof at the prime rate of Citibank
N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the
date of payment.

ARTICLE IX 

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 9.1 No Survival of Representations and Warranties. The representations
and warranties in this Agreement shall terminate at the Effective Time or, if
earlier, except as otherwise provided in Section 8.2, upon the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, as the case may be. This Section 9.1
shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the parties which, by its terms,
contemplates performance after the Effective Time. The Confidentiality

its terms, or, if earlier, (ii) terminate as of the Effective Time.

Section 9.2 Amendment or Supplement. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects, whether
before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, by written
agreement of the parties hereto authorized by action taken by their respective
boards of directors (which in the case of the Company after the Offer Closing
shall include the Independent Director Approval contemplated by Section 1.3);
provided, however, that following receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
there shall be no amendment or change to the provisions hereof which by Law
would require further approval by the stockholders of the Company without such
approval.

Time, any party may, subject to this Agreement and applicable Law, (a) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other party

the Company following the Offer Closing,



55

US_ACTIVE:\\\44126911\\\17\\\77626.0003 

the Independent Director Approval contemplated by Section 1.3 is obtained, if
applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company,
Parent or Purchaser in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right
hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of such party.

Section 9.4 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other parties, provided, that Parent or Purchaser may assign
any of its respective rights and obligations under this Agreement to any
direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent, and Purchaser may assign its rights
and obligations under this Agreement to Parent; provided, that, such
assignment shall not relieve Parent or Purchaser of any of their respective
obligations set forth in this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under this Section
9.4 shall be null and void. No assignment by any party shall relieve such
party of any of its obligations hereunder.

Section 9.5 Counterparts; Scanned Signatures. This Agreement may be executed
in counterparts (each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of
which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement) and shall
become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered (by fax, Portable Document Format (PDF) or other means
of electronic transmission) to the other parties. Facsimile or other
electronically scanned and transmitted signatures shall be deemed originals
for all purposes of this Agreement.

Section 9.6 Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries.

(a) This Agreement, together with Annex A hereto, the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Support Agreement, the Parent Disclosure Schedule and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all
other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the
parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 9.6(a) does not affect any
Commercial Agreements.

(b) Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall
confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any right or remedy of
any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement other than as
specifically provided in Section 6.9.

(a) This Agreement, together with Annex A hereto, the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Support Agreement, the Parent Disclosure Schedule and the

or causes of action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon,
arise out of or relate to this Agreement, the Related Documents or the
negotiation,



56

US_ACTIVE:\\\44126911\\\17\\\77626.0003 

execution, termination, validity, interpretation, construction, enforcement,
performance or nonperformance of this Agreement or the Related Documents or
otherwise arising from the relationship between the parties (including,
without limitation, any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or
related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this
Agreement or the Related Documents or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement or the Related Documents) (all such claims or causes of action, a
"Cause of Action") shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of
Delaware (including its laws regarding statutes of limitations), without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of Law provision or rules (whether of
the State of Delaware or otherwise) that would cause the application of Laws
of any other jurisdiction.

(b) All actions and proceedings that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to a Cause of Action shall be exclusively heard and determined in the Chancery
Court of the State of Delaware or any federal court sitting in the State of
Delaware, and the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such courts (and, in the case of appeals, appropriate
appellate courts therefrom) in any such action or proceeding and irrevocably
waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any objection which
they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such Cause of
Action brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum for the
maintenance of such dispute. The consents to jurisdiction set forth in this
paragraph shall not constitute general consents to service of process in the
State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided
in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other
than the parties hereto. The parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any
such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable law.

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
9.7(c).

Section 9.8 Specific Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this



57

US_ACTIVE:\\\44126911\\\17\\\77626.0003 

Agreement without the requirement for the posting of any bond, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
All rights and remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and
not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available. The parties
hereto further agree that by seeking the remedies provided for in this Section
9.8, a party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form
of relief that may be available to a party under this Agreement (including
monetary damages) in the event that the remedies provided for in this Section
9.8 are not available or otherwise are not granted. If Purchaser has received
(and not repaid to the Company) the Termination Fee, Purchaser shall not be
entitled to exercise any remedies under this Section 9.8. Any repayment of the
Termination Fee will not be deemed to be a waiver of any right to receive the
Termination Fee.
