accordance with this _Section 2.3(e)_. During the 20-day period following
the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, the Sellers Representative and the
Buyer Representative shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing the
Disputed Matters. During such period the Buyer Representative shall have
access to the work papers of the Sellers Representative prepared in
connection with the Notice of Disagreement. If the Sellers Representative and
the Buyer Representative are unable to resolve all Disputed Matters during
such 20-day period, then within ten days following the expiration of such
20-day period, the Sellers Representative and the Buyer Representative shall
submit in writing to the Accounting Firm for review any remaining Disputed
Matters. The Sellers Representative and the Buyer Representative shall jointly
request that the Accounting Firm render its reasoned written decision with
respect to such remaining Disputed Matters for the purpose of calculating the
Adjustment Amount within the 30-day period following submission of such
Disputed Matters to the Accounting Firm (it being understood that in
conducting such review and rendering such decision, the Accounting Firm shall
be functioning as an expert and not as an arbitrator). The determination of
the Disputed Matters by the Accounting Firm will be based on whether such
Disputed Matters have been calculated in accordance with the provisions set
forth in this Agreement. The Accounting Firm will make its determination
solely on presentations and supporting material provided by the Parties and
not pursuant to any independent review. The Accounting Firm's
determination as to any Disputed Matter shall not be more beneficial to the
Buyer Representative than the determination of that item or amount by the
Buyer Representative in the Closing Statement or more beneficial to the
Sellers than the determination of that item or amount in the Notice of
Disagreement. Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Accounting
Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the Party against which such
determination is to be enforced. The cost of any such review and
determination by the Accounting Firm (including the fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm) pursuant to this _Section 2.3(e)_  shall be allocated
between the Buyer, on one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, based upon
the extent to which each Party prevailed, as determined by the Accounting
Firm. The fees (including attorneys' fees) and disbursements of the
Sellers' independent auditors incurred in connection with their review of the
Closing Statement and preparation of any Notice of Disagreement shall be
borne by the Sellers, and the fees (including attorneys' fees) and
disbursements of the Buyer's auditors incurred in connection with their
preparation of the Closing Statement and review of any Notice of Disagreement
shall be borne by the Buyer. The Buyer Representative shall revise the
Closing Statement and the Adjustment Amount to the extent necessary
to reflect the resolution of any Disputed Matters pursuant to the provisions
of this _Section 2.3(e)_.

(f) If the difference between the Adjustment Amount (as finally determined
pursuant to _Section 2.3(e)_ ) and the Adjustment Amount set forth in the
Estimated Closing Statement is greater than zero, then the Company shall, and
the Buyer shall cause the Company to, promptly (but in any event within ten
days after such final determination) deliver to the Sellers
Representative, to be further distributed to the Sellers, an amount equal to
such excess, to be distributed to the Sellers in proportion to the number of
Company Units held by such Sellers as of immediately prior to the Closing, in
each case by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or
accounts designated by the Sellers Representative. If the difference between
the Adjustment Amount (as finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.3(e)_ )
and the Adjustment Amount set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement is
negative, then the Sellers Representative shall promptly (but in any event
within ten days after such final determination) deliver to the Company an
amount equal to the absolute value of such deficiency by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account designated by the Company.

  



  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
that any payment of cash under this Agreement to the Blocker Seller or its
successors or assignees would cause the cumulative amount treated as paid in
cash for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the Blocker Seller pursuant to
this Agreement to exceed 60% of an amount equal to (i) the fair market value
of shares of Buyer Class A Common Stock to be issued to the Blocker Seller
hereunder (determined by using the average of the high and low trading price
on the date that the Blocker Seller became entitled to such payment), plus
(ii) the cumulative amount of cash paid to the Blocker Seller pursuant to
this Agreement (or that would be so paid but for this _Section 2.3(g)_
), then such excess cash amount (the " _Blocker Seller Tax Adjustment Amount_
") shall instead be paid to the Blocker Seller or its successors or assignees
in the form of a number of shares of Buyer Class A Common Stock (the "
_Blocker Seller Tax Adjustment Shares_ ") equal to the first round number
exceeding (A) the Blocker Seller Tax Adjustment Amount divided by (B) the
lesser of (I) the average of the daily VWAP of a share of Buyer Class A Common
Stock for the 10 trading days immediately prior to the date of issuance of
any Blocker Seller Tax Adjustment Shares and (II) the average of the high and
low trading price of the Blocker Seller Tax Adjustment Shares on the date
that the Blocker Seller or its successors or assignees became entitled to
such Blocker Seller Tax Adjustment Shares.

  



  

2.4  _Issuance of Buyer Class B Common Stock_. At the Closing, the Buyer
shall (a) issue to the Continuing Members, one share of Buyer Class B Common
Stock for each Retained Company Unit, free and clear of all Liens (other than
Liens consisting of restrictions on transfer generally arising under
applicable Federal Securities Laws or state securities Law), and (b) make
appropriate book entries (to the accounts designated by the Unit Sellers in
writing prior to Closing) evidencing the issuance to the Unit Sellers of such
shares of Buyer Class B Common Stock.

  



  

2.5  _Pre-Closing Reorganization_ _. _ Prior to the First Blocker Merger,
the Blocker will cause (a) any cash held by the Blocker to be distributed to
the Blocker Seller or used to repay any indebtedness of the Blocker, (b) any
indebtedness of the Blocker to be capitalized or repaid and (c) the equity
interests of the Company held indirectly by the Blocker to be distributed to
the Blocker (such actions in clauses (a), (b) and (c) are referred to as the
" _Pre-Closing Reorganization_ "). Effective prior to the First
Blocker Merger Effective Time, the only asset of the Blocker will be the
Acquired Company Units held by the Blocker, and the Blocker will have no
liabilities other than accrued but unpaid Taxes, if any.

2.6  _Tax Treatment; Purchase Price Allocation_.

  



  

(a) The Parties agree that (i) the sale and purchase of the Acquired Company
Units is intended for all applicable income Tax purposes to be treated as a
taxable sale and purchase of partnership interests (and (ii) the First Blocker
Merger and the Second Blocker Merger, taken together as an integrated
transaction, are intended for all applicable income Tax purposes to qualify as
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and this
Agreement is intended to qualify as, and the Parties hereby adopt
this Agreement as, a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.368-2(g) (clauses (i) and (ii), the " _Intended Tax
Treatment_ ).

  



  

(b) Within 60 days of the final determination of Net Working Capital, the
Buyer Representative shall provide to the Sellers Representative a schedule
allocating the Purchase Price, and all other amounts constituting
consideration for federal income Tax purposes, allocable to the Acquired
Company Units among the assets of the Company (the " _Allocation Schedule_ "),
which such schedule shall be prepared in a manner consistent with Sections
755 and 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.
If the Sellers Representative does not object to such Allocation Schedule
provided by the Buyer Representative within 45 days of receipt of such
Allocation Schedule, then such Allocation Schedule shall be final and binding
on the Parties. If the Sellers Representative objects to such Allocation
Schedule provided by the Buyer Representative within 45 days of receipt of
such Allocation Schedule, then the Parties shall work together in good faith
to resolve all disputed items and agree upon the Allocation Schedule;
_provided_ , that, if the Parties are not able to resolve all disputed items
within 30 days of the Sellers Representative's objection, then the Parties
shall submit all unresolved disputed items to the Accounting Firm for
resolution and the Parties will instruct the Accounting Firm to render a
final determination as soon as reasonably practicable, and the Allocation
Schedule as mutually agreed upon by the Parties or as finally determined by
the Accounting Firm, as applicable, shall be final and binding on the
Parties. The fees, costs and expense of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by
Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, based upon the
percentage which the portion of the contested amount not determined in a
Party's favor bears to the total amount at issue as finally determined by the
Accounting Firm. The Parties shall make appropriate adjustments to the
Allocation Schedule to reflect changes in the Purchase Price.

  



  

(c) The Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
report, act and file all Tax Returns in all respects and for all purposes
consistent with the Intended Tax Treatment and the Allocation Schedule, as
finally determined and as adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)_ , including
for purposes of (i) Treasury Regulation Section 1.743-1(d)(2) in determining
the applicable adjustment to the U.S. federal income Tax basis of the
Company's assets and (ii) Treasury Regulation Section 1.751-1(a)(2) in
determining the character of each Seller's gain or loss, as the case may be,
for U.S. federal income Tax purposes in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. From and after the date hereof, (x) the
Parties shall not take, or knowingly fail to take, any action that could
reasonably be expected to prevent such Intended Tax Treatment and (y) the
Parties shall cooperate to provide each other with Tax representation letters
containing normal and customary representations, warranties and covenants for
purposes of any Tax opinion with respect to the Intended Tax Treatment
described in clause (ii) of _Section 2.6(a)_ to be rendered in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any such Tax
opinion required to be provided in connection with any filings with the SEC.
The Parties agree to notify each other with respect to the initiation of any
Action by any Taxing Authority relating to the Intended Tax Treatment or the
Allocation Schedule, to consult with each other with respect to any such
Action by such Taxing Authority, and to not take any position during the
course of any such Action by such Taxing Authority that is inconsistent with
the Intended Tax Treatment or with the Allocation Schedule, unless required
by a determination within the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code (or any
analogous provision of state, local or non-U.S. Law).

2.7  _Closing_. Unless another date, location or time is mutually agreed
upon by the Buyer and the Company, the closing of the transactions
contemplated hereby (the " _Closing_ ") will take place remotely via the
electronic exchange of documents and executed signature pages on the third
Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth
in _Article VIII_ (other than those conditions which by their terms are
required to be satisfied or waived at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), or on such other date or at such
other time and place as the Buyer and the Company agree in writing (the date
upon which the Closing occurs is referred to as the " _Closing Date_ "). All
proceedings to be taken and all documents to be executed and delivered by all
parties at the Closing will be deemed to have been taken and executed
simultaneously and no proceedings will be deemed to have been taken nor
documents executed or delivered until all have been taken, executed and
delivered.

  



  

2.8  _Withholding_. The Buyer and the Company will be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amount payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
the Buyer or the Company (or any Affiliate thereof) shall determine in good
faith it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code or any other provision of applicable Law; _provided_ ,
that in the event that the Buyer or the Company determines that any such
deduction or withholding is required, other than with respect to payments to
any current or former employee or service provider in the nature of
compensation that are processed and paid through payroll, the Buyer will
notify the Sellers Representative in writing as soon as practicable (and, in
no event less, than 10 days prior to the expected date of payment), setting
forth in reasonable detail the basis for such deduction or withholding, and
the Buyer and the Company will cooperate with the Sellers Representative to
eliminate or reduce such deduction or withholding and consider in good faith
any Tax forms or other information or document submitted by the Sellers
Representative. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Buyer or the
Company (or any Affiliate thereof), the Buyer or the Company (or applicable
Affiliate) shall pay over such amount to the applicable Governmental
Authority (together with any applicable Tax Returns) and such amounts so
withheld and paid over will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding were made.

reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and (b)
the availability of equitable remedies (regardless of whether enforceability
is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity) (the immediately preceding
clauses (a) and (b) are collectively referred to as the " _General
Enforceability Exceptions_ ").

  



  

3.2  _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

  



  

(a) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Seller, nor

Except as set forth or incorporated by reference in the Buyer SEC Reports

looking statements contained therein) or set forth in the Disclosure Letter,
the Buyer and the Blocker Merger Sub jointly and severally represent and
warrant to the Sellers on the Effective Date and as of the Closing Date
(except for representations and warranties that are made as of a specific
date, which are made only as of such date) as follows:

   



  

6.1  _Investor Representations_. The Acquired Company Units and Blocker
Interests are being acquired solely for investment for the Buyer's own
account, not as a nominee or agent and not with a view to the resale or
distribution of any part thereof, and the Buyer has no present intention of
selling, granting a participation in, or otherwise distributing the same. The
Buyer understands that neither the Acquired Company Units nor the Blocker
Interests have been registered under the Securities Act by reason of a
specific exemption from the registration provisions of the Securities Act
that depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of the investment
intent and the accuracy of the Buyer's representations as expressed herein.
The Buyer understands that the Acquired Company Units are
"restricted securities" under applicable U.S. federal and state securities
Laws and that, pursuant to these laws, the Buyer must hold the Acquired
Company Units indefinitely unless they are registered with the Securities and
Exchange Commission and qualified by state authorities, or an exemption from
such registration and qualification requirements is available. The Buyer
understands that no public market now exists for the Acquired Company Units
and neither the Blocker nor the Company has not made any assurances that a
public market will ever exist for the Acquired Company Units. The Buyer is an
"accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated
under the Securities Act.

  



  

6.2  _Existence and Good Standing_. As of the Effective Date, the Buyer is a
Cayman Islands exempted company duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the Cayman Islands. The Buyer is duly qualified to
do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction in which the
character of the properties owned or leased by it or in which the conduct of
its business requires it to be so qualified. At the Closing, the Buyer will
be a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the Laws of the State of Delaware. The Blocker Merger Sub is a limited
liability company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the Laws of the State of Delaware.

  



  

6.3  _Validity and Enforceability_. Other than the adoption of this
Agreement by the Buyer as the sole member of the Blocker Merger Sub in
connection with the First Blocker Merger (which will be effected promptly
following execution of this Agreement), each of the Buyer and the Blocker
Merger Sub has the requisite power and authority to execute, deliver and
perform this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which such Party is or
will become a party and to consummate the Transactions and (b) the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which the
Buyer and the Blocker Merger Sub is or will become a party and the
consummation of the Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary action on the part of such Party. This Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements to which the Buyer or the Blocker Merger Sub is or will become a
party have been duly executed and delivered by such Party and, assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Sellers and the Blocker,
represent the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Party, enforceable
against such Party in accordance with their respective terms, except as
limited by the General Enforceability Exceptions.

  



  

6.4  _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

  



  

(a) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements to which it is or will become a party by the Buyer or the Blocker
Merger Sub, nor the consummation by the Buyer or the Blocker Merger Sub of the
Transactions, nor compliance by the Buyer or the Blocker Merger Sub with any
of the provisions hereof, will (i) conflict with or result in a breach of
any provisions of the Buyer Governing Documents or the governing documents of
the Blocker Merger Sub, (ii) conflict with, constitute or result in a
material breach (with or without the lapse of time, the giving of notice or
both) of any term, condition or provision of, or constitute a material
default (with or without the lapse of time, the giving of notice or both)
under, or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration
with respect to, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any
property or assets of the Buyer, the Surviving Company, the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries, pursuant to any Contract to which Buyer or the Blocker
Merger Sub is a party or by which it or any of its properties or assets may be
subject, or (iii) subject to receipt of the requisite approvals referred to

ARTICLE X 
  _Tax Matters_

  



  

10.1  _Tax Indemnity_. Upon prior written demand, setting forth in
reasonable detail the basis for the claim and containing reasonable
substantiation of the amount of Buyer Tax Losses for which indemnification is

hold harmless and promptly pay the Buyer for any Indemnified Blocker Taxes
and (c) the Sellers shall severally (but not jointly and severally)
indemnity, hold harmless and promptly pay the Buyer for any Indemnified
Company Taxes, in each case, to the extent such Taxes are paid by the Buyer,
the Company or any Company Subsidiary after the Closing and including
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of contesting any audit or other
Tax Matter that could result in the imposition of an Indemnified Tax
(such costs and expense, together with Indemnified Taxes, shall be
collectively, " _Buyer Tax Losses_ "); provided, however, that, in no event
will any Seller be required to pay an aggregate amount pursuant to this
_Section 10.1_ in excess of the cash proceeds actually received by such Seller
(in the case of Unit Sellers, in exchange for Acquired Company Units and, in
the case of the Blocker Seller, in exchange for the Blocker Interests) under
this Agreement.

  



  

10.2  _Tax Returns_. The Sellers Representative shall cause to be prepared
(a) all required income Tax Returns of the Blocker for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period (the " _Blocker Income Returns_ ") and (b) all required income Tax
Returns of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period (the " _Company Income Returns_ ," and together with the Blocker Income
Returns, the " _Seller Income Returns_ "). The Seller Income Returns will be
prepared in a manner consistent with past practices of the Blocker, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, unless otherwise required
by applicable Law or change in facts. At least 30 days prior to the due date
of any Seller Income Return, or such shorter period as required to timely file
any Seller Income Return, the Sellers Representative shall provide to the
Buyer for review and comment drafts of all such Seller Income
Returns required to be filed by the Blocker, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, as applicable, after the Closing Date. The
Sellers Representative shall make any change reasonably requested by the
Buyer to such draft Seller Income Returns that are received in writing not
less than 5 days prior to the due date for such Tax Return. The Buyer shall
cause the Blocker, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable,
to timely file such Seller Income Returns as revised to reflect the Buyer's
reasonable comments. The Sellers Representative, on behalf of the Sellers,
will pay or cause to be paid (at the time of filing) all income Taxes shown
as due and owing on such originally filed Seller Income Tax Returns. The
Sellers and the Buyer agree that with respect to any Straddle Period, (a) the
Buyer shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, to
utilize the "interim closing method" (and the "calendar day convention")
pursuant to Section 706 of the Code (and any similar provision of state,
local or foreign law) to account for any varying interests in the Company for
such taxable year, (b) the Buyer shall cause any such income Tax Returns with
respect to such taxable year to be prepared in a manner consistent with past
practices of the Blocker, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as
applicable, unless otherwise required by applicable Law or change in facts,
and (c) at least 30 days prior to the due date of any such income Tax Returns,
or such shorter period as required to timely file such income Tax Returns,
the Buyer shall provide to the Sellers Representative for review and comment
drafts of all such income Tax Returns required to be filed by the Blocker,
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, after the Closing
Date, and the Buyer shall make any change reasonably requested by the Sellers
Representative to such income Tax Returns that are received in writing not
less than 5 days prior to the due date for such Tax Return. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this _Section 10.2_ , the Sellers, at their sole cost
and expense, shall be solely responsible for filing and all of the Tax
Returns required to be filed by any Seller and paying all of the Taxes due and
owing by any Seller (including to the extent attributable to income of the

 | 76 | 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

10.3  _Apportionment of Taxes_. For purposes of determining whether the
following Taxes are attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (or the portion
of any Straddle Period ending on or prior to the Closing Date), the parties
agree as follows:

  



  

(a) In the case of property Taxes and other similar Taxes imposed on a
periodic basis for a Straddle Period, the amounts that are attributable to the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined
by multiplying the Taxes for the entire Straddle Period by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the
period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period.

  



  

(b) In the case of Taxes in the form of interest or penalties, all such
Taxes shall be treated as attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (or the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date) to the extent
relating to a Tax for a Pre-Closing Tax Period (or portion of a Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date) whether such items are incurred, accrued,
assessed or similarly charged on, before or after the Closing Date.

  



  

(c) In the case of Taxes imposed on the Blocker, the Company, any Company
Subsidiaries, or the Buyer (or its Subsidiaries or any of its Affiliates) as a
result of income of any Flow-Thru Entity (including the Company or any
Company Subsidiaries) realized prior to the Closing Date (such income being
computed assuming the Flow-Thru Entity had a year that ends on the Closing
Date and closed its books), such Taxes shall be treated as Taxes of the
Blocker, Company or Company Subsidiary for a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

  



  

(d) In the case of all other Taxes for a Straddle Period (including income
Taxes, employment Taxes, and sales and use Taxes) the amount attributable to
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be
determined as if the Company or Subsidiary filed a separate Tax Return with
respect to such Taxes for the portion of the Straddle Period ending as of the
end of the day on the Closing Date using a "closing of the books methodology"
For purposes of this clause (c), any item determined on an annual or periodic
basis (including amortization and depreciation deductions and the effects of
graduated rates) shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date based on the mechanics set forth in clause (a) for
periodic Taxes.

  



  

10.4  _Cooperation; Audits; Ordinary Course_.

  



  

(a) In connection with the preparation of Tax Returns, audit examinations and
any administrative or judicial proceedings relating to the Tax liabilities
imposed on the Blocker, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, as
applicable, for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods and Straddle Periods, the Buyer,
on the one hand, and the Sellers Representative, on the other hand, shall
cooperate on a reasonable basis with each other, including the furnishing or
making available during normal business hours of records, personnel (as
reasonably required), books of account, powers of attorney or other materials
necessary or helpful for the preparation of such Tax Returns, the conduct of
audit examinations or the defense of claims by Taxing Authorities as to the
imposition of Taxes. The Buyer shall and shall cause the Blocker, the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries to (i) retain all books and records with respect
to Tax matters pertinent to the Blocker, the Company, and the Company
Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (and, to the
extent notified by the Sellers Representative, any extension thereof) for the
respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any Taxing Authority, and (ii) give the Sellers
Representative reasonable notice prior to transferring, destroying
or discarding any such books and records and shall allow the Sellers
Representative to take possession of such books and records.

  



  

   

 | 77 | 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) The Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall, upon the other's request,
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
(including with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

  



  

10.5  _Controversies_ _._

  



  

(a) This _Section 10.5_ will control any Tax Matters. The Buyer shall
promptly notify the Sellers Representative upon receipt by the Buyer, the
Blocker, the Company or any of their Affiliates of any notice of any Tax
Matter from any Taxing Authority for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle
Period (a " _Pre-Closing Tax Matter_ "). The Sellers Representative may, at
the Sellers' expense, and upon notice to the Buyer, assume the defense of any
Pre-Closing Tax Matter that relates solely to income Taxes for a Pre-Closing
Tax Period (a " _Sellers Tax Matter_ "). If the Sellers
Representative assumes the defense of a Sellers Tax Matter, then the Sellers
Representative will have the authority to represent the interests of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries before the relevant Taxing Authority and
the Sellers Representative will have the right to control the defense,
including responding to inquiries and contesting, defending against and
resolving any assessment for additional Taxes or notice of Tax deficiency or
other adjustment of Taxes of, or relating to, such Sellers Tax Matter;
_provided_ , that (i) the Sellers Representative may not enter into any
settlement or otherwise compromise any such Sellers Tax Matter without the
prior written consent of the Buyer (such consent not to be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld or delayed), (ii) the Buyer will have the right (but
not the duty) to participate in the defense of such Sellers Tax Matter and to
employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from counsel employed by the
Sellers Representative, and (iii) the Sellers Representative shall keep
the Buyer informed with respect to the commencement, status and nature of any
such Sellers Tax Matter and will (in good faith) allow the Buyer to consult
with it regarding the conduct of or positions taken in any such proceeding.

  



  

(b) With respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Matter that is not a Sellers Tax
Matter (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if the Sellers Representative
does not assume the defense of such Pre-Closing Tax Matter pursuant to
_Section 10.5(a)_ ), then the Buyer will have the authority, with respect to
any such Pre-Closing Tax Matter, to represent the interests of the Blocker,
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries before the relevant Taxing
Authority and the Buyer will have the right to control the defense, including
responding to inquiries and contesting, defending against and resolving any
assessment for additional Taxes or notice of Tax deficiency or other
adjustment of Taxes of, or relating to, such Pre-Closing Tax Matter;
_provided_ , that (i) the Buyer may not enter into any settlement or otherwise
compromise any such Pre-Closing Tax Matter to the extent it adversely affects
the Tax liability of any of the Sellers without the prior written consent of
the Sellers Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably conditioned,
withheld or delayed), (ii) the Sellers Representative will have the right
(but not the duty) to participate in the defense of such Pre-Closing Tax
Matter and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from counsel
employed by the Buyer, and (iii) the Buyer shall keep the Sellers
Representative informed with respect to the commencement, status and nature
of any such Pre-Closing Tax Matter and will (in good faith) allow the Sellers
Representative to consult with it regarding the conduct of or positions taken
in any such proceeding.

any of their respective Affiliates amend, refile, revoke or otherwise modify
any Tax Return or Tax election of any of the Blocker, the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period without the
prior written consent of the Sellers Representative (such consent not to be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed), if such action could
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Tax liability of any of the
Sellers or result in an Indemnified Tax.

  



  

(b) None of the Buyer, the Blocker, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or
any of their respective Affiliates shall (i) initiate any voluntary contact
with any Taxing Authority relating to Taxes of the Blocker, the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, without the
prior written consent of the Sellers Representative (such consent not to
be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed), except that this clause
(i) shall not restrict the Blocker, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
from filing any Tax Return for a tax period ending after the Closing Date, or
(ii) permit the Blocker, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Affiliates to take any action (including making any Tax
election) on or after the Closing that is effective for Tax purposes on or
before the Closing Date and that is outside the Ordinary Course of Business.

  



  

(c) The Parties agree that, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, the Blocker
will become a member of a U.S. federal income Tax consolidated group that
includes the Buyer as of the end of the Closing Date pursuant to Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-76, and the Blocker's U.S. federal income taxable
year shall close on such date. The Parties agree that the books of the Company
will be closed on the Closing Date, and the Blocker will be allocated all
taxable income or loss through the Closing Date as prescribed in Section
706(c)(2)(A) of the Code. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable
Law, any tax deductible amounts related to the Company Transaction Expenses
and the Phantom Payments allocable to the Blocker will be included in and
allocated to the Unit Sellers and the Blocker.

  



  

10.7  _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") will be borne equally by the
Sellers, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand, including by way
of inclusion of Transfer Taxes in Buyer Transaction Expenses and Company
Transaction Expenses, and all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation
with respect to Transfer Taxes will be prepared and filed by the party
required to file such Tax Returns under applicable Law.

  



  

10.8  _Tax Distributions_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, no Seller shall retain any right to any distribution for Taxes
pursuant to the terms of the Company's operating agreement as in effect prior
to the adoption of the Company's AandR Regulations in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

10.9  _Survival; Limitations_. The obligation of the Sellers to pay any

11.12  _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction_. This Agreement is to be
governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the internal laws
of the State of Delaware, without regard to its rules of conflict of laws.
Each of the Parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Delaware Court of Chancery in New Castle County, or in the event (but only in
the event) that such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over
such action, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. A
final judgment in any such Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
Law. To the extent that service of process by mail is permitted by applicable
Law, each Party irrevocably consents to the service of process in any such
Action in such courts by the mailing of such process by registered or
certified mail, postage prepaid, at its address for notices provided for in
this Agreement. Each Party irrevocably agrees not to assert (a) any objection
which it may ever have to the laying of venue of any such Action in the
Delaware Court of Chancery in New Castle County, or in the event (but only in
the event) that such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over
such action, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware
and (b) any claim that any such Action brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum.

  



  

11.13  _Waiver of Jury Trial_. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE
LAW WHICH CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES, AND AGREES TO
CAUSE EACH OF HIS, HER OR ITS AFFILIATES TO WAIVE, AND COVENANTS THAT NEITHER
IT NOR ANY OF HIS, HER OR ITS AFFILIATES WILL ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF,
DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE) ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY FORUM IN RESPECT OF
ANY ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER
HEREOF, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING. EACH PARTY
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INFORMED BY THE OTHER PARTIES THAT THIS
_SECTION 11.13_ CONSTITUTES A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT UPON WHICH THE PARTIES
ARE RELYING AND WILL RELY IN ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OTHER
AGREEMENTS RELATING HERETO OR CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. ANY PARTY MAY FILE AN
ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS _SECTION 11.13_ WITH ANY COURT AS
WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES TO THE WAIVER OF THE RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY.

  



  

11.14  _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is found
to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining
terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or
enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any
other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be so
broad as to be unenforceable, the provision will be interpreted to be only
so broad as is enforceable.

  



  

11.15  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original but all of which will
constitute but one instrument. This Agreement is effective upon delivery of
one executed counterpart from each Party to the other Parties. The signatures
of all of the Parties need not appear on the same counterpart. The delivery
of signed counterparts by email which includes a copy of the sending
party's signature(s) (including by ".pdf" format) is as effective as signing
and delivering the counterpart in person.

  



  

11.16  _Enforcement of Agreement_. Each Party's obligation under this
Agreement is unique. The Parties acknowledge that money damages would not be
an adequate remedy at law if any Party fails to perform in any material
respect any of its obligations hereunder and accordingly agree that each
Party, in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled under this
Agreement, at law or in equity, shall be entitled to seek an injunction or
similar equitable relief restraining such Party from committing or continuing
any such breach or threatened breach or to seek to compel specific
performance of the obligations of any other Party under this Agreement,
without the posting of any bond, in accordance with the terms and conditions
of this Agreement in any court of the United States or any State thereof
having jurisdiction, and if any action should be brought in equity to enforce
any of the provisions of this Agreement, none of the Parties shall raise the
defense that there is an adequate remedy at law. No remedy shall be exclusive
of any other remedy, and all available remedies shall be cumulative.

11.17  _Release_.

  



  

(a) Each of the Buyer and the Blocker Merger Sub agrees that, effective as of
the Closing, the Blocker, Company and the Company Subsidiaries will be deemed
to have released and discharged the Sellers Parties (whether in such person's
capacity as a Seller, securityholder, director, officer, employee or
otherwise) from any and all Actions, whether known or unknown, liquidated or
contingent, to the extent based upon or arising out of the dealings among any
of the Sellers Parties, on the one hand, and the Blocker, the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries, on the other hand, on or prior to the Closing
(collectively, the " _Buyer Released Claims_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ ,
the Buyer Released Claims shall not include any liabilities arising out of or
under this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements. Each of the Buyer and the
Blocker Merger Sub acknowledges that the Laws of many states provide
substantially the following: "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS
WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME
OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED
HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR." Each of the Buyer and the Blocker Merger Sub
acknowledges that such provisions are designed to protect a party from waiving
claims that it does not know exist or may exist. Nonetheless, Each of the
Buyer and the Blocker Merger Sub agrees that, effective as of the Closing,
the Blocker, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries will be deemed to waive
any such provision (subject to the limitations herein). Each of the Buyer and
the Blocker Merger Sub further agrees that it will not, directly or
indirectly, cause the Blocker, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to (i)
institute an Action to the extent based upon, arising out of, or relating to
any of the Buyer Released Claims, or (ii) participate, assist, or cooperate in
any such Action except as otherwise required by applicable Law.

  



  

(b) The Sellers agree that, effective as of the Closing, the Sellers will be
deemed to have released and discharged, on behalf of itself and its
equityholders and their Affiliates (other than the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (and the Blocker in the case of the Blocker Seller)), the Buyer
Parties (whether in such person's capacity as a securityholder, director,
officer, employee or otherwise) from any and all Actions, whether known or
unknown, liquidated or contingent, to the extent based upon or arising out of
the dealings among any of the Buyer Parties, on the one hand, and the Sellers,
on the other hand, on or prior to the Closing (collectively, the " _Sellers
Released Claims_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , the Seller Released Claims
shall not include any liabilities arising out of or under this Agreement or
the Ancillary Agreements, any rights to indemnification under any
Organizational Documents of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any other
Contract (including the Company AandR Regulations), or any rights to accrued
and unpaid salary or compensation earned by such the Sellers or
their respective Affiliates or employee benefits due to the Sellers or their
respective Affiliates. The Sellers acknowledge that the Laws of many states
provide substantially the following: "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO
CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT
THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE
MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR." The Sellers acknowledge
that such provisions are designed to protect a party from waiving claims that
it does not know exist or may exist. Nonetheless, the Sellers agree that,
effective as of the Closing, the Sellers will be deemed to waive any such
provision (subject to the limitations herein). The Sellers further agree that
it will not, directly or indirectly, cause any of its equityholders or
Affiliates to (i) institute an Action to the extent based upon, arising out
of, or relating to any of the Sellers Released Claims, or (ii) participate,
assist, or cooperate in any such Action except as otherwise required by
applicable Law.

11.18  _Non-Recourse_. Except in the case of intentional fraud, all Actions
that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be
connected with, or relate in any manner to: (a) this Agreement, (b) the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement
to, this Agreement), (c) any breach of this Agreement and (d) any failure of
the Transactions to be consummated, may be made only against (and, without
prejudice to the rights of any express third party beneficiary to whom rights
under this Agreement inure pursuant to _Section 11.5_ ), are those solely of
the Persons that are expressly identified as parties to this Agreement Except
in the case of intentional fraud, no other Person, including any director,
officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder,
optionholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or Representative of, or any
financial advisor or lender to, any Party, or any director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder, Affiliate, agent,
attorney or representative of, or any financial advisor or lender to any of
the foregoing, shall have any liabilities (whether in contract or in tort, in
law or in equity, or granted by statute whether by or through attempted
piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company
veil) for any claims, causes of action, obligations or liabilities arising
under, out of, in connection with or related in any manner to the items in the
immediately preceding clauses (a) through (d) and each Party, on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates, hereby irrevocably releases and forever discharges
each of such Persons from any such liability or obligation.

  



  

11.19  _Construction_. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, then this Agreement will be construed as
drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof will
arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of
the provisions of this Agreement. Unless otherwise indicated to the contrary
herein by the context or use thereof: (a) any reference or citation in this
Agreement to any Contract or any federal, state, local or foreign statutes,
regulations or other Laws or statutory or regulatory provision shall, when the
context requires, be deemed references or citations to such Contracts,
statutes, regulations, other Laws or provisions, as amended, modified and
supplemented from time to time (and, in the case of a statute, regulation or
other Law, to (i) any successor provision and (ii) all rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder); (b) all references to the preamble, recitals,
Sections, Articles, Exhibits or Disclosure Letter are to the preamble,
recitals, Sections, Articles, Exhibits or Disclosure Letter of or to this
Agreement; (c) the words "herein", "hereto", "hereof", "hereunder" and words
of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular section or paragraph hereof; (d) masculine gender will also
include the feminine and neutral genders and vice versa; (e) words importing
the singular will also include the plural, and vice versa; (f) the words
"include", "including" and "or" mean without limitation by reason of
enumeration; (g) all references to "$" or dollar amounts are to lawful
currency of the United States of America; (h) the terms "delivered" or "made
available" or similar phrases when used in this Agreement will mean that such
documents or other information has been physically or electronically delivered
to the relevant parties, including via a virtual data room; and (i) time
periods within or following which any payment is to be made or any act is to
be done will be calculated by excluding the day on which the time period
commences and including the day on which the time period ends and
by extending the period to the next Business Day following if the last day of
the time period is not a Business Day.

11.20  _Disclosure Letter_. For the purposes of the Disclosure Letter, any
information, item or other disclosure set forth in any section of the
Disclosure Letter will be deemed to have been included in any other sections
of the Disclosure Letter as though fully set forth in such section of the
Disclosure Letter to the extent the relevance of such matter to such section
is reasonably apparent on its face (without inquiry or
investigation). Inclusion of information in any part of the Disclosure Letter
will not be construed as an admission that such information is material to
the business, properties, financial condition or results of operations of the
Blocker, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or the Buyer, as applicable.
Matters reflected in the Disclosure Letter are not necessarily limited to
matters required by this Agreement to be reflected therein and the inclusion
of such matters shall not be deemed an admission that such matters were
required to be reflected in the Disclosure Letter.

  



  

11.21  _Conflict of Interest_. If the Sellers so desire, and without the
need for any consent or waiver by the Blocker, the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries, the Buyer or the Blocker Merger Sub, Jones Day is permitted to
represent the Sellers and/or the Sellers Representative after the Closing in
connection with any matter, including anything related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any disagreement or dispute relating
thereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, after the Closing,
Jones Day is permitted to represent the Sellers, the Sellers Representative
and their respective agents and Affiliates, or any one or more of them, in
connection with any negotiation, transaction or dispute ("dispute" includes
litigation, arbitration or other adversary proceeding) with the Buyer, the
Blocker Merger Sub, the Blocker, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any
of their respective agents or Affiliates under or relating to this Agreement,
any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and any related matter, such
as any claim. Upon and after the Closing, the Blocker, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries will cease to have any attorney-client relationship with
Jones Day, unless and to the extent Jones Day is specifically engaged in
writing by the Blocker, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to represent
the Blocker, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries after the Closing and
either (a) such engagement involves no conflict of interest with respect to
the Sellers or the Sellers Representative or (b) the Sellers or the Sellers
Representative (as applicable) consent in writing at the time to such
engagement. Any such representation of the Blocker, the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries by Jones Day after the Closing in accordance herewith
will not affect the foregoing provisions hereof. For example, and not by way
of limitation, even if Jones Day is representing the Blocker, the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries after the Closing, Jones Day is permitted
simultaneously to represent the Sellers and/or the Sellers Representative in
any matter, including any disagreement or dispute relating hereto.
Furthermore, Jones Day is permitted to withdraw from any representation of
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries in order to be able to represent or
continue so representing the Sellers or the Sellers Representative, even if
such withdrawal causes the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or Buyer
additional legal expense (such as to bring new counsel "up to speed"), delay
or other prejudice

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

11.22  _Privileged Communications_. Each of the Buyer and the Blocker Merger
Sub agrees that, as to all communications between and among all counsel
(including Jones Day) for the Sellers, the Blocker, the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Sellers
Representative, the Sellers, the Blocker, the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, that
relate in any way to the transactions contemplated by or in connection with
this Agreement (collectively, the " _Privileged Communications_ "), the
attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client confidence with
respect to the Privileged Communications belongs to the Sellers and may be
controlled by the Sellers and will not pass to or be claimed by the Buyer,
the Blocker Merger Sub or any of its respective subsidiaries (including,
following the Closing, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries). The
Privileged Communications are the property of the Sellers and, from and after
the Closing, none of the Buyer, its Subsidiaries (including, following the
Closing, the Blocker, Company and the Company Subsidiaries) or any Person
purporting to act on behalf of or through the Buyer or such Subsidiaries will
seek to obtain the Privileged Communications, whether by seeking a waiver
of the attorney-client privilege or through other means. The Buyer, and its
respective Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing, the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries), together with any of their respective Affiliates,
successors or assigns, further agree that no such party may use or rely on
any of the Privileged Communications in any action against or involving any of
the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates after the Closing. The
Privileged Communications may be used by the Sellers or any of
their respective Affiliates in connection with any dispute that relates to
the transactions contemplated by or in connection with this Agreement,
including in any claim brought by the Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event that a dispute arises between the Buyer or any of its respective
Subsidiaries and a third party (other than a party to this Agreement or any of
its Affiliates) after the Closing, the Buyer and its Subsidiaries may assert
the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of
confidential communications by counsel to such third party; _provided_ , that
neither the Buyer nor its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing, the
Blocker, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) may waive such privilege
without the prior written consent of the Sellers Representative.

  



  

11.23  _Trust Account Waiver_. The Sellers, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries acknowledge that the Buyer established the Trust Account for the
benefit of its public shareholders. The Sellers, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries acknowledge that, prior to the Closing, it does not have any
right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Trust
Account, including, without limitation, any claim for indemnification and
hereby waives any claim for monies in the Trust Account it may have in the
future as a result of, or arising out of, this Agreement and the
Transactions, and, the Sellers, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries prior
to the Closing, will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any
reason whatsoever.

Article I. 
 NAME

  



  

The name of the corporation is Sentinel Energy Services Inc. (the "
_Corporation_ ").

  



  

Article II. 
 PURPOSE

  



  

The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for
which corporations may be organized under the Delaware General Corporation
Law (the " _DGCL_ "). In addition to the powers and privileges conferred upon
the Corporation by law and those incidental thereto, the Corporation shall
possess and may exercise all the powers and privileges that are necessary or
convenient to the conduct, promotion or attainment of the business or purposes
of the Corporation, including, but not limited to, effecting a merger,
capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or
similar business combination, involving the Corporation and one or more
businesses (a " _Business Combination_ ").

  



  

Article III.

The address of the Corporation's registered office in the State of Delaware
is 2711 Centerville Road, Suite 400, in the City of Wilmington, County of New
Castle, State of Delaware, 19808, and the name of the Corporation's registered
agent at such address is Corporation Service Company.

  



  

Article IV. 
 CAPITALIZATION

  



  

Section 4.1. _Authorized Capital Stock_. The total number of shares of all
classes of capital stock, each with a par value of $0.0001 per share,
which the Corporation is authorized to issue is [●]1 shares, consisting of
(a) 220,000,000 shares of common stock (the " _Common Stock_ "), including (i)
200,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock (the " _Class A Common Stock_ "),
(ii) 20,000,000 shares of Class B Common Stock (the " _Class B Common Stock_
"), and (b) 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock (the " _Preferred Stock_ ").
Prior to the filing of this Certificate of Incorporation (this " _Certificate_
"), the Corporation was a Cayman Islands exempted company (at such time, the
" _Predecessor Corporation_ "), which had authorized share capital consisting
of (i) 200,000,000 Class A Ordinary Shares, par value $0.0001 per share (the "
_Predecessor Class A Ordinary Shares_ "), (ii) 20,000,000 Class B Ordinary
Shares, par value $0.0001 per share (the " _Predecessor Class B Ordinary
Shares_ "), and 1,000,000 Preferred Shares, par value $0.0001 per share.
Immediately upon the acceptance of this Certificate for filing by the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, each Predecessor Class A Ordinary
Share automatically, without any further action, converted into an equal
number of shares of Class A Common Stock and each Predecessor Class B
Ordinary Share automatically, without any further action, converted into an
equal number of shares of Class B Common Stock.

  



  



  



  

  



   | 1| NTD: Number of authorized shares of each class (other than Class
B) to be determined.

Section 4.2. _Preferred Stock_. The Board of Directors of the Corporation
(the " _Board_ ") is hereby expressly authorized to provide out of the
unissued shares of the Preferred Stock for one or more series of Preferred
Stock and to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included
in each such series and to fix the voting rights, if any, designations,
powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional, special and other
rights, if any, of each such series and any qualifications, limitations and
restrictions thereof, as shall be stated in the resolution or resolutions
adopted by the Board providing for the issuance of such series and included
in a certificate of designation (a " _Preferred Stock Designation_ ") filed
pursuant to the DGCL, and the Board is hereby expressly vested with the
authority to the full extent provided by law, now or hereafter, to adopt any
such resolution or resolutions.

  



  

Section 4.3. _No Class Vote on Changes in Authorized Number of Shares of
Preferred Stock_. Subject to the special rights of the holders of any series
of Preferred Stock pursuant to the terms of this Certificate, any Preferred
Stock Designation or any resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance
of such series of stock adopted by the Board, the number of authorized shares
of Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of
shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting
together as a single class, irrespective of the provisions of Section
242(b)(2) of the DGCL.

  



  

Section 4.4. _Common Stock_.

  



  

(a) _Voting_.

  



  

(i) Except as otherwise required by law or this Certificate (including any
Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of the Common Stock
shall exclusively possess all voting power with respect to the Corporation.

  



  

(ii) Except as otherwise required by law or this Certificate (including any
Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of shares of Common Stock shall be
entitled to one vote for each such share on each matter properly submitted to
the stockholders on which the holders of the Common Stock are entitled to
vote.

  



   

 | -2-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iii) Except as otherwise required by law or this Certificate (including any
Preferred Stock Designation), at any annual or special meeting of the
stockholders of the Corporation, holders of the Class A Common Stock and
holders of the Class B Common Stock, voting together as a single class, shall
have the exclusive right to vote for the election of directors and on all
other matters properly submitted to a vote of the stockholders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise required by law or this
Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), holders of shares of
any series of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to
this Certificate (including any amendment to any Preferred Stock Designation)
that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of
Preferred Stock or other series of Common Stock if the holders of such
affected series of Preferred Stock or Common Stock, as applicable, are
entitled exclusively, either separately or together with the holders of one or
more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Certificate
(including any Preferred Stock Designation) or the DGCL.

  



  

(b) _Class B Common Stock_.

  



  

(i) Shares of Class B Common Stock shall be convertible into shares of Class
A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis (the " _Initial Conversion Ratio_ ")
automatically at the time of the closing of an initial Business Combination.

  



  

(ii) Notwithstanding the Initial Conversion Ratio, in the case that
additional shares of Class A Common Stock or equity-linked securities are
issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts sold in the Corporation's
initial public offering of securities (the " _Offering_ ") and related to the
closing of the initial Business Combination, all issued and outstanding shares
of Class B Common Stock shall automatically convert into shares of Class A
Common Stock at the time of the closing of the initial Business Combination at
a ratio for which:

  



  

(1) the numerator shall be equal to the sum of (A) 25% of all shares of Class
A Common Stock issued or issuable (upon the conversion or exercise of any
equity-linked securities or otherwise) by the Corporation, related to or in
connection with the consummation of the initial Business Combination
(excluding Co-Investment Securities and any securities issued or issuable to
any seller in the initial Business Combination) plus (B) the number of shares
of Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the closing of the
initial Business Combination; and

  



  

(2) the denominator shall be the number of shares of Class B Common Stock
issued and outstanding prior to the closing of the initial
Business Combination.

  



  

As used herein, the term Co-Investment Securities means the shares of Class A
Common Stock and warrants to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock that may
be issued pursuant to that certain Option Agreement, dated as of November 2,
2017, by and between the Corporation, CSL Energy Opportunities Fund III, L.P.
and CSL Energy Holdings III, Corp, LLC, as the same may be amended.

  



  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) the foregoing
adjustment to the Initial Conversion Ratio may be waived as to any particular
issuance or deemed issuance of additional shares of Class A Common Stock or
equity linked securities by the written consent or agreement of holders of a
majority of the shares of Class B Common Stock then outstanding consenting or
agreeing separately as a single class in the manner provided in _Section
4.4(b)(iii)_ , and (ii) in no event shall the Class B Common Stock convert
into Class A Common Stock at a ratio that is less than one-for-one.

  



   

 | -3-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

The foregoing conversion ratio shall also be adjusted to account for any
subdivision (by stock split, subdivision, exchange, stock dividend,
reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) or combination (by reverse
stock split, exchange, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) or
similar reclassification or recapitalization of the outstanding shares of
Class A Common Stock into a greater or lesser number of shares occurring
after the original filing of this Certificate without a proportionate and
corresponding subdivision, combination or similar reclassification or
recapitalization of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock.

  



  

Each share of Class B Common Stock shall convert into its _pro rata_ number
of shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to this _Section 4.4(b)_. The
_pro rata_ share for each holder of Class B Common Stock will be determined
as follows: each share of Class B Common Stock shall convert into such number
of shares of Class A Common Stock as is equal to the product of one multiplied
by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of
Class A Common Stock into which all of the issued and outstanding shares of
Class B Common Stock shall be converted pursuant to this _Section 4.4(b)_ and
the denominator of which shall be the total number of issued and outstanding
shares of Class B Common Stock at the time of conversion.

  



  

(iii) _Voting._  Except as otherwise required by law or this Certificate
(including any Preferred Stock Designation), for so long as any shares of
Class B Common Stock shall remain outstanding, the Corporation shall not,
without the prior vote or written consent of the holders of a majority of the
shares of Class B Common Stock then outstanding, voting separately as a single
class, amend, alter or repeal any provision of this Certificate, whether by
merger, consolidation or otherwise, if such amendment, alteration or repeal
would alter or change the powers, preferences or relative, participating,
optional or other special rights of the Class B Common Stock. Any action
required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the holders of Class B
Common Stock may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without
a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so
taken, shall be signed by the holders of the outstanding Class B Common Stock
having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to
authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares of Class B
Common Stock were present and voted and shall be delivered to the Corporation
by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal
place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody
of the book in which minutes of proceedings of stockholders are recorded.
Delivery made to the Corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by
certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. Prompt written notice
of the taking of corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous
written consent of the holders of Class B Common Stock shall, to the extent
required by law, be given to those holders of Class B Common Stock who have
not consented in writing and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting,
would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date for
notice of such meeting had been the date that written consents signed by a
sufficient number of holders of Class B Common Stock to take the action were
delivered to the Corporation.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 4.5. _Rights and Options_. The Corporation has the authority to
create and issue rights, warrants and options entitling the holders
thereof to acquire from the Corporation any shares of its capital stock of
any class or classes, with such rights, warrants and options to be evidenced
by or in instrument(s) approved by the Board. The Board is empowered to set
the exercise price, duration, times for exercise and other terms and
conditions of such rights, warrants or options; _provided, however_ , that the
consideration to be received for any shares of capital stock issuable upon
exercise thereof may not be less than the par value thereof.

  



  

Article V. 
 BOARD OF DIRECTORS

  



  

Section 5.1. _Board Powers_. The business and affairs of the Corporation
shall be managed by, or under the direction of, the Board. In addition to the
powers and authority expressly conferred upon the Board by statute, this
Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation (" _Bylaws_ "), the Board is
hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things
as may be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the
provisions of the DGCL, this Certificate, and any Bylaws adopted by the
stockholders; _provided, however_ , that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the
stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have
been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

  



  

Section 5.2. _Number, Election and Term_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the provisions of the Investor Rights Agreement by and between
the Corporation and the other holders of Common Units (the " _Investor Rights
Agreement_ "), the number of directors of the Corporation, other than those
who may be elected by the holders of one or more series of the Preferred
Stock voting separately by class or series, shall be fixed from time to time
exclusively by the Board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of
the Board.

  



   

 | -5-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Subject to _Section 5.5_ , the Board shall be divided into three classes,
as nearly equal in number as possible, and designated Class I, Class II and
Class III. The Board is authorized to assign members of the Board already in
office to Class I, Class II or Class III. The term of the initial Class I
Directors shall expire at the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the
Corporation following the effectiveness of this Certificate; the term of the
initial Class II Directors shall expire at the second annual meeting of the
stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this
Certificate; and the term of the initial Class III Directors shall expire at
the third annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the
effectiveness of this Certificate. At each succeeding annual meeting of the
stockholders of the Corporation, beginning with the first annual meeting of
the stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this
Certificate, successors to the class of directors whose term expires at that
annual meeting shall be elected for a three-year term or until the election
and qualification of their respective successors in office, subject to their
earlier death, resignation or removal. Subject to _Section 5.5_ , if the
number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned
by the Board among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in
each class as nearly equal as possible, but in no case shall a decrease in the
number of directors shorten the term of any incumbent director. Subject to
the rights of the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock, voting
separately by class or series, to elect directors pursuant to the terms of
one or more series of Preferred Stock, the election of directors shall be
determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders present in
person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon.
The Board is hereby expressly authorized, by resolution or resolutions
thereof, to assign members of the Board already in office to the aforesaid
classes at the time this Certificate (and therefore such classification)
becomes effective in accordance with the DGCL.

  



  

(c) Subject to _Section 5.5_ hereof, a director shall hold office until the
annual meeting for the year in which his or her term expires and until his or
her successor has been elected and qualified, subject, however, to such
director's earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or
removal.

  



  

(d) Unless and except to the extent that the Bylaws shall so require, the
election of directors need not be by written ballot.

  



  

Section 5.3. _Newly Created Directorships and Vacancies_. Subject to (a)
_Section 5.5_ hereof and (b) the provisions of the Investor Rights Agreement,
any newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the number of
directors and any vacancies on the Board resulting from death, resignation,
retirement, disqualification, removal or other cause may be filled solely by
the majority vote of the remaining directors then in office, even if less
than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director (and not by stockholders), and
any director so chosen shall hold office for the remainder of the full term of
the class of directors to which the new directorship was added or in which
the vacancies occurred and until his or her successor has been elected and
qualified, subject, however, to such director's earlier death, resignation,
retirement, disqualification or removal. In the event of vacancies on the
Board, the remaining directors, except as otherwise provided by law, shall
exercise the powers of the full Board until the vacancy is filled.

  



  

Section 5.4. _Removal_. Subject to _Section 5.5_ hereof, any or all of the
directors may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and only
by the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66⅔ percent of the voting power
of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled
to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single
class. At least 45 days prior to any annual or special meeting of
stockholders at which it is proposed that any director be removed from office,
written notice of such proposed removal and the alleged grounds thereof shall
be sent to the director whose removal will be considered at the meeting.

  



   

 | -6-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 5.5. _Preferred Stock - Directors_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this _Article V_ , and except as otherwise required by law,
whenever the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock shall have
the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect one or more
directors, the term of office, the filling of vacancies, the removal from
office and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the
terms of such series of the Preferred Stock as set forth in this Certificate
(including any Preferred Stock Designation) and such directors shall not be
included in any of the classes created pursuant to this _Article V_ unless
expressly provided by such terms.

  



  

Section 5.6. _No Cumulative Voting_. Except as may otherwise be set forth in
the resolution or resolutions of the Board providing the issue of one or more
series of Preferred Stock, and then only with respect to such series of
Preferred Stock, cumulative voting in the election of directors is
specifically denied.

  



  

Article VI. 
 BYLAWS

  



  

Subject to the provisions of the Investor Rights Agreement, in furtherance
and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law, the Board shall
have the power and is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, alter or repeal
the Bylaws. The affirmative vote of a majority of the Board shall be required
to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws. The Bylaws also may be adopted,
amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital
stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Certificate (including any
Preferred Stock Designation), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least
66⅔ percent of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election
of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the
stockholders to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws; and _provided
further_ , _however_ , that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders
shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such
Bylaws had not been adopted.

  



  

Article VII. 
 MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS; ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT

  



  

Section 7.1. _Meetings_. Except as otherwise required by law and subject to
the rights, if any, of the holders of any outstanding series of the
Preferred Stock, and to the requirements of applicable law, special meetings
of the stockholders of the Corporation for any purpose or purposes may be
called only by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer of the
Corporation, or the Board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of
the Board.

  



  

Section 7.2. _Advance Notice_. Subject to the provisions of the Investor
Rights Agreement, advance notice of stockholder nominations for the
election of directors and of business to be brought by stockholders before
any meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation shall be given in the
manner provided in the Bylaws.

  



  

Section 7.3. _Action by Written Consent_. Except as may be otherwise provided
for or fixed pursuant to this Certificate (including any Preferred Stock
Designation) relating to the rights of the holders of any outstanding series
of Preferred Stock, any action required or permitted to be taken by the
stockholders of the Corporation must be effected by a duly called annual or
special meeting of such stockholders and may not be effected by written
consent of the stockholders other than with respect to the Class B Common
Stock, with respect to which action may be taken by written consent.

Article VIII. 
 LIMITED LIABILITY; INDEMNIFICATION

  



  

Section 8.1. _Limitation of Director Liability_. A director of the
Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its
stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director,
except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is
not permitted under the DGCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended
unless a director violated their duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its
stockholders, acted in bad faith, knowingly or intentionally violated the law,
authorized unlawful payments of dividends, unlawful stock purchases or
unlawful redemptions, or derived improper personal benefit from their
actions as directors. Any amendment, modification or repeal of the foregoing
sentence shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of
the Corporation hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to
the time of such amendment, modification or repeal.

  



  

Section 8.2. _Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_.

  



  

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as the same exists or
may hereafter be amended, the Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless
each person who is or was made a party or is threatened to be made a party to
or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit
or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a "
_proceeding_ ") by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or
officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of
the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a
partnership, joint venture, trust, other enterprise or nonprofit entity,
including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (an " _indemnitee_
"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an
official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent, or in any other
capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, against all
liability and loss suffered and expenses (including, without limitation,
attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties and
amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred by such indemnitee in
connection with such proceeding. The Corporation shall to the fullest extent
not prohibited by applicable law pay the expenses (including attorneys' fees)
incurred by an indemnitee in defending or otherwise participating in any
proceeding in advance of its final disposition;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, to the extent required by applicable law, such payment of expenses in
advance of the final disposition of the proceeding shall be made only upon
receipt of an undertaking, by or on behalf of the indemnitee, to repay
all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that the
indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified under this _Section 8.2_ or
otherwise. The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred
by this _Section 8.2_ shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue
as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or
agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and
administrators. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 8.2(a)_ , except for proceedings to enforce rights to
indemnification and advancement of expenses, the Corporation shall
indemnify and advance expenses to an indemnitee in connection with a
proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if
such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board.

  



   

 | -8-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Any indemnification of a director or officer of the Corporation or
advancement of expenses (including attorneys' fees, costs and charges) under
this _Section 8.2_ shall be made promptly, and in any event within forty-five
days (or, in the case of an advancement of expenses, twenty days, provided
that the director or officer has delivered the undertaking contemplated by
_Section 8.2(a)_ if required), upon the written request of the director or
officer. If the Corporation denies a written request for indemnification or
advancement of expenses, in whole or in part, or if payment in full pursuant
to such request is not made within forty-five days (or, in the case of an
advancement of expenses, twenty days, provided that the director or officer
has delivered the undertaking contemplated by _Section 8.2(a)_ if required),
the right to indemnification or advancements as granted by this _Section 8.2_
shall be enforceable by the director or officer in the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware, which shall be the sole and exclusive forums for any
such action. Such person's costs and expenses incurred in connection with
successfully establishing his or her right to indemnification, in whole or in
part, in any such action shall also be indemnified by the Corporation to
the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. It shall be a defense to any
such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for the
advancement of expenses where the undertaking required pursuant to _Section
8.2(a)_ , if any, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has
not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the DGCL for
the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the
burden of such defense shall be on the Corporation to the maximum
extent permitted by law. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including
its Board, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a
determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of
the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual
determination by the Corporation (including its Board, independent legal
counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable
standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption
that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

  



  

(c) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on
any indemnitee by this _Section 8.2_ shall not be exclusive of any other
rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this
Certificate, the Bylaws, an agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors, or otherwise.

  



  

(d) Any repeal or amendment of this _Section 8.2_ by the stockholders of the
Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of
this Certificate inconsistent with this _Section 8.2_ , shall, unless
otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such
amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to provide broader
indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto),
and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection
existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such
inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when such
proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of, or
related to, any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment
or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

  



   

 | -9-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) For purposes of this _Section 8.2_ , references to the "Corporation"
shall include, in addition to the resulting Corporation, any constituent
Corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a
consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would
have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers and
employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer,
employee or agent of such constituent Corporation, or is or was serving at the
request of such constituent Corporation as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, shall stand in the same position under this _Section 8.2_ with
respect to the resulting or surviving Corporation as he or she would have
with respect to such constituent Corporation if its separate existence had
continued.

  



  

(f) This  _Section 8.2_ shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to the
extent and in the manner authorized or permitted by law, to indemnify and to
advance expenses to persons other than indemnitees.

  



  

Article IX. 
 CORPORATE OPPORTUNITY

  



  

To the extent allowed by law, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any
other analogous doctrine, shall not apply with respect to the Corporation or
any of its officers or directors, and the Corporation renounces any expectancy
that any of the directors or officers of the Corporation will offer any such
corporate opportunity of which he or she may become aware to the Corporation,
except, the doctrine of corporate opportunity shall apply with respect to any
of the directors or officers of the Corporation only with respect to
a corporate opportunity that was offered to such person solely in his or her
capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation and such opportunity is
one the Corporation is legally and contractually permitted to undertake and
would otherwise be reasonable for the Corporation to pursue.

  



  

Article X. 
 EXCLUSIVE FORUM FOR CERTAIN LAWSUITS

  



  

Section 10.1. _Forum_. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the
selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including
a beneficial owner) to bring (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought
on behalf of the Corporation, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a
fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the
Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (c) any
action asserting a claim against the Corporation, its directors, officers or
employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or this
Certificate or the Bylaws, or (d) any action asserting a claim against the
Corporation, its directors, officers or employees governed by the internal
affairs doctrine, except for, as to each of (a) through (d) above, any claim
as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable
party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the
indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), which is
vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court
of Chancery, or for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter
jurisdiction.

  



   

 | -10-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 10.2. _Consent to Jurisdiction_. If any action the subject matter of
which is within the scope of _Section 10.1_ immediately above is filed in a
court other than a court located within the State of Delaware (a " _Foreign
Action_ ") in the name of any stockholder, such stockholder shall be deemed
to have consented to (a) the personal jurisdiction of the state and
federal courts located within the State of Delaware in connection with any
action brought in any such court to enforce _Section 10.1_  immediately above
(an " _FSC Enforcement Action_ ") and (b) having service of process made upon
such stockholder in any such FSC Enforcement Action by service upon such
stockholder's counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for such stockholder.

  



  

Article XI.

  



  

Section 11.1. _Severability_. If any provision or provisions of this
Certificate shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied
to any person or entity or circumstance for any reason whatsoever, then, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, the validity, legality and
enforceability of such provisions in any other circumstance and of the
remaining provisions of this Certificate (including, without limitation, each
portion of any sentence of this Certificate containing any such provision held
to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable) and the application of such provision to
other persons or entities and circumstances shall not in any way be affected
or impaired thereby. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise
acquiring any interest in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be
deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Certificate.

  



  

Article XII. 
 AMENDMENT to CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

  



  

Subject to the provisions of the Investor Rights Agreement, the Corporation
reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend, alter,
change or repeal any provision contained in this Certificate (including any
Preferred Stock Designation), and other provisions authorized by the laws of
the State of Delaware at the time in force that may be added or inserted, in
the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Certificate and the DGCL; and,
except as set forth in _Article VIII_ , all rights, preferences and privileges
of whatever nature herein conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other
persons by and pursuant to this Certificate in its present form or as
hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved in this _Article
XI_. In addition to any other vote of holders of capital stock that is
required by this Certificate or by law, any amendment or repeal of _Article V_
, _Article VI_ ,  _Article VIII_ , _Article IX_ and this _Article XII_ shall
require the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66⅔ percent of the voting
power of the then outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote on such
amendment or repeal.

Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) or the DGCL.

  



  

(b) _Class B Common Stock_.

  



  

(i) _Certain Definitions_. As used in this Amended and Restated Certificate:

party thereto;

 | -3-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iii) _Voting_. Except as otherwise required by law or this Amended and
Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), for so long
as any shares of Class B Common Stock shall remain outstanding, the
Corporation shall not, without the prior vote or written consent of the
holders of a majority of the shares of Class B Common Stock then outstanding,
voting separately as a single class, amend, alter or repeal any provision of
this Amended and Restated Certificate, whether by merger, consolidation or
otherwise, if such amendment, alteration or repeal would alter or change the
powers, preferences or relative, participating, optional or other special
rights of the Class B Common Stock. Any action required or permitted to be
taken at any meeting of the holders of Class B Common Stock may be taken
without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or
consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by
the holders of the outstanding Class B Common Stock having not less than the
minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such
action at a meeting at which all shares of Class B Common Stock were present
and voted and shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its
registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business,
or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which
minutes of proceedings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the
Corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested. Prompt written notice of the taking
of corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent
of the holders of Class B Common Stock shall, to the extent required by law,
be given to those holders of Class B Common Stock who have not consented in
writing and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would have been
entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date for notice of such
meeting had been the date that written consents signed by a sufficient number
of holders of Class B Common Stock to take the action were delivered to the
Corporation.

  



  

(iv) _Dividends_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Amended and
Restated Certificate, dividends shall not be declared or paid on the Class B
Common Stock.

  



  

(v) _Transfer of Class B Common Stock_.

  



  

(1) A holder of Class B Common Stock may transfer shares of Class B Common
Stock to any transferee (other than the Corporation) only if, and only to the
extent permitted by the LLC Agreement, such holder also simultaneously
transfers an equal number of such holder's Common Units to such transferee in
compliance with the LLC Agreement. The transfer restrictions described in this
_Section 4.4(b)(v)(1) _ are referred to as the " _Restrictions_."

  



  

(2) Any purported transfer of shares of Class B Common Stock in violation of
the Restrictions shall be null and void. If, notwithstanding the
Restrictions, a person shall, voluntarily or involuntarily, purportedly become
or attempt to become the purported owner (" _Purported Owner_ ") of shares of
Class B Common Stock in violation of the Restrictions, then the Purported
Owner shall not obtain any rights in and to such shares of Class B Common
Stock (the " _Restricted Shares_ "), and the purported transfer of the
Restricted Shares to the Purported Owner shall not be recognized by the
Corporation or its transfer agent (the " _Transfer Agent_ ").

  



   

 | -4-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(3) Upon a determination by the Board that a person has attempted or may
attempt to transfer or to acquire Restricted Shares in violation of the
Restrictions, the Board may take such action as it deems advisable to refuse
to give effect to such transfer or acquisition on the books and records of
the Corporation, including without limitation, to cause the Transfer Agent to
record the Purported Owner's transferor as the record owner of the Restricted
Shares and to institute proceedings to enjoin or rescind any such transfer or
acquisition.

  



  

(4) The Board may, to the extent permitted by law, from time to time
establish, modify, amend or rescind, by bylaw or otherwise, regulations and
procedures that are consistent with the provisions of this _Section 4.4(b)(v)_
for determining whether any transfer or acquisition of shares of Class B
Common Stock would violate the Restrictions and for the orderly application,
administration and implementation of the provisions of this _Section
4.4(b)(v)_. Any such procedures and regulations shall be kept on file
with the Secretary of the Corporation and with the Transfer Agent and shall
be made available for inspection by any prospective transferee and, upon
written request, shall be mailed to holders of shares of Class B Common Stock.

  



  

(5) The Board shall have all powers necessary to implement the Restrictions,
including without limitation, the power to prohibit the transfer of any
shares of Class B Common Stock in violation thereof.

  



  

(vi) _Exchange of Class B Common Stock_. Shares of Class B Common Stock
(together with the same number of Common Units) may be exchanged for shares
of Class A Common Stock as provided in the Exchange Agreement. The Corporation
will at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but
unissued shares of Class A Common Stock, solely for the purpose of issuance
upon exchange of shares of Class B Common Stock and Common Units for shares
of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, such number
of shares of Class A Common Stock that shall be issuable upon any such
exchange pursuant to the Exchange Agreement; _provided_  that nothing
contained herein shall be construed to preclude the Corporation from
satisfying its obligations in respect of any such exchange pursuant to the
Exchange Agreement by delivering to the holder of the shares of Class B Common
Stock and Common Units being exchanged (A) shares of Class A Common Stock
held in treasury by the Corporation or (B) cash in lieu of shares of Class A
Common Stock in the amount permitted by and provided in the Exchange
Agreement. All shares of Class A Common Stock that shall be issued upon any
such exchange of shares of Class B Common Stock and Common Units pursuant to
the Exchange Agreement will, upon issuance in accordance with the Exchange
Agreement, be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

Common Stock, as the case may be, shall bear a legend substantially in the
following form (or in such other form as the Board may determine):

  



  

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS BOOK ENTRY ARE SUBJECT TO THE RESTRICTIONS

STOCKHOLDER MAKING A REQUEST THEREFOR).

assets of the Corporation in the event of any voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.

holders of any outstanding series of the Preferred Stock, the holders of the
shares of Class A Common Stock shall be entitled to receive such dividends and
other distributions (payable in cash, property or capital stock of the
Corporation) when, as and if declared thereon by the Board from time to time
out of any assets or funds of the Corporation legally available therefor, and
shall share equally on a per share basis in such dividends and distributions.

  



  

(d) _Class A Common Stock_. In no event shall the shares of Class A Common
Stock be split, divided, or combined (including by way of stock dividend)
unless the outstanding shares of the other class shall be proportionately
split, divided or combined.

  



  

(e) _Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up of the Corporation_. Subject to
applicable law and the rights, if any, of the holders of any
outstanding series of the Preferred Stock, in the event of any voluntary or
involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, after
payment or provision for payment of the debts and other liabilities of the
Corporation, the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock shall be entitled
to receive all the remaining assets of the Corporation available for
distribution to its stockholders, ratably in proportion to the number of

create and issue rights, warrants and options entitling the holders thereof
to acquire from the Corporation any shares of its capital stock of any class

instrument(s) approved by the Board. The Board is empowered to set the

exercise thereof may not be less than the par value thereof.

more series of Preferred Stock, voting separately by class or series, to
elect directors pursuant to the terms of one or more series of Preferred
Stock, the election of directors shall be determined by a plurality of the
votes cast by the stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at
the meeting and entitled to vote thereon.

  



  

(c) Subject to _Section 5.5_ hereof, a director shall hold office until the
annual meeting for the year in which his or her term expires and until his or
her successor has been elected and qualified, subject, however, to such
director's earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or
removal.

  



  

(d) Unless and except to the extent that the Bylaws shall so require, the
election of directors need not be by written ballot.

  



  

Section 5.3. _Newly Created Directorships and Vacancies_. Subject to (a)
_Section 5.5_ hereof and (b) the provisions of the Investor Rights Agreement,
any newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the number of
directors and any vacancies on the Board resulting from death, resignation,
retirement, disqualification, removal or other cause may be filled solely by
the majority vote of the remaining directors then in office, even if less
than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director (and not by stockholders), and
any director so chosen shall hold office until the next annual meeting of
stockholders (or special meeting in lieu thereof) and until his or her
successor has been elected and qualified, subject, however, to such director's
earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal. In the
event of vacancies on the Board, the remaining directors, except as otherwise
provided by law, shall exercise the powers of the full Board until the vacancy
is filled.

Section 5.4. _Removal_. Subject to _Section 5.5_ hereof, any or all of the
directors may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and only
by the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66⅔ percent of the voting power
of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled
to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a
single class. At least 45 days prior to any annual or special meeting of
stockholders at which it is proposed that any director be removed from
office, written notice of such proposed removal and the alleged grounds
thereof shall be sent to the director whose removal will be considered at the
meeting.

  



  

Section 5.5. _Preferred Stock - Directors_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this _Article V_ , and except as otherwise required by law,
whenever the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock shall have
the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect one or more
directors, the term of office, the filling of vacancies, the removal from
office and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the
terms of such series of the Preferred Stock as set forth in this Amended and
Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation).

  



  

Section 5.6. _No Cumulative Voting_. Except as may otherwise be set forth in
the resolution or resolutions of the Board providing the issue of one or more
series of Preferred Stock, and then only with respect to such series of
Preferred Stock, cumulative voting in the election of directors is
specifically denied.

  



  

Article VI. 
 BYLAWS

  



  

Subject to the provisions of the Investor Rights Agreement, in furtherance
and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law, the Board shall
have the power and is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, alter or repeal
the Bylaws. The affirmative vote of a majority of the Board shall be required
to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws. The Bylaws also may be adopted,
amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders; provided, however, that in
addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock
of the Corporation required by law or by this Amended and Restated Certificate
(including any Preferred Stock Designation), the affirmative vote of the
holders of at least 66⅔ percent of the voting power of all then outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the
election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required
for the stockholders to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws; and provided
further, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall
invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such
Bylaws had not been adopted.

Corporation, or the Board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of
the Board.

Section 7.3. _Action by Written Consent_. Except as may be otherwise provided
for or fixed pursuant to this Amended and Restated Certificate (including any
Preferred Stock Designation) relating to the rights of the holders of any
outstanding series of Preferred Stock, any action required or permitted to be
taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected by a duly called
annual or special meeting of such stockholders and may not be effected by
written consent of the stockholders other than with respect to the Class B
Common Stock, with respect to which action may be taken by written consent.

  



  

Article VIII. 
 LIMITED LIABILITY; INDEMNIFICATION

  



  

Section 8.1. _Limitation of Director Liability_. A director of the
Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its
stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director,
except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is
not permitted under the DGCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended
unless a director violated their duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its
stockholders, acted in bad faith, knowingly or intentionally violated the
law, authorized unlawful payments of dividends, unlawful stock purchases or
unlawful redemptions, or derived improper personal benefit from their actions
as directors. Any amendment, modification or repeal of the foregoing sentence
shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the
Corporation hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the
time of such amendment, modification or repeal.

  



  

Section 8.2. _Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_.

  



  

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as the same exists or
may hereafter be amended, the Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless
each person who is or was made a party or is threatened to be made a party to
or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit
or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a "
_proceeding_ ") by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or
officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of
the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a
partnership, joint venture, trust, other enterprise or nonprofit entity,
including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (an " _indemnitee_
"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an
official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent, or in any other
capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, against all
liability and loss suffered and expenses (including, without limitation,
attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties and
amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred by such indemnitee in
connection with such proceeding. The Corporation shall to the fullest extent
not prohibited by applicable law pay the expenses (including attorneys' fees)
incurred by an indemnitee in defending or otherwise participating in any
proceeding in advance of its final disposition;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, to the extent required by applicable law, such payment of expenses in
advance of the final disposition of the proceeding shall be made only upon
receipt of an undertaking, by or on behalf of the indemnitee, to repay
all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that the
indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified under this _Section 8.2_ or
otherwise. The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred
by this _Section 8.2_ shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue
as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or
agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and
administrators. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section
8.2(a)_ , except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification and
advancement of expenses, the Corporation shall indemnify and advance expenses
to an indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated
by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized
by the Board.

  



   

 | -9-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Any indemnification of a director or officer of the Corporation or
advancement of expenses (including attorneys' fees, costs and charges) under
this _Section 8.2_ shall be made promptly, and in any event within forty-five
days (or, in the case of an advancement of expenses, twenty days, provided
that the director or officer has delivered the undertaking contemplated by
_Section 8.2(a)_ if required), upon the written request of the director or
officer. If the Corporation denies a written request for indemnification or
advancement of expenses, in whole or in part, or if payment in full pursuant
to such request is not made within forty-five days (or, in the case of an
advancement of expenses, twenty days, provided that the director or officer
has delivered the undertaking contemplated by _Section 8.2(a)_ if required),
the right to indemnification or advancements as granted by this _Section 8.2_
shall be enforceable by the director or officer in the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware, which shall be the sole and exclusive forums for any
such action. Such person's costs and expenses incurred in connection
with successfully establishing his or her right to indemnification, in whole
or in part, in any such action shall also be indemnified by the Corporation
to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. It shall be a defense to
any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for the
advancement of expenses where the undertaking required pursuant to _Section
8.2(a)_ , if any, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has
not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the DGCL for
the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the
burden of such defense shall be on the Corporation to the maximum extent
permitted by law. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board,
independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination
prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant
is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable
standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the
Corporation (including its Board, independent legal counsel or its
stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of
conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the
claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

  



  

(c) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on
any indemnitee by this _Section 8.2_ shall not be exclusive of any other
rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this
Amended and Restated Certificate, the Bylaws, an agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

  



   

 | -10-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) Any repeal or amendment of this _Section 8.2_ by the stockholders of the
Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of
this Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this _Section 8.2_ ,
shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the
extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to
provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted
prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any
right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or
adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding
(regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or
completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring prior
to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

  



  

(e) For purposes of this _Section 8.2_ , references to the "Corporation"
shall include, in addition to the resulting Corporation, any constituent
Corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a
consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would
have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers and
employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer,
employee or agent of such constituent Corporation, or is or was serving at the
request of such constituent Corporation as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, shall stand in the same position under this _Section 8.2_ with
respect to the resulting or surviving Corporation as he or she would have
with respect to such constituent Corporation if its separate existence had
continued.

  



  

(f) This  _Section 8.2_ shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to the
extent and in the manner authorized or permitted by law, to indemnify and to
advance expenses to persons other than indemnitees.

  



  

Article IX. 
 CORPORATE OPPORTUNITY

  



  

To the extent allowed by law, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any
other analogous doctrine, shall not apply with respect to the Corporation or
any of its officers or directors, and the Corporation renounces any expectancy
that any of the directors or officers of the Corporation will offer any such
corporate opportunity of which he or she may become aware to the
Corporation, except, the doctrine of corporate opportunity shall apply with
respect to any of the directors or officers of the Corporation only with
respect to a corporate opportunity that was offered to such person solely in
his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation and such
opportunity is one the Corporation is legally and contractually permitted to
undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for the Corporation to pursue.

Article X. 
 EXCLUSIVE FORUM FOR CERTAIN LAWSUITS

  



  

Section 10.1. _Forum_. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the
selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including
a beneficial owner) to bring (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought
on behalf of the Corporation, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a
fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the
Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (c) any
action asserting a claim against the Corporation, its directors, officers or
employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or this Amended and
Restated Certificate or the Bylaws, or (d) any action asserting a claim
against the Corporation, its directors, officers or employees governed by the
internal affairs doctrine, except for, as to each of (a) through (d)
above, any claim as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is
an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such
determination), which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or
forum other than the Court of Chancery, or for which the Court of Chancery
does not have subject matter jurisdiction.

  



  

Section 10.2. _Consent to Jurisdiction_. If any action the subject matter of
which is within the scope of _Section 10.1_  immediately above is filed in a
court other than a court located within the State of Delaware (a " _Foreign
Action_ ") in the name of any stockholder, such stockholder shall be deemed
to have consented to (a) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal
courts located within the State of Delaware in connection with any action
brought in any such court to enforce _Section 10.1_ immediately above (an "
_FSC Enforcement Action_ ") and (b) having service of process made upon such
stockholder in any such FSC Enforcement Action by service upon such
stockholder's counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for such stockholder.

  



  

Article XI. 
 severability

  



  

If any provision or provisions of this Amended and Restated Certificate shall
be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any person or
entity or circumstance for any reason whatsoever, then, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, the validity, legality and enforceability of such
provisions in any other circumstance and of the remaining provisions of this
Amended and Restated Certificate (including, without limitation, each portion
of any sentence of this Amended and Restated Certificate containing any such
provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself held
to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) and the application of such
provision to other persons or entities and circumstances shall not in any way
be affected or impaired thereby. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise
acquiring any interest in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be
deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Amended and
Restated Certificate.

  



  

Article XII. 
 AMENDMENT to CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

  



  

Subject to the provisions of the Investor Rights Agreement, the Corporation
reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend, alter, change
or repeal any provision contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate
(including any Preferred Stock Designation), and other provisions authorized
by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force that may be added or
inserted, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by this Amended and
Restated Certificate and the DGCL; and, except as set forth in _Article VIII_
, all rights, preferences and privileges of whatever nature herein conferred
upon stockholders, directors or any other persons by and pursuant to this
Amended and Restated Certificate in its present form or as hereafter amended are
granted subject to the right reserved in this _Article XI_. In addition to
any other vote of holders of capital stock that is required by this Amended and
Restated Certificate or by law, any amendment or repeal of _Article V_ ,
_Article VI_ , _Article VIII_ , _Article IX_ and this _Article XII_ shall
require the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66⅔ percent of the voting
power of the then outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote on such
amendment or repeal.

Article 1 
  
 Stockholders

  



  

1.1 _Place of Meetings_. Meetings of stockholders of Strike, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Corporation_ "), shall be held at the place,
either within or without the State of Delaware, as may be designated by the
Board of Directors of the Corporation (the " _Board of Directors_ ") from
time to time.

  



  

1.2 _Annual Meetings_. Annual meetings of stockholders shall be held at such
time and place as fixed by the Board of Directors for the purpose of electing
directors and transacting any other business as may properly come before such
meetings.

  



  

1.3 _Special Meetings_. Except as otherwise required by law, special
meetings of stockholders for any purpose or purposes may be called at any
time only by the Board of Directors, the Chairperson of the Board of
Directors, the Lead Director of the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive
Officer of the Corporation, to be held at such place, date and time as shall
be designated in the notice or waiver of notice thereof. Only business within
the purposes described in the Corporation's notice of meeting required by
_Section 1.4_ may be conducted at the special meetings. The ability of the
stockholders to call a special meeting is specifically denied.

  



  

1.4 _Notice of Meetings_. Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to
take any action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting shall be given
that shall state the place, date and hour of the meeting and, in the case of a
special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.
Unless otherwise provided by law, the Corporation's Certificate of
Incorporation (as the same may be amended or restated from time to time, the
" _Certificate of Incorporation_ ") or these Bylaws, the written notice of
any meeting shall be given no fewer than 10 nor more than 60 days before the
date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. If
mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the mail,
postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his or her address as it
appears on the records of the Corporation.

  



  

1.5 _Adjournments_. Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special, may
adjourn from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place,
and notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time and
place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.
At the adjourned meeting, the Corporation may transact any business that might
have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more
than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the
adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each
stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

  



   



 



    



  

1.6 _Quorum_. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Corporation or these Bylaws, at each meeting of
stockholders, the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of shares of
stock having a majority of the votes that could be cast by the holders of all
outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote at the meeting shall be necessary
and sufficient to constitute a quorum, and the stockholders present at any
duly convened meeting may continue to do business until adjournment
notwithstanding any withdrawal from the meeting of holders of shares counted
in determining the existence of a quorum. In the absence of a quorum, the
stockholders so present may, by majority vote, adjourn the meeting from time
to time in the manner provided in _Section 1.5_ of these Bylaws until a
quorum shall attend. Shares of its own stock belonging to the Corporation or
any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Corporation shall neither be
entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the Corporation to vote
stock, including but not limited to its own stock, held by it in a fiduciary
capacity.

  



  

1.7 _Organization_. Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by the
Chairperson of the Board of Directors, if any, or in his or her absence by
the Lead Director, if any, or in his or her absence by the Vice Chairperson of
the Board of the Directors, if any, or in his or her absence by the Chief
Executive Officer, or in his or her absence by a chairperson designated by the
Board of Directors, or in the absence of such designation, by a chairperson
chosen at the meeting. The Board of Directors may appoint a non-
executive Lead Director, who shall be a director of the Corporation and shall
undertake duties prescribed herein and such other duties or responsibilities
as the Board of Directors may assign. The Secretary shall act as secretary of
the meeting, but in his or her absence the chairperson of the meeting may
appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.

  



  

1.8 _Voting; Proxies_. Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of
Incorporation, each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of
stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by
such stockholder that has voting power upon the matter in question. Each
stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize
another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, but no such
proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless
the proxy provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy shall be
irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as,
it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable
power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy that is not irrevocable by
attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in
writing revoking the proxy or another duly executed proxy bearing a later
date with the Secretary of the Corporation. Voting at meetings of
stockholders need not be by written ballot. Directors shall be elected by a
plurality of the votes entitled to be cast by the stockholders who are
present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote
on the election of directors. All other elections and questions shall, unless
otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws,
be decided by a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the stockholders
who are present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and
entitled to vote. In the case of a matter submitted for a vote of the
stockholders as to which a stockholder approval requirement is
applicable under the stockholder approval policy of The Nasdaq Stock Market
or any other exchange or quotation system on which the capital stock of the
Corporation is quoted or traded, the requirements of Rule 16b-3 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), or any
provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_
"), in each case for which no higher voting requirement is specified by the
Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended (the " _DGCL_ "), the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, the vote required for approval
shall be the requisite vote specified in such stockholder approval policy,
Rule 16b-3 or Code provision, as the case may be (or the highest such
requirement if more than one is applicable).

1.9 _Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record_. In order that
the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to
vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to
receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any
rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change,
conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful
action, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date for
stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders, which
shall not be more than 60 nor fewer than 10 days before the date of such
meeting, nor more than 60 days prior to any other action. If the Board of
Directors so fixes a date for the determination of stockholders entitled to
receive notice of a meeting of stockholders, such date shall also be the
record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting
unless the Board of Directors determines, at the time it fixes such record
date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the
date for making such determination. If no record date is fixed: (1) the
record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a
meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next
preceding the day on which notice is given or, if notice is waived, at the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is
held; and (2) the record date for determining stockholders for any
other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board
of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of
stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the
determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and
in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled to
notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for
determination of stockholders entitled to vote.

  



  

1.10 _List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote_. The Secretary shall prepare
and make, at least 10 days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete
list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting; _provided_ ,
_however_ , if the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to
vote is fewer than 10 days before the meeting date, the list shall reflect the
stockholders entitled to vote as of the tenth day before the meeting date,
arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each
stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each
stockholder as of the record date. Such list shall be open to the
examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting,
during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least 10 days prior to the
meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held,
which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so
specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also
be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole
time thereof and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. An
original or duplicate stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are
the stockholders entitled to examine the stock ledger, the list of
stockholders or the books of the Corporation or to vote in person or by proxy
at any meeting of stockholders.

  



  

1.11 _Notice of Stockholder Business; Nominations_.

  



  

(a) _Annual Meetings of Stockholders_. Nominations of one or more
individuals to the Board of Directors (each, a " _Nomination_ ," and more
than one, " _Nominations_ ") and the proposal of business other than
Nominations (" _Business_ ") to be considered by the stockholders of the
Corporation may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders only (1) pursuant
to the Corporation's notice of meeting or any supplement thereto ( _provided_
, _however_ , that reference in the Corporation's notice of meeting to the
election of directors or to the election of members of the Board of Directors
shall not include or be deemed to include Nominations), (2) by or at the
direction of the Board of Directors or (3) by any stockholder of the
Corporation who was a stockholder of record of the Corporation at the time
the notice provided for in this _Section 1.11_ is delivered to the Secretary
of the Corporation, who is entitled to vote at the meeting, and who complies
with the notice procedures set forth in this _Section 1.11_. Subclause (3)
above shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations or
submit business (other than matters properly brought under Rule 14a-8 (or any
successor thereto) under the Exchange Act and indicated in the
Corporation's notice of meeting) before an annual meeting of stockholders.

(b) _Special Meetings of Stockholders_. Only such Business shall be
conducted at a special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation as shall
have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Corporation's notice of
meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , that reference in the Corporation's notice
of meeting to the election of directors or to the election of members of the
Board of Directors shall not include or be deemed to include Nominations.
Nominations may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which
directors are to be elected pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting

share or shares of stock as the absolute owner thereof for all purposes and,
accordingly, shall not be bound to recognize any legal, equitable or other
claim to, or interest in, such share or shares of stock on the part of any
other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof,
except as otherwise expressly provided by law.

  



  

5.4 _Transfer Agent; Registrar_. The Board of Directors may appoint a
transfer agent and one or more co-transfer agents and registrar and one or
more co-registrars and may make, or authorize any such agent to make, all such
rules and regulations deemed expedient concerning the issue, transfer and
registration of shares of stock of the Corporation.

Article 6 
  
 Indemnification

  



  

6.1 _Right to Indemnification_. The Corporation shall indemnify and hold
harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it presently
exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment,
only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide
broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to
provide prior to such amendment), any person who was or is made or is
threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a "
_Proceeding_ "), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person for whom
he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the
Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee,
member, trustee, partner, manager, representative or agent of another
corporation or of a partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to
employee benefit plans maintained or sponsored by the Corporation (an "
_Indemnitee_ "), whether the basis in such Proceeding is alleged action in an
official capacity as director, officer, employee, member, trustee, partner,
manager, representative or agent or in any other capacity while serving as
such, against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees,
judgments, fines, excise taxes or penalties, and amounts paid in settlement)
incurred or suffered by such Indemnitee in connection therewith, if such
person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to
be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with
respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to
believe such person's conduct was unlawful. The Corporation shall indemnify
an Indemnitee in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by
such Indemnitee only if the initiation of such Proceeding (or part thereof)
by the Indemnitee was authorized by the Board of Directors.

  



  

6.2 _Prepayment of Expenses_. The Corporation shall pay the expenses
(including attorneys' fees) incurred by an Indemnitee in defending any
Proceeding in advance of its final disposition; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the payment of expenses incurred by a director or officer in advance of the
final disposition of the Proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an
undertaking (an " _Undertaking_ ") by or on behalf of the director or officer
to repay all amounts advanced if it should be ultimately determined that the
director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article or
otherwise.

  



  

6.3 _Claims_.

  



  

(a) To obtain indemnification under this _Article 6_ , an Indemnitee shall
submit to the Corporation a written request, including therein or therewith
such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the
Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what
extent the claimant is entitled to indemnification. Upon written request by an
Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to the first sentence of this
_Section 6.3(a)_ , a determination, if required by applicable law,
with respect to the Indemnitee's entitlement thereto shall be made (1) by the
Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who
are not and were not parties to the matter in respect of which indemnification
is sought by Indemnitee (" _Disinterested Directors_ "), (2) if a quorum of
the Board of Directors consisting of Disinterested Directors is not
obtainable or, even if obtainable, such quorum of Disinterested Directors so
directs, by less than a quorum of the Board of Directors consisting of
Disinterested Directors or (3) if a majority of Disinterested Directors so
directs, by the stockholders of the Corporation.

  



   

 | 13| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) If a claim for indemnification or payment of expenses under this _Article
6_ is not paid in full by the Corporation within 30 days after a written
claim therefor by the Indemnitee has been received by the Corporation, the
Indemnitee may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if
successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expenses of
prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than
an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any
Proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required Undertaking,
if any is required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the Indemnitee
has not met the standard of conduct that makes it permissible under the DGCL
for the Corporation to indemnify the Indemnitee for the amount claimed.
Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors
or stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of
such action that indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in the
circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set
forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including
its Board of Directors or stockholders) that the Indemnitee has not met such
applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a
presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard
of conduct. If a determination shall have been made pursuant to _Section
6.3(b)_ that the claimant is entitled to indemnification, the Corporation
shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding commenced
pursuant to this _Section 6.3(b)_. The Corporation shall be precluded from
asserting in any judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to this _Section
6.3(b)_ that the procedures and presumptions of this _Article 6_ are not
valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in such proceeding that
the Corporation is bound by all the provisions of this _Article 6_.

  



  

6.4 _Employees and Agents_. The Corporation may, to the extent authorized
from time to time by the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification,
and rights to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending
any proceeding in advance of its final disposition, to any current or former
employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions
of this  _Article 6_ with respect to the indemnification and advancement of
expenses of current or former directors and officers of the Corporation.

  



  

6.5 _Non-exclusivity of Rights_. The rights conferred on any person by this
_Article 6_ shall not be exclusive of any other rights that such person may
have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of
Incorporation, these Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or Disinterested
Directors or otherwise.

  



  

6.6 _Other Indemnification_. The Corporation's obligation, if any, to
indemnify any person who was or is serving at its request as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity shall be reduced by any amount such
person may collect as indemnification from such other corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit enterprise.

  



  

6.7 _Nature of Indemnification Rights; Amendment or Repeal_. Each person who
was, is, or becomes a director or officer shall be deemed to have served or
to have continued to serve in such capacity in reliance upon the indemnity
provided for in this _Article 6_. Such rights shall be deemed to have vested
at the time such person becomes or became a director or officer of the
Corporation, and such rights shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has
ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the
benefit of the Indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators. Any
amendment, modification, alteration or repeal of this _Article 6_ that in any
way diminishes, limits, restricts, adversely affects or eliminates any right
of an Indemnitee or his or her successors to indemnification, advancement of
expenses or otherwise shall be prospective only and shall not in any way
diminish, limit, restrict, adversely affect or eliminate any such right with
respect to any actual or alleged state of facts, occurrence, action or
omission then or previously existing, or any action, suit or proceeding
previously or thereafter brought or threatened based in whole or in part upon
any such actual or alleged state of facts, occurrence, action or omission.

  



   

 | 14| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

6.8 _Enforceability_. If any provision or provisions of this _Article 6_
shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason
whatsoever, then (1) the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions of this _Article 6_ (including, without limitation, each
portion of any Section or paragraph of this _Article 6_ containing any such
provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected
or impaired thereby, and (2) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions
of this _Article 6_ (including, without limitation, each such portion of any
Section or paragraph of this _Article 6_ containing any such provision held to
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect
to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable.

  



  

6.9 _Insurance for Indemnification_. The Corporation may purchase and
maintain, at its expense, insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving
at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent
of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such
person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person's status as such,
whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person
against such liability under the provisions of Section 145 of the DGCL. To
the extent that the Corporation maintains any policy or policies providing
such insurance, each such current or former director or officer, and each
such agent or employee to which rights to indemnification have been
granted as provided in _Section 6.4_ , shall be covered by such policy or
policies in accordance with its or their terms to the maximum extent of the
coverage thereunder for any such current or former director, officer, employee
or agent.

  



  

6.10 _Limitation on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything contained in
this _Article 6_ to the contrary, except for proceedings to enforce rights to
indemnification (which shall be governed by _Section 6.3_ ), the Corporation
shall not be obligated to indemnify any director or officer (or his or her
heirs, executors or personal or legal representatives) or advance expenses
in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person
unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or consented to by
the Board of Directors.

  



  

Article 7 
  
 Miscellaneous

  



  

7.1 _Fiscal Year_. The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be the calendar
year, unless otherwise determined by resolution of the Board of Directors.

  



  

7.2 _Seal_. The corporate seal shall have the name of the Corporation
inscribed thereon and shall be in such form as may be approved from time to
time by the Board of Directors.

  



  

7.3 _Notices_. Except as may otherwise be required by law, the Certificate
of Incorporation or these Bylaws, any notice to the Corporation,
any stockholder or director must be in writing and may be transmitted by:
mail, private carrier or personal delivery; telegraph or teletype; or
telephone, wire or wireless equipment that transmits a facsimile of the
notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and without limiting the manner by
which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders pursuant to
the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, any notice to
stockholders given by the Corporation under any provision of the DGCL, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws shall be effective if given by a
form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the
notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by
written notice to the Corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked
if:

  



  

(a) the Corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two
consecutive notices given by the Corporation in accordance with such consent;
and

  



   

 | 15| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) such inability becomes known to the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary
of the Corporation or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for
the giving of notice.

  



  

Inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not
invalidate any meeting or other action. An " _electronic transmission_ " means
any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission
of paper, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved and reviewed
by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by
such a recipient through an automated process.

  



  

Written notice by the Corporation to its stockholders shall be deemed
effective when mailed, if mailed with first-class postage prepaid and
correctly addressed to the stockholder's address shown in the Corporation's
current record of stockholders. Except as set forth in the previous sentence,
written notice shall be deemed effective at the earliest of the following:
(a) when received; (b) five days after its deposit in the United States mail,
as evidenced by the postmark, if mailed with first-class postage, prepaid and
correctly addressed; (c) on the date shown on the return receipt, if sent by
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, and receipt is signed
by or on behalf of the addressee; (d) when directed to the stockholder, if by
electronic transmission (other than as set forth in (e) below); or (e) if
sent to a stockholder's address, telephone number or other number appearing on
the records of the Corporation, when dispatched by telegraph, teletype or
facsimile equipment.

  



  

Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given
effectively by the Corporation to stockholders, any notice to stockholders
given by the Corporation under any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of
Incorporation or these Bylaws shall be effective if given by a single written
notice to stockholders who share an address if consented to by the
stockholders at that address to whom such notice is given. A stockholder may
revoke such stockholder's consent by delivering written notice of such
revocation to the Corporation. Any stockholder who fails to object in writing
to the Corporation within 60 days of having been given written notice by the
Corporation of its intention to send such a single written notice shall be
deemed to have consented to receiving such single written notice.

  



  

7.4 _Waiver of Notice of Meetings of Stockholders, Directors and
Committees_. Any written waiver of notice, signed by the person entitled to
notice, or waiver by electronic transmission by the person or persons entitled
to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed
equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a
waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting
for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the
transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of any
regular or special meeting of the stockholders, directors or members of a
committee of directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice.

  



  

7.5 _Interested Directors; Quorum_. No contract or transaction between the
Corporation and one or more of its directors or officers, or between the
Corporation and any other corporation, partnership, association or other
organization in which one or more of its directors or officers are directors
or officers, or have a financial interest, shall be void or voidable solely
for this reason, or solely because the director or officer is present at or
participates in the meeting of the Board of Directors or committee
thereof that authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely because his,
her or their votes are counted for such purpose, if: (a) the material facts
as to his or her relationship or interest and as to the contract or
transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board of Directors or the
committee, and the Board of Directors or committee in good faith authorizes
the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the
Disinterested Directors, even though the Disinterested Directors be less than
a quorum; (b) the material facts as to his or her relationship or interest
and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the
stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is
specifically approved in good faith by vote of the stockholders; or (c) the
contract or transaction is fair as to the Corporation as of the time it is
authorized, approved or ratified by the Board of Directors, a committee
thereof, or the stockholders. All directors, including interested directors,
may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the
Board of Directors or of a committee that authorizes the contract or
transaction.

  



   

 | 16| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

7.6 _Form of Records_. Any records maintained by the Corporation in the
regular course of its business, including its stock ledger, books of account
and minute books, may be kept on, or be in the form of, punch cards, magnetic
tape, photographs, hard drives or any other information storage device,
provided that the records so kept can be converted into clearly legible form
within a reasonable time. The Corporation shall so convert any records so
kept upon the request of any person entitled to inspect the same.

  



  

7.7 _Amendment of Bylaws_.

  



  

(a) These Bylaws may only be amended or repealed by the stockholders at an
annual or special meeting of the stockholders, the notice for which
designates that an amendment or repeal of one or more of such sections is to
be considered, only by an affirmative vote of the stockholders holding a
majority in interest of all shares entitled to vote upon such amendment or
repeal, voting as a single class; _provided_ , _however_ , that _Article 1_ ,
_Section 2.2_ , _Article 6_ and _Section 7.7_ of these Bylaws may only be
amended or repealed by the stockholders at an annual or special meeting of the
stockholders, the notice for which designates that an amendment or repeal of
one or more of such sections is to be considered, only by an affirmative vote
of the stockholders holding at least 66-2/3 percent of the voting power of
the stockholders entitled to vote at an election for directors of the
Corporation, voting as a single class.

  



  

(b) The Board of Directors shall have the power to amend or repeal these
Bylaws of, or adopt new bylaws for, the Corporation. Any such bylaws, or any
alternation, amendment or repeal of these Bylaws, may be subsequently amended
or repealed by the stockholders as provided in _Section 7.7(a)_ of these
Bylaws.

ARTICLE IV 
 CAPITAL ACCOUNTS AND ISSUANCE OF COMPANY UNITS

  



  

4.1 _Units_. Company Interests shall be represented by Units, or such other
securities of the Company, in each case as the Manager may establish in its
discretion in accordance with the terms and subject to the restrictions
hereof. Immediately after the Effective Time, the Units will be comprised of
a single class of Common Units (with an aggregate of [●]2 Common Units being
authorized for issuance by the Company). To the extent required pursuant to
_Section 4.3(a)_ , the Manager may create one or more classes or series of
Common Units or preferred Units solely to the extent they are in the aggregate
substantially equivalent to a class or series of common stock of the
Corporation or class or series of preferred stock of the Corporation,
respectively; _provided_ , that as long as there are any Members of the
Company (other than the Corporation), then no such new class or series of
Units may deprive such Members of, or dilute or reduce, the pro rata share of
all Company Interests they would have received or to which they would have
been entitled if such new class or series of Units had not been created except
to the extent (and solely to the extent) the Company actually receives cash
in an aggregate amount, or other property with a fair market value in an
aggregate amount, equal to the pro rata share allocated to such new class or
series of Units and the number thereof issued by the Company. As long as
there are any Members of the Company (other than the Corporation), the Company
shall only issue and shall only register the transfer of whole numbers of
Units of any class or series of Units then authorized (including the Common
Units).

  



  

4.2 _Recapitalization_. In connection with the Recapitalization, upon
execution of these Regulations and as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, all Original Company Securities that were issued and outstanding and
held by the Pre-Transaction Members immediately prior to the Effective Time,
which are set forth next to each Pre-Transaction Member on _Schedule 1_ , are
hereby converted into the number of Common Units set forth next to each Pre-
Transaction Member on the Schedule of Members, and such Common Units are
hereby issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and the holders of
such Common Units hereby continue as Members.

4.3 _Authorization and Issuance of Additional Units_.

  



  

(a) The Company shall undertake all actions, including an issuance,
reclassification, distribution, division or recapitalization, with respect to
the Common Units, to maintain at all times a one-to-one ratio between the
number of Common Units owned by the Corporation, directly or indirectly, and
the number of outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, disregarding, for
purposes of maintaining the one-to-one ratio, (i) options, rights or
securities of the Corporation issued under an Equity Plan that are convertible
into or exercisable or exchangeable for Class A Common Stock (except to the
extent the net proceeds from such other securities, including any exercise or
purchase price payable upon conversion, exercise or exchange thereof, has been
contributed by the Corporation to the equity capital of the Company), (ii)
treasury stock, (iii) preferred stock or other debt or equity securities
(including without limitation warrants, options or rights) issued by the
Corporation that are convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable
for Class A Common Stock (except to the extent the net proceeds from such
other securities, including any exercise or purchase price payable upon
conversion, exercise or exchange thereof, has been contributed by the
Corporation to the equity capital of the Company), (iv) the issuance and
distribution to holders of shares of Class A Common Stock of rights to
purchase Equity Securities of the Corporation under a "poison pill" or
similar shareholders rights plan, or (v) Capital Contributions by the
Manager from excess cash at the Corporation. In the event the Corporation
issues, transfers or delivers from treasury stock or repurchases Class A
Common Stock in a transaction not contemplated in these Regulations or the
Exchange Agreement, the Manager shall take all actions such that, after
giving effect to all such issuances, transfers, deliveries or repurchases, the
number of outstanding Common Units owned by the Corporation will equal on a
one-for-one basis the aggregate number of outstanding shares of Class A Common
Stock. In the event the Corporation issues, transfers or delivers from
treasury stock or repurchases or redeems the Corporation's preferred stock in
a transaction not contemplated in these Regulations, the Manager shall have
the authority to take all actions such that, after giving effect to all such
issuances, transfers, deliveries, repurchases or redemptions, the Corporation
holds (in the case of any issuance, transfer or delivery) or ceases to hold
(in the case of any repurchase or redemption) equity interests in the Company
which (in the good faith determination by the Manager) are in the aggregate
substantially equivalent to the outstanding preferred stock of the
Corporation so issued, transferred, delivered, repurchased or redeemed. The
Company shall not undertake any subdivision (by any Common Unit split, Common
Unit distribution, reclassification, recapitalization or similar event) or
combination (by reverse Common Unit split, reclassification, recapitalization
or similar event) of the Common Units that is not accompanied by an identical
subdivision or combination of Class A Common Stock to maintain at all times a
one-to-one ratio between the number of Common Units owned by the Corporation
and the number of outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, unless such
action is necessary to maintain at all times a one-to-one ratio between the
number of Common Units owned by the Corporation and the aggregate number of
outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock as
contemplated by the first sentence of this _Section 4.3(a)_.

  



  

(b) The Company shall undertake all actions, including an issuance, a
reclassification, distribution, division or recapitalization, with respect to
the Common Units, to maintain at all times a one-to-one ratio between the
number of outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock held by any Person and
the number of Common Units owned by such Person; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company shall not be required to take any action to maintain a one-to-one
ratio of Common Units to outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock following
the exchange of Class B Common Stock as set forth in Section 4.4(b)(vi) of the
Corporation's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as it may be
amended from time to time. In the event the Corporation repurchases Class
B Common Stock in a transaction not contemplated in these Regulations or the
Exchange Agreement, the Manager shall take all actions such that, after
giving effect to all such repurchases, the number of outstanding shares of
Class B Common Stock held by any Person will equal on a one-to-one basis the
number of Common Units owned by such Person. The Company shall not undertake
any subdivision (by any Common Unit split, Common Unit distribution,
reclassification, recapitalization or similar event) or combination (by
reverse Common Unit split, reclassification, recapitalization or similar
event) of the Common Units that is not accompanied by an
identical subdivision or combination of Class B Common Stock to the extent
necessary to maintain at all times a one-to-one ratio between the number of
outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock held by any Person and the number
of Common Units owned by such Person as contemplated by the first sentence of
this _Section 4.3(b)_.

  



   

 | 13| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) The Company shall only be permitted to issue additional Units or other
Equity Securities in the Company to the Persons and on the terms and
conditions provided for in _Section 4.1_ , this _Section 4.3_ , _Section 4.6_
and _Section 4.7_. Subject to the foregoing, the Manager may cause the
Company to issue additional Common Units authorized under these Regulations at
such times and upon such terms as the Manager shall determine and the Manager
shall, and is hereby authorized to, promptly amend these Regulations and the
Schedule of Members attached hereto as necessary in connection with the
issuance of additional Common Units and admission of additional Members under
this _Section 4.3_ without the requirement of any consent or acknowledgement
of any other Member.

  



  

4.4 _Certificates Representing Units; Lost, Stolen or Destroyed
Certificates; Registration and Transfer of Units_.

  



  

(a) Units shall not be certificated unless otherwise determined by the
Manager. If the Manager determines that one or more Units shall
be certificated, each such certificate shall be signed by or in the name of
the Company and any officer designated by the Manager. Such certificate shall
be in such form (and shall contain such legends) as the Manager may determine.
Any or all of such signatures on any certificate representing one or more
Units may be a facsimile, engraved or printed, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law.

  



  

(b) If Units are certificated, the Manager may direct that a new certificate
representing one or more Units be issued in place of any certificate
theretofore issued by the Company alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon delivery to the Manager of an affidavit of the owner or
owners of such certificate, setting forth such allegation. The Manager may
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or such
owner's legal representative, to give the Company a bond sufficient to
indemnity it against any claim that may be made against it on account of the
alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of
any such new certificate.

  



  

(c) Upon surrender to the Company or the transfer agent of the Company, if
any, of a certificate for one or more Units, duly endorsed or accompanied by
appropriate evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer, in
compliance with the provisions hereof, the Company shall issue a new
certificate representing one or more Units to the Person entitled thereto,
cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books. Subject
to the provisions of these Regulations, the Manager may prescribe such
additional rules and regulations as it may deem appropriate relating to the
issue, Transfer and registration of Units.

  



  

4.5 _Purchase or Redemption of Shares of Class A Common Stock_. If, at any
time, any shares of Class A Common Stock are purchased or redeemed by the
Corporation for cash, then the Manager shall cause the Company, immediately
prior to such purchase or redemption of Class A Common Stock, to redeem a
corresponding number of Common Units held by the Corporation, at an aggregate
redemption price equal to the aggregate purchase or redemption price of the
shares of Class A Common Stock being purchased or redeemed by the
Corporation (plus any expenses related thereto) and upon such other terms as
are the same for the shares of Class A Common Stock being purchased or
redeemed by the Corporation.

4.6 _Equity Plans_.

  



  

(a) _Options Granted to Persons other than LLC Employees_. If at any time or
from time to time, in connection with any Equity Plan, a stock option granted
over shares of Class A Common Stock to a Person other than a LLC Employee is
duly exercised:

  



  

(i) the Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after such exercise, make a
Capital Contribution to the Company in an amount equal to the exercise price
paid to the Corporation by such exercising Person in connection with the
exercise of such stock option;

  



  

(ii) notwithstanding the amount of the Capital Contribution actually made
pursuant to _Section 4.6(a)(i)_ , the Corporation shall be deemed to
have contributed to the Company as a Capital Contribution, in lieu of the
Capital Contribution actually made and in consideration of additional Common
Units, an amount equal to the Value of a share of Class A Common Stock as of
the date of such exercise multiplied by the number of shares of Class A
Common Stock then being actually issued by the Corporation in connection with
the exercise of such stock option (disregarding for purposes of this _Section
4.6(a)(ii)_ any shares withheld for tax withholding or in connection with a
cashless exercise). The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that such deemed
Capital Contribution will result in a "revaluation of partnership property"
and corresponding adjustments to Capital Account balances as described in
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f) of the Treasury Regulations; and

  



  

(iii) the Corporation shall receive in exchange for such Capital
Contributions (as deemed made under _Section 4.6(a)(ii)_ ) a
corresponding number of Common Units.

  



  

(b) _Options Granted to LLC Employees_. If at any time or from time to time,
in connection with any Equity Plan, a stock option granted over shares of
Class A Common Stock to a LLC Employee is duly exercised:

  



  

(i) the Corporation shall sell to the Optionee, and the Optionee shall
purchase from the Corporation, for a cash price per share equal to the Value
of a share of Class A Common Stock at the time of exercise, a number of shares
of Class A Common Stock equal to the quotient of (A) the aggregate exercise
price payable by the Optionee in connection with the exercise of such stock
option divided by (B) the Value of a share of Class A Common Stock at the
time of such exercise;

  



  

(ii) the Corporation shall sell to the Company (or if the Optionee is an
employee of, or other service provider to, a Subsidiary, the
Corporation shall sell to such Subsidiary), and the Company (or such
Subsidiary, as applicable) shall purchase from the Corporation, a number of
shares of Class A Common Stock equal to the excess of (A) the number of shares
of Class A Common Stock as to which such stock option is being exercised over
(B) the number of shares of Class A Common Stock sold pursuant to _Section
4.6(b)(i)_. The purchase price per share of Class A Common Stock for such
sale of shares of Class A Common Stock to the Company (or such
Subsidiary) shall be the Value of a share of Class A Common Stock as of the
date of exercise of such stock option;

  



   

 | 15| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iii) the Company shall transfer to the Optionee (or if the Optionee is an
employee of, or other service provider to, a Subsidiary, the Subsidiary shall
transfer to the Optionee) at no additional cost to such LLC Employee and as
additional compensation to such LLC Employee, the number of shares of Class A
Common Stock described in _Section 4.6(b)(ii)_ ; and

  



  

(iv) the Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after such exercise, make
a Capital Contribution to the Company in an amount equal to all proceeds
received (from whatever source, but excluding any payment by the Corporation
in respect of payroll taxes or other withholdings) by the Corporation in
connection with the exercise of such stock option. The Corporation shall
receive for such Capital Contribution, a number of Common Units equal to the
number of shares of Class A Common Stock for which such option was
exercised. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that such Capital
Contribution will result in a "revaluation of partnership property" and
corresponding adjustments to Capital Account balances as described in Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f) of the Treasury Regulations.

  



  

(c) _Stock Issued to LLC Employees_. If, other than as contemplated by
_Section 4.6(a)_ or _4.6(b)_ , at any time or from time to time, in
connection with any Equity Plan, any shares of Class A Common Stock are issued
to a LLC Employee (or his or her Permitted Transferee, if applicable)
(including any shares of Class A Common Stock that are subject to forfeiture
in the event such LLC Employee terminates his or her employment with the
Company or any Subsidiary) in consideration for services performed for the
Company or any Subsidiary:

  



  

(i) the Corporation shall issue such number of shares of Class A Common Stock
as are to be issued to such LLC Employee (or his or her Permitted Transferee,
if applicable) in accordance with the Equity Plan;

  



  

(ii) on the date (such date, the " _Vesting Date_ ") that the Value of such
shares is included in the taxable income of such LLC Employee, the following
events will be deemed to have occurred: (A) the Corporation shall be deemed to
have sold such shares of Class A Common Stock to the Company (or if such LLC
Employee is an employee of, or other service provider to, a Subsidiary, to
such Subsidiary) for a purchase price equal to the Value of such shares of
Class A Common Stock, (B) the Company (or such Subsidiary) shall be deemed to
have delivered such shares of Class A Common Stock to such LLC Employee (or
his or her Permitted Transferee, if applicable), (C) the Corporation shall be
deemed to have contributed the purchase price for such shares of Class A
Common Stock to the Company as a Capital Contribution, and (D) in the case
where such LLC Employee is an employee of a Subsidiary, the Company shall be
deemed to have contributed such amount to the capital of the Subsidiary; and

  



  

(iii) the Company shall issue to the Corporation on the Vesting Date a number
of Common Units equal to the number of shares of Class A Common Stock issued
under _Section 4.6(c)(i)_ (disregarding for purposes of this _Section
4.6(c)(iii)_ any shares withheld for tax withholding) in consideration for a
Capital Contribution that shall be deemed to have been contributed to the
Company by the Corporation in an amount equal to the product of (A) the
number of such newly issued Common Units multiplied by (B) the Value of a
share of Class A Common Stock.

  



   

 | 16| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) _Future Stock Incentive Plans_. Nothing in these Regulations shall be
construed or applied to preclude or restrain the Corporation from adopting,
modifying or terminating stock incentive plans for the benefit of employees,
directors or other business associates of the Corporation, the Company or any
of their respective Affiliates. The Members acknowledge and agree that, in the
event that any such plan is adopted, modified or terminated by the
Corporation, amendments to this _Section 4.6_ may become necessary
or advisable and that any approval or consent to any such amendments
requested by the Corporation shall be deemed granted by the Manager without
the requirement of any further consent or acknowledgement of any other Member.

  



  

(e) _Anti-dilution adjustments._ For all purposes of this _Section 4.6_ ,
the number of shares of Class A Common Stock and the corresponding number of
Common Units shall be determined after giving effect to all anti-dilution or
similar adjustments that are applicable, as of the date of exercise or
vesting, to the option, warrant, restricted stock or other equity interest
that is being exercised or becomes vested under the applicable Equity Plan
and applicable award or grant documentation.

  



  

4.7 _Dividend Reinvestment Plan, Cash Option Purchase Plan, Stock Incentive
Plan or Other Plan_. Except as may otherwise be provided in this _Article IV_
, all amounts received or deemed received by the Corporation in respect of any
dividend reinvestment plan, cash option purchase plan, stock incentive or
other stock or subscription plan or agreement, either (a) shall be utilized by
the Corporation to effect open market purchases of shares of Class A Common
Stock, or (b) if the Corporation elects instead to issue new shares of Class
A Common Stock with respect to such amounts, shall be contributed by the
Corporation to the Company in exchange for additional Common Units. Upon such
contribution, the Company will issue to the Corporation a number of Common
Units equal to the number of new shares of Class A Common Stock so issued.

  



  

ARTICLE V 
 DISTRIBUTIONS

  



  

5.1 _Distributions_.

  



  

(a) _Distributable Cash; Other Distributions_. To the extent permitted by
applicable Law and hereunder, Distributions to Members may be declared by the
Manager out of Distributable Cash or other funds or property legally available
therefor in such amounts and on such terms (including the payment dates of
such Distributions) as the Manager shall determine using such record date as
the Manager may designate; such Distributions shall be made to the Members as
of the close of business on such record date on a pro rata basis in
accordance with each Member's Percentage Interest as of the close of business
on such record date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Manager shall have the
obligation to make Distributions as set forth in _Section 10.2_ ; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary,
no Distributions shall be made to any Member to the extent such Distributions
would violate TBOC. Promptly following the designation of a record date and
the declaration of a Distribution pursuant to this _Section 5.1(a)_ , the
Manager shall give notice to each Member of the record date, the amount and
the terms of the Distribution and the payment date thereof. In furtherance of
the foregoing, it is intended that the Manager shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law and hereunder, have the right in its sole discretion to make
Distributions to the Members pursuant to this _Section 5.1(a)_ in such
amounts as shall enable the Corporation to pay dividends or to meet its
obligations, including its obligations pursuant to the Tax Receivable
Agreement (to the extent such obligations are not otherwise able to be
satisfied as a result of Tax Distributions made pursuant to _Section 5.1(b)_
).

  



   

 | 17| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) _Tax Distributions_. Notwithstanding _Section 5.1(a)_ , to the extent
funds of the Company may be available for distribution by the Company (as
determined by the Manager in its sole discretion), with respect to each Fiscal
Year, the Company shall distribute to each Member an amount of cash (a " _Tax
Distribution_ ") equal to (i) the aggregate taxable income of the Company
for the Fiscal Year allocated under this Agreement with respect to the Units
held by such Member (with taxable income reflecting, without limitation,
adjustments under Sections 704(c), 734 and 743 of the Code and net of taxable
losses of the Company allocated in respect of prior Fiscal Years and not
previously taken into account under this clause), _multiplied by_ (ii)
the Applicable Tax Rate; _provided_ , _however_ , unless otherwise determined
by the Manager in its sole discretion, the amount of the Tax Distribution
distributable to the Corporation shall not be less than an amount that will
enable the Corporation to satisfy its tax obligations and its obligations
pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement (in each case as determined by the
Manager in its sole discretion) for the relevant Fiscal Year (subject to
sufficient funds available for distribution); _provided further_ , that the
amount of Tax Distributions made with respect to the Units (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, includes the amount that will enable the Corporation to
satisfy its obligations pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement, if
applicable) shall be the same for every Unit and shall be equal to the
highest amount that any Member would otherwise be entitled to receive on a per
Unit basis under this _Section 5.1(b)_. The Company shall, subject to the
availability of cash, make advance distributions to the Members of their
respective Tax Distributions on a quarterly basis based upon estimates of the
required Tax Distributions in a manner sufficient to permit the Members to
apply such advances toward their quarterly estimated tax payment obligations.
If the Manager determines there are insufficient funds available to pay the
Tax Distributions in full, then Tax Distributions shall be made to each
Member on a pro rata basis, with each Unit receiving the same amount on a per
Unit basis. To the extent that any holders of Units have not received Tax
Distributions in full under this _Section 5.1(b)_ , such unpaid amounts shall
carryforward and shall be distributed in future periods as Tax Distributions
under this Section. Tax Distributions shall be treated as advances of any
amounts holders of Units are entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 5.1(a)_
and _Article X_. For the avoidance of doubt, unless the Manager specifies
that a distribution is not a Tax Distribution pursuant to this _Section
5.1(b)_ , each Distribution with respect to a Unit shall be treated as a Tax
Distribution.

  



  

5.2 _Restricted Distributions_. Notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary contained in these Regulations, the Company shall not make any
Distribution to any Member on account of any Company Interest to the extent
such Distribution would render the Company insolvent, violate any applicable
Law or violate the terms of the Credit Agreement or result in a default (or an
event that, with notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default) thereunder.

ARTICLE VI 
 CAPITAL ACCOUNTS; ALLOCATIONS; TAX MATTERS

  



  

6.1 _Capital Accounts_.

  



  

(a) The Company shall maintain a separate Capital Account for each Member
according to the rules of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv). For
this purpose, the Company may (in the discretion of the Manager), upon the
occurrence of the events specified in Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f), increase or decrease the Capital Accounts in accordance
with the rules of such Treasury Regulation and Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(g) to reflect a revaluation of Company property.

  



  

(b) For purposes of computing the amount of any item of Company income, gain,
loss or deduction to be allocated pursuant to this _Article VI_ and to be
reflected in the Capital Accounts of the Members, the determination,
recognition and classification of any such item shall be the same as its
determination, recognition and classification for U.S. federal income tax
purposes (including any method of depreciation, cost recovery or amortization
used for this purpose); _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that:

  



  

(i) The computation of all items of income, gain, loss and deduction shall
include those items described in Code Section 705(a)(l)(B) or Code Section
705(a)(2)(B) and Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(i), without
regard to the fact that such items are not includable in gross income or are
not deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

  



  

(ii) If the Book Value of any Company property is adjusted pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(e) or Treasury
Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f), the amount of such adjustment shall
be taken into account as gain or loss from the disposition of such property.

  



  

(iii) Items of income, gain, loss or deduction attributable to the
disposition of Company property having a Book Value that differs from
its adjusted basis for tax purposes shall be computed by reference to the
Book Value of such property.

  



  

(iv) Items of depreciation, amortization and other cost recovery deductions
with respect to Company property having a Book Value that differs from its
adjusted basis for tax purposes shall be computed by reference to the
property's Book Value in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(g).

  



  

(v) To the extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any Company
asset pursuant to Code Sections 732(d), 734(b) or 743(b) is
required, pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be
taken into account in determining Capital Accounts, the amount of such
adjustment to the Capital Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain (if the
adjustment increases the basis of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment
decreases such basis).

  



  

6.2 _Allocations_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section 6.3_ and
_Section 6.4_ , Net Profits and Net Losses for any Allocation Period shall be
allocated among the Capital Accounts of the Members pro rata in accordance
with their respective Percentage Interests.

  



   

 | 19| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

6.3 _Regulatory Allocations_.

  



  

(a) Losses attributable to partner nonrecourse debt (as defined in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.704-2(b)(4)) shall be allocated in the manner required
by Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i). If there is a net decrease during
an Allocation Period in partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain (as defined in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(3)), Profits for such Allocation Period
(and, if necessary, for subsequent Allocation Periods) shall be allocated to
the Members in the amounts and of such character as determined according to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(4).

  



  

(b) Nonrecourse deductions (as determined according to Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-2(b)(1)) for any Allocation Period shall be allocated pro rata
among the Members in accordance with their Percentage Interests. Except as
otherwise provided in _Section 6.3(a)_ , if there is a net decrease in the
Minimum Gain during any Allocation Period, each Member shall be allocated
Profits for such Allocation Period (and, if necessary, for subsequent
Allocation Periods) in the amounts and of such character as determined
according to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(f). This _Section 6.3(b)_ is
intended to be a minimum gain chargeback provision that complies with the
requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(f), and shall be
interpreted in a manner consistent therewith.

  



  

(c) If any Member that unexpectedly receives an adjustment, allocation or
Distribution described in Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) and (6) has an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit
as of the end of any Allocation Period, computed after the application of
_Sections 6.3(a)_ and _6.3(b)_ but before the application of any other
provision of this _Article VI_ , then Profits for such Allocation Period
shall be allocated to such Member in proportion to, and to the extent of, such
Adjusted Capital Account Deficit. This _Section 6.3(c)_ is intended to be a
qualified income offset provision as described in Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and shall be interpreted in a manner consistent
therewith.

  



  

(d) If the allocation of Net Loss to a Member as provided in _Section 6.2_
would create or increase an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit, there shall be
allocated to such Member only that amount of Loss as will not create or
increase an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit. The Net Losses that would,
absent the application of the preceding sentence, otherwise be allocated to
such Member shall be allocated to the other Members in accordance with their
relative Percentage Interests, subject to this _Section 6.3(d)_.

  



  

(e) Profits and Losses described in _Section 6.1(b)(v)_ shall be allocated in
a manner consistent with the manner that the adjustments to the Capital
Accounts are required to be made pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv).

  



   

 | 20| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(f) The allocations set forth in _Section 6.3(a)_ through and including
_Section 6.3(e)_ (the " _Regulatory Allocations_ ") are intended to comply
with certain requirements of Sections 1.704-1(b) and 1.704-2 of the Treasury
Regulations. The Regulatory Allocations may not be consistent with the manner
in which the Members intend to allocate Profits and Losses of the Company
or make Distributions. Accordingly, notwithstanding the other provisions of
this _Article VI_ , but subject to the Regulatory Allocations, income, gain,
deduction and loss shall be reallocated among the Members so as to eliminate
the effect of the Regulatory Allocations (taking into consideration any
future Regulatory Allocations that are reasonably expected to be made to
offset prior Regulatory Allocations) and thereby cause the respective Capital
Accounts of the Members to be in the amounts (or as close thereto as
possible) they would have been if Profits and Losses (and such other items of
income, gain, deduction and loss) had been allocated without reference to the
Regulatory Allocations. In general, the Members anticipate that this will be
accomplished by specially allocating other Profits and Losses (and such other
items of income, gain, deduction and loss) among the Members so that the
net amount of the Regulatory Allocations and such special allocations to each
such Member is zero. In addition, if in any Allocation Period there is a
decrease in partnership minimum gain, or in partner nonrecourse debt minimum
gain, and application of the minimum gain chargeback requirements set forth
in _Section 6.3(a)_ or _Section 6.3(b)_ would cause a distortion in the
economic arrangement among the Members, the Members may, if they do not
expect that the Company will have sufficient other income to correct such
distortion, request the Internal Revenue Service to waive either or both of
such minimum gain chargeback requirements. If such request is granted, these
Regulations shall be applied in such instance as if it did not contain such
minimum gain chargeback requirement.

  



  

6.4 _Final Allocations_. Notwithstanding any contrary provision in these
Regulations except _Section 6.3_ , the Manager shall make appropriate
adjustments to allocations of Profits and Losses to (or, if necessary,
allocate items of gross income, gain, loss or deduction of the Company among)
the Members upon the liquidation of the Company (within the meaning of Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g) of the Treasury Regulations), the transfer of
substantially all the Units (whether by sale or exchange or merger) or sale of
all or substantially all the assets of the Company, such that, to the maximum
extent possible, the Capital Accounts of the Members are proportionate to
their Percentage Interests. In each case, such adjustments or allocations
shall occur, to the maximum extent possible, in the Allocation Period of the
event requiring such adjustments or allocations.

  



  

6.5 _Tax Allocations_.

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise provided in the remainder of this _Section 6.5_ , the
income, gains, losses, deductions and credits of the Company will be
allocated, for federal, state and local income tax purposes, among the Members
in accordance with the allocation of such income, gains, losses, deductions
and credits among the Members for computing their Capital Accounts; _provided_
, that if any such allocation is not permitted by the Code or other
applicable Law, the Company's subsequent income, gains, losses, deductions
and credits will be allocated among the Members so as to reflect as nearly as
possible the allocation set forth herein in computing their Capital Accounts.

  



  

(b) Items of Company taxable income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to
any property contributed to the capital of the Company shall be allocated
among the Members in accordance with Code Section 704(c) so as to take account
of any variation between the adjusted basis of such property to the Company
for federal income tax purposes and its Book Value (" _704(c) allocations_
") using the "traditional method" as described in Treasury Regulations
Section 1.704-3(b), or any other reasonable method described in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-3 so as to minimize to the maximum extent possible
the Tax Distributions made pursuant to _Section 5.1(b)_ , as determined by
the Manager.

  



   

 | 21| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) If the Book Value of any Company asset is adjusted pursuant to _Section
5.1(b)_ , subsequent allocations of items of taxable income, gain, loss and
deduction with respect to such asset shall take account of any variation
between the adjusted basis of such asset for federal income tax purposes and
its Book Value in the same manner as under Code Section 704(c) (" _reverse
704(c) allocations_ ") using the "traditional method" as described in
Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-3(b), or any other reasonable method
described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-3 so as to minimize to the
maximum extent possible the Tax Distributions made pursuant to _Section
5.1(b)_ , as determined by the Manager.

  



  

(d) Allocations of tax credits, tax credit recapture, and any items related
thereto shall be allocated to the Members pro rata as determined by the
Manager taking into account the principles of Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(4)(ii).

  



  

(e) Each Member's pro rata share of the Company's "excess nonrecourse
liabilities" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.752-3(a)(3)
shall be determined under any reasonable method selected by the Manager.

  



  

(f) Allocations pursuant to this _Section 6.5_ are solely for purposes of
federal, state and local taxes and shall not affect, or in any way be taken
into account in computing, any Member's Capital Account or share of Profits,
Losses, Distributions or other Company items pursuant to any provision of
these Regulations.

  



  

6.6 _Combined Reporting_. If Texas Law requires any Member (or an Affiliate
thereof) and the Company to participate in the filing of a combined group
report for Texas franchise tax purposes, such Member (or an Affiliate thereof)
shall cause one of the members of the combined group other than the Company
to be the reporting entity and pay the Texas franchise tax liability due in
connection with such combined report. The Company's Texas franchise tax
liability shall be equal to the amount of the Texas franchise tax that the
Company would have paid if it had computed its Texas franchise tax liability
for the reporting period on a separate entity basis (rather than as a member
of the combined group). The Company shall bear all costs related to such
separate entity Texas franchise tax computation. The Members agree that the
Company shall no later than five business days prior to the due date of any
estimated or final Texas franchise tax report, pay such Member (or an
Affiliate thereof) the Texas franchise tax determined as owed under such
separate entity Texas franchise tax computation. Except as provided in this
_Section 6.6_ with respect to the amount of such combined group's Texas
franchise tax that the Company is required to pay any such Member (or an
Affiliate thereof), such Member (or an Affiliate thereof) shall indemnify and
hold the Company harmless from and against any and all Texas franchise tax of
such combined group that is imposed on the Company.

  



  

6.7 _Preparation of Tax Returns_. The Manager shall arrange for the
preparation and timely filing of all tax returns required to be filed by the
Company. No later than five days before the due date for quarterly federal
estimated income tax payments, the Company shall send to each Person who was
a Member at any time during the prior quarter, an estimate of such Member's
state tax apportionment information and allocations to the Members of taxable
income, gains, losses, deductions and credits for the prior quarter,
which estimate shall have been reviewed by the Company's outside tax
accountants. In addition, no later than the earlier of (i) March 15 following
the end of the prior Fiscal Year, and (ii) thirty (30) Business Days after the
issuance of the final financial statement report for a Fiscal Year by the
Company's auditors, or as soon as commercially practicable thereafter, the
Company shall send to each Person who was a Member at any time during such
Fiscal Year, a statement showing such Member's final state tax apportionment
information and allocations to the Members of taxable income, gains, losses,
deductions and credits for such Fiscal Year and a completed IRS Schedule K-1.
Each Member shall notify the Company upon receipt of any notice of tax
examination of the Company by federal, state or local authorities. The
Manager shall have the authority to prepare the tax returns of the
Company using such permissible methods and elections as it determines in its
reasonable discretion, including the use of any permissible method under
Section 706 of the Code for purposes of determining the varying Company
Interests of its Members ( _provided_ _, _ _however_ , that, in respect of
the acquisition of Corporation's acquisition of Company Interests on the
Effective Date pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, the Company shall use
the interim closing method and the calendar day convention pursuant to
Treasury Regulation 1.706-4).

  



   

 | 22| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

6.8 _Tax Elections_. The taxable year of the Company (the _" Taxable Year"_)
shall be the Fiscal Year set forth in _Section 2.8_ or such other accounting
period as the Company may be required to utilize as its taxable year
pursuant to the Code and the Treasury Regulations. The Company and any
eligible Subsidiary shall make an election pursuant to Section 754 of the
Code and shall not thereafter revoke such election. Each Member will upon
request supply any information reasonably necessary to give proper effect to
any such elections. The Company shall not make any election to be an
association taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes
(including by filing any US Internal Revenue Service Form 8832 that would
cause the Company to be taxed as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes).

  



  

6.9 _Tax Controversies_.

  



  

(a) The Manager shall be the "partnership representative" (within the meaning
given to such term in Section 6223 of the Code) (the " _Partnership
Representative_ ") and, as such, (i) shall be authorized to designate any
other Person selected by the Manager as the partnership representative and
(ii) shall be authorized and required to represent the Company (at the
Company's expense) in connection with all examinations of the Company's
affairs by tax authorities, including resulting administrative and judicial
proceedings, and to expend the Company's funds for professional services and
reasonably incurred in connection therewith. Each Member agrees to reasonably
cooperate with the Company and to do or refrain from doing any or all things
reasonably requested by the Company with respect to the conduct of such
proceedings.

  



  

(b) In the event of an audit by the Internal Revenue Service, the Partnership
Representative shall be permitted, with the consent of the Manager, to make
on a timely basis, to the extent permissible under applicable Law, the
election provided by Section 6226(a) of the Code to treat a "partnership
adjustment" as an adjustment to be taken into account by each Member in
accordance with Section 6226(b) of the Code. If the election under Section
6226(a) of the of the Code is made, the Partnership Representative shall
furnish to each Member for the year under audit a statement reflecting the
Member's share of the adjusted items as determined in the notice of final
partnership adjustment, and each such Member shall take such adjustment into
account as required under Section 6226(b) of the Code and shall be liable for
any related tax, interest, penalty, addition to tax, or additional
amounts. If an election under Section 6226(a) of the Code is not made, the
Partnership Representative shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
minimize the financial burden of any "imputed underpayment" (as determined
under Section 6225 of the Code) to each Member, through the application of
the procedures established pursuant to Section 6225(c) of the Code.

  



   

 | 23| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) In the event of an audit by the Internal Revenue Service, if the
Partnership Representative does not make the election provided by Section
6226(a) of the Code as noted above, the Partnership Representative shall
allocate the burden of any taxes (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
"imputed underpayment" within the meaning of Section 6225 of the Code),
penalties, interest and related expenses imposed on the Company among the
Members to whom such amounts are attributable (whether as a result of
their status, actions, inactions or otherwise), as reasonably determined by
the Partnership Representative, and each Member shall promptly reimburse the
Company in full for the entire amount the Partnership Representative
determines to be attributable to such Member;  _provided_ that the Company
will also be allowed to recover any amount due from such Member pursuant to
this sentence from any distribution otherwise payable to such Member pursuant
to this Agreement. Solely for purposes of determining the current
Member(s) to which any taxes or other amounts are attributable under this
provision, references to any Member in this _Section 6.9(c)_  shall include a
reference to each Person that previously held the Units currently held by such
Member (but only to the extent of such Person's interest in such Units).

  



  

(d) In the event of an audit by the Internal Revenue Service, the Partnership
Representative shall (i) keep the Member Tax Rep reasonably informed of any
administrative or judicial income tax proceeding relevant to any adjustment or
proposed adjustment at the Company level of the Company items and (ii) use
its commercially reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the Member
Tax Rep prior to submitting any material written filings or submissions in
connection with an income tax audit of the Company.

  



  

(e) The Partnership Representative is authorized to, and shall follow
principles (to the extent available) similar to those set forth in  _Section
6.9(b)_ and _Section 6.9(c)_ with respect to any audits by state, local, or
foreign tax authorities and any tax liabilities that result therefrom.

  



  

(f) The provisions contained in this _Section 6.9_ shall survive the
dissolution of the Company and the withdrawal of any Member or the Transfer
of any Member's interest in the Company and shall apply to any current or
former Member.

  



  

ARTICLE VII 
 Restrictions on transfer of units

  



  

7.1 _Restrictions on Transfer_. No holder of Units may Transfer any interest
in any Units, except Transfers (a) pursuant to and in accordance with
_Section 7.2_ or (b) approved in writing by the Manager. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, "Transfer" shall not include an event that terminates the
existence of a Member for income tax purposes (including a change in entity
classification of a Member under Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-3, a
sale of assets by, or liquidation of, a Member pursuant to an election under
Code Sections 336 or 338, or a merger, severance, or allocation within a trust
or among sub-trusts of a trust that is a Member), but that does not terminate
the existence of such Member under applicable state law (or, in the case of a
trust that is a Member, does not terminate the trusteeship of the fiduciaries
under such trust with respect to all the Company Interests of such trust that
is a Member); _provided_ , _however_ , that this sentence shall not apply for
purposes of applying _Section 7.7(b)(iv)_ ,  _Section 7.7(b)(vi)_ or _Section
7.7(b)(vii)_.

  



   

 | 24| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

7.2 _Permitted Transfers_. The restrictions contained in _Section 7.1_ shall
not apply to any Transfer (each, a " _Permitted Transfer_ ") in connection
with: (a)(i) an "Exchange" pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement
(as defined therein) or (ii) a Transfer by a Member to the Corporation or any
of its Subsidiaries; (b) by any Continuing Member, a Transfer by such
Continuing Member to such Continuing Member's spouse, any lineal ascendants or
descendants or trusts or other entities in which such Continuing Member or
Continuing Member's spouse, lineal ascendants or descendants are the
sole beneficial owners; (c) by the Manager to the extent required by the
terms of the Credit Agreement; or (d) a Transfer to a partner, shareholder,
member or Affiliate of such Member (which may include special purpose
investment vehicles wholly owned by one or more Affiliated investment funds
but shall not include portfolio companies); _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that
(A) the restrictions contained in these Regulations will continue to apply to
Units after any Permitted Transfer of such Units, and (B) in the case of the
foregoing clauses (b), (c) and (d), the Permitted Transferees of the Units so
Transferred shall agree in writing to be bound by the provisions of these
Regulations and, the transferor will deliver a written notice to the Company
and the Members, which notice will disclose in reasonable detail the identity
of the proposed transferee. In the case of a Permitted Transfer of any
Common Units, the transferring Member shall be required to transfer an equal
number of shares of Class B Common Stock corresponding to the proportion of
such Member's Common Units that were transferred in the transaction to such
Permitted Transferee. All Permitted Transfers are subject to the additional
limitations set forth in _Section 7.7(b)_.

  



  

7.3 _Restricted Units Legend_. The Units have not been registered under the
Securities Act and, therefore, in addition to the other restrictions on
Transfer contained in these Regulations, cannot be sold unless subsequently
registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is
then available. To the extent such Units have been certificated, each
certificate evidencing Units and each certificate issued in exchange for or
upon the Transfer of any Units (if such securities remain Units as defined
herein after such Transfer) shall be stamped or otherwise imprinted with a
legend in substantially the following form (or such other form as shall be
approved by the Manager):

  



  

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED
UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "ACT"), AND MAY NOT BE SOLD
OR TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE
ACT OR AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION THEREUNDER. THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED
BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER
SPECIFIED IN THE THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED REGULATIONS OF STRIKE CAPITAL,
LLC, AS MAY BE AMENDED AND MODIFIED FROM TIME TO TIME AND THE EXCHANGE
AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO AMONG STRIKE CAPITAL, LLC, STRIKE, INC. AND THE HOLDER
OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE, AND STRIKE CAPITAL, LLC
RESERVES THE RIGHT TO REFUSE THE TRANSFER OF SUCH SECURITIES UNTIL SUCH
CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN FULFILLED WITH RESPECT TO ANY TRANSFER. A COPY OF SUCH
CONDITIONS SHALL BE FURNISHED BY STRIKE CAPITAL, LLC TO THE HOLDER HEREOF UPON
WRITTEN REQUEST AND WITHOUT CHARGE."

  



   

 | 25| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

7.4 _Transfer_. Prior to Transferring any Units (other than pursuant to an
"Exchange" pursuant to the Exchange Agreement), the Transferring holder of
Units shall cause the prospective transferee to be bound by these Regulations
as provided in _Section 7.2_ and any other agreements executed by the holders
of Units and relating to such Units in the aggregate, including the
Registration Rights Agreement and the Exchange Agreement if applicable
(collectively, the " _Other Agreements_ "), and shall cause the prospective
transferee to execute and deliver to the Company and the other holders of
Units counterparts of this Regulations and any applicable Other Agreements.
Any Transfer or attempted Transfer of any Units in violation of any provision
of these Regulations (including any indirect Transfers) (a) shall be void,
and (b) the Company shall not record such Transfer on its books or treat any
purported transferee of such Units as the owner of such securities for any
purpose.

  



  

7.5 _Assignee 's Rights_.

  



  

(a) The Transfer of a Company Interest in accordance with these Regulations
shall be effective as of the date of its assignment (assuming compliance with
all of the conditions to such Transfer set forth herein), and such Transfer
shall be shown on the books and records of the Company. Profits and Losses
and other Company items shall be allocated between the transferor and the
Assignee according to Code Section 706, using any permissible method as
determined in the reasonable discretion of the Manager. Distributions
made before the effective date of such Transfer shall be paid to the
transferor, and Distributions made after such date shall be paid to the
Assignee.

  



  

(b) Unless and until an Assignee becomes a Member pursuant to _Section 3.5_ ,
the Assignee shall not be entitled to any of the rights granted to a Member
hereunder or under applicable Law, other than the rights granted specifically
to Assignees pursuant to these Regulations; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that,
without relieving the transferring Member from any such limitations or
obligations as more fully described in _Section 7.6_ , such Assignee shall be
bound by any limitations and obligations of a Member contained herein that a
Member would be bound on account of the Assignee's Company Interest (including
the obligation to make Capital Contributions on account of such Company
Interest).

  



  

7.6 _Assignor 's Rights and Obligations_. Any Member who shall Transfer any
Company Interest in accordance with these Regulations shall cease to be a
Member with respect to such Units or other Company Interest and shall no
longer have any rights or privileges, or, except as set forth in this
_Section 7.6_ , duties, liabilities or obligations, of a Member with respect
to such Units or other Company Interest (it being understood, however, that
the applicable provisions of _Sections 8.8_ and _9.4_ shall continue to inure
to such Person's benefit), except that unless and until the Assignee (if not
already a Member) is admitted as a Substituted Member in accordance with
_Section 3.4_ (the " _Admission Date_ "), (a) such assigning Member shall
retain all of the duties, liabilities and obligations of a Member with respect
to such Units or other interest, and (b) the Manager may, in its sole
discretion, reinstate all or any portion of the rights and privileges of such
Member with respect to such Units or other interest for any period of time
prior to the Admission Date. Nothing contained herein shall relieve any Member
who Transfers any Units or other Company Interest from any liability of such
Member to the Company with respect to such Company Interest that may exist on
the Admission Date or that is otherwise specified in TBOC and incorporated
into these Regulations or for any liability to the Company or any other
Person for any materially false statement made by such Member (in its capacity
as such) or for any present or future breaches of any representations,
warranties or covenants by such Member (in its capacity as such)
contained herein or in the other agreements with the Company.

  



   

 | 26| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

7.7 _Overriding Provisions_.

  



  

(a) Any Transfer in violation of this _Article VII_ shall be null and void
_ab initio_ , and the provisions of _Sections 7.5_  and _7.6_ shall not apply
to any such Transfers. For the avoidance of doubt, any Person to whom a
Transfer is made or attempted in violation of this _Article VII_ shall not
become a Member, shall not be entitled to vote on any matters coming before
the Members and shall not have any other rights in or with respect to any
rights of a Member of the Company. The approval of any Transfer in any one or
more instances shall not limit or waive the requirement for such approval in
any other or future instance. The Manager shall, and is hereby authorized to,
promptly amend these Regulations and the Schedule of Members attached hereto
to reflect any Permitted Transfer pursuant to this _Article VII_ , without
the requirement of any consent or acknowledgement of any other Member.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of _Section 3.4_ , _Section 3.5_ and
_Section 7.1_ , in no event shall any Member Transfer any Units to the extent
such Transfer would:

  



  

(i) result in the violation of the Securities Act, or any other applicable
federal, state or foreign Law;

  



  

(ii) cause an assignment under the Investment Company Act;

  



  

(iii) in the reasonable determination of the Manager, be a violation of or a
default (or an event that, with notice or the lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default) under, or result in an acceleration of any indebtedness
under, any promissory note, mortgage, loan agreement, indenture or similar
instrument or agreement to which the Company or the Manager is a party;
_provided that_  the payee or creditor to whom the Company or the Manager
owes such obligation is not an Affiliate of the Company or the Manager;

  



  

(iv) be a Transfer to a Person who is not legally competent or who has not
achieved his or her majority under applicable Law (excluding trusts for the
benefit of Persons who are not legally competent or who are minors); or

  



  

(v) cause the Company to be treated as a "publicly traded partnership" or to
be taxed as a corporation pursuant to Section 7704 of the Code or successor
provision of the Code.

  



   

 | 27| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

7.8 _Spouses of Members_. Spouses of the Members do not become Members as a
result of such marital relationship. Each spouse of a Member, if applicable,
has executed a Spouse's Agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_
(each a " _Spouse 's Agreement_"). Such Member's non-delivery to the Company
of an executed consent in the form of _Exhibit B_  attached to these
Regulations at any time shall constitute such Member's continuing
representation and warranty that such Member is not legally married as of
such date.

  



  

ARTICLE VIII 
 MANAGEMENT

  



  

8.1 _Authority of the Manager_.

  



  

(a) Except for situations in which the approval of any Member(s) is
specifically required by these Regulations, (i) all management powers over
the business and affairs of the Company shall be exclusively vested in the
Corporation, as the sole manager of the Company (the Corporation, in such
capacity, or any other Person appointed in accordance with _Section 8.4_ , the
" _Manager_ "), and (ii) the Manager shall conduct, direct and exercise full
control over all activities of the Company. The Manager shall be
the "manager" of the Company for the purposes of TBOC. Except as otherwise
expressly provided for herein and subject to the other provisions of these
Regulations, the Members hereby consent to the exercise by the Manager of all
such powers and rights conferred on the Members by TBOC with respect to the
management and control of the Company. Any vacancies in the position of
Manager shall be filled in accordance with _Section 8.4_.

  



  

(b) The day-to-day business and operations of the Company shall be overseen
and implemented by officers of the Company (each, an " _Officer_ " and
collectively, the " _Officers_ "), subject to the limitations imposed by the
Manager. An Officer may, but need not, be a Member. Each Officer shall be
appointed by the Manager and shall hold office until his or her successor
shall be duly designated and shall qualify or until his or her death or until
he or she shall resign or shall have been removed in the manner hereinafter
provided. Any one Person may hold more than one office. Subject to the other
provisions in these Regulations (including in _Section 8.7_ below), the
salaries or other compensation, if any, of the Officers shall be fixed from
time to time by the Manager. The authority and responsibility of the Officers
shall include, but not be limited to, such duties as the Manager may, from
time to time, delegate to them and the carrying out of the Company's business
and affairs on a day-to-day basis. An Officer may also perform one or more
roles as an officer of the Manager. The Manager may remove any Officer from
office at any time, with or without cause. If any vacancy shall occur in any
office, for any reason whatsoever, then the Manager shall have the right to
appoint a new Officer to fill the vacancy.

  



  

(c) The Manager shall have the power and authority to effectuate the sale,
lease, transfer, exchange or other disposition of any, all or substantially
all of the assets of the Company (including the exercise or grant of any
conversion, option, privilege or subscription right or any other right
available in connection with any assets at any time held by the Company) or
the merger, consolidation, reorganization or other combination of the Company
with or into another entity.

  



  

8.2 _Actions of the Manager_. The Manager may act through any Officer or
through any other Person or Persons to whom authority and duties have been
delegated pursuant to _Section 8.7_.

  



   

 | 28| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

8.3 _Resignation; No Removal_. The Manager may resign at any time by giving
written notice to the Members. Unless otherwise specified in the notice, the
resignation shall take effect upon receipt thereof by the Members, and the
acceptance of the resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Members have no right under these Regulations
to remove or replace the Manager.

  



  

8.4 _Vacancies_. Vacancies in the position of Manager occurring for any
reason shall be filled by the Corporation (or, if the Corporation has
ceased to exist without any successor or assign, then by the holders of a
majority in interest of the voting capital stock of the
Corporation immediately prior to such cessation). For the avoidance of doubt,
the Members (other than the Corporation) have no right under these
Regulations to fill any vacancy in the position of Manager.

  



  

8.5 _Transactions Between Company and Manager_. The Manager may cause the
Company to contract and deal with the Manager, or any Affiliate of the
Manager, provided such contracts and dealings are on terms comparable to and
competitive with those available to the Company from others dealing at arm's
length or are approved by the Members holding a majority of the Units then
outstanding. The Members hereby approve each of the contracts or agreements
between or among the Manager, the Company and their respective
Affiliates entered into on or prior to the date hereof.

  



  

8.6 _Reimbursement for Expenses_. The Manager shall not be compensated for
its services as Manager of the Company except as expressly provided in these
Regulations. The Members acknowledge and agree that the Manager's Class A
Common Stock will be publicly traded and therefore the Manager will have
access to the public capital markets and that such status and the services
performed by the Manager will inure to the benefit of the Company and all
Members; therefore, the Manager shall be reimbursed by the Company for any
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred on behalf of or for the benefit of
the Company, including all fees, expenses and costs associated with being a
public company (including public reporting obligations, proxy statements,
stockholder meetings, stock exchange fees, transfer agent fees, SEC and FINRA
filing fees and offering expenses) and maintaining its corporate existence. To
the extent practicable, expenses incurred by the Manager on behalf of or for
the benefit of the Company shall be billed directly to and paid by the
Company and, if and to the extent any reimbursements to the Manager or any of
its Affiliates by the Company pursuant to this _Section 8.6_ constitute gross
income to such Person (as opposed to the repayment of advances made by such
Person on behalf of the Company), such amounts shall be treated as
"guaranteed payments" within the meaning of Code Section 707(c) and shall not
be treated as distributions for purposes of computing the Members' Capital
Accounts.

  



  

8.7 _Delegation of Authority_. The Manager (a) may, from time to time,
delegate to one or more Persons such authority and duties as the Manager may
deem advisable, and (b) may assign titles (including chief executive officer,
chief strategy officer, chief financial officer, chief operating officer,
president, vice president, secretary, assistant secretary, treasurer or
assistant treasurer) and delegate certain authority and duties to such
Persons as the same may be amended, restated or otherwise modified from
time to time. Any number of titles may be held by the same individual. The
salaries or other compensation, if any, of such agents of the Company shall
be fixed from time to time by the Manager, subject to the other provisions in
these Regulations.

  



   

 | 29| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

8.8 _Limitation of Liability of Manager_.

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein or in an agreement entered into by
such Person and the Company, neither the Manager nor any of the Manager's
Affiliates shall be liable to the Company or to any Member that is not the
Manager for any act or omission performed or omitted by the Manager in its
capacity as the sole manager of the Company pursuant to authority granted to
the Manager by these Regulations; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that, except as
otherwise provided herein, such limitation of liability shall not apply to
the extent the act or omission was attributable to the Manager's or its
Affiliates' gross negligence, willful misconduct or knowing violation of Law
or for any present or future breaches of any representations, warranties or
covenants by the Manager or its Affiliates contained herein or in the other
agreements with the Company. The Manager may exercise any of the powers
granted to it by these Regulations and perform any of the duties imposed upon
it hereunder either directly or by or through its agents, and, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, shall not be responsible for any
misconduct or negligence on the part of any such agent (so long as such agent
was selected in good faith and with reasonable care). The Manager shall
be entitled to rely upon the advice of legal counsel, independent public
accountants and other experts, including financial advisors, and any act of
or failure to act by the Manager in good faith reliance on such advice shall
in no event subject the Manager to liability to the Company or any Member
that is not the Manager.

  



  

(b) Whenever these Regulations or any other agreement contemplated herein
provides that the Manager shall act in a manner which is, or provides terms
which are, "fair and reasonable" to the Company or any Member that is not the
Manager, the Manager shall determine such appropriate action or provide such
terms considering, in each case, the relative interests of each party to such
agreement, transaction or situation and the benefits and burdens relating to
such interests, any customary or accepted industry practices, and any
applicable United States generally accepted accounting practices or
principles.

  



  

(c) Whenever in these Regulations or any other agreement contemplated herein,
the Manager is permitted or required to take any action or to make a decision
in its "sole discretion" or "discretion," with "complete discretion" or
under a grant of similar authority or latitude, the Manager shall be entitled
to consider such interests and factors as it desires, including its own
interests, and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, have
no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of or factors
affecting the Company or other Members.

  



  

(d) Whenever in these Regulations the Manager is permitted or required to
take any action or to make a decision in its "good faith" or under another
express standard, the Manager shall act under such express standard and, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, shall not be subject to any other or
different standards imposed by these Regulations or any other agreement
contemplated herein, and, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, so long as the Manager acts in good faith, the resolution, action
or terms so made, taken or provided by the Manager shall not constitute a
breach of these Regulations or any other agreement contemplated herein or
impose liability upon the Manager or any of the Manager's Affiliates.

8.9 _Investment Company Act_. The Manager shall use its reasonable best
efforts to ensure that the Company shall not be subject to registration as an
investment company pursuant to the Investment Company Act.

  



  

8.10 _Outside Activities of the Manager_. The Manager shall not, directly or
indirectly, enter into or conduct any business or operations, other than in
connection with (a) the ownership, acquisition and disposition of Common
Units, (b) the management of the business and affairs of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, (c) the operation of the Manager as a reporting company with a
class (or classes) of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange
Act and listed on a securities exchange, (d) the offering, sale,
syndication, private placement or public offering of stock, bonds, securities
or other interests, (e) financing or refinancing of any type related to the
Company, its Subsidiaries or their assets or activities, and (f) such
activities as are incidental to the foregoing; _provided_ _, _ _however_ ,
that, except as otherwise provided herein, the net proceeds of any financing
raised by the Manager pursuant to the preceding clauses (d) and (e) shall be
made available to the Company, whether as Capital Contributions, loans or
otherwise, as appropriate, and, _provided further_ , that the Manager may, in
its sole and absolute discretion, from time to time hold or acquire assets in
its own name or otherwise other than through the Company and its Subsidiaries
so long as the Manager takes commercially reasonable measures to ensure that
the economic benefits and burdens of such assets are otherwise vested in the
Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries, through assignment, mortgage loan
or otherwise or, if it is not commercially reasonable to vest such economic
interests in the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Members shall
negotiate in good faith to amend these Regulations to reflect such activities
and the direct ownership of assets by the Manager. Nothing contained herein
shall be deemed to prohibit the Manager from executing any guarantee of
indebtedness of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

  



  

8.11 _Management of Strike, LLC and its Subsidiaries_. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Manager shall, on behalf of the Company as the sole managing
member of Strike, LLC and its Subsidiaries, have the full power and authority
to do, and to direct or delegate to the Officers to do, all things and on
such terms as it determines to be necessary or appropriate to conduct the
business of Strike, LLC and its Subsidiaries, in the same manner as with
respect to the Company.

  



  

ARTICLE IX 
 rights and obligations of members

  



  

9.1 _Limitation of Liability and Duties of Members_.

  



  

(a) Except as specifically provided in these Regulations or in TBOC, no
Member (including the Manager) shall be obligated personally for any debt,
obligation or liability solely by reason of being a Member or acting as the
Manager of the Company. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, the failure of the Company to observe any formalities or
requirements relating to the exercise of its powers or management of its
business and affairs under these Regulations or TBOC shall not be grounds for
imposing personal liability on the Members for liabilities of the Company.

  



   

 | 31| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) In accordance with TBOC and the Laws of the State of Texas, a Member may,
under certain circumstances, be required to return amounts previously
distributed to such Member. It is the intent of the Members that no
Distribution to any Member pursuant to _Article V_ or _Article X_ shall be
deemed to be a return of money or other property paid or a distribution
distributed in violation of TBOC. The making of any such Distribution to a
Member shall be deemed to be approved upon by unanimous consent of the
Members, and, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any Member receiving
any such money or property shall not be required to return any such money or
property to the Company or any other Person. However, if any court of
competent jurisdiction holds that, notwithstanding the provisions of these
Regulations, any Member is obligated to make any such payment, such obligation
shall be the obligation of such Member and not of any other Member.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of these Regulations (subject to
_Section 8.8_ with respect to the Manager), to the extent that, at law or in
equity, any Member (or such Member's Affiliate or any manager, managing
member, general partner, director, officer, employee, agent, fiduciary or
trustee of such Member or of any Affiliate of such Member (each Person
described in this parenthetical, a " _Related Person_ ")) has duties
(including fiduciary duties) to the Company, to the Manager, to
another Member, to any Person who acquires an interest in a Company Interest
or to any other Person bound by these Regulations, all such duties (including
fiduciary duties) are hereby eliminated, to the fullest extent permitted by
Law, and replaced with the duties or standards expressly set forth herein, if
any; _provided_ , _further_ , the Members and the Company hereby waive
any and all fiduciary duties that, absent such waiver, may be established or
implied by TBOC or any applicable Law by the Manager to the Members and the
Company, and in doing so, acknowledge and agree that the duties and
obligations of the Manager to the Members and the Company are only as
expressly set forth in this Agreement. The elimination of duties (including
fiduciary duties) to the Company, the Manager, each of the Members, each
other Person who acquires an interest in a Company Interest and each other
Person bound by these Regulations and replacement thereof with the duties or
standards expressly set forth herein, if any, are approved by the Company,
the Manager, each of the Members, each other Person who acquires an interest
in a Company Interest and each other Person bound by these Regulations.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding any duty (including any fiduciary duty) otherwise
applicable at law or in equity, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or
any analogous doctrine, will not apply to any Member (including the
Corporation in its capacity as a Member or as Manager) or to any Related
Person of such Member, and no Member (or any Related Person of such Member)
that acquires knowledge of a potential transaction, agreement, arrangement or
other matter that may be an opportunity for the Company or the Members will
have any duty to communicate or offer such opportunity to the Company or the
Members, or to develop any particular investment, and such Person will not be
liable to the Company or the Members for breach of any fiduciary or other
duty (other than any fiduciary owed by such Person to the Corporation) by
reason of the fact that such Person pursues or acquires for, or directs such
opportunity to, another Person or does not communicate such investment
opportunity to the Members. Notwithstanding any duty (including any fiduciary
duty (other than any fiduciary duty owed to the Corporation)) otherwise
applicable at law or in equity, neither the Company nor any Member has any
rights or obligations by virtue of these Regulations or the relationship
created hereby in or to such independent ventures or the income or profits
or losses derived therefrom, and the pursuit of any such ventures outside the
Company, even if competitive with the activities of the Company or the
Members, will not be deemed wrongful or improper.

  



   

 | 32| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

9.2 _Lack of Authority_. No Member, other than the Manager or a duly
appointed Officer, in each case in its capacity as such, has the authority or
power to act for or on behalf of the Company, to do any act that would be
binding on the Company or to make any expenditure on behalf of the Company.
The Members hereby consent to the exercise by the Manager of the powers
conferred on them by Law and these Regulations.

  



  

9.3 _No Right of Partition_. No Member, other than the Manager, shall have
the right to seek or obtain partition by court decree or operation of Law of
any Company property, or the right to own or use particular or individual
assets of the Company.

  



  

9.4 _Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) The Company hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any Person (each
an " _Indemnified Person_ ") to the fullest extent permitted under TBOC, as
the same now exists or may hereafter be amended, substituted or replaced (but,
in the case of any such amendment, substitution or replacement only to the
extent that such amendment, substitution or replacement permits the Company
to provide broader indemnification rights than the Company is providing
immediately prior to such amendment), against all loss, liability, claim,
damage, judgment, actions, other expenses whatsoever (including attorneys'
fees, judgments, fines, excise taxes or penalties) (the " _Liabilities_ ")
reasonably incurred or suffered by such Person (or one or more of such
Person's Affiliates) by reason of the fact that such Person is or was a Member
or is or was serving as the Manager, Partnership Representative, Officer,
employee or other agent of the Company or is or was serving at the request of
the Company as a manager, partnership representative, officer, director,
principal, member, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, limited liability company, trust or other enterprise;
_provided_ _,_ _however_ , that no Indemnified Person shall be indemnified
for any Liabilities suffered that are attributable to such Indemnified
Person's or its Affiliates' gross negligence, willful misconduct or knowing
violation of Law or for any present or future breaches of any
representations, warranties or covenants by such Indemnified Person or its
Affiliates contained herein or in the other agreements with the Company.
Expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred by any such Indemnified Person
in defending a proceeding, shall be paid by the Company in advance of the
final disposition of such proceeding, including any appeal therefrom, upon
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person to repay
such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnified Person
is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company.

  



  

(b) The right to indemnification and the advancement of expenses conferred in
this _Section 9.4_ shall not be exclusive of any other right which any Person
may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, agreement, bylaw, action by
the Manager or otherwise.

  



  

(c) The Company shall maintain directors' and officers' liability insurance,
or substantially equivalent insurance, at its expense, to protect any
Indemnified Person (and the investment funds, if any, they represent) against
any expense, liability or loss described in _Section 9.4(a)_ whether or not
the Company would have the power to indemnify such Indemnified Person
against such Liabilities under the provisions of this _Section 9.4_. The
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to purchase and
maintain property, casualty and liability insurance in types and at levels
customary for companies of similar size engaged in similar lines of business,
as determined in good faith by the Manager, and the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to purchase directors' and officers'
liability insurance (including employment practices coverage) with a
carrier and in an amount determined necessary or desirable as determined in
good faith by the Manager.

  



   

 | 33| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary (including in
this _Section 9.4_ ), (i) any indemnity by the Company relating to the
matters covered in this _Section 9.4_ shall be provided out of and to the
extent of Company assets only and no Member (unless such Member otherwise
agrees in writing or is found in a final decision by a court of competent
jurisdiction to have personal liability on account thereof) shall have
personal liability on account thereof or shall be required to make additional
Capital Contributions to help satisfy such indemnity of the Company and (ii)
the Company agrees that any indemnification and advancement of expenses
available to any current or former Indemnified Person from any investment fund
that is an Affiliate of the Company who served as a director or manager of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or as a Member of the Company by virtue
of such Person's service as a member, director, partner or employee of any
such investment fund prior to or following the Effective Time (any
such Person, a " _Sponsor Person_ ") shall be secondary to the
indemnification and advancement of expenses to be provided by the Company
pursuant to this _Section 9.4_ and the Company (A) shall be the primary
indemnitor of first resort for such Sponsor Person pursuant to this _Section
9.4_ and (B) shall be fully responsible for the advancement of all
expenses and the payment of all damages or liabilities with respect to such
Sponsor Person which are addressed by this _Section 9.4_.

  



  

(e) If this _Section 9.4_ or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any
ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Company shall
nevertheless indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person pursuant to
this _Section 9.4_ to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion
of this _Section 9.4_ that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law.

  



  

9.5 _Inspection Rights_. Subject to _Section 12.3_ , the Company shall
permit each Member and each of its designated representatives to examine the
books and records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at the principal
office of the Company or such other location as the Manager shall reasonably
approve during reasonable business hours, and make copies and extracts
therefrom, for any purpose reasonably related to such Member's Company
Interest.

  



  

ARTICLE X 
 DISSOLUTION AND TERMINATION

  



  

10.1 _Dissolution_. The Company shall not be dissolved by the admission of
Additional Members or Substituted Members or the attempted withdrawal
or resignation of a Member. The Company shall dissolve, and its affairs shall
be wound up, upon:

  



  

(a) the decision of the Manager and the consent of the Members holding a
majority of the outstanding Units to dissolve the Company;

  



  

(b) such time that there are no Members of the Company other than the
Corporation, unless the Company is continued in accordance with TBOC; or

  



  

(c) the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution of the Company under
Section 11.301 of TBOC.

  



  

Except as otherwise set forth in this _Article X_ , the Company is intended
to have perpetual existence. An Event of Withdrawal shall not cause a
dissolution of the Company and the Company shall continue in existence
subject to the terms and conditions of these Regulations.

  



   

 | 34| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

10.2 _Liquidation and Termination_. On dissolution of the Company, the
Manager shall act as liquidator or may appoint one or more Persons as
liquidator. The liquidators shall proceed diligently to wind up the affairs of
the Company and make final distributions as provided herein and in TBOC. The
costs of liquidation shall be borne as a Company expense. Until final
distribution, the liquidators shall continue to operate the Company
properties with all of the power and authority of the Manager. The steps to be
accomplished by the liquidators are as follows:

  



  

(a) as promptly as possible after dissolution and again after final
liquidation, the liquidators shall cause a proper accounting to be made by a
recognized firm of certified public accountants of the Company's assets,
liabilities and operations through the last day of the calendar month in
which the dissolution occurs or the final liquidation is completed, as
applicable;

  



  

(b) the liquidators shall cause the notice described in TBOC to be mailed to
each known creditor of and claimant against the Company in the manner
described thereunder;

  



  

(c) the liquidators shall pay, satisfy or discharge from Company funds, or
otherwise make adequate provision for payment and discharge thereof
(including the establishment of a cash fund for contingent liabilities in such
amount and for such term as the liquidators may reasonably determine) the
following: first, all expenses incurred in liquidation; second, all of the
debts, liabilities and obligations of the Company owed to creditors other
than the Members and third, all of the debt, liabilities and obligations
of the Company owed to Members (other than any payments or distributions owed
to such Members in their capacity as Members pursuant to these Regulations);
and

  



  

(d) all remaining assets of the Company shall be distributed to the Members
in accordance with _Article V_ by the end of the Taxable Year during which
the liquidation of the Company occurs (or, if later, by 90 days after the date
of the liquidation). The distribution of cash or property to the Members in
accordance with the provisions of this _Section 10.2_ and _Section 10.3_
below constitutes a complete return to the Members of their Capital
Contributions, a complete distribution to the Members of their interest in
the Company and all the Company's property and constitutes a compromise to
which all Members have consented within the meaning of TBOC. To the extent
that a Member returns funds to the Company, it has no claim against any other
Member for those funds.

  



  

10.3 _Deferment; Distribution in Kind_. Notwithstanding the provisions of
_Section 10.2_ , but subject to the order of priorities set forth therein, if
upon dissolution of the Company the liquidators determine that an immediate
sale of part or all of the Company's assets would be impractical or would
cause undue loss (or would otherwise not be beneficial) to the Members, the
liquidators may, in their sole discretion, defer for a reasonable time the
liquidation of any assets except those necessary to satisfy Company
liabilities (other than loans to the Company by Members) and reserves.
Subject to the order of priorities set forth in _Section 9.2_ , the
liquidators may, in their sole discretion, distribute to the Members, in lieu
of cash, either (a) all or any portion of such remaining Company assets in-
kind in accordance with the provisions of _Section 10.2(d)_ , (b) as tenants
in common and in accordance with the provisions of _Section 10.2(d)_ ,
undivided interests in all or any portion of such Company assets or (c) a
combination of the foregoing. Any such Distributions in kind shall be subject
to (i) such conditions relating to the disposition and management of such
assets as the liquidators deem reasonable and equitable and (ii) the terms and
conditions of any agreements governing such assets (or the operation thereof
or the holders thereof) at such time. Any Company assets distributed in kind
will first be written up or down to their Fair Market Value, thus creating
Profit and Loss (if any), which shall be allocated in accordance with
_Article VI_. The liquidators shall determine the Fair Market Value of any
property distributed in accordance with the valuation procedures set forth in
_Article XI_.

  



   

 | 35| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

10.4 _Cancellation of Certificate_. On completion of the distribution of
Company assets as provided herein, the Company is terminated (and the Company
shall not be terminated prior to such time), and the Manager (or such other
Person or Persons as TBOC may require or permit) shall file a certificate of
termination with the Secretary of State of Texas, cancel any other filings
made pursuant to these Regulations that are or should be canceled and take
such other actions as may be necessary to terminate the Company. The Company
shall be deemed to continue in existence for all purposes of these Regulations
until it is terminated pursuant to this  _Section 10.4_.

  



  

10.5 _Reasonable Time for Winding Up_. A reasonable time shall be allowed
for the orderly winding up of the business and affairs of the Company and the
liquidation of its assets pursuant to _Sections 10.2_ and _10.3_ in order to
minimize any losses otherwise attendant upon such winding up.

  



  

ARTICLE XI 
 VALUATION

  



  

11.1 _Determination_. " _Fair Market Value_ " of a specific Company asset
will mean the amount which the Company would receive in an all-cash sale of
such asset in an arms-length transaction with a willing unaffiliated third
party, with neither party having any compulsion to buy or sell, consummated
on the day immediately preceding the date on which the event occurred which
necessitated the determination of the Fair Market Value (and after giving
effect to any transfer taxes payable in connection with such sale), as such
amount is determined by the Manager (or, if pursuant to _Section 10.2_ , the
liquidators) in its good faith judgment using all factors, information and
data it deems to be pertinent.

  



  

11.2 _Dispute Resolution_. If any Member or Members dispute the accuracy of
any determination of Fair Market Value in accordance with  _Section 11.1_ ,
and the Manager and such Member(s) are unable to agree on the determination of
the Fair Market Value of any asset of the Company, the Manager and such
Member(s) shall each select a nationally recognized investment banking firm
experienced in valuing securities of closely-held companies such as the
Company in the Company's industry (the " _Appraisers_ "), who shall each
determine, or cause to be determined, the Fair Market Value of the asset or
the Company (as applicable) in accordance with the provisions of _Section
11.1_. The Appraisers shall be instructed to give written notice of their
determination of the Fair Market Value of the asset or the Company (as
applicable) within 30 days of their appointment as Appraisers. If Fair
Market Value as determined by an Appraiser is higher than Fair Market Value
as determined by the other Appraiser by 10% or more, and the Manager and such
Member(s) do not otherwise agree on a Fair Market Value, the original
Appraisers shall designate a third Appraiser meeting the same criteria used
to select the original two and the Fair Market Value determined by such third
Appraiser shall be final and binding. If Fair Market Value as determined by
an Appraiser is within 10% of the Fair Market Value as determined by
the other Appraiser (but not identical), and the Manager and such Member(s)
do not otherwise agree on a Fair Market Value, the Manager shall select the
Fair Market Value of one of the Appraisers. The fees and expenses of the
Appraisers shall be borne by the Company.

and personal representatives.

  



  

12.3 _Access to and Confidentiality of Company Information_. Information
regarding the Company shall be subject to the following provisions:

  



  

(a) _Member 's Entitlement to Company Information_.

  



  

(i) Each holder of Common Units is entitled to all information to which that
Member is entitled to have access pursuant to Section 101.502 of TBOC under
the circumstances and subject to the conditions therein stated.

  



  

(ii) The Members agree that the Manager from time to time may in the sole
discretion of the Manager determine that certain information regarding the

considerations.

  



  

(b) _Confidential Information_.

  



  

(i) Except as required by applicable Law, the Manager and each of the Members
agree to hold the Company's Confidential Information in confidence and shall
not (x) disclose any Confidential Information except as otherwise authorized
separately in writing by the Manager or (ii) use such information except in

Class A Common Stock (or, if there is no then-acting registrar and transfer
agent of Holdings Class A Common Stock, at the principal executive offices of

(c) In connection with a Change of Control, and subject to any approval of
the Change of Control by the holders of shares of Holdings required under the
Holdings Charter or applicable Law (which approval has been granted by a vote
or consent of the stockholders of Holdings), Holdings shall have the right to
require each Unitholder to Exchange some or all of the outstanding Company
Units beneficially owned by such Unitholder (and a corresponding number of
shares of Holdings Class B Common Stock) (in each case, free and clear of all
Liens), in consideration for the issuance by Holdings to such Unitholder of a
number of shares of Holdings Class A Common Stock equal to the number of
Company Units surrendered _multiplied by_ the Exchange Rate (a " _Change of
Control Exchange_ "), with such Change of Control Exchange to be effected by
the surrender of such Company Units to Holdings (and surrender for
cancellation one or more stock certificates (if certificated) or instructions
and stock powers (if uncertificated)) and the subsequent automatic conversion
of such exchanged Company Units into an equal number of shares of Holdings

exist and concomitantly with any such issuance, any exchanged shares of
Holdings Class B Common Stock automatically shall be deemed cancelled without
any action on the part of any Person, including the Company or Holdings);
_provided_ , that if the Company requires the Unitholders to Exchange less
than all of their outstanding Company Units (and to surrender a corresponding
number of shares of Holdings Class B Common Stock for cancellation), each
Unitholder's participation in the Change of Control Exchange shall be reduced
_pro rata. _ Any Change of Control Exchange shall be effective immediately
prior to the consummation of the Change of Control (and, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall not be effective if such Change of Control is not consummated)
(the " _Change of Control Exchange Time_ ") and each Unitholder will be
treated as a holder of record of shares of Holdings Class A Common Stock as
of the Change of Control Exchange Time. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) any
Company Units and a corresponding number of shares of Holdings Class B Common
Stock held by an Unitholder that are not Exchanged or cancelled, as

Unitholder pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ subject to, and in accordance with,
the terms thereof and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
Holdings shall not be entitled to make a Cash Exchange Payment in the case of
a Change of Control Exchange.

  



  

(d) To effect the delivery of such shares of Holdings Class A Common Stock,
Holdings shall: (i) deliver or cause to be delivered at the offices of the
then-acting registrar and transfer agent of Holdings Class A Common Stock (or,
if there is no then-acting registrar and transfer agent of Holdings Class A
Common Stock, at the principal executive offices of Holdings) such number of
shares of Holdings Class A Common Stock, registered in the name of the
relevant Unitholder (or in such other name as is requested in writing by such
Unitholder), in certificated or uncertificated form, as determined by
Holdings, or (ii) if shares of Holdings Class A Common Stock are settled
through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company, upon the written
instruction of such Unitholder, use its commercially reasonable efforts to
deliver the shares of Holdings Class A Common Stock through the facilities of
The Depository Trust Company, to the account of the participant of The
Depository Trust Company designated by such Unitholder.

(e) Holdings shall provide written notice of an expected Change of Control to
all Unitholders within the earlier of (i) five days following the execution
of the agreement with respect to such Change of Control and (ii) ten days
before the proposed date upon which the contemplated Change of Control is to
be effected, indicating in such notice such information as may reasonably
describe the Change of Control transaction, subject to applicable Law,
including the date of execution of such agreement or such proposed
effective date, as applicable, the amount and types of consideration to be
paid for Company Units or shares of Holdings Class A Common Stock, as
applicable, in the Change of Control (which consideration shall be identical
whether paid for Company Units or shares of Holdings Class A Common Stock),
any election with respect to types of consideration that a holder of Company
Units or shares of Holdings Class A Common Stock, as applicable, shall be
entitled to make in connection with the Change of Control, the percentage of
total Company Units or shares of Holdings Class A Common Stock, as
applicable, to be transferred to the acquirer by all stockholders of Holdings
in the Change of Control, and the number of Company Units held by each
Unitholder that Holdings intends to require be Exchanged for shares of
Holdings Class A Common Stock in connection with the Change of Control.
Holdings shall update such notice from time to time to reflect any material
changes to such notice. Holdings may satisfy any such notice and update
requirements described in the preceding two sentences by providing such
information on Form 8-K, Schedule TO, Schedule 14D-9 or similar form filed
with the SEC.

  



  

(f) Immediately upon the Exchange of any Company Unit pursuant to this
_Section 2.1_, an equal number of outstanding shares of Holdings Class B
Common Stock beneficially owned by the exchanging Unitholder automatically
shall be deemed cancelled without any action on the part of any Person,
including such Unitholder, the Company or Holdings. Any such cancelled shares
of Holdings Class B Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding, and all
rights with respect to such shares shall automatically cease and terminate.

  



  

(g) The Company, Holdings and each Unitholder shall bear its own expenses in
connection with the consummation of any Exchange, whether or not any such
Exchange is ultimately consummated, except that Holdings shall bear any
transfer taxes, stamp taxes or duties, or other similar taxes in connection
with, or arising by reason of, any Exchange; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
any shares of Holdings Class A Common Stock are to be delivered in a name
other than that of the Unitholder that requested the Exchange (or The
Depository Trust Company or its nominee for the account of a participant of
The Depository Trust Company that will hold the shares for the account of
such Unitholder), then such Unitholder or the Person in whose name such shares
of Holdings Class A Common Stock are to be delivered shall pay to the Company
the amount of any transfer taxes, stamp taxes or duties, or other similar
taxes in connection with, or arising by reason of, such Exchange or shall
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Holdings that such tax has been
paid or is not payable. For the avoidance of doubt, each exchanging Unitholder
shall bear any and all income or gains taxes imposed on gain realized by such
exchanging Unitholder as a result of any such Exchange.

  



  

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the Manager of the
Company, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and tax
advisor, shall determine in good faith that interests in the Company do not
meet the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.7704-1(h) (or other
provisions of those Treasury Regulations), the Company may impose such
restrictions on Exchanges as the Company may reasonably determine to be
necessary or advisable so that the Company is not treated as a "publicly
traded partnership" under Section 7704 of the Code.

(i) Upon receiving an Exchange Notice from a Unitholder, Holdings may elect
to cause the Company to effect the Exchange under _Section 2.1_ and deliver
to the Unitholder the applicable number of shares of Holdings Class A Common
Stock or the Cash Exchange Payment that such Unitholder is entitled to
receive in the Exchange, in which event the Unitholder shall deliver to the
Company the Common Units being surrendered in the Exchange.

  



  

2.2 _Class A Common Shares to be Issued_.

  



  

(a) In connection with any Exchange, Holdings reserves the right to provide
Holdings Class A Common Stock that are registered pursuant to the Securities
Act, shares of Holdings Class A Common Stock or any combination thereof, as it
may determine in its sole discretion, it being understood that to the extent
an Unitholder is a party to the Registration Rights Agreement, any
unregistered shares of Holdings Class A Common Stock issued to such
Unitholder shall be entitled to the registration rights as set forth therein.

  



  

(b) Holdings shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its
authorized but unissued shares of Holdings Class A Common Stock, solely for
the purpose of issuances upon any Exchange, such number of shares of Holdings
Class A Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the
Exchange of all Company Units that may be outstanding from time to time.
Holdings shall take any and all actions necessary or desirable to give effect
to the foregoing.

  



  

(c) Prior to the Date of Exchange effected pursuant to this Agreement,
Holdings shall take all such steps as may be required to cause to qualify for
exemption under Rule 16b-3(d) or (e), as applicable, under the Exchange Act,
and to be exempt for purposes of Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act, any
acquisitions from, or dispositions to, Holdings of equity securities of
Holdings (including derivative securities with respect thereto) and any
securities that may be deemed to be equity securities or derivative
securities of Holdings for such purposes that result from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, by each officer or director of Holdings,
including any director by deputization. The authorizing resolutions shall be
approved by either the board of directors of Holdings or a committee thereof
composed solely of two or more Non-Employee Directors (as defined in Rule

2.3 _Capital Stock of Holdings and the Company_.

  



  

(a) Holdings shall, and shall cause the Company to, take all actions
necessary so that, at all times for as long as this Agreement is in
effect: (i) the number of Company Units outstanding equals the number of
shares of Holdings Class A Common Stock outstanding; and (ii) one Company
Unit is exchangeable for one share of Holdings Class A Common Stock pursuant
to this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Upon the issuance by Holdings of any shares of Holdings Class A Common
Stock other than pursuant to an Exchange (including any issuance in
connection with a business acquisition by Holdings or its direct or indirect
Subsidiaries, an equity incentive program or upon the conversion, exercise
(including cashless exercise) or exchange of any security or other instrument
convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of Holdings Class
A Common Stock), Holdings shall contribute the proceeds of such issuance (net
of any selling or underwriting discounts or commissions or other expenses) to
the Company in exchange for a number of newly issued Company Units equal to
the number of shares of Holdings Class A Common Stock issued.

  



  

(c) At any time that the Company issues a Company Unit to anyone other than
Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries, Holdings shall issue a share of Holdings
Class B Common Stock to the recipient of such Company Unit. Upon the
conversion or cancellation of any Company Unit pursuant to this Agreement or
the Company AandR Regulations, a corresponding number of shares of Holdings
Class B Common Stock shall automatically be cancelled without any action on
the part of any Person, including such Unitholder, the Company or Holdings.
Holdings may only issue shares of Holdings Class B Common Stock to the
Unitholders and their respective Permitted Transferees. A Unitholder may only
transfer Company Units to a Person if (i) such Person is a Permitted
Transferee of such Unitholder and (ii) an equal number of shares of Holdings
Class B Common Stock are simultaneously transferred to the Permitted
Transferee.

  



  

(d) If Holdings redeems, repurchases or otherwise acquires any shares of
Holdings Class A Common Stock for cash (including a redemption, repurchase or
acquisition of restricted shares of Holdings Class A Common Stock for nominal
or no value), the Company shall, coincident with such redemption, repurchase
or acquisition, redeem, repurchase or acquire an identical number of Company
Units held by Holdings upon the same terms, including the same price, as the
terms of the redemption, repurchase or acquisition of shares of
Holdings Class A Common Stock.

  



  

(e) Holdings shall not in any manner effect any Subdivision or Combination of
shares of Holdings Class A Common Stock unless the Company
simultaneously effects a Subdivision or Combination, as the case may be, of
Company Units with an identical ratio as the Subdivision or Combination of
shares of Holdings Class A Common Stock. The Company shall not in any manner
effect any Subdivision or Combination of Company Units unless Holdings
simultaneously effects a Subdivision or Combination, as the case may be, of
shares of Holdings Class A Common Stock and shares of Holdings Class B Common
Stock with an identical ratio as the Subdivision or Combination of Company
Units.

  



   

 | 10| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(f) Holdings shall not issue, and shall not agree to issue (including
pursuant to any security or other instrument convertible into or
exercisable or exchangeable for) any class of equity securities other than
shares of Holdings Class A Common Stock and shares of Holdings Class B Common
Stock or one or more series of preferred stock that Holdings may determine to
issue from time to time in accordance with, and subject to the limitations
contained in, the Holdings Charter and this _Section 2.3(f)_. Holdings
shall not issue any shares of preferred stock unless (i) the Company issues
or agrees to issue, as the case may be, to Holdings a number of units, with
designations, preferences and other rights and terms that are substantially
the same as such shares of preferred stock, equal to the number of such
shares of preferred stock issued by Holdings, and (ii) Holdings transfers to
the Company the proceeds (net of any selling or underwriting discounts or
commissions and other expenses) of the issuance of such preferred stock (and
agrees to transfer to the Company any amounts paid by the holders of
securities or instruments exercisable or exchangeable therefor upon their
exercise or exchange, if applicable, net of expenses).

  



  

(g) For as long as this Agreement is in effect: (i) the Company shall not,
and Holdings shall cause the Company not to, at any time, issue Company Units
except as required by this Agreement; (ii) the Company shall not, and Holdings
shall cause the Company not to, at any time, issue Company Units to any
Person other than Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries, the Unitholders and
their respective Permitted Transferees; and (iii) Holdings shall not transfer
any Company Units except in connection with a Change of Control. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit Holdings from
pledging any Company Units held by Holdings in connection with a credit
facility that is for the benefit of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(h) If Holdings makes a dividend or other distribution of Holdings stock on
its shares of Holdings Class A Common Stock, the Company shall make a
dividend or other distribution to the holders of Company Units of an
equivalent number of Company Units with designations, preferences and other
rights and terms that are substantially the same as such distributed stock.

  



  

(i) For the avoidance of doubt, no Exchange will impair the right of an
exchanging Unitholder to receive any distribution for periods ending on or
prior to the Date of Exchange for such Exchange (but for which payment had not
yet been made with respect to the Company Units in question at the time the
Exchange is consummated).

  



  

2.4 _Adjustments_. Without limiting anything set forth in _Section 2.3_ :

  



  

(a) In the event there is any (i) Subdivision or Combination of the shares of
Holdings Class B Common Stock or Company Units that is not accompanied by an
equivalent Subdivision or Combination of the Holdings Class A Common Stock;
(ii) Subdivision or Combination of the Holdings Class A Common Stock that is
not accompanied by an equivalent Subdivision or Combination of the shares of
Holdings Class B Common Stock and Company Units, or (iii) dividend or
distribution of cash or other property made by Holdings on shares of Holdings
Class A Common Stock that is not funded by a matching pro rata dividend or
distribution of cash or other property made by the Company on the Company
Units, the Exchange Rate shall be adjusted accordingly.

  



   

 | 11| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) If there is any reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or
other similar transaction in which the Holdings Class A Common Stock is
converted or changed into another security, securities or other property, then
upon any subsequent Exchange, an exchanging Unitholder shall be entitled to
receive the amount of such security, securities or other property that such
exchanging Unitholder would have received if such Exchange had occurred
immediately prior to the effective date of such reclassification,
reorganization, recapitalization or other similar transaction, taking into
account any adjustment as a result of any Subdivision or Combination of such
security, securities or other property that occurs after the effective time of
such reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar
transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, if there is any reclassification,
reorganization, recapitalization or other similar transaction in which the
Holdings Class A Common Stock is converted or changed into another security,
securities or other property, this _Section 2.4(b)_ shall continue to be
applicable, _mutatis mutandis_ , with respect to such security or other
property.

  



  

(c) This Agreement shall apply to, _mutatis mutandis_ , and all references to
"Company Units" or "Holdings Class B Common Stock" shall be deemed to
include, any security, securities or other property of the Company or Holdings
which may be issued in respect of, in exchange for or in substitution of
Company Units or shares of Holdings Class B Common Stock, as applicable, by
reason of any distribution or dividend, split, reverse split, combination,
reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization, merger, exchange (other
than an Exchange) or other transaction.

  



  

2.5 _Withholding; Certification of Non-Foreign Status_.

  



  

(a) If Holdings shall be required to withhold any amounts by reason of any
federal, state, local or foreign tax rules or regulations in respect of any
Exchange, Holdings shall be entitled to take such action as it deems
appropriate, in its reasonable discretion, in order to ensure compliance with
such withholding requirements, including, at its option, withholding shares of
Holdings Class A Common Stock with a fair market value equal to the minimum
amount of any taxes that Holdings may be required to withhold with respect to
such Exchange; _provided_ that, in the event that Holdings so determines that
withholding is required with respect to an Exchange, Holdings shall notify
the Sellers Representative as soon as reasonably practicable of its intent to
withhold and Holdings shall consider in good faith any forms, statements,
documentation or other information submitted by, and otherwise cooperate on a
reasonable basis with, the Sellers Representative to reduce or eliminate the
proposed withholding. To the extent that amounts are (or property is) so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, such withheld
amounts (or property) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid (or delivered) to the applicable Unitholder and, as soon
as reasonably practicable after any such withholding, Holdings shall deliver
to the Sellers Representative the original or a certified copy of a receipt
issued by the applicable taxing authority evidencing such payment, a copy of
the return reporting such payment and, upon request of the Sellers
Representative or applicable Unitholder, other evidence of such payment and
Holdings shall cooperate on a reasonable basis with the Sellers
Representative or applicable Unitholders to claim and obtain a refund for any
such Taxes withheld.

  



   

 | 12| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Holdings may, in its
reasonable discretion, require that an exchanging Unitholder deliver
to Holdings a certification of non-foreign status in accordance with Sections
1445 and 1446(f)(2) of the Code and Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(b)
prior to an Exchange. In the event Holdings has required delivery of such
certification but an exchanging Unitholder does not provide such
certification, Holdings shall nevertheless deliver or cause to be delivered to
the exchanging Unitholder the Holdings Class A Common Stock or the Cash
Exchange Payment in accordance with _Section 2.1_ , but subject
to withholding as provided in _Section 2.5(a)_.

such sale or other disposition one of the exemptions from registration
set forth in the Securities Act, the rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder and applicable state law. Such Unitholder further understands that
the Company and Holdings have no obligation or present intention to register
the Holdings Class A Common Stock or to permit their sale other than in

the Holdings Class A Common Stock will be subject to additional restrictions
on transfer in accordance with (i) the Company AandR Regulations, (ii) the
Registration Rights Agreement, to the extent such Unitholder is a party, and
(iii) the Lock-Up Agreement.

described in Rule 506(d)(1)(i)-(viii) of the Securities Act is applicable to
such Unitholder or, if applicable, any direct or indirect owner of any
interest in such Unitholder.

5.10 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction_. This Agreement is to be
governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the internal laws
of the State of Delaware, without regard to its rules of conflict of laws.
Each of the Parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Delaware Court of Chancery in New Castle County, or in the event (but only
in the event) that such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over
such action, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. A
final judgment in any such Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by Law. To the extent that service of process by mail is permitted

DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE) ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY FORUM IN RESPECT OF
ANY ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER
HEREOF, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING. EACH PARTY
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INFORMED BY THE OTHER PARTIES THAT THIS

RELYING AND WILL RELY IN ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OTHER
AGREEMENTS RELATING HERETO OR CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. ANY PARTY MAY FILE AN

terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or
enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any
other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be so broad

5.14 _Enforcement of Agreement_. Each Party's obligation under this Agreement
is unique. The Parties acknowledge that money damages would not be an
adequate remedy at law if any Party fails to perform in any material respect
any of its obligations hereunder and accordingly agree that each Party, in
addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled under
this Agreement, at law or in equity, shall be entitled to seek an injunction
or similar equitable relief restraining such Party from committing or
continuing any such breach or threatened breach or to seek to compel specific
performance of the obligations of any other Party under this Agreement,
without the posting of any bond, in accordance with the terms and conditions
of this Agreement in any court of the United States or any State thereof
having jurisdiction, and if any action should be brought in equity to enforce
any of the provisions of this Agreement, none of the Parties shall raise the
defense that there is an adequate remedy at law. No remedy shall be exclusive
of any other remedy, and all available remedies shall be cumulative.

  



  

5.15 _Construction_. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, then this Agreement will be construed as drafted
jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof will arise
favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the
provisions of this Agreement. Unless otherwise indicated to the contrary

Agreement to any contract or any federal, state, local or foreign statutes,

company (the " _Holders Representative_ "). Each of the Corporate Taxpayer,
the Company, the Holders and the Holders Representative may be referred to

Corporate Taxpayer, dated as of [●], 2019, the Corporate Taxpayer is
authorized to issue, among other things, (1) Class A Common Stock, par value

Regulations_"), the Company Units represent all of the Capital Stock of the
Company.

  



  

C. Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
October [●], 2018, by and among the Parties (the " _Transaction Agreement_
"), at the Closing and concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the
Corporate Taxpayer is acquiring certain Company Units.

  



  

D. At the Closing and concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the
Corporate Taxpayer and the Holders are entering into an exchange Agreement
(the " _Exchange Agreement_ "), pursuant to which each Holder will be entitled
to exchange the Company Units that such Holder continues to hold in exchange
for the number of shares of Class A Common Stock specified in the Exchange
Agreement on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein (each,
a " _Post-Transaction Exchange_ ").

  



  

E.  The Company is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal and

classified as a corporation for U.S. federal and applicable state and local

F. It is intended that the acquisition of Company Units pursuant to the
Transaction Agreement will constitute a taxable sale of partnership interests
pursuant to Sections 741 and 1001 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "
_Code_ ").

  



  

H. The Company will have in effect an election under Section 754 of the Code
(and any corresponding provisions of state or local Tax Law), for each
Taxable Year (as defined below) of the Company, which election is intended
generally to result in an adjustment under Sections 734(b) and 743(b) of the
Code (including a substituted basis transaction described in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.755-1(b)(5)) to the tax basis of the assets owned by
the Company (solely with respect to the Corporate Taxpayer) with respect to
each Exchange, by reason of the Exchange and the receipt of certain payments
under this Agreement.

  



   



 



    



  

I. The income, gain, loss, deduction and other Tax (as defined below) items
of the Corporate Taxpayer and its wholly owned Subsidiaries (as defined
below) may be affected by (1) the Basis Adjustments and (2) the Imputed
Interest.

  



  

J. The Parties desire to make certain arrangements with respect to the effect
of the Basis Adjustments and the Imputed Interest on the liability for Taxes
of the Corporate Taxpayer.

  



  

K. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement will have the
respective meanings ascribed to such terms in the Transaction Agreement.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the respective
covenants and agreements contained herein, the receipt and sufficiency of
which is hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the
Parties agree as follows:

  



  

Article I

  



  

 _Definitions_

  



  

1.1 _Definitions_. As used in this Agreement, the terms set forth in this
_Article I_ have the following meanings.

  



  

" _Advisory Firm_ " means any accounting firm or any law firm that, in either
case, is nationally recognized as being expert in tax matters.

or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with such
Person. For purposes of this definition, "control" (including, with
correlative meaning, the terms "controlled by" and "under common control
with") as applied to any Person means the power to direct or cause the
direction of the management and policies of such Person whether by ownership
of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.

  



  

" _Agreed Rate_ " means LIBOR plus 100 basis points.

  



  

" _Agreement_ " has the meaning set forth in the Preamble.

  



  

" _Amended Schedule_ " has the meaning set forth in _Section 2.2(b)_.

  



  

" _Applicable Asset_ " means any asset that is, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, (a) depreciable or amortizable, (b) stock of a corporation or (c)
land.

  



  

" _Assumed State and Local Tax Rate_ " means [ ] percent ([ ]%)1 or such
other rate as the Corporate Taxpayer may in good faith determine to be
appropriate taking into account any changes, after the date hereof, to the
Corporate Taxpayer's apportionment factors and/or the corporate income and
franchise tax rates in any state and local jurisdictions in which the
Corporate Taxpayer files income and franchise tax returns.

" _Basis Adjustment_ " means, in respect of a Holder, the adjustment to the
tax basis of a Reference Asset under Sections 732, 755 and 1012 of the Code

separate from its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes) or under
Sections 734(b), 743(b) and 755 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder (in situations where, following an Exchange, the Company remains
in existence as an entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes) and, in each
case, comparable provisions of state and local Tax Law, as a result of (a) an
Exchange by such Holder and (b) payments made to such Holder pursuant to this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the amount of any Basis Adjustment
resulting from an Exchange shall be determined without regard to any Pre-
Exchange Transfers (and as if any such Pre-Exchange Transfers had not
occurred). As required by _Section 2.1(a)_, the Company will ensure that an
election under Section 754 of the Code is in effect for each Taxable Year of
the Company (until the Company becomes an entity that is disregarded as
separate from its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes).

membership interests (whether general or limited); and

  



  

(d) any other interest or participation that confers on a Person the right to
receive a share of the profits and losses of, or distributions of assets of,
the issuing Person.

" _Class A Common Stock Market Value_ " means, for any day, the average of
the high price and the low price of a share of Class A Common Stock for such
day; _provided_ , that if the Class A Common Stock no longer trades on a
securities exchange or automated or electronic quotation system, then a
majority of the independent members of the Board shall determine the fair
market value of a share of Class A Common Stock for such day in good faith.

  



  

" _Code_ " has the meaning set forth in the Recitals.

filed with respect to Taxes of any Taxable Year.

  



  

" _Cumulative Net Realized Tax Benefit_ " means, for a Taxable Year, in
respect of a Holder, the cumulative amount of Realized Tax Benefits in
respect of such Holder for all Taxable Years or portions thereof of (a) the
Corporate Taxpayer, (b) its wholly owned Subsidiaries, and (c) without
duplication, the Company and its Subsidiaries, up to and including such
Taxable Year, net of the cumulative amount of Realized Tax Detriments for the
same Taxable Year or portion thereof shall be determined based on the
most recent Tax Benefit Schedule or Amended Schedule, if any, in existence at
the time of such determination. If a Cumulative Net Realized Tax Benefit in
respect of such Holder is being calculated with respect to a portion of a
Taxable Year, then calculations of the Cumulative Net Realized Tax Benefit in
respect of such Holder (including determinations relating to Basis Adjustments

over the Hypothetical Tax Liability in respect of such Holder for such Taxable
Year (or portion thereof). If all or a portion of the actual liability for
such Taxes for the Taxable Year arises as a result of an audit by a Taxing
Authority of any Taxable Year, such liability shall not be included in
determining the Realized Tax Detriment in respect of such Holder unless
and until there has been a Determination. If an "actual liability" for Taxes
is being calculated with respect to a portion of a Taxable Year, then
calculations of such actual liability (including determinations relating Basis
Adjustments and Imputed Interest to the extent applicable) shall be made as
if there were an interim closing of the books of the relevant entity and
its Subsidiaries and the Taxable Year had closed on the relevant date.

assumptions that (a) in each Taxable Year ending on or after such Early
Termination Date (or with respect to which the Tax Benefit Payment has not
been determined and (subject to _Sections  3.6_ and _5.3_ ) paid), the
Corporate Taxpayer and its wholly owned Subsidiaries will have taxable income
sufficient to fully utilize the deductions arising from the Basis Adjustments
and the Imputed Interest during such Taxable Year or future Taxable Years in
which such deductions would become available (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, Basis Adjustments and Imputed Interest that would result from post-
Early Termination Date Tax Benefit Payments that would be paid in accordance
with the Valuation Assumptions), (b) the U.S. federal income tax rates and
state and local income tax rates that will be in effect for each such Taxable
Year will be those specified for each such Taxable Year by the Code and other
Law as in effect on the Early Termination Date (but taking into account for
the applicable Taxable Years adjustments to the tax rates that have been
enacted as of the Early Termination Date with a delayed effective date), (c)
any loss carryovers generated by any Basis Adjustment or Imputed Interest and
available as of the Early Termination Date will be used by the Corporate
Taxpayer on a pro rata basis from the Early Termination Date through the
scheduled expiration date of such loss carryovers or, if shorter, through the
15th Taxable Year after the Taxable Year in which the Early Termination Date
occurs, (d) any non-depreciable or non-amortizable Reference Asset will

(or is deemed to have) Company Units that have not been Exchanged, then each
such Company Unit shall be deemed to be Exchanged for the Class A
Common Stock Market Value on the Early Termination Date, and the Holder shall
be deemed to receive the amount of cash the Holder would have been entitled
to pursuant to this Agreement had the Company Unit actually been Exchanged on
the Early Termination Date, determined using the Valuation Assumptions, and

Subsidiaries, as applicable) for each Taxable Year for which a Tax Benefit
Payment would be due.

Article II _ 
  
 Determination of Certain Realized Tax Benefit_

  



  

2.1 _Tax Benefit Schedule_.

  



  

(a) _Tax Benefit Schedule_. Within 90 calendar days after the due date
(taking into account valid extensions) of the U.S. federal income Tax Return
of the Corporate Taxpayer (or its wholly owned Subsidiaries, as applicable)
for any Taxable Year in which there is a Realized Tax Benefit or Realized Tax
Detriment (collectively, a " _Realized Tax Benefit or Detriment_ "), the
Corporate Taxpayer shall provide to the Holders Representative a schedule
showing in reasonable detail the calculation of the Realized Tax Benefit or
Detriment in respect of each Holder for such Taxable Year and any Tax Benefit
Payment in respect of the Holders (a " _Tax Benefit Schedule_ "). The Tax
Benefit Schedules provided by the Corporate Taxpayer will become final as
provided in _Section 2.2(a)_ and shall be amended as provided in _Section
2.2(b)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Corporate Taxpayer
shall cause the Company to ensure that an election under Section 754 of the
Code is in effect for each Taxable Year of the Company (until the Company
becomes an entity that is disregarded as separate from its owner for U.S.
federal income tax purposes).

  



  

(b) _Applicable Principles_. Subject to _Section 3.3(a)_, the Realized Tax
Benefit or Detriment for each Taxable Year is intended to measure the
decrease or increase in the actual liability for Taxes of the Corporate
Taxpayer and its wholly owned Subsidiaries (and the Company and its
Subsidiaries, as applicable and without duplication) for such Taxable Year (or
portion thereof) attributable to the Basis Adjustments and the Imputed
Interest, determined using a "with and without" methodology. For the
avoidance of doubt, the actual liability for Taxes of the Corporate Taxpayer
and its wholly owned Subsidiaries (and the Company and its Subsidiaries, as
applicable and without duplication) will take into account any deduction of
Imputed Interest. Carryovers or carrybacks of any Tax item attributable to
the Basis Adjustments and Imputed Interest shall be considered to be subject
to the rules of the Code and the Treasury Regulations or the appropriate
provisions of U.S. state and local Tax Law, as applicable, governing the use,
limitation and expiration of carryovers or carrybacks of the relevant type.

  



  

2.2 _Procedure; Amendments_.

  



  

(a) _Procedure_. Every time the Corporate Taxpayer delivers to the Holders
Representative an applicable Schedule under this Agreement, including any
Amended Schedule delivered pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_, including any Early
Termination Schedule or amended Early Termination Schedule, the Corporate
Taxpayer shall also allow the Holders Representative reasonable access at no
cost to the appropriate representatives, as determined by the Corporate
Taxpayer, at the Corporate Taxpayer and the Advisory Firm that prepared the
relevant Corporate Taxpayer Returns in connection with a review of such
Schedule. Without limiting the application of the preceding sentence, the
Corporate Taxpayer shall, upon request, deliver to the Holders Representative
work papers providing reasonable detail regarding the computation of such Tax
Benefit Schedule. An applicable Tax Benefit Schedule or amendment
thereto shall, subject to the final sentence of this _Section 2.2(a)_, become
final and binding on the Holders Representative and each Holder and its
Affiliates 30 calendar days from the first date on which the Corporate
Taxpayer sent the Holders Representative the applicable Schedule or amendment
thereto unless (i) the Holders Representative within 30 calendar days after
the date the Corporate Taxpayer sent such Schedule or amendment thereto
provides the Corporate Taxpayer with written notice of a material objection
to such Schedule made in good faith and setting forth in reasonable detail
the Holders Representative's material objection along with a letter from an
Advisory Firm supporting such objection, if such objection relates to the
application of Tax Law (an " _Objection Notice_ ") or (ii) the Holders
Representative provides a written waiver of the right to provide any Objection
Notice with respect to such Schedule or amendment thereto within the period
described in _clause (i)_ above, in which case such Schedule or amendment
thereto becomes binding on the date the waiver is received by the Corporate
Taxpayer. If the Corporate Taxpayer and the Holders Representative are unable
to resolve the issues raised in any Objection Notice within 30 calendar
days after receipt by the Corporate Taxpayer of such Objection Notice, the
Corporate Taxpayer and the Holders Representative shall employ the
reconciliation procedures described in _Section 7.9_ (the " _Reconciliation
Procedures_ ").

  



   

 | \- 10 -| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) _Amended Schedule_. The applicable Schedule for any Taxable Year shall
be amended from time to time by the Corporate Taxpayer (i) in connection with
a Determination affecting such Schedule, (ii) to correct inaccuracies in the
Schedule identified after the date the Schedule was provided to the Holders
Representative, (iii) to comply with an Expert's determination under the
Reconciliation Procedures applicable to this Agreement, (iv) to reflect a
change in the Realized Tax Benefit or Detriment in respect of a Holder for
such Taxable Year attributable to a carryback or carryforward of a loss or
other tax item to such Taxable Year, (v) to reflect a change in the Realized
Tax Benefit or Detriment in respect of a Holder for such Taxable Year
attributable to an amended Tax Return filed for such Taxable Year, or (vi) to
take into account payments made pursuant to this Agreement (any such Schedule,
an " _Amended Schedule_ ").

  



  

2.3 _Consistency with Tax Returns_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, all calculations and determinations hereunder, including Basis
Adjustments, the Schedules, and the determination of the Realized Tax Benefit
or Detriment, shall be made in accordance with any elections, methodologies
or positions taken on the relevant Corporate Taxpayer Returns.

  



  

Article III _ 
  
 Tax Benefit Payments_

  



  

3.1 _Payments_.

  



  

(a) _Payments_. Except as provided in _Sections 3.6_ and _5.3_ , and subject
to _Section 3.3_, within five Business Days after all the Tax Benefit
Schedules with respect to the Taxable Year delivered to the Holders
pursuant to this Agreement become final in accordance with _Article II_ , the
Corporate Taxpayer shall pay or cause to be paid to each Holder for such
Taxable Year such Holder's Tax Benefit Payment (if any) determined pursuant to
_Section  3.1(b)_. Each such payment shall be made, at the sole discretion of
the Corporate Taxpayer, by wire or Automated Clearing House transfer of
immediately available funds to the bank account previously designated by the
Holders Representative to the Corporate Taxpayer or as otherwise agreed by
the Corporate Taxpayer and the Holders Representative.

  



   

 | \- 11 -| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) A " _Tax Benefit Payment_ " in respect of a Holder for a Taxable Year
means an aggregate amount, not less than zero, which the Corporate Taxpayer
is required to pay or cause to be paid pursuant to _Section 3.1_, equal
to the sum of the Net Tax Benefit and the Interest Amount in respect of such
Holder. For the avoidance of doubt, for Tax purposes, the Interest Amount
shall not be treated as interest for U.S. federal and applicable state and
local Tax purposes but instead shall be treated as additional consideration
for the acquisition of Company Units in Exchanges, unless otherwise required
by Law, as reasonably determined by the Corporate Taxpayer. The " _Net Tax
Benefit_ " in respect of such Holder for a Taxable Year shall be an amount
equal to the excess, if any, of (i) 85% of the Cumulative Net Realized Tax
Benefit in respect of such Holder as of the end of such Taxable Year (or
portion thereof) over (ii) the total amount of payments previously made
under this _Section 3.1_ in respect of such Holder (excluding payments of
Interest Amounts).

  



  

(c) The " _Interest Amount_ " in respect of such Holder for a Taxable Year
(or portion thereof) shall equal the interest on the Net Tax Benefit in
respect of such Holder with respect to such Taxable Year (or portion thereof)
calculated at the Agreed Rate compounded annually from the due date (without
extensions) for filing the U.S. federal income Tax Return of the
Corporate Taxpayer for such Taxable Year until the Payment Date. The Net Tax
Benefit and the Interest Amount shall be determined separately with respect
to each separate Exchange on an individual basis by reference to the resulting
Basis Adjustment to the Corporate Taxpayer.

  



  

3.2 _Duplicative Payments_. It is intended that the provisions of this
Agreement will not result in a duplicative payment of any amount
(including interest) required under this Agreement. It is also intended that
the provisions of this Agreement, subject to _Article IV_ and _Section 7.13_,
will result in 85% of the Cumulative Net Realized Tax Benefit (but calculated
by taking into account all Exchanges by all Holders as of any time) as of any
determination date being paid to the Holders pursuant to this Agreement. The
provisions of this Agreement shall be construed in the appropriate manner to
ensure such intentions are realized. For the avoidance of doubt, interest
shall not accrue under more than one provision of this Agreement for any
specific period of time.

  



  

3.3 _Pro Rata Payments; Coordination of Benefits_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 3.1_ to the contrary, to the extent
that the aggregate tax benefit of the Corporate Taxpayer's, and/or its wholly
owned Subsidiaries', as applicable, deductions within Net Tax Benefit
(including the Basis Adjustments and Imputed Interest under this Agreement)
is limited in a particular Taxable Year because the Corporate Taxpayer and/or
its wholly owned Subsidiaries, as applicable, does or do not have sufficient
taxable income or other limitations to utilize the tax benefits within Net
Tax Benefit (including the Basis Adjustments or Imputed Interest), the Net Tax
Benefit shall be allocated among all Holders eligible for payments hereunder
in proportion to the respective amounts of Net Tax Benefit that would have
been allocated to each such party if the Corporate Taxpayer and, as
applicable, its wholly owned Subsidiaries, had sufficient taxable income
so that there were no such limitation (or such other limitations did not
apply).

  



  

(b) After taking into account _Section 3.3(a)_, if the Corporate Taxpayer
defers a Tax Benefit Payment in respect of a particular Taxable Year pursuant
to _Section 5.3_, then the Parties agree that no Tax Benefit Payment shall be
made in respect of any Taxable Year until all Tax Benefit Payments in respect
of prior Taxable Years have been made in full. If, as a result of the
deferral described in the foregoing sentence, the Tax Benefit Payments are to
be partially but not fully satisfied with respect to a Taxable Year, such Tax
Benefit Payments shall be made in the same proportion as the Tax Benefit
Payments that would have been paid to the Holders if the Corporate Taxpayer
were to satisfy its obligation in full.

  



   

 | \- 12 -| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

3.4 _No Return of Payments_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the Holders shall not be required to return any previously
made TRA Payment or any other payment hereunder.

  



  

3.5 _Stock and Stockholders of the Corporate Taxpayer_. TRA Payments and any
other payments hereunder are not conditioned on the Holders holding any stock
of the Corporate Taxpayer (or any successor thereto).

  



  

3.6 _Interest Amount Limitation_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, if at any time the applicable Agreed Rate or Default Rate shall
exceed the maximum lawful interest rate that may be contracted for, charged,
taken, received or reserved in accordance with applicable Law (the " _Maximum
Rate_ "), the Agreed Rate and Default Rate (as applicable) shall be
limited to the Maximum Rate; provided, that any amounts unpaid as a result of
such limitation (other than with respect to an Early Termination Payment)
shall be paid (together with interest calculated at the Agreed Rate or the
Default Rate (as applicable) with respect to the period such amounts remained
unpaid) on subsequent payment dates to the extent not exceeding the legal
limitation.

  



  

3.7 _Day Count Convention_. All computations using the Agreed Rate, Default
Rate or Termination Rate shall use the "Actual/360" day count convention.

  



  

Article IV _ 
  
 Termination_

  



  

4.1 _Early Termination and Breach of Agreement_.

  



  

(a) The Corporate Taxpayer may, with the prior written consent of a majority
of the disinterested members of the Board, terminate this Agreement with
respect to all amounts payable to all of the Holders (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any transferee pursuant to _Section 7.5(a)_) at any time
by paying or causing to be paid to such Holders an Early Termination
Payment;  _provided_ , _however_ , that this Agreement shall terminate with
respect to any such Holder only upon the payment of such Early Termination
Payment to such Holder; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Corporate Taxpayer
may withdraw any notice to execute its termination rights under this _Section
4.1(a)_ prior to the time at which any Early Termination Payment has been
paid. Upon payment of an Early Termination Payment to a Holder, the Corporate
Taxpayer shall not have any further payment obligations in respect of such
Holder under this Agreement, other than for any Tax Benefit Payment (i) agreed
to by the Corporate Taxpayer and such Holder as due and payable but unpaid as
of the Early Termination Date, (ii) that is the subject of an Objection
Notice, which will be payable in accordance with resolution of the issues
identified in such Objection Notice pursuant to this Agreement, and (iii) due
for the Taxable Year ending with or including the Early Termination Date
(except to the extent that the amounts described in _clauses (i)_, _(ii)_ and
_(iii)_ above are included in the calculation of the Early Termination
Payment). If an Exchange occurs with respect to Company Units with respect to
which the Corporate Taxpayer has previously paid or cause to be paid to the
applicable Holder an Early Termination Payment, the Corporate Taxpayer shall
have no obligations under this Agreement with respect to such Exchange.

(b) In the event that the Corporate Taxpayer materially breaches any of its
material obligations under this Agreement, whether as a result of failure to
make any payment when due, failure to honor any other material obligation
required hereunder or by operation of Law as a result of the rejection of
this Agreement in a case commenced under the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise,
then all obligations hereunder shall be accelerated, and such obligations
shall be calculated as if an Early Termination Notice had been delivered
on the date of such breach to each Holder and shall include (i) each Early
Termination Payment calculated as if an Early Termination Notice had been
delivered on the date of such breach (and the Corporate Taxpayer shall provide
each Holder with an Early Termination Schedule, which shall become final in
accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section 4.2_), (ii) any
Tax Benefit Payment agreed to by the Corporate Taxpayer and any Holder as due
and payable but unpaid as of the date of such breach, (iii) any Tax Benefit
Payment that is the subject of an Objection Notice, which will be payable in
accordance with resolution of the issues identified in such Objection Notice
pursuant to this Agreement, and (iv) any Tax Benefit Payment due for the
Taxable Year ending with or including the date of such breach, as applicable
(except to the extent that the amounts described in _clauses  (ii)_, _(iii)_
and _(iv)_ above are included in the calculation of the amount described in
_clause (i)_ above). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the
Corporate Taxpayer materially breaches this Agreement, each Holder shall be
entitled to elect to receive the amounts set forth in _clauses (i)_, _(ii)_
,  _(iii)_ and _(iv)_ above or to seek specific performance of the terms
hereof. The Parties agree that it will not be considered to be a material
breach of a material obligation under this Agreement to make a payment due
pursuant to this Agreement within 30 calendar days of the date such payment
is due (for the avoidance of doubt, taking into account _Sections  3.6_,
_5.2_ and _5.3_ ).

  



  

4.2 _Early Termination Notice_. If the Corporate Taxpayer chooses to
exercise its right of early termination under _Section 4.1_, the Corporate
Taxpayer shall deliver to the Holders Representative notice of such intention
to exercise such right (" _Early Termination Notice_ ") and a schedule (the "
_Early Termination Schedule_ ") specifying the Corporate Taxpayer's intention
to exercise such right and showing in reasonable detail the calculation of the
Early Termination Payment for each Holder. The Early Termination Schedule
will become final and binding with respect to the Holders Representative and
each Holder and its Affiliates 30 calendar days from the first date on which
the Corporate Taxpayer sent the Holders Representative such Early Termination
Schedule unless (a) the Holders Representative within 30 calendar days after
the date the Corporate Taxpayer sent such Schedule or amendment thereto
provides the Corporate Taxpayer with an Objection Notice with respect to such
Early Termination Schedule or (b) the Holders Representative provides a
written waiver of the right to provide any Objection Notice with respect to
such Schedule or amendment thereto within the period described in _clause (a)_
above, in which case such Schedule or amendment thereto becomes binding on
the date the waiver is received by the Corporate Taxpayer. If the Corporate
Taxpayer and the Holders Representative, for any reason, are unable to
resolve the issues raised in such Objection Notice within 30 calendar days
after receipt by the Corporate Taxpayer of the Objection Notice, the Corporate
Taxpayer and the Holders Representative shall employ the Reconciliation
Procedures. The date on which every Early Termination Schedule under this
Agreement becomes final with respect to all Holders in accordance with this
_Section 4.2_ shall be the " _Early Termination Effective Date_ ".

  



   

 | \- 14 -| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

4.3 _Payment upon Early Termination_.

  



  

(a) Within five Business Days after the Early Termination Effective Date, the
Corporate Taxpayer shall pay or cause to be paid to each Holder an amount
equal to its Early Termination Payment. Such payment shall be made, at the
sole discretion of the Corporate Taxpayer, by wire or Automated Clearing
House transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account or accounts
designated by the Holder or as otherwise agreed by the Corporate Taxpayer and
the Holder.

  



  

(b) An " _Early Termination Payment_ " in respect of a Holder shall equal the
net present value, discounted at the Early Termination Rate as of the Early
Termination Date, of all Tax Benefit Payments that would be required to be
paid by the Corporate Taxpayer to such Holder under _Section 3.1(a)_
beginning from the Early Termination Date and assuming that the Valuation
Assumptions are applied.

  



  

Article V _ 
  
 Subordination and Late Payments_

  



  

5.1 _Subordination_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, any TRA Payment (or portion thereof) required to be made to
a Holder under this Agreement shall rank subordinate and junior in right of
payment to any principal, interest (including interest which accrues after
the commencement of any case or proceeding in bankruptcy, or the
reorganization of the Corporate Taxpayer or any Subsidiary thereof), fees,
premiums, charges, expenses, attorneys' fees or other obligations in respect
of indebtedness for borrowed money of the Corporate Taxpayer (and its wholly-
owned Subsidiaries, if applicable) (" _Senior Obligations_ ") and shall rank
pari passu with all current or future unsecured obligations of the Corporate
Taxpayer (and its wholly-owned Subsidiaries, as applicable) that are not
Senior Obligations.

  



  

5.2 _Late Payments by the Corporate Taxpayer_. The amount of all or any
portion of any TRA Payment not made to the Holders when due under the terms
of this Agreement (taking into account any deferral under _Section 5.3_) shall
be payable together with any interest thereon, computed at the Default Rate
and commencing from the date on which such TRA Payment was due and payable.

  



  

5.3 _Payment Deferral_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided herein, to the extent
that, at the time any TRA Payment becomes due and payable hereunder, (i) the
Corporate Taxpayer Group is not permitted, pursuant to the terms of any
outstanding or committed indebtedness for borrowed money to make such TRA
Payment, or if, after making such TRA Payment, the Corporate Taxpayer Group
would be in breach or default under the terms of any such indebtedness, or
(ii) (A) the Corporate Taxpayer does not have the cash on hand to make such
TRA Payment, and (B) the Corporate Taxpayer is not able to obtain cash from
the Corporate Taxpayer Group to fund such TRA Payment because (1) the
Corporate Taxpayer Group is not permitted, pursuant to the terms of any such
indebtedness, to make tax distributions or similar payments to the Corporate
Taxpayer to allow it to make such TRA Payment, or if, after making such TRA
Payment, the Corporate Taxpayer Group would be in breach or default under the
terms of any such indebtedness or (2) the applicable member of the Corporate
Taxpayer Group does not have the cash on hand to make the payment described
in _clause (1)_ above, then, in each case, upon prior notice to the Holders
Representative, the Corporate Taxpayer shall be permitted to defer such TRA
Payment until the condition described in _clauses (i)_ or _(ii)_ above is no
longer applicable.

  



   

 | \- 15 -| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) If the Corporate Taxpayer defers any TRA Payment (or portion thereof)
pursuant to _Section 5.3(a)_, such deferred amount shall accrue interest at
the Agreed Rate, from the date that such amounts originally became due and
owing pursuant to the terms hereof to the Payment Date, compounded annually,
and such deferred amounts shall not be treated as late payments or as
a breach of any obligation under this Agreement.

  



  

Article VI _ 
  
 Certain Covenants_

  



  

6.1 _Participation in the Corporate Taxpayer 's and the Company's Tax
Matters_. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Corporate Taxpayer shall
have full responsibility for, and sole discretion over, all Tax matters
concerning the Corporate Taxpayer, the Company and their respective
Subsidiaries, including the preparation, filing or amending of any Tax Return
and defending, contesting or settling any issue pertaining to Taxes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporate Taxpayer shall notify the Holders
Representative of, and keep the Holders Representative reasonably informed
with respect to, the portion of any audit of the Corporate Taxpayer and the
Company by a Taxing Authority the outcome of which is reasonably expected to
affect the rights and obligations of the Holders and their Affiliates under
this Agreement, and shall provide to the Holders Representative reasonable
opportunity to provide information and other input to the Corporate Taxpayer,
the Company and their respective advisors concerning the conduct of any such
portion of such audit.

  



  

6.2 _Consistency_. The Corporate Taxpayer and each Holder agree to report
and cause to be reported for all purposes, including federal, state and local
Tax purposes, all Tax-related items (including the Basis Adjustments and each
Tax Benefit Payment and any Imputed Interest) in a manner consistent with
that specified by the Corporate Taxpayer in any Schedule provided by or on
behalf of the Corporate Taxpayer under this Agreement unless otherwise
required by Law based on written advice of an Advisory Firm.

  



  

6.3 _Cooperation_. Each Holder shall (a) furnish to the Corporate Taxpayer
in a timely manner such information, documents and other materials as
the Corporate Taxpayer may reasonably request for purposes of making any
determination or computation necessary or appropriate under this Agreement,
preparing any Tax Return, complying with any Tax Law, or contesting or
defending any audit, examination or controversy with any Taxing Authority or
other governmental authority, (b) make itself available to the Corporate
Taxpayer and its representatives to provide explanations of documents and
materials and such other information as the Corporate Taxpayer or its
representatives may reasonably request in connection with any of the matters
described in _clause (a)_ above, and (c) reasonably cooperate in connection
with any such matter, and the Corporate Taxpayer shall reimburse the Holders
for any reasonable third-party costs and expenses incurred pursuant to this
_Section 6.3_.

constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely

intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or
remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

  



  

7.4 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be

merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the
business or assets of the Corporate Taxpayer, by written agreement, expressly
to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the
same extent that the Corporate Taxpayer would be required to perform if no
such succession had taken place (except to the extent expressly provided by
this Agreement).

  



   

 | \- 18 -| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

7.6 _Titles and Subtitles_. The titles of the sections and subsections of
this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and are not to be
considered in construing this Agreement.

  



  

7.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted and
enforced in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving
effect to any choice of Law or conflict of Laws rules or provisions (whether
of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

  



  

7.8 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each Party irrevocably
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State
of Delaware (unless the Federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over the
matter, in which case the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware, or the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware does not have
jurisdiction, in which case the Superior Court of the State of Delaware) for
the purposes of any legal proceeding arising out of this Agreement, and
agrees to commence any such legal proceeding only in such courts. Each Party
further agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by
United States registered mail to such Party's respective address set forth
herein shall be effective service of process for any such legal proceeding.
Each Party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying
of venue of any legal proceeding out of this Agreement in such courts, and
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or
claim in any such court that any such legal proceeding brought in any such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. EACH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER AT LAW, IN EQUITY, BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF SUCH
PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

  



  

7.9 _Reconciliation_. In the event that the Corporate Taxpayer and the
Holders Representative are unable to resolve a disagreement with respect to
the matters governed by _Article II_ or _Article IV_ within the relevant
period designated in this Agreement (" _Reconciliation Dispute_ "), the
Reconciliation Dispute shall be submitted for determination to a nationally
recognized expert (the " _Expert_ ") in the particular area of disagreement
mutually acceptable to such Parties. The Expert shall be a partner or
principal in a nationally recognized accounting or law firm, and (unless
the Corporate Taxpayer and the Holders Representative agree otherwise), the
Expert shall not, and the firm that employs the Expert shall not, have any
material relationship with the Corporate Taxpayer or the Holders
Representative or their Affiliates or other actual or potential conflict of
interest. If the Parties are unable to agree on an Expert within 15 calendar
days of the end of the 30 calendar-day period set forth in _Sections 2.1_ or
_4.2_ , the Expert shall be appointed by the International Chamber of
Commerce Centre for Expertise. The Expert shall resolve any matter relating to
the Early Termination Schedule or an amendment thereto within 30 calendar
days and shall resolve any matter relating to a Tax Benefit Schedule or
an amendment thereto within 15 calendar days or, in each case, as soon
thereafter as is reasonably practicable, in each case after the matter has
been submitted to the Expert for resolution. If the matter is not resolved
before any payment that is the subject of a disagreement would be due (in the
absence of such disagreement), the undisputed amount shall be paid on the date
prescribed by this Agreement, subject to adjustment upon resolution. For the
avoidance of doubt, this _Section 7.9_ shall not restrict the ability of the
Corporate Taxpayer or its Affiliates to determine when or whether to file or
amend any Tax Return. The costs and expenses relating to the engagement of
such Expert or amending any Tax Return shall be borne equally by the
Corporate Taxpayer and the Holders (on a pro rata basis based on relative
proportion of all Early Termination Payments under this Agreement, measured
by present value of payments due under this Agreement, using the present value
calculation and assumptions described under  _Section 4.3(b)_ assuming for
such purpose the Early Termination Date is the date the Reconciliation Dispute
is resolved) participating in the Reconciliation Dispute. The Corporate
Taxpayer may withhold payments under this Agreement to collect amounts due
under the preceding sentence. Any dispute as to whether a dispute is a
Reconciliation Dispute within the meaning of this _Section 7.9_ shall be
decided by the Expert. The Expert shall finally determine any Reconciliation
Dispute and the determinations of the Expert pursuant to this _Section 7.9_
shall be binding on the Corporate Taxpayer and the Holders Representative
and/or its Affiliates, as applicable, participating in the Reconciliation
Dispute and may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction.

  



   

 | \- 19 -| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

7.10 _Withholding_. The Corporate Taxpayer shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold or cause to be deducted and withheld from any payment payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as the Corporate Taxpayer determines
in good faith it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign tax Law, _provided_ , that, (a) the Corporate Taxpayer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to notify any applicable Holder of its intent
to withhold at least ten Business Days prior to withholding such amounts and
(b) except with respect to any withholding obligation resulting from
any change in Law arising on or after the date hereof, the Corporate Taxpayer
shall not withhold on account of U.S. federal income Taxes with respect to an
applicable Holder that provides (i) a properly prepared and executed
certificate of non-foreign status under Treasury Regulations Section
1.1445-2(b)(2) and (ii) an IRS Form W-9 claiming a complete exemption from
backup withholding.

  



  

To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
Taxing Authority by the Corporate Taxpayer, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Holder.

  



  

7.11 _Admission of the Corporate Taxpayer into a Consolidated Group;
Transfers of Corporate Assets_.

  



  

(a) If the Corporate Taxpayer and its wholly owned Subsidiaries are or become
members of a combined, consolidated, affiliated or unitary group that files a
consolidated, combined or unitary income tax return pursuant to Sections 1501
_et seq._ of the Code or any corresponding provisions of state or local Law,
then: (i) the provisions of this Agreement shall be applied with respect
to the relevant group as a whole; and (ii) TRA Payments, Net Tax Benefit,
Cumulative Net Realized Tax Benefit, Realized Tax Benefit or Detriment and
other applicable items hereunder shall be computed with reference to the
consolidated (or combined or unitary, where applicable) taxable income, gain,
loss, deduction and attributes of the relevant group as a whole.

  



   

 | \- 20 -| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) If any entity that is or may be obligated to make a TRA Payment, or any
entity any portion of the income of which is included in the income of the
Corporate Taxpayer's consolidated, combined, affiliated or unitary group,
directly or indirectly transfers (as determined for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) one or more assets to a Person classified as a corporation for U.S.
income tax purposes with which such entity does not file a consolidated
income tax return pursuant to Section 1501 _et seq._ of the Code (or, for
purposes of calculations relating to state or local taxes, a consolidated,
combined or unitary income tax return under applicable state or local Law),
such entity, for purposes of calculating the amount of any TRA Payment ( _e_.
_g._ , calculating the gross income of the entity and, if applicable,
determining the Realized Tax Benefit of such entity) due hereunder, shall be
treated as having disposed of such asset in a fully taxable transaction on the
date of such transfer. The consideration deemed to be received by such entity
shall be equal to the fair market value of the transferred asset, increased by
the amount of debt that would increase the transferor's "amount realized" for
U.S. federal income tax purposes in connection with such transfer, in the
case of a contribution of an encumbered asset (including an interest in an
entity classified for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a partnership which
has debt outstanding). For the avoidance of doubt, a transaction treated
for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a liquidation into the Corporate
Taxpayer of one or more of its wholly owned Subsidiaries or merger of one or
more of such entities into one another or the Corporate Taxpayer will not
cause any such Persons to be treated as having disposed of any of its assets
for purposes of this _Section 7.11(b)_. In the event there occurs a
transaction described in the preceding sentence, the Tax Benefit Payments and
any other amounts due under this Agreement shall be calculated without regard
to such transaction.

  



  

7.12 _Confidentiality_. Each Holder and each of its assignees acknowledge
and agree that the information of the Corporate Taxpayer is confidential
and agrees that, until the date that is three years after the termination of
this Agreement in respect of such Holder (or assignee), such Holder (or
assignee) shall keep and retain in the strictest confidence and not disclose
to any Person any confidential matters acquired pursuant to this Agreement of
the Corporate Taxpayer and its Affiliates and successors, learned by the
Holder heretofore or hereafter, except in the course of performing any duties
as necessary for the Corporate Taxpayer and its Affiliates, as required by
Law or legal process or to enforce the terms of this Agreement. This _Section
7.12_ shall not apply to (a) any information that has been made publicly
available by the Corporate Taxpayer or any of its Affiliates, becomes public
knowledge (except as a result of an act of the Holder in violation of this
Agreement) or is generally known to the business community, (b) any
information independently determined by a Holder or provided to a Holder by a
third party on a non-confidential basis and (c) the disclosure of information
to the extent necessary for the Holder to prepare and file its Tax Returns, to
respond to any inquiries regarding the same from any Taxing Authority or to
prosecute or defend any action, proceeding or audit by any Taxing
Authority with respect to such Tax Returns. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein or in any other agreement, the Holders and each of their
assignees (and each employee, representative or other agent of the Holders or
their assignees, as applicable) may disclose to any and all Persons, without
limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure and any related
tax strategies of or relating to the Corporate Taxpayer and its Affiliates,
the Holder or its assignee, and any of their transactions or agreements, and
all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are
provided to the Holder or its assignee relating to such tax treatment and tax
structure and any related tax strategies.

  



   

 | \- 21 -| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

If a Holder or an assignee commits a breach, or threatens to commit a breach,
of any of the provisions of this _Section 7.12_, the Corporate Taxpayer and
its Affiliates shall have the right and remedy to have the provisions of this
_Section 7.12_ specifically enforced by injunctive relief or otherwise by any
court of competent jurisdiction without the need to post any bond or other
security, it being acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or threatened
breach shall cause irreparable injury to the Corporate Taxpayer or its
Affiliates and the accounts and funds managed by the Corporate Taxpayer and
that money damages alone shall not provide an adequate remedy to such
Persons. Such rights and remedies shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of,
any other rights and remedies available at law or in equity.

  



  

7.13 _Change in Law_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if,
in connection with an actual or proposed change in Law, a Holder reasonably
believes that the existence of this Agreement could cause income (other than
income arising from receipt of a payment under this Agreement) recognized by
such Holder (or its direct or indirect owners) to be treated as ordinary
income rather than capital gain (or otherwise taxed at ordinary income rates)
for U.S. federal income tax purposes or could have other material adverse tax
consequences to such Holder (or its direct or indirect owners), then at the
election of such Holder and the receipt by such Holder of the written consent
of the Corporate Taxpayer (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) and to the extent specified by such Holder, this
Agreement shall cease to have further effect with respect to such Holder.

  



  

7.14 _Independent Nature of Holders ' Rights and Obligations_. The rights
and obligations of each Holder are independent of the rights and obligations
of any other Holder. No Holder shall be responsible in any way for the
performance of the obligations of any other Holder, nor shall any Holder have
the right to enforce the rights or obligations of any other Holder. The
obligations of each Holder are solely for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable solely by, the Corporate Taxpayer. The decision of each Holder to
enter into this Agreement has been made by such Holder independently of any
other Holder. Nothing contained herein or in any other agreement or document
delivered at any closing (other than the Company AandR Regulations and any
joinder thereto), and no action taken by any Holder pursuant hereto or
thereto, shall be deemed to constitute the Holders as a partnership, an
association, a joint venture or any other kind of entity, or create a
presumption that the Holders are in any way acting in concert or as a group
with respect to such rights or obligations or the transactions contemplated
hereby, and the Corporate Taxpayer acknowledges that the Holders are not
acting in concert or as a group and will not assert any such claim with
respect to such rights or obligations or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 | \- 3 -| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) So long as this Agreement remains in effect, in addition to any

the Board shall not be increased without the approval of a majority of the
Board present and voting, which approval must include at least one IRA
Director.

  



  

(c) For so long as the Investors have the right to designate individuals for
nomination to the Board under this Agreement, the following procedures shall
be followed with respect to the nomination of the IRA Directors pursuant to
_Section 2(a)_ and any vacancy created by the death, resignation,

disqualification or removal of any IRA Director may be filled by the
Board only with a director nominee selected by the Investors (acting through
the Investors Representative), and the IRA Director so chosen shall hold
office until the next election of directors at an annual or special meeting of
the stockholders and until his or her successor is duly elected and
qualified, or until his or her earlier death, resignation, retirement,

(ii) So long as the Investors satisfy the Minimum Threshold, the Company
shall notify the Investors Representative in writing of the date on which
proxy materials are expected to be mailed by the Company in connection with an
election of directors at an annual or special meeting of the stockholders
(and the Company shall deliver such notice at least 60 days (or such shorter
period to which the Investors Representative consents in writing) prior to
such expected mailing date or such earlier date as may be specified by the

opportunity to review and provide comments on any portion of the proxy
materials relating to the IRA Director or the rights and obligations provided
under this Agreement and to discuss any such comments with the Company.
The Company shall notify the Investors Representative of any opposition to an
IRA Director sufficiently in advance of the date on which such proxy
materials are to be mailed by the Company in connection with such election of
directors so as to enable the Investors (acting through the Investors
Representative) to propose a replacement IRA Director, if necessary, in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and the Investors (acting

Investors' nominee(s), as the case may be, for IRA Director(s), along with
any other information reasonably requested by the Board to evaluate the
suitability of such candidate(s) for directorship; _provided_ , that in no
event shall the Investors Representative or Investors be required to provide
any such notice of the nominees with respect to any IRA Director that is then
currently serving on the Board and that has not provided notice in writing to
the Company of his or her decision not to stand for re-election at that year's
annual meeting. With respect to any Investors' nominee, the Investors
Representative shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that
any such nominee substantially satisfies all reasonable stated criteria and
guidelines for director nominees of the Company (it being understood and
agreed that each of the IRA Directors on the Effective Date meet such
criteria). The Company shall be entitled to rely on any written direction
from the Investors Representative regarding the Investors' nominee(s) without
further action by the Company.

  



  

   

 | \- 4 -| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iv) The Board (or any authorized committee thereof) shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to the fullest extent of the DGCL and other applicable law
to nominate and include in the slate of nominees recommended by the Board for
election at any meeting of stockholders called for the purpose of electing
directors the persons designated pursuant to this _Section 2_ and to nominate
and recommend each such individual to be elected as an IRA Director as
provided herein, and to solicit proxies or consents in favor
thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board may nominate an individual
who previously served as an IRA Director or any other person associated or
affiliated with the Investors for election or re-election to the Board at any
time.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and without
any further action by the Company, the Investors' right to nominate any
person to the Board shall automatically terminate, and be of no further force
and effect, on the date that the Investors beneficially own less than the
Minimum Threshold; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the Investors beneficially
own less than the Minimum Threshold, the IRA Directors shall, at the request
of remaining members of the Board, resign from the Board.

  



  

(e) Each of the IRA Directors, upon appointment or election to the Board,
will be governed by the same protections and obligations as all other
directors of the Company, including, without limitation, protections and
obligations regarding customary liability insurance for directors and
officers, conflicts of interests, fiduciary duties, trading and disclosure
policies, director evaluation process, director code of ethics, director
share ownership guidelines, stock trading and pre-approval policies, and other
governance matters. The Company agrees that it shall enter into an
indemnification agreement with each IRA Director as of the Effective Date in
the same form as indemnification agreements entered into with each of the
other members of the Board, and shall enter into substantially similar
indemnification agreements whenever a new IRA Director becomes a member of the
Board.

  



  

(f) Each of the IRA Directors that is a non-employee director shall preserve
the confidentiality of Company business and information,
including discussions or matters considered in meetings of the Board or Board
committees to the extent not disclosed publicly by the Company in a manner
consistent with the confidentiality requirements applicable to all non-
employee Board members; _provided_ that, subject to the Company and each of
the IRA Directors that is a non-employee director entering into a customary
and reasonable mutually acceptable confidentiality agreement (to the extent
that such an agreement is requested of other non-employee Board members
with respect to sharing of such information with their representatives and
Affiliates), such IRA Director shall be entitled to discuss Company business
and matters discussed at meetings of the Board with other representatives of
the Investors and their Affiliates so long as such interaction is covered by
such confidentiality agreement and does not, based on the advice of counsel to
the Company, jeopardize any attorney-client privilege.

  



  

   

 | \- 5 -| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(g) So long as this Agreement shall remain in effect, subject to applicable
legal requirements, the Bylaws and the Certificate shall accommodate and not
in any respect conflict with the rights and obligations set forth herein.

  



  

3\. _Investors Observer Rights_. Subject to the applicability of the DGCL,
SEC Rules, and Stock Exchange or other national stock exchange
requirements on which the Class A Common Stock may then be listed, if, after
the Effective Date and for as long thereafter as the Investors beneficially
own on a continuous basis, in the aggregate, at least 15% in voting power of
the then outstanding Capital Stock of the Company entitled to vote generally
in the election of directors, the Company will permit a representative of the
Investors selected by the Investors (acting through the Investors
Representative) (the " _Investor Observer_ "), to attend any and all meetings
of the Board, in a non-voting capacity and, in this respect, the Company shall
give the Investor Observer copies of all notices, minutes, consents and
other materials that it provides to its directors at the same time and in
the same manner as provided to such directors; provided, however, that the
Investor Observer shall agree to hold in confidence and trust all information
so provided and enter into a non-disclosure agreement in customary form if
requested by the Company; provided, further, that the Company may withhold
any information and exclude the Investor Observer from any meeting or portion
thereof if access to such information or attendance at such meeting could
adversely affect the attorney-client privilege between the Company and its
counsel or result in disclosure of trade secrets or a conflict of interests,
or if the Investor Observer is employed by or provides services to a
competitor of the Company.

  



  

4\. _Miscellaneous_.

  



  

(a) _Successors and Assigns; Third-Party Beneficiaries._ Any assignment of
this Agreement or any of the rights or obligations under this Agreement by
any of the Parties (whether by operation of law or otherwise) shall be void,
invalid and of no effect without the prior written consent of the other
parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that the rights under this Agreement may be
assigned by the Investors to a Permitted Transferee, subject to and in
accordance with the terms of the Strike Company Agreement. The terms and
conditions of this Agreement inure to the benefit of and are binding upon the
respective successors and permitted assignees of the parties. Nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any party other than
the parties hereto or their respective successors and permitted assignees any
rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this
Agreement, except as expressly provided herein.).

  



  

(b) _Termination_. This Agreement shall terminate at such time as the
Investors or any assignee of the Investors, as permitted under _Section 4(a)_
 hereof, no longer has the authority to nominate a director to the Board of
the Company pursuant to _Section 2_. Upon such termination, no Party shall
have any further obligations or liabilities hereunder; _provided_ that such
termination shall not relieve any party from liability for any breach of this
Agreement prior to such termination.

  



  

   

 | \- 6 -| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction_. This Agreement is to be
governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the internal laws
of the State of Delaware, without regard to its rules of conflict of laws.
Each of the Parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Delaware Court of Chancery in New Castle County, or in the event (but only in
the event) that such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over
such action, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. A
final judgment in any such Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by Law. To the extent that service of process by mail is permitted by
applicable Law, each Party irrevocably consents to the service of process in
any such Action in such courts by the mailing of such process by registered or
certified mail, postage prepaid, at its address for notices provided for in
this Agreement. Each Party irrevocably agrees not to assert (1) any objection
which it may ever have to the laying of venue of any such Action in the
Delaware Court of Chancery in New Castle County, or in the event (but only in
the event) that such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such
action, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and (2)
any claim that any such Action brought in any such court has been brought in
an inconvenient forum

(k) _Enforcement of Agreement_. Each Party's obligation under this Agreement
is unique. The Parties acknowledge that money damages would not be an
adequate remedy at law if any Party fails to perform in any material respect
any of its obligations hereunder and accordingly agree that each Party, in
addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled, at law or in equity,
shall be entitled to seek an injunction or similar equitable relief
restraining such Party from committing or continuing any such breach or
threatened breach or to seek to compel specific performance of the
obligations of any other Party under this Agreement, without the posting of
any bond, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement in
any court of the United States or any State thereof having jurisdiction, and
if any action should be brought in equity to enforce any of the provisions of
this Agreement, none of the Parties shall raise the defense that there is an
adequate remedy at law. No remedy shall be exclusive of any other remedy, and
all available remedies shall be cumulative.

Holders) pursuant to _Section 6.01_.

  



  

(d) When effective, the Shelf Registration Statement (including any documents
incorporated therein by reference) will comply as to form in all material
respects with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading (in the case of any prospectus

Section 2.02 _Shelf Underwritten Offerings_.

  



  

(a) In the event that any Holder or group of Holders elects to dispose of
Registrable Securities under the Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to an
Underwritten Offering and reasonably expects gross proceeds of at least $10
million from such Underwritten Offering (including proceeds attributable to
any Registrable Securities included in such Underwritten Offering by any Shelf
Piggybacking Holders), Holdings shall, at the request (a " _Shelf
Underwritten Offering Request_ ") of such Holder or Holders (in such
capacity, the " _Requesting Holders_ "), enter into an underwriting agreement
in a form as is customary in Underwritten Offerings with the underwriter or
underwriters selected pursuant to _Section 2.02(d)_ and shall take all such
other reasonable actions as are requested by the Managing Underwriter of such
Underwritten Offering and/or the Requesting Holders in order to expedite or
facilitate the disposition, subject to _Section 2.02(c)_ , of such
Registrable Securities and the Registrable Securities requested to be
included by any Shelf Piggybacking Holder (a " _Shelf Underwritten Offering_
"); _provided, however_ , that Holdings shall have no obligation to facilitate
or participate in more than (i) one Shelf Underwritten Offering during any
180-day period or (ii) (A) a total of three Shelf Underwritten Offerings
initiated by the Sponsor, (B) a total of three Shelf Underwritten Offerings
initiated by OEP or (C) a total of three Shelf Underwritten Offerings
initiated by Pate Holding; _provided further_ , that a Shelf Underwritten
Offering that is commenced but terminated for any reason prior to the
execution of an underwriting agreement with respect thereto will not be
counted as a Shelf Underwritten Offering for purposes of the foregoing
limitations on the number Shelf Underwritten Offerings.

  



  

(b) If Holdings receives a Shelf Underwritten Offering Request, it will give
written notice of such proposed Shelf Underwritten Offering to each Holder
(other than the Requesting Holders) that, together with such Holder's
Affiliates, holds at least the Minimum Number of Registrable Securities,
which notice shall be held in strict confidence by such Holders and shall
include the anticipated filing date of the related Underwritten Offering
Filing and, if known, the number of shares of Class A Common Stock (or
other equity securities of the same class as the Registrable Securities) that
are proposed to be included in such Shelf Underwritten Offering, and of such
Holders' rights under this _Section 2.02(b)_. Such notice shall be given
promptly (and in any event at least five (5) Business Days before the filing
of the Underwritten Offering Filing or two (2) Business Days before
the filing of the Underwritten Offering Filing in connection with a bought or
overnight Underwritten Offering); _provided_ , that if the Shelf Underwritten
Offering is a bought or overnight Underwritten Offering and the Managing
Underwriter advises Holdings and the Requesting Holders that the giving of
notice pursuant to this _Section 2.02(b)_ would adversely affect the
offering, no such notice shall be required (and such Holders shall have no
right to include Registrable Securities in such bought or
overnight Underwritten Offering); and _provided further_ , that Holdings
shall not so notify any such other Holder that has notified Holdings (and not
revoked such notice) requesting that such Holder not receive notice from
Holdings of any proposed Shelf Underwritten Offering. Each such Holder shall
then have four (4) Business Days (or one (1) Business Day in the case of a
bought or overnight Underwritten Offering) after the date on which the
Holders received notice pursuant to this _Section 2.02(b)_ to
request inclusion of Registrable Securities in the Shelf Underwritten
Offering (which request shall specify the maximum number of
Registrable Securities intended to be disposed of by such Holder and such
other information as is reasonably required to effect the inclusion of such
Registrable Securities) (any such Holder making such request, a " _Shelf
Piggybacking Holder_ "). If no request for inclusion from a Holder is
received within such period, such Holder shall have no further right to
participate in such Shelf Underwritten Offering.

(c) If the Managing Underwriter of the Shelf Underwritten Offering shall
advise Holdings and the Requesting Holders in writing, with a copy to be
provided upon request to any Shelf Piggybacking Holder, of its belief that the
number of Registrable Securities requested to be included in such Shelf
Underwritten Offering by the Requesting Holders and any Shelf Piggybacking
Holders, together with any Holdings Securities or Other Securities requested
or proposed to be included in such Shelf Underwritten Offering, exceeds the
Maximum Number of Securities for such Shelf Underwritten Offering, then
Registrable Securities, Holdings Securities and Other Securities shall be
included in the Shelf Underwritten Offering, up to the Maximum Number of
Securities (as set forth in such written advice from the Managing
Underwriter), in the following priority:

  



  

(i) _first_ , the Registrable Securities requested to be included in such
Shelf Underwritten Offering by the Requesting Holders and the
Shelf Piggybacking Holders, _pro rata_ among the Requesting Holders and the
Shelf Piggybacking Holders based on the respective numbers of Registrable
Securities that each requested be included; and

  



  

(ii) _second_ , to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not
been reached under the foregoing clause (i), any Holdings Securities or Other
Securities requested or proposed to be included in such Shelf Underwritten
Offering allocated, as applicable, in accordance with the order of priority
established in the agreement or agreements granting the registration rights
with respect to any such Other Securities.

  



  

(d) The Managing Underwriter and any other underwriters for any Shelf
Underwritten Offering shall be selected by Holdings; _provided _ that the
Managing Underwriter shall be reasonably acceptable to the Requesting Holders.
The Requesting Holders shall determine the pricing of the Registrable
Securities offered pursuant to any Shelf Underwritten Offering and the
applicable underwriting discounts and commissions and determine the timing of
any such Shelf Underwritten Offering, subject to _Section 2.03_.

  



  

Section 2.03 _Delay and Suspension Rights_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, Holdings may (a) delay filing or effectiveness
of the Shelf Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or effecting a
Shelf Underwritten Offering or (b) suspend the Holders' use of any prospectus
that is a part of the Shelf Registration Statement upon written notice
to each Holder whose Registrable Securities are included in the Shelf
Registration Statement ( _provided_ that in no event shall such notice
contain any material non-public information regarding Holdings) (in which
event such Holder shall discontinue sales of Registrable Securities pursuant
to the Shelf Registration Statement but may settle any then-contracted sales
of Registrable Securities), in each case for a period of up to 60 days, if
Holdings' board of directors determines upon the advice of legal counsel (x)
that such delay or suspension is in the best interest of Holdings and its
stockholders generally due to a pending financing or other transaction
involving Holdings, including a proposed sale of Class A Common Stock by
Holdings for its own account, (y) that such registration or offering would
render Holdings unable to comply with applicable securities laws or (z) that
such registration or offering would require disclosure of material
information that Holdings has a _bona fide_ business purpose for preserving
as confidential (any such period, a " _Suspension Period_ "); _provided,
however_ , that in no event shall any Suspension Periods collectively exceed
an aggregate of 120 days in any twelve-month period and there shall be no
more than two Suspension Periods.

Section 2.04 _Piggyback Registration Rights_.

  



  

(a) Subject to _Section 2.04(c)_ , if Holdings at any time proposes to file
an Underwritten Offering Filing for an Underwritten Offering of shares of
Class A Common Stock (or other equity securities of the same class as the
Registrable Securities) for its own account or for the account of any other
Persons who have or have been granted registration rights (a " _Piggyback
Underwritten Offering_ "), it will give written notice of such Piggyback
Underwritten Offering to each Holder that, together with such Holder's
Affiliates, holds at least the Minimum Number of Registrable Securities, which
notice shall be held in strict confidence by such Holders and shall include
the anticipated filing date of the Underwritten Offering Filing and, if known,
the number of shares of Class A Common Stock (or other equity securities of
the same class as the Registrable Securities) that are proposed to be
included in such Piggyback Underwritten Offering, and of such Holders' rights
under this _Section 2.04(a)_. Such notice shall be given promptly (and in any
event at least five (5) Business Days before the filing of the Underwritten
Offering Filing or two (2) Business Days before the filing of the
Underwritten Offering Filing in connection with a bought or
overnight Underwritten Offering); _provided_ , that if the Piggyback
Underwritten Offering is a bought or overnight Underwritten Offering and the
Managing Underwriter advises Holdings that the giving of notice pursuant to
this _Section 2.04(a)_ would adversely affect the offering, no such notice
shall be required (and such Holders shall have no right to include Registrable
Securities in such bought or overnight Underwritten Offering). Each such
Holder shall then have four (4) Business Days (or one (1) Business Day in the
case of a bought or overnight Underwritten Offering) after the date on which
the Holders received notice pursuant to this _Section 2.04(a)_ to request
inclusion of Registrable Securities in the Piggyback Underwritten Offering
(which request shall specify the maximum number of Registrable Securities
intended to be disposed of by such Holder and such other information as is
reasonably required to effect the inclusion of such Registrable Securities)
(any such Holder making such request, a " _Piggybacking Holder_ "). If no
request for inclusion from a Holder is received within such period, such
Holder shall have no further right to participate in such Piggyback
Underwritten Offering. Subject to _Section 2.04(c)_ , Holdings shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to include in the Piggyback Underwritten
Offering all Registrable Securities that Holdings has been so requested to
include by the Piggybacking Holders; _provided, however_ , that if, at any
time after giving written notice of a proposed Piggyback Underwritten
Offering pursuant to this _Section 2.04(a)_ and prior to the execution of an
underwriting agreement with respect thereto, Holdings or such other Persons
who have or have been granted registration rights, as applicable, shall
determine for any reason not to proceed with or to delay such Piggyback
Underwritten Offering, Holdings shall give written notice of
such determination to the Piggybacking Holders (which such Holders will hold
in strict confidence) and (i) in the case of a determination not to proceed,
shall be relieved of its obligation to include any Registrable Securities in
such Piggyback Underwritten Offering (but not from any obligation of Holdings
to pay the Registration Expenses in connection therewith), and (ii) in the
case of a determination to delay, shall be permitted to delay inclusion of
any Registrable Securities for the same period as the delay in including the
Holdings Securities or Other Securities, as applicable.

  



   

 | 11 | 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Each Holder shall have the right to withdraw its request for inclusion of
its Registrable Securities in any Piggyback Underwritten Offering at any time
prior to the execution of an underwriting agreement with respect thereto by
giving written notice to Holdings of its request to withdraw. Any Holder may
deliver written notice (a " _Piggyback Opt-Out Notice_ ") to Holdings
requesting that such Holder not receive notice from Holdings of any proposed
Piggyback Underwritten Offering; _provided, however_ , that such Holder may
later revoke any such Piggyback Opt-Out Notice in writing. Following receipt
of a Piggyback Opt-Out Notice from any Holder (unless subsequently revoked),
Holdings shall not, and shall not be required to, deliver any notice to such
Holder pursuant to this _Section 2.04_ and such Holder shall no longer be
entitled to participate in any Piggyback Underwritten Offering.

  



  

(c) If the Managing Underwriter of the Piggyback Underwritten Offering shall
advise Holdings of its belief that the number of Registrable Securities
requested to be included in such Piggyback Underwritten Offering, together
with the number of Holdings Securities and Other Securities proposed or
requested to be included in such Piggyback Underwritten Offering, exceeds the
Maximum Number of Securities for such Piggyback Underwritten Offering, then
Holdings Securities, Other Securities and Registrable Securities shall be
included in the Piggyback Underwritten Offering, up to the Maximum Number of
Securities (as set forth in such written advice from the
Managing Underwriter), in the following priority:

  



  

(i) If the Piggyback Underwritten Offering is initiated for the account of
Holdings:

  



  

(1) _first_ , all of the Holdings Securities proposed to be included therein;

  



  

(2) _second_ , to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not
been reached under the foregoing clause (1), the Registrable
Securities requested to be included by the Piggybacking Holders and any Other
Securities requested to be included by Persons having rights of registration
on parity with the Piggybacking Holders with respect to such offering, _pro
rata_ among the Piggybacking Holders and such other Persons based on the
number of shares of Class A Common Stock (or other equity securities of the
same class as the Registrable Securities) each requested to be included; and

  



  

(3) _third_ , any Other Securities requested to be included by Persons having
rights of registration that are subordinate to the rights of the Piggybacking
Holders with respect to such offering.

  



  

(ii) If the Piggyback Underwritten Offering is initiated for the account of
any other Persons who have or have been granted registration rights:

  



  

(1) _first_ , all of the Other Securities requested to be included therein by
such Persons;

Securities requested to be included by Persons (other than those for the
account of which the Piggyback Underwritten Offering is initiated) having
rights of registration on parity with the Piggybacking Holders with respect
to such offering, _pro rata_ among the Piggybacking Holders and such other
Persons based on the number of shares of Class A Common Stock (or other
equity securities of the same class as the Registrable Securities) each
requested to be included; and

  



  

(3) _third_ , to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not
been reached under the foregoing clauses (1) and (2), any Holdings Securities
proposed to be included and any Other Securities requested to be included by
Persons (other than those for the account of which the Piggyback Underwritten
Offering is initiated) having rights of registration that are subordinate to
the rights of the Piggybacking Holders with respect to such offering,
allocated, as applicable, in accordance with the order of priority
established in the agreement or agreements granting the registration rights
with respect to any such Other Securities.

  



  

(d) Holdings or the other Persons for the account of which the Piggyback
Underwritten Offering is initiated, as applicable, shall select
the underwriters in any Piggyback Underwritten Offering and shall determine
the pricing of the shares of Class A Common Stock (or other securities of the
same class as Registrable Securities) offered pursuant to any Piggyback
Underwritten Offering, the applicable underwriting discounts and commissions
and the timing of any such Piggyback Underwritten Offering.

  



  

Section 2.05 _Participation in Underwritten Offerings_.

  



  

(a) In connection with any Underwritten Offering contemplated by _Section
2.02_ or _Section 2.04_ , the underwriting agreement into which each Selling
Holder and Holdings shall enter into shall contain such representations,
covenants, indemnities (subject to _Article III_ ) and other rights and
obligations as are customary in underwritten offerings of securities. No
Selling Holder shall be required to make any representations or warranties to
or agreements with Holdings or the underwriters other than
representations, warranties or agreements regarding such Selling Holder's
authority to enter into such underwriting agreement and to sell, and its
ownership of, the securities being registered on its behalf, its intended
method of distribution and any other representation required by law.

  



  

(b) In connection with any Piggyback Underwritten Offering in which any
Holder has the right to include Registrable Securities pursuant to _Section
2.04_ , such Holder agrees (i) to supply any information reasonably requested
by Holdings in connection with the preparation of a Registration Statement
and/or any other documents relating to such registered offering and (ii) to
execute and deliver any agreements and instruments being executed by all
holders on substantially the same terms reasonably requested by Holdings or
the Managing Underwriter, as applicable, to effectuate such registered
offering, including, without limitation, underwriting agreements, custody
agreements, lock-ups, "hold back" agreements pursuant to which such Holder
agrees not to sell or purchase any securities of Holdings for the same period
of time following the registered offering as is agreed to by Holdings and the
other participating holders, powers of attorney and questionnaires.

  



   

 | 13 | 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) If Holdings or the Managing Underwriter, as applicable, requests that the
Holders take any of the actions referred to in _Section 2.05(b)(ii)_ , the
Holders shall take such action promptly but in any event within three (3)
Business Days following the date of such request.

  



  

Section 2.06 _Registration Procedures_.

  



  

(a) In connection with its obligations under this _Article II_ , Holdings
will:

  



  

(i) promptly prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and
supplements to such Registration Statement and the prospectus used
in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such Registration
Statement effective and to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act
with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such Registration
Statement until such time as all of such securities have been disposed of in
accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the seller or sellers
thereof set forth in such Registration Statement;

   



  

(ii) furnish to each Selling Holder such number of conformed copies of such
Registration Statement and of each such amendment and supplement thereto (in

other prospectus filed under Rule 424 under the Securities Act, in conformity
with the requirements of the Securities Act, and such other documents, as
such seller may reasonably request;

  



  

(iii) if applicable, use commercially reasonable efforts to register or
qualify all Registrable Securities and other securities covered by such
Registration Statement under such other securities or blue sky laws of such
jurisdictions as each seller thereof shall reasonably request, to keep such
registration or qualification in effect for so long as such Registration
Statement remains in effect, and to take any other action which may be
reasonably necessary or advisable to enable such seller to consummate the
disposition in such jurisdictions of the securities owned by such seller,
except that Holdings shall not for any such purpose be required to qualify
generally to do business as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction wherein
it would not but for the requirements of this clause (iii) be obligated to be
so qualified or to consent to general service of process in any such
jurisdiction;

  



  

(iv) advise each Holder within five (5) Business Days:

(vii) promptly notify each Selling Holder, at any time when a prospectus
relating thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, upon
discovery that, or upon the happening of any event as a result of which, the
prospectus included in such Registration Statement, as then in effect,
includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, and at the request of any such seller promptly prepare and furnish to
such seller a reasonable number of copies of a supplement to or an amendment
of such prospectus as may be necessary so that, as thereafter delivered to the

upon receipt of any notice from Holdings of the happening of any event of the
kind described in _Section 2.06(a)(v)_ , such Holder will forthwith
discontinue such Holder's disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to
the Registration Statement until such Holder's receipt of the copies of the
supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by _Section 2.06(a)(v)_ as
filed with the Commission or until it is advised in writing by Holdings that
the use of such Registration Statement may be resumed, and, if so directed by
Holdings, will deliver to Holdings (at Holdings' expense) all copies, other
than permanent file copies, then in such Holder's possession of the
prospectus relating to such Registrable Securities current at the time of
receipt of such notice. Holdings may provide appropriate stop orders to
enforce the provisions of this _Section 2.06(b)_.

  



  

(c) Any Holder may deliver written notice (including via email in accordance
with _Section 6.02_ ) (an " _Opt-Out Notice_ ") to Holdings requesting that
Holder not receive notices from Holdings otherwise required by this _Section
2.06_ ; provided, however, that Holder may later revoke any such Opt-Out
Notice in writing. Following receipt of an Opt-Out Notice from Holder
(unless subsequently revoked), (i) Holdings shall not deliver any such

supplement, as applicable, to comply with the Securities Act.

  



  

Section 2.08 _Restrictions on Public Sale by Holders_. Each Holder agrees not
to effect any public sale or distribution of Registrable Securities for a
period of up to 90 days following completion of an Underwritten Offering of
equity securities by Holdings; _provided _ that (a) Holdings gives written
notice to such Holder of the date of the commencement and termination of such
period with respect to any such Underwritten Offering and (b) the duration of

Section 2.10 _Other Registration Rights_. From and after the date hereof,
Holdings shall not, without the prior written consent of the Majority
Holders, enter into any agreement with any current or future holder of any
securities of Holdings that would allow such current or future holder to
require Holdings to include securities in any Underwritten Offering Filing on
a basis other than  _pari passu_ with, or expressly subordinate to, the
piggyback rights of the Holders hereunder; _provided_ , that in no event
shall Holdings enter into any agreement that would permit another holder of
securities of Holdings to participate on a _pari passu_ basis (in terms of
priority of cut-back based on advice of underwriters) with the Holders in a
Shelf Underwritten Offering.

  



  

Article III. 
 INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION

  



  

Section 3.01 _Indemnification by Holdings_. Holdings will indemnify and hold
harmless each Selling Holder, its officers and directors and each Person (if
any) that controls such Holder within the meaning of either Section 15 of the
Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including
attorneys' fees) (" _Losses_ ") caused by, arising out of, resulting from or
related to any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact contained in any Registration Statement or prospectus relating to the
Registrable Securities (as amended or supplemented if Holdings shall have
furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or any preliminary
prospectus, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading (in the case of any prospectus, in the
light of the circumstances under which such statement is made),  _provided,
however_ , that such indemnity shall not apply to that portion of such Losses
caused by, or arising out of, any untrue statement, or alleged untrue
statement or any such omission or alleged omission, to the extent such
statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with
information furnished in writing to Holdings by or on behalf of such Holder
expressly for use therein.

  



  

Section 3.02 _Indemnification by the Holders_. Each Holder agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless Holdings, its officers and directors and each
Person (if any) that controls Holdings within the meaning of either Section 15

and all Losses caused by, arising out of, resulting from or related to any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in
any Registration Statement or prospectus relating to Registrable
Securities (as amended or supplemented if Holdings shall have furnished any
amendments or supplements thereto) or any preliminary prospectus, or any
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (in
the case of any prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which such
statement is made), only to the extent such statement or omission was made in
reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing by or
on behalf of such Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement or
prospectus relating to the Registrable Securities, or any amendment or
supplement thereto, or any preliminary prospectus.

Section 3.03 _Indemnification Procedures_. In case any proceeding (including
any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any Person in
respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to _Section 3.01_ or
_Section 3.02_ , such Person (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly
notify the Person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing (provided that the failure of the
Indemnified Party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this _Article III_ , except to
the extent the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure to
give notice), and the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in
such proceeding and, unless in the reasonable opinion of outside counsel to
the Indemnified Party a conflict of interest between the Indemnified Party
and Indemnifying Party may exist in respect of such claim, to assume
the defense thereof jointly with any other Indemnifying Party similarly
notified, to the extent that it chooses, with counsel reasonably satisfactory
to such Indemnified Party, and after notice from the Indemnifying Party to
such Indemnified Party that it so chooses, the Indemnifying Party shall not
be liable to such Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses
subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the
defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (a) if the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense or
employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, (b) if such
Indemnified Party who is a defendant in any action or proceeding which is also
brought against the Indemnifying Party reasonably shall have concluded that
there may be one or more legal defenses available to such Indemnified Party
which are not available to the Indemnifying Party or (c) if representation of
both parties by the same counsel is otherwise inappropriate under applicable
standards of professional conduct then, in any such case, the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to assume or continue its own defense as set forth
above (but with no more than one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties
in each jurisdiction, except to the extent any Indemnified Party or Parties
reasonably shall have concluded that there may be legal defenses available to
such party or parties which are not available to the other Indemnified Parties
or to the extent representation of all Indemnified Parties by the same
counsel is otherwise inappropriate under applicable standards of professional
conduct) and the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for any expenses
therefor. No Indemnifying Party shall, without the written consent of the
Indemnified Party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or
claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought
hereunder (whether or not the Indemnified Party is an actual or potential
party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment
(x) includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all
liability arising out of such action or claim and (y) does not include a
statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act,
by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party.

  



  

Section 3.04 _Contribution_.

  



  

(a) If the indemnification provided for in this _Article III_ is unavailable
to an Indemnified Party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or
liabilities in respect of which indemnity is to be provided hereunder, then
each Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party,
shall to the fullest extent permitted by law contribute to the amount paid or
payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such losses, claims, damages
or liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of such party in connection with the statements or omissions
that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any
other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of Holdings (on
the one hand) and a Holder (on the other hand) shall be determined by
reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact relates to information supplied by such party and the
parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to
correct or prevent such statement or omission.

  



   

 | 18 | 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Holdings and each Holder agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this _Article III_ were determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of
the equitable considerations referred to in _Section 3.04(a)_. The amount
paid or payable by an Indemnified Party as a result of the losses, claims,
damages or liabilities referred to in _Section 3.04(a)_ shall be deemed to
include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with
investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this _Article III_ , no Holder shall be liable for
indemnification or contribution pursuant to this _Article III_ for any amount
in excess of the net proceeds of the offering received by such Holder,
less the amount of any damages which such Holder has otherwise been required
to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

  



  

Article IV. 
 RULE 144

  



  

With a view to making available the benefits of certain rules and regulations
of the Commission that may permit the resale of the Registrable Securities
without registration, Holdings agrees to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to:

  



  

(a) make and keep public information regarding Holdings available, as those
terms are understood and defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act (or any
successor or similar rule adopted by the Commission then in effect), at all
times from and after the date hereof;

  



  

(b) file with the Commission in a timely manner all reports and other
documents required of Holdings under the Exchange Act at all times from and
after the date hereof; and

  



  

(c) so long as a Holder owns any Registrable Securities, furnish (i) to the
extent accurate, forthwith upon request, a written statement of Holdings that
it has complied with the reporting requirements of Rule 144 under the
Securities Act (or any successor or similar rule adopted by the Commission
then in effect) and (ii) unless otherwise available through the Commission's
EDGAR filing system, to such Holder, forthwith upon request, a copy of the
most recent annual or quarterly report of Holdings, and such other reports
and documents so filed as such Holder may reasonably request in availing
itself of any rule or regulation of the Commission allowing such Holder to
sell any such securities without registration.

and such Transferee has delivered to Holdings a duly executed Adoption
Agreement.

Section 6.04 _Complete Agreement_. This Agreement and the Exhibit attached
hereto, and the other documents delivered and contemplated to be delivered by

the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the parties
with respect thereto.

  



  

Section 6.05 _Adjustments Affecting Registrable Securities_. The provisions
of this Agreement shall apply to any and all shares of capital stock of
Holdings or any successor or assignee of Holdings (whether by merger,
consolidation, sale of assets or otherwise) which may be issued in respect

reason of any stock dividend, split, reverse split, combination,

be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the internal
laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its rules of conflict of

of the Delaware Court of Chancery in New Castle County, or in the event (but
only in the event) that such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction
over such action, the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware. A final judgment in any such action shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by law. To the extent that service of process by mail is
permitted by applicable law, each party irrevocably consents to the service
of process in any such action in such courts by the mailing of such process
by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, at its address for notices
provided for in this Agreement. Each party irrevocably agrees not to assert
(a) any objection which it may ever have to the laying of venue of any such
action in the Delaware Court of Chancery in New Castle County, or in the
event (but only in the event) that such court does not have subject matter
jurisdiction over such action, the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware and (b) any claim that any such action brought in any
such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

  



  

Section 6.08 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY
APPLICABLE LAW WHICH CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES, AND

PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE) ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY FORUM IN
RESPECT OF ANY ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR
HEREAFTER ARISING. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INFORMED
BY THE OTHER PARTIES THAT THIS _SECTION 6.08_ CONSTITUTES A MATERIAL
INDUCEMENT UPON WHICH THE PARTIES ARE RELYING AND WILL RELY IN ENTERING INTO
THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS RELATING HERETO OR CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY. ANY PARTY MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS _SECTION
6.08_ WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES TO THE
WAIVER OF THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

Section 6.09 _Amendments and Modifications; Waiver_. This Agreement may be
amended or modified only by a written instrument duly executed by Holdings
and the Majority Holders; _provided, however_ , that notwithstanding the
foregoing, any such amendment or modification that adversely affects any
Holder in a manner that is materially different from any other Holder shall
require the consent of each Holder so affected. No course of dealing between
any Holder or Holdings and any other party hereto or any failure or delay on
the part of a Holder or Holdings in exercising any rights or remedies under
this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of any rights or remedies of any
Holder or Holdings. No single or partial exercise of any rights or remedies
under this Agreement by a party shall operate as a waiver or preclude the
exercise of any other rights or remedies hereunder or thereunder by such
party.

  



  

Section 6.10 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
found to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining
terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or
enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any
other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be so broad
as to be unenforceable, the provision will be interpreted to be only as broad
as is enforceable.

  



  

Section 6.11 _Captions_. The captions contained in this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only and do not form a part of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 6.12 _Construction_. The parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, then this Agreement will be construed as
drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof will
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of
the provisions of this Agreement. Unless otherwise indicated to the contrary
herein by the context or use thereof: (a) any reference or citation in this
Agreement to any federal, state, local or foreign statutes, regulations or
other laws or statutory or regulatory provision shall, when the context
requires, be deemed references or citations to such statutes, regulations,
other laws or provisions, as amended, modified and supplemented from time to
time (and, in the case of a statute, regulation or other law, to (i) any
successor provision and (ii) all rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder); (b) all references to the preamble, recitals, Sections, Articles
or Exhibits are to the preamble, recitals, Sections, Articles or Exhibits of
or to this Agreement; (c) the words "herein", "hereto", "hereof", "hereunder"
and words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular section or paragraph hereof; (d) masculine gender will also
include the feminine and neutral genders and vice versa; (e) words importing
the singular will also include the plural, and vice versa; (f) the words
"include", "including" and "or" mean without limitation by reason of
enumeration; (g) all references to "$" or dollar amounts are to lawful
currency of the United States of America; and (h) time periods within or
following which any payment is to be made or any act is to be done will be
calculated by excluding the day on which the time period commences and
including the day on which the time period ends and by extending the period
to the next Business Day following if the last day of the time period is
not a Business Day.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  



  

This letter agreement (this " _Agreement_ ") relates to a Transaction
Agreement and Plan of Merger entered into as of October ____, 2018 (as
amended, restated, supplemented or modified from time to time, the "
_Transaction Agreement_ "), by and among, OEP Secondary Fund (Strike), LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company, One Equity Partners Secondary Fund,
L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership (the " _Blocker Seller_
"), Strike Capital, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (the " _Company_
"), the unitholders of the Company (collectively, the " _Unit Sellers_ " and
together with Blocker Seller, the " _Sellers_ "), OEP-Strike Seller
Representative, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and Strike, Inc.
(f/k/a Sentinel Energy Services Inc., a Cayman Islands exempted company), a
Delaware corporation (the " _Buyer_ "). Capitalized terms used and not
otherwise defined herein are defined in the Transaction Agreement and shall
have the meanings given to such terms in the Transaction Agreement.

  



  

1\. In order to induce all parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreement, the undersigned hereby
agrees that, from the Closing Date until the earliest of: (a) the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, and (b) the date following the Closing Date
on which Buyer completes a liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other
similar transaction that results in all of the Buyer's stockholders having
the right to exchange their shares of Buyer Capital Stock for cash, securities
or other property (the period between the Closing Date and the earliest of
clauses (a) and (b), the " _Lock-Up Period_ "), the undersigned will not: (i)
sell, offer to sell, contract or agree to sell, hypothecate, pledge, grant any
option to purchase or otherwise dispose of or agree to dispose of, directly
or indirectly, or establish or increase a put equivalent position
or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of
Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission promulgated
thereunder (the " _Exchange Act_ "), with respect to shares of Buyer Class A
Common Stock issued to the undersigned pursuant to the Exchange
Agreement (such shares of Buyer Class A Common Stock, collectively, the "
_Lock-up Shares_ "), (ii) enter into any swap or other arrangement that
transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of
ownership of any of the Lock-up Shares, in cash or otherwise, or (iii)
publicly announce any intention to effect any transaction specified in
clause (i) or (ii).

  



  

   



 



    



  

2\. The undersigned hereby authorizes the Buyer during the Lock-Up Period to
cause its transfer agent for the Lock-up Shares to decline to transfer, and
to note stop transfer restrictions on the stock register and other records
relating to, the Lock-up Shares for which the undersigned is the record
holder and, in the case of Lock-up Shares for which the undersigned is the
beneficial holder but not the record holder, agrees during the Lock-Up Period
to cause the record holder to cause the relevant transfer agent to decline to
transfer, and to note stop transfer restrictions on the stock register and
other records relating to, such Lock-up Shares, if such transfer would
constitute a violation or breach of this Agreement.

  



  

3\. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the undersigned may sell or otherwise
transfer Lock-up Shares during the undersigned's lifetime or on death (or, if
the undersigned is not a natural person, during its existence) (a) if the
undersigned is not a natural person, to its direct or indirect equity holders
or to any of its other Affiliates, (b) to the immediate family members
(including spouses, significant others, lineal descendants, brothers and
sisters) of the undersigned, (c) to a family trust, foundation or
partnership established for the exclusive benefit of the undersigned, its
equity holders or any of their respective immediate family members, or (d) to
a charitable foundation controlled by the undersigned, its equityholders or
any of their respective immediate family members; provided, however, that in
each such case, any such sale or transfer shall be conditioned upon entry by
such transferees into a written agreement, addressed to the Buyer, agreeing
to be bound by these transfer restrictions and the other terms and conditions
of this Agreement and any other documents or instruments reasonably requested

Exhibit J

  



  

 _FORM OF RESTRICTIVE COVENANT AGREEMENT_

  



  

This RESTRICTIVE COVENANT AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), entered into as
of [●], 2019, is made by and between Strike, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the " _Company_ "), and [●] (the " _Restricted Party_ "). The Company and
the Restricted Party are sometimes hereafter referred to individually as a "
_Party_ ," or collectively as the " _Parties_."

  



  

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Transaction Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
October [●], 2018, by and among the Company, the Restricted Party,
Strike Capital, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (" _Strike_ "), and
other parties thereto (as such agreement may be amended or otherwise modified
from time to time, the " _Transaction Agreement_ "), the Company will acquire
certain of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Strike including
the purchase from the Restricted Party of [all] / [●]% of the Recipient's
equity interests in Strike;

  



  

[WHEREAS, concurrently with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by the Transaction Agreement, the Restricted Party entered into an
Exchange Agreement, pursuant to which the Company may acquire the remaining
equity interests in Strike held by the Restricted Party, in exchange for, at
the option of the Company, Class A Common Stock of the Company or cash;]

  



  

WHEREAS, the Restricted Party, in its capacity as [beneficial] / [an] owner
of equity securities of Strike will receive significant cash proceeds
[and Class B Common Stock of the Company] in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, the Restricted Party has been active in the management and affairs
of Strike and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Strike Companies_ ");

  



  

WHEREAS, following the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Agreement, Strike will be a Subsidiary of the Company; and

  



  

WHEREAS, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Restricted Party
is a material inducement to the Company's execution and delivery of the
Transaction Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
thereby.

  



  

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants set
forth herein, and other consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the Company and the Restricted Party, intending to
be legally bound, do hereby agree as follows:

  



  

1\. _Definitions_. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have
such meanings ascribed to them in the Transaction Agreement.

  



  

2\. _Non-Solicitation; Non-Competition_.

  



  

(a) For a period of four years following the date hereof (the " _Term_ "),
the Restricted Party shall not, and shall cause [his] Affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly contact or solicit vendors, suppliers, customers or
clients of the Strike Companies with whom the Restricted Party had contact or
about whom the Restricted Party received proprietary, confidential or
otherwise non-public information for the purpose of providing (i) services
relating to pipeline products and services, including new construction, make-
ready, testing, maintenance, repairs, rehabilitation, upgrades, facility
construction and reconnection, (ii) construction services relating to the
installation and construction of mainline and lateral pipelines and associated
facilities, testing and repair, (iii) new and refurbished flow measurement
systems for natural gas and liquid applications, (iv) directional drilling
services for various applications, including gas, oil, water, sewer and
fiber, (v) instrumentation, electrical and control services in the oil and
gas industry, and (vi) maintenance and construction activities in the oil and
gas industry (the " _Business_ ") or intentionally interfere with, disrupt or
attempt to disrupt the relationship, contractual or otherwise, between the
Company or any Strike Company and any vendor, supplier, customer or client of
any Strike Company or in any way encourage them to terminate or otherwise
alter their relationship with the Company or any Strike Company. The
Restricted Party further agrees that during the Term, [he] shall not, and
shall cause [his] Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, provide any
products or services related to the Business to the Company or any of the
Strike Companies' customers and clients. For purposes of this _Section 2_ ,
"customers and clients" shall mean and include those customers and clients
who have an existing contractual relationship with any Strike Company as of
Closing Date.

  



  

   

 | 1 | 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) In addition, the Restricted Party agrees that during the Term, the
Restricted Party will not, for any reason whatsoever, directly or indirectly,
for himself or on behalf of or in conjunction with any other person, company,
partnership, corporation, business or other entity of whatever nature, engage
in, make loans to, own, operate, manage, control, become financially
interested in or otherwise have any connection with, whether as an officer,
director, manager, employee, independent contractor, advisor,
sales representative, consultant, shareholder, owner, partner, member or in
any other capacity, the Business within any portion of the United States (the
" _Territory_ ") and anywhere outside of the Territory where any Strike
Company has engaged in the Business; _provided, however_ , that the passive
ownership by the Restricted Party of 5% or less of the outstanding voting
securities of a publicly traded company will not be deemed to be a breach of
this _Section 2_.

  



  

(c) If, at the time of enforcement of this _Section 2_, a court or other
tribunal shall hold that the duration, geography or scope restrictions stated
herein are unreasonable under circumstances then existing, the Parties agree
that the maximum duration, geography or scope reasonable under such
circumstances shall be substituted for the stated duration, geography or scope
and that the court or other tribunal shall reform the restrictions contained
herein to cover the maximum duration, geography and scope permitted by law.

  



  

3\. _Non-disparagement_. During the Term, neither Party shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates not to, whether in writing or orally, malign, denigrate,
impugn, attack or disparage the other Party (including in the case of the
Restricted Party, the Strike Companies) or their respective predecessors and
successors, or any of the current or former directors, managers, officers,
employees, owners, investors, shareholders, partners, members,
representatives, Affiliates or agents of any of the foregoing, with respect to
any of their respective past or present activities, products or services, or
otherwise publish (whether in writing or orally) statements that tend to
portray any of the aforementioned parties in an unfavorable light or take any
unethical or deceitful action that would materially interfere with
any existing or potential business relationship or contractual arrangement of
the aforementioned parties.

  



  

4.  _Remedies_. The Restricted Party acknowledges that a violation by the
Restricted Party or its Affiliates, as applicable, of any of the covenants
contained in _Section 2_ or _3_ would cause irreparable damage to the Company
in an amount that would be material but not readily ascertainable, and that
any remedy at law (including the payment of damages) would be
inadequate. Accordingly, the Restricted Party agrees that, notwithstanding
any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Company or any Strike
Company shall be entitled (without the necessity of showing economic loss or
other actual damage) to injunctive relief (including temporary restraining
orders, preliminary injunctions and/or permanent injunctions) in any court of
competent jurisdiction for any actual or threatened breach of any of the
covenants set forth in _Section 2_ or _3_ in addition to any other legal or
equitable remedies it may have. The preceding sentence shall not be construed
as a waiver of the rights that the Company may have for damages under this
Agreement or otherwise, and all of the Company's rights shall be unrestricted.

6.  _Notices_. Except as otherwise specifically set forth in this Agreement,
all notices and communications hereunder will be deemed to have been duly
given and made on (a) the date such notice is served by personal delivery upon
the Person for whom it is intended, (b) the date sent if delivered by email
so long as such notice and communication is furnished to a nationally
recognized overnight courier for next Business Day delivery, (c) three
Business Days after mailing if sent by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested, or (d) one Business Day after being furnished to a

each case to the Person at the applicable address or email address set forth

7\. _Governing Law; EXCLUSIVE VENUE_. This Agreement is to be governed by,
and construed and enforced in accordance with, the internal laws of the State
of Delaware, without regard to its rules of conflict of laws. Each of the
Parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware
Court of Chancery in New Castle County, or in the event (but only in the
event) that such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such
action, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. A final
judgment in any such Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.
To the extent that service of process by mail is permitted by applicable Law,
each Party irrevocably consents to the service of process in any such Action
in such courts by the mailing of such process by registered or certified mail,
postage prepaid, at its address for notices provided for in this Agreement.
Each Party irrevocably agrees not to assert (a) any objection which it may
ever have to the laying of venue of any such Action in the Delaware Court of
Chancery in New Castle County, or in the event (but only in the event) that
such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such action, the
United States District Court for the District of Delaware and (b) any claim
that any such Action brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum.

8\. _Successor and Assigns_. This Agreement is binding upon and inures to the
benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
No Party may assign any of such Party's rights or delegate any of such
Party's obligations under this Agreement to any Person without the prior
written consents of the other Parties to this Agreement, and any purported
assignment or delegation without such prior written consents will be void and
of no effect.

  



  

9\. _Amendment_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this
Agreement may be amended at any time only by written agreement between
the Company (with the written approval of the Board of Directors of the
Company) and the Restricted Party, and any provision hereof may be waived
only in writing by the Party who is so waiving (which waiver, if being made by
the Company, shall require written approval of the Board of Directors of the
Company).

  



  

10\. _Counterparts; Facsimile Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in
two or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original but all of
which will constitute but one instrument. This Agreement is effective upon
delivery of one executed counterpart from each Party to the other Parties. The
signatures of all of the Parties need not appear on the same counterpart. The
delivery of signed counterparts by email which includes a copy of the sending
party's signature(s) (including by ".pdf" format) is as effective as signing
and delivering the counterpart in person

  



  

11\. _No Waiver_. No failure or delay on the part of the Company or the
Restricted Party in enforcing or exercising any right or remedy
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof. It is agreed that a waiver by
either Party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate
or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach by that same party.

  



  

12\. _Representations and Warranties; Advice of Counsel_. Prior to execution
of this Agreement, the Restricted Party was advised by the Company of the
Restricted Party's right to seek independent advice from an attorney of the
Restricted Party's own selection regarding this Agreement and the Restricted
Party acknowledges that he has had sufficient opportunity to do so. The
Restricted Party acknowledges that the Restricted Party has entered into this
Agreement knowingly and voluntarily and with full knowledge and understanding
of the provisions of this Agreement after being given the opportunity to
consult with counsel. The Restricted Party further represents that in
entering into this Agreement, the Restricted Party is not relying on any
statements or representations made by any of the Company, the Strike
Companies or any of their respective directors, managers, officers, employees,
owners, investors, shareholders, partners, members, representatives,
Affiliates or agents that are not expressly set forth herein or in the
Transaction Agreement, and that the Restricted Party is relying only upon the
Restricted Party's own judgment and any advice provided by the
Restricted Party's attorney.

  



  

13\. _No Construction Against Drafter_. No provision of this Agreement or any
related document will be construed against or interpreted to the
disadvantage of any Party hereto by any court or other governmental or
judicial authority by reason of such Party having or being deemed to have
structured or drafted such provision.

  



  

14\. _Severability_. Subject to _Section 2(c)_ , any term or provision of
this Agreement that is found to be invalid or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction will, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of
such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or
unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or
affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement
is found to be so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision will be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

or provisions subjecting the Restricted Stock to a continuing substantial
risk of forfeiture while held by any transferee).

Restricted Stock, which will be subject to the same restrictions as the
underlying award. For the avoidance of doubt, any such dividends or other
distributions on Restricted Stock will be deferred until, and paid contingent
upon, the vesting of such Restricted Stock.

transfer any rights under his or her award and will have no rights of

Restricted Stock Units and will have no right to vote them, but the Committee
may, at or after the Date of Grant, authorize the payment of dividend
equivalents on such Restricted Stock Units on a deferred and contingent
basis, either in cash or in additional shares of Common Stock; _provided_ ,

(b) The interpretation and construction by the Committee of any provision of

constitute a limitation on the authority of the Committee.

11\. Adjustments. The Committee shall make or provide for such adjustments in
the number of and kind of shares of Common Stock covered by
outstanding Option Rights, Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock, Restricted
Stock Units, Performance Shares and Performance Units granted hereunder and,
if applicable, in the number of and kind of shares of Common Stock covered by
other awards granted pursuant to _Section 9_ of this Plan, in the Option
Price and Base Price provided in outstanding Option Rights and Appreciation
Rights, respectively, in Cash Incentive Awards, and in other award terms, as
the Committee, in its sole discretion, exercised in good faith, determines is
equitably required to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of
Participants that otherwise would result from (a) any extraordinary cash
dividend, stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares, recapitalization
or other change in the capital structure of the Company, (b) any merger,
consolidation, spin-off, split-off, spin-out, split-up, reorganization,
partial or complete liquidation or other distribution of assets, issuance of
rights or warrants to purchase securities, or (c) any other corporate
transaction or event having an effect similar to any of the foregoing.
Moreover, in the event of any such transaction or event or in the event of a
Change in Control, the Committee may provide in substitution for any or all
outstanding awards under this Plan such alternative consideration (including
cash), if any, as it, in good faith, may determine to be equitable in the
circumstances and shall require in connection therewith the surrender of all
awards so replaced in a manner that complies with Section 409A of the Code.
In addition, for each Option Right or Appreciation Right with an Option Price
or Base Price, respectively, greater than the consideration offered in
connection with any such transaction or event or Change in Control, the
Committee may in its discretion elect to cancel such Option Right or
Appreciation Right without any payment to the person holding such Option
Right or Appreciation Right. The Committee shall also make or provide for
such adjustments in the number of shares of Common Stock specified in
_Section 3_ of this Plan as the Committee in its sole discretion, exercised in
good faith, determines is appropriate to reflect any transaction or event
described in this _Section 11_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such
adjustment to the number specified in _Section 3(c)_ of this Plan will be
made only if and to the extent that such adjustment would not cause any
Option Right intended to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option to fail to so
qualify.

  



  

12\. Change in Control. For purposes of this Plan, a " _Change in Control_ "
will be deemed to have occurred upon the occurrence (after the Effective

Control: (A) any acquisition directly from the Company; (B) any acquisition by
the Company or any of its affiliates; (C) any acquisition by any employee
benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by the Company or any
of its affiliates; or (D) any acquisition by any Person pursuant to a

subsequent to the Effective Date whose election, or nomination for election by
the Stockholders, was approved by a vote or the approval of at least a
majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board (either by
a specific vote or written action or by approval of the proxy statement of
the Company in which such person is named as a nominee for director, without
objection to such nomination) shall be considered as though such individual
were a member of the Incumbent Board, but excluding for this purpose, any
such individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an
actual or threatened election contest with respect to the election or removal
of directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or
consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the Board;

  



  

(c) consummation of a reorganization, merger or consolidation or sale or
other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the

Combination, all or substantially all of the Persons who were the beneficial
owners, respectively, of the shares of Common Stock and Voting Shares
immediately prior to such Business Combination beneficially own, directly or
indirectly, 50% or more of, respectively, the then-outstanding common shares
and the combined voting power of the then-outstanding voting
securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, as the
case may be, of the entity resulting from such Business
Combination (including an entity which as a result of such transaction owns
the Company or all or substantially all of the Company's assets either
directly or through one or more subsidiaries) in substantially the same
proportions relative to each other as their ownership, immediately prior to
such Business Combination, of the shares of Common Stock and Voting Shares of
the Company, as the case may be; or

  



  

(d) approval by the Stockholders of a complete liquidation or dissolution of
the Company.

  



  

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event will the
issuance of Common Stock to investors pursuant to that certain Exchange
Agreement entered between One Equity Partners Secondary Fund, L.P., Strike
Capital, LLC and the unitholders of Strike Capital, LLC dated October [____],
2018 be deemed to be a Change in Control.

  



  

13\. Detrimental Activity and Recapture Provisions. Any Evidence of Award may
reference a clawback policy of the Company or provide for the cancellation or
forfeiture of an award or the forfeiture and repayment to the Company of any
gain related to an award, or other provisions intended to have a similar
effect, upon such terms and conditions as may be determined by the Committee
from time to time, if a Participant, either (a) during employment or other
service with the Company or a Subsidiary, or (b) within a specified period
after termination of such employment or service, engages in any detrimental
activity, as described in the applicable Evidence of Award or such clawback
policy. In addition, notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary,
any Evidence of Award or such clawback policy may also provide for the
cancellation or forfeiture of an award or the forfeiture and repayment to the
Company of any shares of Common Stock issued under and/or any other benefit
related to an award, or other provisions intended to have a similar effect,
upon such terms and conditions as may be required by the Committee or under
Section 10D of the Exchange Act and any applicable rules or regulations
promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission or any national
securities exchange or national securities association on which the shares of
Common Stock may be traded.

  



  

   

14

 



    



  

14\. Non-U.S. Participants. In order to facilitate the making of any grant or
combination of grants under this Plan, the Committee may provide for such
special terms for awards to Participants who are foreign nationals or who are
employed by the Company or any Subsidiary outside of the United States of
America or who provide services to the Company or any Subsidiary under an
agreement with a foreign nation or agency, as the Committee may consider
necessary or appropriate to accommodate differences in local law, tax policy
or custom. Moreover, the Committee may approve such supplements to or
amendments, restatements or alternative versions of this Plan (including sub-
plans) as it may consider necessary or appropriate for such purposes, without
thereby affecting the terms of this Plan as in effect for any other purpose,
and the secretary or other appropriate officer of the Company may certify any
such document as having been approved and adopted in the same manner as this
Plan. No such special terms, supplements, amendments or
restatements, however, will include any provisions that are inconsistent with
the terms of this Plan as then in effect unless this Plan could have been
amended to eliminate such inconsistency without further approval by the
Stockholders.

  



  

15\. Transferability.

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise determined by the Committee, no Option Right,
Appreciation Right, Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Unit,
Performance Share, Performance Unit, Cash Incentive Award, award contemplated
by _Section 9_ of this Plan or dividend equivalents paid with respect to
awards made under this Plan will be transferable by the Participant except by
will or the laws of descent and distribution. In no event will any such award
granted under this Plan be transferred for value. Except as otherwise
determined by the Committee, Option Rights and Appreciation Rights will be
exercisable during the Participant's lifetime only by him or her or, in
the event of the Participant's legal incapacity to do so, by his or her
guardian or legal representative acting on behalf of the Participant in a
fiduciary capacity under state law or court supervision.

  



  

(b) The Committee may specify on the Date of Grant that part or all of the
shares of Common Stock that are (i) to be issued or transferred by the
Company upon the exercise of Option Rights or Appreciation Rights, upon the
termination of the Restriction Period applicable to Restricted Stock Units or
upon payment under any grant of Performance Shares or Performance Units or
(ii) no longer subject to the substantial risk of forfeiture and restrictions
on transfer referred to in _Section 6_ of this Plan, will be subject to
further restrictions on transfer.

  



  

16\. Withholding Taxes. To the extent that the Company is required to
withhold federal, state, local or foreign taxes or other amounts in
connection with any payment made or benefit realized by a Participant or
other person under this Plan, and the amounts available to the Company for
such withholding are insufficient, it will be a condition to the receipt of
such payment or the realization of such benefit that the Participant or such
other person make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for payment of the
balance of such taxes or other amounts required to be withheld, which
arrangements (in the discretion of the Committee) may include relinquishment
of a portion of such benefit. If a Participant's benefit is to be received in
the form of shares of Common Stock, and such Participant fails to make
arrangements for the payment of taxes or other amounts, then, unless otherwise
determined by the Committee, the Company will withhold shares of Common Stock
having a value equal to the amount required to be withheld. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, when a Participant is required to pay the Company an amount
required to be withheld under applicable income, employment, tax or other
laws, the Participant may elect, unless otherwise determined by the Committee,
to satisfy the obligation, in whole or in part, by having withheld, from the
shares of Common Stock required to be delivered to the Participant, shares of
Common Stock having a value equal to the amount required to be withheld or by
delivering to the Company other shares of Common Stock held by such
Participant. The shares of Common Stock used for tax or other withholding
will be valued at an amount equal to the fair market value of such shares of
Common Stock on the date the benefit is to be included in Participant's
income. In no event will the fair market value of the shares of Common Stock
to be withheld and delivered pursuant to this _Section 16_ exceed the minimum
amount required to be withheld, unless (i) an additional amount can be
withheld and not result in adverse accounting consequences, (ii)
such additional withholding amount is authorized by the Committee, and (iii)
the total amount withheld does not exceed the Participant's estimated tax
obligations attributable to the applicable transaction. Participants will also
make such arrangements as the Company may require for the payment of any
withholding tax or other obligation that may arise in connection with the
disposition of shares of Common Stock acquired upon the exercise of Option
Rights.

  



  

   

15

 



    



  

17\. Compliance with Section 409A of the Code.

  



  

(a) To the extent applicable, it is intended that this Plan and any grants
made hereunder comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code, so
that the income inclusion provisions of Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code do not
apply to the Participants. This Plan and any grants made hereunder will be
administered in a manner consistent with this intent. Any reference in this
Plan to Section 409A of the Code will also include any regulations or any
other formal guidance promulgated with respect to such section by the U.S.
Department of the Treasury or the Internal Revenue Service.

  



  

(b) Neither a Participant nor any of a Participant's creditors or
beneficiaries will have the right to subject any deferred
compensation (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) payable under
this Plan and grants hereunder to any anticipation, alienation, sale,
transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, attachment or garnishment. Except
as permitted under Section 409A of the Code, any deferred compensation
(within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) payable to a Participant or
for a Participant's benefit under this Plan and grants hereunder may not be
reduced by, or offset against, any amount owed by a Participant to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(c) If, at the time of a Participant's separation from service (within the
meaning of Section 409A of the Code), (i) the Participant will be a specified
employee (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and using the
identification methodology selected by the Company from time to time) and
(ii) the Company makes a good faith determination that an amount payable
hereunder constitutes deferred compensation (within the meaning of Section
409A of the Code) the payment of which is required to be delayed pursuant to
the six-month delay rule set forth in Section 409A of the Code in order to
avoid taxes or penalties under Section 409A of the Code, then the Company
will not pay such amount on the otherwise scheduled payment date but will
instead pay it, without interest, on the earlier to occur of (i) the fifth
business day of the seventh month after such separation from service and (ii)
the Participant's death.

  



  

   

16

 



    



  

(d) Solely with respect to any award that constitutes nonqualified deferred
compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code and that is payable on
account of a Change in Control (including any installments or stream of
payments that are accelerated on account of a Change in Control), a Change in
Control shall occur only if such event also constitutes a "change in the
ownership," "change in effective control," and/or a "change in the ownership
of a substantial portion of assets" of the Company as those terms are defined
under Treasury Regulation §1.409A-3(i)(5), but only to the extent necessary to
establish a time and form of payment that complies with Section 409A of the
Code, without altering the definition of Change in Control for any purpose in
respect of such award.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan and grants hereunder to the
contrary, in light of the uncertainty with respect to the proper
application of Section 409A of the Code, the Company reserves the right to
make amendments to this Plan and grants hereunder as the Company deems
necessary or desirable to avoid the imposition of taxes or penalties under
Section 409A of the Code. In any case, a Participant will be solely
responsible and liable for the satisfaction of all taxes and penalties that
may be imposed on a Participant or for a Participant's account in connection
with this Plan and grants hereunder (including any taxes and penalties
under Section 409A of the Code), and neither the Company nor any of its
affiliates will have any obligation to indemnify or otherwise hold a
Participant harmless from any or all of such taxes or penalties.

  



  

18\. Amendments.

  



  

(a) The Board may at any time and from time to time amend this Plan in whole
or in part; _provided_ , _however_ , that no amendment to the Plan shall be
effective without the approval of the Company's stockholders if (i)
stockholder approval is required by applicable law, rule or regulation,
including any rule of the Nasdaq Stock Market, or any other stock exchange on
which the Common Stock is then traded, or (ii) such amendment seeks to modify
the non-employee Director compensation limits set forth in  _Section 3(d)_.

  



  

(b) Except in connection with a corporate transaction or event described in
_Section 11_ of this Plan or in connection with a Change in Control, the
terms of outstanding awards may not be amended to reduce the Option Price of
outstanding Option Rights or the Base Price of outstanding Appreciation
Rights, or cancel outstanding "underwater" Option Rights or Appreciation
Rights in exchange for cash, other awards or Option Rights or Appreciation
Rights with an Option Price or Base Price, as applicable, that is less than
the Option Price of the original Option Rights or Base Price of the original
Appreciation Rights, as applicable, without Stockholder approval. This
_Section 18(b)_ is intended to prohibit the repricing of "underwater" Option
Rights and Appreciation Rights and will not be construed to prohibit the
adjustments provided for in _Section 11_ of this Plan. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Plan to the contrary, this _Section 18(b)_ may not be
amended without approval by the Stockholders.

  



  

   

17

 



    



  

(c) If permitted by Section 409A of the Code, but subject to the paragraph
that follows, including in the case of termination of employment or service,
or in the case of unforeseeable emergency or other circumstances or in the
event of a Change in Control, to the extent a Participant holds an Option
Right or Appreciation Right not immediately exercisable in full, or any
Restricted Stock as to which the substantial risk of forfeiture or the
prohibition or restriction on transfer has not lapsed, or any Restricted Stock
Units as to which the Restriction Period has not been completed, or any Cash
Incentive Awards, Performance Shares or Performance Units which have not been
fully earned, or any dividend equivalents or other awards made pursuant to
_Section 9_ of this Plan subject to any vesting schedule or transfer
restriction, or who holds shares of Common Stock subject to any transfer
restriction imposed pursuant to _Section 15(b)_ of this Plan, the Committee
may, in its sole discretion, provide for continued vesting or accelerate the
time at which such Option Right, Appreciation Right or other award may be
exercised or the time at which such substantial risk of forfeiture or
prohibition or restriction on transfer will lapse or the time when such
Restriction Period will end or the time at which such Cash Incentive Awards,
Performance Shares or Performance Units will be deemed to have been fully
earned or the time when such transfer restriction will terminate or may waive
any other limitation or requirement under any such award.

  



  

(d) Subject to _Section 18(b)_ of this Plan, the Committee may amend the
terms of any award theretofore granted under this Plan prospectively or
retroactively. Except for adjustments made pursuant to _Section 11_ of this
Plan, no such amendment will materially impair the rights of any Participant
without his or her consent. The Board may, in its discretion, terminate this
Plan at any time. Termination of this Plan will not affect the rights of
Participants or their successors under any awards outstanding hereunder and
not exercised in full on the date of termination.

  



  

19\. Governing Law. This Plan and all grants and awards and actions taken
hereunder will be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal
substantive laws of the State of Delaware.

  



  

20\. Effective Date/Termination. This Plan will be effective as of the
Effective Date. No grant will be made under this Plan on or after the tenth
anniversary of the Effective Date, but all grants made prior to such date will
continue in effect thereafter subject to the terms thereof and of this Plan.
Awards hereunder may be made at any time prior to the termination of this
Plan, provided that no Incentive Stock Options may be granted later than ten
years after the date on which the Plan was approved by the Board.

  



  

21\. Miscellaneous Provisions.

  



  

(a) The Company will not be required to issue any fractional shares of Common
Stock pursuant to this Plan. The Committee may provide for the elimination of
fractions or for the settlement of fractions in cash.

  



  

(b) This Plan will not confer upon any Participant any right with respect to
continuance of employment or other service with the Company or any
Subsidiary, nor will it interfere in any way with any right the Company or any
Subsidiary would otherwise have to terminate such Participant's employment or
other service at any time.

  



  

(c) Except with respect to _Section 21(e)_ of this Plan, to the extent that
any provision of this Plan would prevent any Option Right that was intended
to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option from qualifying as such, that
provision will be null and void with respect to such Option Right. Such
provision, however, will remain in effect for other Option Rights and there
will be no further effect on any provision of this Plan.

  



  

   

18

 



    



  

(d) No award under this Plan may be exercised by the holder thereof if such
exercise, and the receipt of cash or stock thereunder, would be, in the
opinion of counsel selected by the Company, contrary to law or the regulations
of any duly constituted authority having jurisdiction over this Plan.

  



  

(e) Subject to Section 409A of the Code or the extent otherwise provided for
in an Evidence of Award, absence on leave approved by a duly
constituted officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will not be
considered interruption or termination of service of any employee for any
purposes of this Plan or awards granted hereunder.

  



  

(f) No Participant will have any rights as a Stockholder with respect to any
shares of Common Stock subject to awards granted to him or her under this
Plan prior to the date as of which he or she is actually recorded as the
holder of such shares of Common Stock upon the stock records of the Company.

  



  

(g) Subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Committee may condition the
grant of any award or combination of awards authorized under this Plan on the
surrender or deferral by the Participant of his or her right to receive a cash
bonus or other compensation otherwise payable by the Company or a Subsidiary
to the Participant.

  



  

(h) Except with respect to Option Rights and Appreciation Rights, the
Committee may permit Participants to elect to defer the issuance of shares of
Common Stock under this Plan pursuant to such rules, procedures or programs as
it may establish for purposes of this Plan and which are intended to comply
with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. The Committee also may
provide that deferred issuances and settlements include the crediting of
dividend equivalents or interest on the deferral amounts.

  



  

(i) If any provision of this Plan is or becomes invalid or unenforceable in
any jurisdiction, or would disqualify this Plan or any award under any law
deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision will be construed or deemed
amended or limited in scope to conform to applicable laws or, in the
discretion of the Committee, it will be stricken and the remainder of this
Plan will remain in full force and effect. Notwithstanding anything in this
Plan or an Evidence of Award to the contrary, nothing in this Plan or in
an Evidence of Award prevents a Participant from providing, without prior
notice to the Company, information to governmental authorities regarding
possible legal violations or otherwise testifying or participating in any
investigation or proceeding by any governmental authorities regarding
possible legal violations, and for purpose of clarity a Participant is not
prohibited from providing information voluntarily to the Securities and
Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 21F of the Exchange Act.

  



  

   

19

 



    



  

22\. Stock-Based Awards in Substitution for Awards Granted by Another
Company. Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary:

  



  

(a) Awards may be granted under this Plan in substitution for or in
conversion of, or in connection with an assumption of, stock options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units or other stock
or stock-based awards held by awardees of an entity engaging in a corporate
acquisition or merger transaction with the Company or any Subsidiary. Any
conversion, substitution or assumption will be effective as of the close of
the merger or acquisition, and, to the extent applicable, will be
conducted in a manner that complies with Section 409A of the Code. The awards
so granted may reflect the original terms of the awards being assumed or
substituted or converted for and need not comply with other specific terms of
this Plan, and may account for shares of Common Stock substituted for the
securities covered by the original awards and the number of shares subject to
the original awards, as well as any exercise or purchase prices applicable to
the original awards, adjusted to account for differences in stock prices in
connection with the transaction.

  



  

(b) In the event that a company acquired by the Company or any Subsidiary or
with which the Company or any Subsidiary merges has shares available under a
pre-existing plan previously approved by stockholders and not adopted in
contemplation of such acquisition or merger, the shares available for grant
pursuant to the terms of such plan (as adjusted, to the extent appropriate, to
reflect such acquisition or merger) may be used for awards made after such
acquisition or merger under this Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that awards
using such available shares may not be made after the date awards or grants
could have been made under the terms of the pre-existing plan absent the
acquisition or merger, and may only be made to individuals who were not
employees or directors of the Company or any Subsidiary prior to such
acquisition or merger.

  



  

(c) Any shares of Common Stock that are issued or transferred by, or that are
subject to any awards that are granted by, or become obligations of, the
Company under _Sections 22(a)_ or _22(b)_ of this Plan will not reduce the
shares of Common Stock available for issuance or transfer under this Plan or
otherwise count against the limits contained in _Section 3_ of this Plan. In
addition, no shares of Common Stock subject to an award that is granted by,
or becomes an obligation of, the Company under _Sections 22(a)_  or _22(b)_
of this Plan will be added to the aggregate limit contained in _Section
3(a)(i)_ of this Plan.

Exhibit L

  



  

FORM OF INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT

  



  

THIS INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made as of [●],
2018, by and between STRIKE, INC., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_
"), and [●] (" _Indemnitee_ ").

  



  

 _RECITALS_

  



  

WHEREAS, highly competent persons have become more reluctant to serve
publicly-held corporations as directors or officers unless they are
provided with adequate protection through insurance or adequate
indemnification against inordinate risks of claims and actions against
them arising out of their service to and activities on behalf of such
corporations.

  



  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Board_ ") has
determined that, in order to attract and retain qualified individuals as
directors and officers, the Company will attempt to maintain on an ongoing
basis, at its sole expense, liability insurance to protect such persons
serving the Company and its subsidiaries from certain liabilities. Although
the furnishing of such insurance has been a customary and widespread practice
among corporations and other business enterprises, the Company believes that,
given current market conditions and trends, such insurance may be available to
it in the future only at higher premiums and with more exclusions. At the
same time, directors and officers are being increasingly subjected to
expensive and time-consuming litigation. The amended and restated certificate
of incorporation (the " _Charter_ ") of the Company requires indemnification
of the officers and directors of the Company. Indemnitee may also be entitled
to indemnification pursuant to applicable Delaware law. The Charter expressly
provides that the indemnification provisions set forth therein are not
exclusive, and thereby contemplate that contracts may be entered into between
the Company and members of the Board, officers and other persons with respect
to indemnification, hold harmless, exoneration, advancement and reimbursement
rights.

  



  

WHEREAS, the uncertainties relating to such insurance and to indemnification
have increased the difficulty of attracting and retaining such persons.

  



  

WHEREAS, the Board has determined that the increased difficulty in attracting
and retaining such persons is detrimental to the best interests of the
Company's stockholders and that the Company should act to assure such persons
that there will be increased certainty of such protection in the future.

  



  

WHEREAS, it is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Company
contractually to obligate itself to indemnify, hold harmless, exonerate
and to advance expenses on behalf of, such persons to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law so that they will serve or continue to serve the
Company free from undue concern that they will not be so protected against
liabilities.

  



  

WHEREAS, this Agreement is a supplement to and in furtherance of the Charter
and any resolutions adopted pursuant thereto, and shall not be deemed a
substitute therefor, nor to diminish or abrogate any rights of Indemnitee
thereunder.

  



  

   



 



    



  

WHEREAS, Indemnitee may not be willing to serve as an officer or director
without adequate protection, and the Company desires Indemnitee to serve in
such capacity. Indemnitee is willing to serve or continue to serve for or on
behalf of the Company on the condition that Indemnitee be so indemnified.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the covenants contained
herein, the Company and Indemnitee do hereby covenant and agree as follows:

  



  

 _TERMS AND CONDITIONS_

  



  

1 SERVICES TO THE COMPANY. In consideration of the Company's covenants and
obligations hereunder, Indemnitee will serve or continue to serve as an
officer, director or key employee of the Company for so long as Indemnitee is
duly elected or appointed or until Indemnitee tenders
Indemnitee's resignation or until Indemnitee is removed. The foregoing
notwithstanding, this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect after
Indemnitee has ceased to serve as a director or officer of the Company, as
provided in Section 16. This Agreement, however, shall not impose any
obligation on Indemnitee or the Company to continue Indemnitee's service to
the Company beyond any period otherwise required by law or by other agreements
or commitments of the parties, if any.

  



  

2 DEFINITIONS. As used in this Agreement:

directors resulting from such Business Combination (including, without
limitation, a corporation which as a result of such transaction owns the

Combination, of the securities entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors; (2) no Person (excluding any corporation resulting from such
Business Combination) is the Beneficial Owner, directly or indirectly, of 15%

Business Combination; and (3) at least a majority of the Board of Directors

complete liquidation of the Company or an agreement or series of

to prosecute or defend, investigating, being or preparing to be a witness in,
settlement or appeal of, or otherwise participating in, a Proceeding (as
defined below), including reasonable compensation for time spent by Indemnitee
for which he or she is not otherwise compensated by the Company or any third
party. "Expenses" also shall include expenses incurred in connection with any
appeal resulting from any Proceeding (as defined below), including without
limitation the principal, premium, security for, and other costs relating to
any cost bond, supersedeas bond, or other appeal bond or its equivalent.
"Expenses," however, shall not include amounts paid in settlement by
Indemnitee or the amount of judgments or fines against Indemnitee.

  



  

(k) References to " _fines_ " shall include any excise tax assessed on
Indemnitee with respect to any employee benefit plan; references to
"serving at the request of the Company" shall include any service as a
director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Company which imposes
duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee, agent
or fiduciary with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or
beneficiaries; and if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner
Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the participants
and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan, Indemnitee shall be deemed to
have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Company" as
referred to in this Agreement.

(l) " _Independent Counsel_ " shall mean a law firm or a member of a
law firm with significant experience in matters of corporation law and that
neither presently is, nor in the past five years has been, retained to
represent: (i) the Company or Indemnitee in any matter material to either such
party (other than with respect to matters concerning Indemnitee under this
Agreement, or of other indemnitees under similar indemnification agreements);
or (ii) any other party to the Proceeding (as defined below) giving rise to a
claim for indemnification hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term
"Independent Counsel" shall not include any person who, under the applicable
standards of professional conduct then prevailing, would have a conflict of
interest in representing either the Company or Indemnitee in an action to
determine Indemnitee's rights under this Agreement.

  



  

(m) The term " _Person_ " shall have the meaning as set forth in Sections
13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act as in effect on the date hereof;
provided, however, that "Person" shall exclude: (i) the Company; (ii) any
Subsidiaries (as defined below) of the Company; (iii) any employment benefit
plan of the Company or of a Subsidiary (as defined below) of the Company or
of any corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by the stockholders of the

an employee benefit plan of the Company or of a Subsidiary (as defined below)
of the Company or of a corporation owned directly or indirectly by the
stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as

completed action, suit, arbitration, mediation, alternate dispute resolution
mechanism, investigation, inquiry, administrative hearing or any other
actual, threatened or completed proceeding, whether brought in the right of
the Company or otherwise and whether of a civil (including intentional or
unintentional tort claims), criminal, administrative or investigative nature,
in which Indemnitee was, is, will or might be involved as a party or otherwise
by reason of the fact that Indemnitee is or was a director or officer of the
Company, by reason of any action (or failure to act) taken by Indemnitee or
of any action (or failure to act) on Indemnitee's part while acting as a
director or officer of the Company, or by reason of the fact that Indemnitee
is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer,
trustee, general partner, managing member, fiduciary, employee or agent of any
other Enterprise, in each case whether or not serving in such capacity at the
time any liability or expense is incurred for which
indemnification, reimbursement, or advancement of expenses can be provided
under this Agreement.

  



  

(o) The term " _Subsidiary_ ," with respect to any Person, shall mean any

Person.

  



  

3 INDEMNITY IN THIRD-PARTY PROCEEDINGS. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, the Company shall indemnify, hold harmless and exonerate
Indemnitee in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3 if Indemnitee
was, is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or a participant (as a
witness, deponent or otherwise) in any Proceeding, other than a Proceeding by
or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor by reason
of Indemnitee's Corporate Status. Pursuant to this Section 3, Indemnitee
shall be indemnified, held harmless and exonerated against all
Expenses, judgments, liabilities, fines, penalties and amounts paid in
settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or
payable in connection with or in respect of such Expenses, judgments, fines,
penalties and amounts paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred by
Indemnitee or on Indemnitee's behalf in connection with such Proceeding or
any claim, issue or matter therein, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a
manner Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Company and, in the case of a criminal Proceeding, had no
reasonable cause to believe that Indemnitee's conduct was unlawful.

4 INDEMNITY IN PROCEEDINGS BY OR IN THE RIGHT OF THE COMPANY. To the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, the Company shall indemnify, hold
harmless and exonerate Indemnitee in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 4 if Indemnitee was, is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or a
participant (as a witness, deponent or otherwise) in any Proceeding by or in
the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of
Indemnitee's Corporate Status. Pursuant to this Section 4, Indemnitee shall
be indemnified, held harmless and exonerated against all Expenses actually
and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee's behalf in connection
with such Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein, if Indemnitee
acted in good faith and in a manner Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in
or not opposed to the best interests of the Company. No indemnification, hold
harmless or exoneration for Expenses shall be made under this Section 4 in
respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which Indemnitee shall have been
finally adjudged by a court to be liable to the Company, unless and only to
the extent that any court in which the Proceeding was brought or the Delaware
Court shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of
liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, Indemnitee is
fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification, to be held harmless or to
exoneration.

  



  

5 INDEMNIFICATION FOR EXPENSES OF A PARTY WHO IS WHOLLY OR PARTLY SUCCESSFUL.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that
Indemnitee was or is, by reason of Indemnitee's Corporate Status, a party to
(or a participant in) and is successful, on the merits or otherwise, in any
Proceeding or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, in whole or
in part, the Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, indemnify, hold harmless and exonerate Indemnitee against all Expenses
actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection therewith. If
Indemnitee is not wholly successful in such Proceeding but is successful, on
the merits or otherwise, as to one or more but less than all claims, issues
or matters in such Proceeding, the Company shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, indemnify, hold harmless and exonerate
Indemnitee against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee
or on Indemnitee's behalf in connection with each successfully resolved
claim, issue or matter. If Indemnitee is not wholly successful in such
Proceeding, the Company also shall, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, indemnify, hold harmless and exonerate Indemnitee against all
Expenses reasonably incurred in connection with a claim, issue or matter
related to any claim, issue, or matter on which Indemnitee was successful. For
purposes of this Section and without limitation, the termination of any
claim, issue or matter in such a Proceeding by dismissal, with or without
prejudice, shall be deemed to be a successful result as to such claim, issue
or matter.

  



  

6 INDEMNIFICATION FOR EXPENSES OF A WITNESS. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee is, by reason of
Indemnitee's Corporate Status, a witness or deponent in any Proceeding to
which Indemnitee was or is not a party or threatened to be made a party,
Indemnitee shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be
indemnified, held harmless and exonerated against all Expenses actually and
reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee's behalf in
connection therewith.

  



  

   

6

 



    



  

7 CONTRIBUTION IN THE EVENT OF JOINT LIABILITY.

  



  

(a) To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, if the
indemnification, hold harmless and/or exoneration rights provided for in this
Agreement are unavailable to Indemnitee in whole or in part for any reason
whatsoever, the Company, in lieu of indemnifying, holding harmless or
exonerating Indemnitee, shall pay, in the first instance, the entire amount
incurred by Indemnitee, whether for judgments, liabilities, fines, penalties,
amounts paid or to be paid in settlement and/or for Expenses, in connection
with any Proceeding without requiring Indemnitee to contribute to such
payment, and the Company hereby waives and relinquishes any right of
contribution it may have at any time against Indemnitee.

  



  

(b) The Company shall not enter into any settlement of any Proceeding in
which the Company is jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in
such Proceeding) unless such settlement provides for a full and final release
of all claims asserted against Indemnitee.

  



  

(c) The Company hereby agrees to fully indemnify, hold harmless and exonerate
Indemnitee from any claims for contribution which may be brought by officers,
directors or employees of the Company other than Indemnitee who may be jointly
liable with Indemnitee.

  



  

8 EXCLUSIONS. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement, the Company
shall not be obligated under this Agreement to make any
indemnification, advance of expenses, hold harmless or exoneration payment in
connection with any claim made against Indemnitee:

  



  

(a) for which payment has actually been received by or on behalf of
Indemnitee under any insurance policy, contract, agreement, or
other indemnity or advancement provision or otherwise, except with respect to
any excess beyond the amount actually received under any insurance policy,
contract, agreement, other indemnity or advancement provision or otherwise;

  



  

(b) for an accounting of profits made from the purchase and sale (or sale and
purchase) by Indemnitee of securities of the Company within the meaning of
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act (or any successor rule) or similar
provisions of state statutory law or common law; or

  



  

(c) except as otherwise provided in Sections 13(f)-(g) hereof, prior to a
Change in Control, in connection with any Proceeding (or any part of any
Proceeding) initiated by Indemnitee, including any Proceeding (or any part of
any Proceeding) initiated by Indemnitee against the Company or its directors,
officers, employees or other indemnitees, unless (i) the Board authorized the
Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding) prior to its initiation or (ii)
the Company provides the indemnification, advance of expenses, hold
harmless or exoneration payment, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the
powers vested in the Company under applicable law. Indemnitee shall seek
payments or advances from the Company only to the extent that such payments or
advances are unavailable from any insurance policy of the Company covering
Indemnitee.

  



  

   

7

 



    



  

9 ADVANCES OF EXPENSES; DEFENSE OF CLAIM.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, and to
the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law, the Company shall pay
the Expenses incurred by Indemnitee (or reasonably expected by Indemnitee to
be incurred by Indemnitee within three months) in connection with any
Proceeding within ten (10) days after the receipt by the Company of a
statement or statements requesting such advances from time to time, prior to
the final disposition of any Proceeding. Advances shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, be unsecured and interest free. Advances shall, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, be made without regard to
Indemnitee's ability to repay the Expenses and without regard to
Indemnitee's ultimate entitlement to be indemnified, held harmless or
exonerated under the other provisions of this Agreement. Advances
shall include any and all reasonable Expenses incurred pursuing a Proceeding
to enforce this right of advancement, including Expenses incurred preparing
and forwarding statements to the Company to support the advances claimed. To
the fullest extent required by applicable law, such payments of Expenses in
advance of the final disposition of the Proceeding shall be made only upon the
Company's receipt of an undertaking, by or on behalf of Indemnitee, to repay
the advanced amounts to the extent that it is ultimately determined that
Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, held harmless or exonerated by
the Company under the provisions of this Agreement, the Charter, applicable
law or otherwise. This Section 9(a) shall not apply to any claim made by
Indemnitee for which an indemnification, advance of expenses, hold harmless
or exoneration payment is excluded pursuant to Section 8.

  



  

(b) The Company will be entitled to participate in the Proceeding at its own
expense.

  



  

(c) The Company shall not settle any action, claim or Proceeding (in whole or
in part) which would impose any Expense, judgment, liability, fine, penalty
or limitation on Indemnitee without Indemnitee's prior written consent.

  



  

10 PROCEDURE FOR NOTIFICATION AND APPLICATION FOR INDEMNIFICATION.

  



  

(a) Indemnitee agrees to promptly notify the Company in writing upon being
served with any summons, citation, subpoena, complaint,
indictment, information or other document relating to any Proceeding, claim,
issue or matter therein which may be subject to indemnification, hold
harmless or exoneration rights, or advancement of Expenses covered hereunder.
The failure of Indemnitee to so notify the Company shall not relieve the
Company of any obligation which it may have to Indemnitee under this
Agreement, or otherwise.

  



  

(b) Indemnitee may deliver to the Company a written application to indemnify,
hold harmless or exonerate Indemnitee in accordance with this Agreement. Such
application(s) may be delivered from time to time and at such time(s) as
Indemnitee deems appropriate in Indemnitee's sole discretion. Following such
a written application for indemnification by Indemnitee,
Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification shall be determined according to
Section 11(a) of this Agreement.

11 PROCEDURE UPON APPLICATION FOR INDEMNIFICATION.

  



  

(a) A determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to
Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification shall be made in the specific
case by one of the following methods, which shall be at the election of
Indemnitee: (i) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though
less than a quorum of the Board or (ii) by Independent Counsel in a written
opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee. The
Company promptly will advise Indemnitee in writing with respect to any
determination that Indemnitee is or is not entitled to indemnification,
including a description of any reason or basis for which indemnification has
been denied. If it is so determined that Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification, payment to Indemnitee shall be made within ten (10) days
after such determination. Indemnitee shall reasonably cooperate with the
person, persons or entity making such determination with respect to
Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification, including providing to such
person, persons or entity upon reasonable advance request any
documentation or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected
from disclosure and which is reasonably available to Indemnitee
and reasonably necessary to such determination. Any costs or Expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements) incurred by
Indemnitee in so cooperating with the person, persons or entity making such
determination shall be borne by the Company (irrespective of the
determination as to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification) and the
Company hereby agrees to indemnify and to hold Indemnitee harmless therefrom.

  



  

(b) In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be
made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 11(a) hereof, the Independent
Counsel shall be selected as provided in this Section 11(b). The Independent
Counsel shall be selected by Indemnitee (unless Indemnitee shall request that
such selection be made by the Board), and Indemnitee shall give written notice
to the Company advising it of the identity of the Independent Counsel so
selected and certifying that the Independent Counsel so selected meets the
requirements of "Independent Counsel" as defined in Section 2 of this
Agreement. If the Independent Counsel is selected by the Board, the Company
shall give written notice to Indemnitee advising Indemnitee of the identity
of the Independent Counsel so selected and certifying that the
Independent Counsel so selected meets the requirements of
"Independent Counsel" as defined in Section 2 of this Agreement. In
either event, Indemnitee or the Company, as the case may be, may, within ten
(10) days after such written notice of selection shall have been received,
deliver to the Company or to Indemnitee, as the case may be, a written
objection to such selection; provided, however, that such objection may be
asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected does not
meet the requirements of "Independent Counsel" as defined in Section 2 of
this Agreement, and the objection shall set forth with particularity the
factual basis of such assertion. Absent a proper and timely objection, the
person or law firm so selected shall act as Independent Counsel. If such
written objection is so made and substantiated, the Independent Counsel so
selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until such
objection is withdrawn or a court of competent jurisdiction has determined
that such objection is without merit. If, within twenty (20) days after
submission by Indemnitee of a written request for indemnification pursuant to
Section 10(b) hereof, no Independent Counsel shall have been selected and not
objected to, either the Company or Indemnitee may petition the Delaware Court
for resolution of any objection which shall have been made by the Company or
Indemnitee to the other's selection of Independent Counsel and/or for the
appointment as Independent Counsel of a person selected by the Delaware
Court, and the person with respect to whom all objections are so resolved or
the person so appointed shall act as Independent Counsel under Section 11(a)
hereof. Upon the due commencement of any judicial proceeding or arbitration
pursuant to Section 13(a) of this Agreement, Independent Counsel shall be
discharged and relieved of any further responsibility in such capacity
(subject to the applicable standards of professional conduct then
prevailing).

  



  

   

9

 



    



  

(c) The Company agrees to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of Independent
Counsel and to fully indemnify and hold harmless such Independent Counsel
against any and all Expenses, claims, liabilities and damages arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or such Independent Counsel's engagement
pursuant hereto.

  



  

12 PRESUMPTIONS AND EFFECT OF CERTAIN PROCEEDINGS.

  



  

(a) In making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification
hereunder, the person, persons or entity making such determination shall
presume that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement if
Indemnitee has submitted a request for indemnification in accordance with
Section 10(b) of this Agreement, and the Company shall have the burden of
proof to overcome that presumption in connection with the making by any
person, persons or entity of any determination contrary to that presumption.
Neither the failure of the Company (including by the Disinterested Directors
or Independent Counsel) to have made a determination prior to the
commencement of any action pursuant to this Agreement that indemnification is
proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the
applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Company
(including by the Disinterested Directors or Independent Counsel) that
Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense
to the action or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met the
applicable standard of conduct.

  



  

(b) If the person, persons or entity empowered or selected under Section 11
of this Agreement to determine whether Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification shall not have made a determination within thirty (30) days
after receipt by the Company of the request therefor, the requisite
determination of entitlement to indemnification shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, be deemed to have been made and Indemnitee shall be
entitled to such indemnification, absent (i) a misstatement by Indemnitee of a
material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make
Indemnitee's statement not materially misleading, in connection with the
request for indemnification, or (ii) a final judicial determination that any
or all such indemnification is expressly prohibited under applicable law;
provided, however, that such 30-day period may be extended for a reasonable
time, not to exceed an additional fifteen (15) days, if the person, persons or
entity making the determination with respect to entitlement to
indemnification in good faith requires such additional time for the obtaining
or evaluating of documentation and/or information relating thereto.

  



  

(c) The termination of any Proceeding or of any claim, issue or matter
therein, by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo
contendere or its equivalent, shall not (except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement) of itself adversely affect the right of
Indemnitee to indemnification or create a presumption that Indemnitee did not
act in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be
in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company or, with respect to any
criminal Proceeding, that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that
Indemnitee's conduct was unlawful.

  



  

   

10

 



    



  

(d) For purposes of any determination of good faith, Indemnitee shall be
deemed to have acted in good faith if Indemnitee's action is based on the
records or books of account of the Enterprise, including financial statements,
or on information supplied to Indemnitee by the directors, managers, or
officers of the Enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of
legal counsel for the Enterprise, the Board, any committee of the Board or
any director, trustee, general partner, manager or managing member of the
Enterprise, or on information or records given or reports made to the
Enterprise, the Board, any committee of the Board or any director, trustee,
general partner, manager or managing member of the Enterprise, by an
independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert
selected by the Enterprise, the Board, any committee of the Board or any
director, trustee, general partner, manager or managing member of the
Enterprise. The provisions of this Section 12(d) shall not be deemed to be
exclusive or to limit in any way the other circumstances in which Indemnitee
may be deemed or found to have met the applicable standard of conduct set
forth in this Agreement.

  



  

(e) The knowledge and/or actions, or failure to act, of any other director,
officer, trustee, partner, manager, managing member, fiduciary, agent or
employee of the Enterprise shall not be imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of
determining the right to indemnification under this Agreement.

  



  

13 REMEDIES OF INDEMNITEE.

  



  

(a) In the event that (i) a determination is made pursuant to Section 11 of
this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement, (ii) advancement of Expenses is not timely made pursuant to Section
9 of this Agreement, (iii) no determination of entitlement to indemnification
shall have been made pursuant to Section 11(a) of this Agreement within thirty
(30) days after receipt by the Company of the request for indemnification,
(iv) payment of indemnification is not made pursuant to Section 5, 6 or the
last sentence of Section 11(a) of this Agreement within ten (10) days after
receipt by the Company of a written request therefor, (v) a contribution
payment is not made in a timely manner pursuant to Section 7 of this
Agreement, (vi) payment of indemnification pursuant to Section 3 or 4 of this
Agreement is not made within ten (10) days after a determination has been made
that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, or (vii) payment to
Indemnitee pursuant to any hold harmless or exoneration rights under this
Agreement or otherwise is not made in accordance with this Agreement,
Indemnitee shall be entitled to an adjudication by the Delaware Court to such
indemnification, hold harmless, exoneration, contribution or advancement
rights. Alternatively, Indemnitee, at Indemnitee's option, may seek an award
in arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Except
as set forth herein, the provisions of Delaware law (without regard to its
conflict of laws rules) shall apply to any such arbitration. The Company
shall not oppose Indemnitee's right to seek any such adjudication or award in
arbitration.

  



  

(b) In the event that a determination shall have been made pursuant to
Section 11(a) of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to
indemnification, any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to
this Section 13 shall be conducted in all respects as a de novo trial, or
arbitration, on the merits and Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of
that adverse determination.

  



  

   

11

 



    



  

(c) In any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this
Section 13, Indemnitee shall be presumed to be entitled to be indemnified,
held harmless, exonerated and to receive advancement of Expenses under this
Agreement and the Company shall have the burden of proving Indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified, held harmless, exonerated and to receive
advancement of Expenses, as the case may be, and the Company may not refer to
or introduce into evidence any determination pursuant to Section 11(a)
of this Agreement adverse to Indemnitee for any purpose. If Indemnitee
commences a judicial proceeding or arbitration pursuant to this Section 13,
Indemnitee shall not be required to reimburse the Company for any advances
pursuant to Section 9 until a final determination is made with respect to
Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification (as to which all rights of appeal
have been exhausted or lapsed).

  



  

(d) If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 11(a) of this
Agreement that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall
be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding or arbitration
commenced pursuant to this Section 13, absent (i) a misstatement by
Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to
make Indemnitee's statement not materially misleading, in connection with the
request for indemnification, or (ii) a prohibition of such
indemnification under applicable law.

  



  

(e) The Company shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding
or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 13 that the procedures and
presumptions of this Agreement are not valid, binding and enforceable and
shall stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator that the
Company is bound by all the provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

(f) The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless Indemnitee to the fullest
extent permitted by law against all Expenses and, if requested by
Indemnitee, shall (within ten (10) days after the Company's receipt of such
written request) pay to Indemnitee, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, such Expenses which are incurred by Indemnitee in connection
with any judicial proceeding or arbitration brought by Indemnitee: (i) to
enforce Indemnitee's rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this
Agreement or any other indemnification, hold harmless, exoneration,
advancement or contribution agreement or provision of the Charter now or
hereafter in effect; or (ii) for recovery or advances under any
insurance policy maintained by any person for the benefit of Indemnitee,
regardless of the outcome and whether Indemnitee ultimately is determined to
be entitled to such indemnification, hold harmless or exoneration right,
advancement, contribution or insurance recovery, as the case may be (unless
such judicial proceeding or arbitration was not brought by Indemnitee in good
faith).

  



  

(g) Interest shall be paid by the Company to Indemnitee at the legal rate
under Delaware law for amounts which the Company indemnifies, holds harmless
or exonerates, or advances, or is obliged to indemnify, hold harmless or
exonerate or advance for the period commencing with the date on which
Indemnitee requests indemnification, to be held harmless, exonerated,
contribution, reimbursement or advancement of any Expenses and ending with
the date on which such payment is made to Indemnitee by the Company.

  



  

14 SECURITY. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to the extent
requested by Indemnitee and approved by the Board, the Company may at any
time and from time to time provide security to Indemnitee for the
Company's obligations hereunder through an irrevocable bank line of credit,
funded trust or other collateral. Any such security, once provided to
Indemnitee, may not be revoked or released without the prior written consent
of Indemnitee.

  



  

   

12

 



    



  

15 NON-EXCLUSIVITY; SURVIVAL OF RIGHTS; INSURANCE; SUBROGATION.

  



  

(a) The rights of Indemnitee as provided by this Agreement shall not be
deemed exclusive of any other rights to which Indemnitee may at any time be
entitled under applicable law, the Charter, any agreement, a vote of
stockholders or a resolution of directors, or otherwise. No amendment,
alteration or repeal of this Agreement or of any provision hereof shall limit
or restrict any right of Indemnitee under this Agreement in respect of any
Proceeding (regardless of when such Proceeding is first threatened,
commenced or completed) or claim, issue or matter therein arising out of, or
related to, any action taken or omitted by such Indemnitee in Indemnitee's
Corporate Status prior to such amendment, alteration or repeal. To the extent
that a change in applicable law, whether by statute or judicial decision,
permits greater indemnification, hold harmless or exoneration rights or
advancement of Expenses than would be afforded currently under the Charter or
this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties hereto that Indemnitee shall
enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by such change. No
right or remedy herein conferred is intended to be exclusive of any other
right or remedy, and every other right and remedy shall be cumulative and in
addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter
existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any
right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent
assertion or employment of any other right or remedy.

  



  

(b) The DGCL and the Charter permit the Company to purchase and maintain
insurance or furnish similar protection or make other arrangements
including, but not limited to, providing a trust fund, letter of credit, or
surety bond (" _Indemnification Arrangements_ ") on behalf of Indemnitee
against any liability asserted against Indemnitee or incurred by or on behalf
of Indemnitee or in such capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent
of the Company, or arising out of Indemnitee's status as such, whether or not
the Company would have the power to indemnify Indemnitee against such
liability under the provisions of this Agreement or under the DGCL, as it may
then be in effect. The purchase, establishment, and maintenance of any such
Indemnification Arrangement shall not in any way limit or affect the rights
and obligations of the Company or of Indemnitee under this Agreement except
as expressly provided herein, and the execution and delivery of this Agreement
by the Company and Indemnitee shall not in any way limit or affect the rights
and obligations of the Company or the other party or parties thereto under any
such Indemnification Arrangement.

  



  

(c) To the extent that the Company maintains an insurance policy or policies
providing liability insurance for directors, officers, trustees, partners,
managers, managing members, fiduciaries, employees, or agents of the Company
or of any other Enterprise which such person serves at the request of the
Company, Indemnitee shall be covered by such policy or policies in accordance
with its or their terms to the maximum extent of the coverage available for
any such director, officer, trustee, partner, managers, managing member,
fiduciary, employee or agent under such policy or policies. If, at the time
the Company receives notice from any source of a Proceeding as to which
Indemnitee is a party or a participant (as a witness, deponent or otherwise),
the Company has director and officer liability insurance in effect, the
Company shall give prompt notice of such Proceeding to the insurers in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies. The
Company shall thereafter take all necessary or desirable action to cause such
insurers to pay, on behalf of Indemnitee, all amounts payable as a result of
such Proceeding in accordance with the terms of such policies.

(d) In the event of any payment under this Agreement, the Company, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, shall be subrogated to the extent of such
payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all
papers required and take all action necessary to secure such rights,
including execution of such documents as are necessary to enable the Company
to bring suit to enforce such rights.

  



  

(e) The Company's obligation to indemnify, hold harmless, exonerate or
advance Expenses hereunder to Indemnitee who is or was serving at the
request of the Company as a director, officer, trustee, partner, manager,
managing member, fiduciary, employee or agent of any other Enterprise shall
be reduced by any amount Indemnitee has actually received as indemnification,
hold harmless or exoneration payments or advancement of expenses from such
Enterprise. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, (i) Indemnitee shall have no obligation to reduce, offset,
allocate, pursue or apportion any indemnification, hold harmless, exoneration,
advancement, contribution or insurance coverage among multiple parties
possessing such duties to Indemnitee prior to the Company's satisfaction and
performance of all its obligations under this Agreement, and (ii) the Company
shall perform fully its obligations under this Agreement without regard to
whether Indemnitee holds, may pursue or has pursued any indemnification,
advancement, hold harmless, exoneration, contribution or insurance coverage
rights against any person or entity other than the Company.

  



  

16 DURATION OF AGREEMENT. All agreements and obligations of the Company
contained herein shall continue during the period Indemnitee serves as a
director or officer of the Company or as a director, officer, trustee,
partner, manager, managing member, fiduciary, employee or agent of any other
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
Enterprise which Indemnitee serves at the request of the Company and shall
continue thereafter so long as Indemnitee shall be subject to any
possible Proceeding (including any rights of appeal thereto and any
Proceeding commenced by Indemnitee pursuant to Section 13 of this
Agreement) by reason of Indemnitee's Corporate Status, whether or
not Indemnitee is acting in any such capacity at the time any liability or
expense is incurred for which indemnification or advancement can be provided
under this Agreement.

  



  

17 SEVERABILITY. If any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall be
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (a)
the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this
Agreement (including, without limitation, each portion of any Section,
paragraph or sentence of this Agreement containing any such provision held to
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal or
unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and shall
remain enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law; (b) such provision
or provisions shall be deemed reformed to the extent necessary to conform to
applicable law and to give the maximum effect to the intent of the parties
hereto; and (c) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this
Agreement (including, without limitation, each portion of any Section,
paragraph or sentence of this Agreement containing any such provision held to
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal or
unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent
manifested thereby.

18 ENFORCEMENT AND BINDING EFFECT.

  



  

(a) The Company expressly confirms and agrees that it has entered into this
Agreement and assumed the obligations imposed on it hereby in order to induce
Indemnitee to serve as a director, officer or key employee of the Company, and
the Company acknowledges that Indemnitee is relying upon this Agreement in
serving as a director, officer or key employee of the Company.

  



  

(b) Without limiting any of the rights of Indemnitee under the Charter as
they may be amended from time to time, this Agreement constitutes the entire
agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral, written and
implied, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof.

  



  

(c) The indemnification, hold harmless, exoneration and advancement of
expenses rights provided by or granted pursuant to this Agreement shall be
binding upon and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns (including any direct or indirect successor by
purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise to all or substantially all of
the business and/or assets of the Company), shall continue as to an
Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer employee or agent of the
Company or a director, officer, trustee, general partner, manager, managing
member, fiduciary, employee or agent of any other Enterprise at the Company's
request, and shall inure to the benefit of Indemnitee and Indemnitee's
spouse, assigns, heirs, devisees, executors and administrators and other
legal representatives.

  



  

(d) The Company shall require and cause any successor (whether direct or
indirect by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to
all, substantially all or a substantial part, of the business and/or assets
of the Company, by written agreement in form and substance satisfactory to
Indemnitee, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the
same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to
perform if no such succession had taken place.

  



  

(e) The Company and Indemnitee agree herein that a monetary remedy for breach
of this Agreement, at some later date, may be inadequate, impracticable and
difficult of proof, and further agree that such breach may cause Indemnitee
irreparable harm. Accordingly, the parties hereto agree that Indemnitee may,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, enforce this Agreement by seeking,
among other things, injunctive relief and/or specific performance hereof,
without any necessity of showing actual damage or irreparable harm and that
by seeking injunctive relief and/or specific performance, Indemnitee shall not
be precluded from seeking or obtaining any other relief to which Indemnitee
may be entitled. The Company and Indemnitee further agree that Indemnitee
shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be entitled to such specific
performance and injunctive relief, including temporary restraining
orders, preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions, without the
necessity of posting bonds or other undertaking in connection therewith. The
Company acknowledges that in the absence of a waiver, a bond or undertaking
may be required of Indemnitee by a court of competent jurisdiction. The
Company hereby waives any such requirement of such a bond or undertaking to
the fullest extent permitted by law.

Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by the Company and
Indemnitee. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be
deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provisions of this Agreement
nor shall any waiver constitute a continuing waiver.

representatives after the expiration of two years from the date of accrual of
such cause of action, and any claim or cause of action of the Company shall
be extinguished and deemed released unless asserted by the timely filing of a
legal action within such two-year period; provided, however, that if any
shorter period of limitations is otherwise applicable to any such cause of
action such shorter period shall govern.

  



  

25 ADDITIONAL ACTS. If for the validation of any of the provisions in this
Agreement any act, resolution, approval or other procedure is required to the
fullest extent permitted by law, the Company undertakes to cause such act,
resolution, approval or other procedure to be affected or adopted in a manner
