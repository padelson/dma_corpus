         1.3      Assumed Liabilities. At the Closing, the Purchaser shall
assume no liability or obligation of the Seller except with respect to the
Liabilities expressly set forth in this Section 1.3 (the "Assumed Liabilities"),
which the Purchaser shall pay, perform and discharge in accordance with their
terms (whether fixed or contingent, matured or unmatured, arising by law or by
Contract or otherwise), subject to any defenses or claimed offsets asserted in
good faith against the obligee to whom such liabilities or obligations are owed:

                  (a)      all Liabilities resulting from the ownership, use,
operation or maintenance of the Assets or the conduct of the Business by the
Purchaser after the Closing;

                  (b)      all Liabilities under the Assumed Contracts arising

                  (d)      all Liabilities associated with the Intellectual
Property arising after the Closing Date; and

                  (e)      all of the Assumed Sporting Goods Obligations.

         1.4      Excluded Liabilities. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the parties expressly acknowledge and agree that
the Purchaser shall not assume or in any manner whatsoever be liable or
responsible for any Liability of the Seller, or any predecessors or Affiliates
of the Seller, or any of their Representatives or any Claim against any and all
of the foregoing, whether matured or unmatured, known or unknown, contingent or
absolute, direct or indirect, whensoever incurred, whether or not related to the
Business, other than Assumed Liabilities. All such Liabilities other than
Assumed Liabilities are collectively referred to as the "Excluded Liabilities."

         1.5      Purchase Price; Allocation of Purchase Price.

                  (a)      Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, in
reliance upon the representations and warranties of the Seller and the covenants
of the Seller herein set forth, and as consideration for the sale and purchase
of the Assets, at the Closing, the Purchaser shall assume the Assumed
Liabilities and shall tender the Purchase Price. On the Closing Date, the
"Purchase Price" shall be the sum of: (i) the Closing Cash Payment (defined in
subparagraph (b) below); plus (ii) the Indemnity Deposit; plus (iii) the Current
Receivables Deposit; plus (iv) the aggregate Straddle Period Accruals; plus (v)
the Signing Bonuses. The Purchase Price shall be adjusted after the Closing Date
if, and to the extent, that (x) the Purchaser is required to remit to the Seller
an amount in cash pursuant to Section 1.6(d) or (y) the Purchaser is entitled to
an amount in cash from the Current Receivables Deposit pursuant to Section
1.6(d).

                                                                               5

                  (b)      The Closing Cash Payment shall be paid by the
Purchaser to the Seller at the Closing as provided in Section 1.10(a). The
"Closing Cash Payment" shall initially be ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION
DOLLARS ($125,000,000) minus the sum of: (i) the Indemnity Deposit; plus (ii)
the Current Receivables Deposit; plus (iii) the aggregate Straddle Period
Accruals; plus (iv) the Signing Bonuses. The amount of the Closing Cash Payment
required to be paid by the Purchaser to the Seller at the Closing shall be
reduced, if necessary, in accordance with Section 1.6(a).

                  (c)      The Indemnity Deposit shall be delivered by the
Purchaser to the Escrow Agent as provided in Section 1.10(b) and shall be held
and disbursed by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the Indemnity Escrow Agreement.

                  (d)      The Current Receivables Deposit shall be delivered by
the Purchaser to the Escrow Agent as provided in Section 1.10(c) and shall be
held and disbursed by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Current Receivables Escrow Agreement.

                  (e)      The parties acknowledge that certain payments are
required to be made pursuant to the Assumed Contracts listed on Schedule 1.5(e)
hereto (the "Tour Contracts"). All required payments earned under the Tour
Contracts prior to the Closing Date and not yet paid by the Seller, including,
without limitation, win bonuses and the pro rata portion of any base
compensation (the "Straddle Period Accruals") shall be (i) treated as an offset
against the Purchase Price and (ii) included in the calculation of the Purchase
Price and the Closing Cash Payment in the manner set forth above. Any Straddle
Period Accruals earned as of the Closing Date shall be paid by the Purchaser.
Any year end bonuses, including bonuses based on money list standings (the "Year
End Bonuses"), shall be prorated based on the period of time prior to and after
the Closing. The Seller shall be responsible for the portion of Year End Bonuses
earned prior to the Closing and the Purchaser shall be responsible for the
portion of Year End Bonuses earned after the Closing. The Purchaser shall pay
the Year End Bonuses and shall immediately be reimbursed from the Indemnity
Deposit for the payments relating to Year End Bonuses (without giving effect to
the Purchaser Recovery Threshold) in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of
Year End Bonuses paid by the Purchaser multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of days between (and including) January 1, 2003 and the
Closing Date, and the denominator of which is 365.

                  (f)      The Signing Bonuses shall be paid by the Purchaser
promptly after the Closing to the Transferred Employees set forth on Schedule
1.5(f).

                  (g)      The Purchaser shall prepare an allocation of the
Purchase Price (and all other capitalized costs) among the Assets in accordance
with Code ss.1060 and the Treasury regulations thereunder (and any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law, as appropriate), which allocation
shall be mutually agreed upon by the Seller and the Purchaser. The Purchaser
shall deliver such allocation to the Seller within sixty (60) days after the
Final Adjustment Date. If the Seller and the Purchaser are unable to agree on
such allocation within thirty (30) days after delivery by the Purchaser to the
Seller of

<PAGE>

                                                                               6

such allocation, they shall immediately, upon the expiration of such 30-day
period, refer their remaining differences to the Independent Accountants, who
shall determine such allocation among the Assets. The Purchaser and the Seller
and their respective Affiliates shall report, act and file Tax Returns
(including, but not limited to Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) in all
respects and for all purposes consistent with such allocation prepared by the
Purchaser and reasonably consented to by the Seller. The Seller shall timely and
properly prepare, execute, file and deliver all such documents, forms and other
information as the Purchaser may reasonably request to prepare such allocation.
Neither the Purchaser nor the Seller shall take any position (whether in audits,
tax returns or otherwise) which is inconsistent with such allocation except
pursuant to Requirements of Law.

         1.6      Assigned Inventory Adjustment.

                  (a)      Not later than five (5) Business Days preceding the
Closing Date, the Seller shall in good faith prepare, or cause to be prepared,
and deliver to the Purchaser a certificate signed by the chief financial officer
(or such other Person serving in a similar capacity) of the Seller setting forth
its estimate of the Deemed Closing Date Inventory Value of the Assigned
Inventory (expressed in United States dollars) as of the close of business on
the Closing Date (the "Target Inventory") without giving effect to the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Target
Inventory Statement"). On the Closing Date, the Closing Cash Payment shall be
adjusted as follows: (i) if the amount of the Target Inventory set forth in the
Target Inventory Statement plus the Deemed Closing Date A/R Value of the
Assigned Current Receivables is equal to or greater than $90,000,000, there
shall be no adjustment to the Closing Cash Payment based on the amount of the
Target Inventory and the Assigned Current Receivables; and (ii) if the amount of
the Target Inventory set forth in the Target Inventory Statement plus the Deemed
Closing Date A/R Value of the Assigned Current Receivables is less than
$90,000,000, the Purchaser shall reduce the Closing Cash Payment (and,
accordingly, the amount paid at Closing) by the amount of such deficiency. If
the Target Inventory exceeds $43,650,000, it shall be deemed for purposes of
this Section 1.6(a) to equal $43,650,000 notwithstanding such excess. The Seller
shall cause there to be sufficient Inventory as of the Closing Date so that the
Deemed Closing Date Inventory Value is at least $33,950,000.

                  (b)      As soon as practicable, but in no event later than
thirty (30) days following the Closing, the Purchaser shall in good faith
prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to the Seller a certificate signed
by the chief financial officer of the Purchaser setting forth its determination
of the Deemed Closing Date Inventory Value of Assigned Inventory (expressed in
United States dollars) as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the
"Closing Inventory") but without giving effect to the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated hereby (the "Closing Date Statement").

                  (c)      The Seller shall, within thirty (30) calendar days
after the delivery by the Purchaser of the Closing Date Statement, complete its
review of the Closing Date Statement and the Closing Inventory reflected
thereon. In the event that the Seller disagrees with the Closing Date Statement,
the Seller shall inform the Purchaser in

<PAGE>

                                                                               7

writing (the "Objection") on or before the last day of such thirty (30) calendar
day period, setting forth a description in reasonable detail of the basis of its
objection(s) and the adjustments to the Closing Date Statement and the Closing
Inventory reflected thereon which the Seller believes should be made; provided,
that, no Objection may be made by the Seller if the amount of Closing Inventory
reflected on the Closing Date Statement is within $100,000 of the amount that
the Seller reasonably believes in good faith to be the actual Closing Inventory
amount. Until the Final Adjustment Date (as defined below), each party and its
Representatives will be afforded reasonable access to the Business' books,
records and personnel during normal business hours, for the purposes of
preparing, evaluating and resolving disputes regarding the Closing Date
Statement and the Closing Inventory reflected thereon. Upon receipt of the
Objection, the Purchaser shall have ten (10) Business Days to review and respond
in writing to the Objection (and failure to do so will be deemed an acceptance
by the Purchaser of the adjustments set forth in the Objection). During such ten
(10) Business Day review period and, if the response referred to in the
foregoing sentence is timely delivered, during the subsequent ten (10) calendar
day period the parties shall seek in good faith to resolve any differences which
they may have with respect to the matters specified in the Objection. If the
Purchaser and the Seller are unable to resolve all of their differences with
respect to the Objection within the ten (10) calendar day period following
completion of the Purchaser's review of the Objection, they shall immediately
upon the expiration of such ten (10) calendar day period refer their remaining
differences to the Independent Accountants, who shall determine on the basis of
the standards set forth in the definition of Deemed Closing Date Inventory
Value, and only with respect to the remaining differences so submitted, whether
and to what extent, if any, the Closing Date Statement and the Closing Inventory
reflected thereon require adjustment. The parties shall instruct the Independent
Accountants to deliver a written determination to the Purchaser and the Seller
no later than the 20th calendar day after the Objection (or the unresolved
portion thereof) is referred to the Independent Accountants. The Purchaser and
the Seller will furnish to the Independent Accountants such work papers and
other documents and information relating to the Objection as the Independent
Accountants may reasonably request and the Purchaser and the Seller will be
afforded the opportunity to present to the Independent Accountants any material
relating to the determination and to discuss the determination with the
Independent Accountants (provided that there shall be no ex parte conversations
or meetings). The Independent Accountants shall act as an arbitrator for
purposes of resolving the Objection, and not as an expert. The Independent
Accountants will be required to enter into a customary engagement letter. The
determination by the Independent Accountants will be binding and conclusive on
the parties for all purposes. The Independent Accountants shall address only
those issues in dispute, and may not assign a value to any item greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by either party or lower than the lowest
value claimed by either party. Half of the fees and expenses of the Independent
Accountants shall be borne by the Seller, on the one hand, and the other half
shall be borne by the Purchaser, on the other hand. The "Final Closing Date
Statement" shall be (i) the Closing Date Statement in the event that (x) no
Objection is delivered to the Purchaser during the thirty (30) calendar day
period specified above in this Section 1.6(c) for making Objections or (y) the
Seller and the Purchaser so agree, (ii) the Closing Date Statement, adjusted in
accordance with the Objection, in the event

<PAGE>

                                                                               8

that the Purchaser does not respond to the Objection within the ten (10)
Business Day period following receipt by the Purchaser of the Objection or
agrees with the Objection, or (iii) the Closing Date Statement, as adjusted by
either (x) the agreement of the Seller and the Purchaser or (y) the Independent
Accountants.

                  (d)      On the date the Final Closing Date Statement is
issued (such date being the "Final Adjustment Date"), the Purchase Price shall
be adjusted as follows: (i) if the amount of Closing Inventory set forth in the
Final Closing Date Statement is equal to the Target Inventory there shall be no
adjustment to the Purchase Price based on the amount of the Closing Inventory;
(ii) if the amount of the Closing Inventory set forth in the Final Closing Date
Statement is greater than the Target Inventory, the Purchaser shall pay the
Seller the amount of such excess; provided, that, if the Closing Inventory
exceeds $43,650,000, it shall be deemed for purposes of this clause (ii) to
equal $43,650,000 notwithstanding such excess; and (iii) if the amount of the
Closing Inventory set forth in the Final Closing Date Statement is less than
both the Target Inventory and $43,650,000 (the "Seller's Inventory Deficiency"),
the excess (x) of the lesser of (1) the Target Inventory (without giving effect
to the last sentence of Section 1.6(a)) and (2) $43,650,000 over (y) the Closing
Inventory shall be paid to the Purchaser from the Indemnity Deposit (without
giving effect to the Purchaser Recovery Threshold) up to a maximum of such
Indemnity Deposit in immediately available funds in accordance with the terms of
the Indemnity Escrow Agreement. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the
Indemnity Deposit is the sole source of funding to satisfy the Seller's
Inventory Deficiency and under no circumstances shall the Purchaser be entitled
to any amount of the Seller's Inventory Deficiency which exceeds the Indemnity
Deposit.

                  (e)      Any payments required under Section 1.6(d) shall (i)
bear interest at the Discount Rate (the "Applicable Interest") and shall accrue
from the Closing Date to, and including, the date such payment is actually made
and (ii) be made within five (5) Business Days after the Final Adjustment Date
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified by the
Seller or the Purchaser, as applicable.

                  (f)      In the event that Ernst & Young LLP, refuses to be
retained as the Independent Accountant for purposes of Section 1.6(c), the
Purchaser and the Seller (or, if the Purchaser and the Seller are unable to so
agree within ten (10) Business Days of Ernst & Young LLP refusing to be so
retained, the Purchaser's and the Seller's respective independent accounting
firms) shall jointly select another independent accounting firm of recognized
national standing, which firm shall be deemed to be the "Independent
Accountants" for purposes of Section 1.6(c).

         1.7      Accounts Receivable.

                  (a)      Assigned Current Receivables.

                           (i)      The Purchaser shall purchase from the Seller
         Current Receivables having a Deemed Closing Date A/R Value equal to the
         excess of $90,000,000 over the Target Inventory (such excess, the
         "Assigned A/R Value" and such purchased Current Receivables, the
         "Assigned Current Receivables").

<PAGE>

                                                                               9

         To the extent, if any, that the Deemed Closing Date A/R Value of the
         Current Receivables exceeds the Assigned A/R Value (such excess, the
         "Retained A/R Value"), the Seller shall retain the Current Receivables
         having a Deemed Closing Date A/R Value equal to the Retained A/R Value.
         In the event that there is Retained A/R Value, the Seller shall retain
         all Current Receivables from the customers of the Seller set forth on
         Schedule 1.7(a), in the order (from top down) set forth on Schedule
         1.7(a) until the Deemed Closing Date A/R Value of such retained Current
         Receivables equals the Retained A/R Value (such retained Current
         Receivables, the "Retained Current Receivables"). If the allocation of
         a Current Receivable pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence
         would result in:

                                    (A)      a customer's Current Receivable
         being divided between the Seller and the Purchaser, the Seller shall
         retain the least current portion of the Current Receivable of the
         customer and the Seller's portion of the proceeds thereof shall be paid
         in accordance with Section 1.7(b) below; or

                                    (B)      a single invoice of such Current
         Receivables being divided between the Seller and the Purchaser, such
         invoice shall be so divided and the Seller's portion of the proceeds
         thereof shall be paid in accordance with Section 1.7(b) below.

                           (ii)     An amount equal to the Current Receivables
         Deposit shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section
         1.10(c) herein and held, in accordance with the Current Receivables
         Escrow Agreement, for a period not to exceed 180 days after the Closing
         Date; provided that no portion of the Current Receivables Deposit shall
         be released from the Current Receivables Escrow Agreement prior to the
         expiration of the period in which the Purchaser is entitled to make an
         election pursuant to subparagraph (iii) below.

                           (iii)    The Purchaser shall: (A) use commercially
         reasonable efforts and, in any event, no less effort than the Purchaser
         uses to collect its own accounts receivable when collecting the
         Assigned Current Receivables and (B) not settle, modify or compromise
         any Assigned Current Receivable without the prior consent of the
         Seller. In the event that the Purchaser requests that the Seller
         consent to a settlement, modification or compromise of an Assigned
         Current Receivable, the Seller agrees to respond to such request within
         five (5) Business Days after such request is received by the Seller. If
         on the 181st day after the Closing Date there are Assigned Current
         Receivables which remain uncollected, the Purchaser may elect, in its
         sole discretion on an account-by-account basis, within five (5)
         Business Days after such 181st day to either (x) assign such
         uncollected Assigned Current Receivables to the Seller and deduct an
         amount equal to the Deemed Closing Date A/R Value of such uncollected
         Assigned Current Receivables (the "Current Receivables Deficiency")
         from the Current Receivables Deposit, (y) continue to collect such
         uncollected Assigned Current Receivables without any deduction from the
         Current Receivables Deposit or (z) any combination of clauses (x) and
         (y); provided, that the Purchaser shall be

<PAGE>

                                                                              10

         permitted to recover the Current Receivables Deficiency only to the
         extent that it is equal to or less than, as the case may be, the
         Current Receivables Deposit. If the Purchaser fails to provide notice
         of its election on or prior to the fifth Business Day after such 181st
         day, it will be deemed to have irrevocably elected to proceed in
         accordance with clause (x) of the preceding sentence. If the Purchaser
         elects to proceed with clause (x) or (z) above, then it shall execute
         and deliver, concurrently with the release of funds from the Current
         Receivables Deposit, an instrument of transfer substantially in the
         form of the Bill of Sale and transfer such Current Receivables to the
         Seller free and clear of all Liens. Any remaining balance of the
         Current Receivables Deposit, after giving effect to this Section
         1.7(a), shall be paid to the Seller in accordance with the Current
         Receivables Escrow Agreement. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
         that the Current Receivables Deposit is the sole source of funding to
         satisfy the Current Receivables Deficiency and under no circumstances
         shall the Purchaser be entitled to any amount of the Current
         Receivables Deficiency which exceeds the Current Receivables Deposit.

                           (iv)     Not later than five (5) Business Days
         preceding the Closing Date, the Seller shall in good faith prepare, or
         cause to be prepared, and deliver to the Purchaser a certificate signed
         by the Chief Financial Officer (or such other Person serving in a
         similar capacity) of the Seller setting forth a reconciliation between
         the Deemed Closing Date A/R Value of the Assigned Current Receivables
         and the Deemed Closing Date A/R Value of the Assigned Current
         Receivables less the amount of "A&P" (which pertains solely to co-op
         advertising and other similar promotional items that are generally
         dilutive to such Assigned Current Receivables and which shall be
         determined on the same basis as "A&P" is determined in the Financial
         Statements) as of the Closing Date that are deductible from the
         Assigned Current Receivables (the "A/R Reconciliation"). If the A/R
         Reconciliation, as determined by the Seller and the Purchaser, is
         greater than $100,000, (A) the Current Receivables Deposit shall be
         increased by an amount in cash equal to the A/R Reconciliation and (B)
         the Closing Cash Payment shall be correspondingly reduced in accordance
         with Section 1.5(b).

                  (b)      Retained Receivables.

                           (i)      The Purchaser shall collect, on behalf of
         and for the account of the Seller, all Retained Current Receivables for
         a period of 180 days after the Closing Date (the "Collection Period").
         In collecting such Retained Current Receivables, the Purchaser shall:
         (A) use commercially reasonable efforts and, in any event, no less
         effort that the Purchaser uses to collect its own accounts receivable;
         (B) shall not interfere with or prejudice the payment or collection of
         such Retained Current Receivables; and (C) not settle, modify or
         compromise any Retained Current Receivable without the prior consent of
         the Seller. In the event that the Purchaser requests that the Seller
         consent to a settlement, modification or compromise of a Retained
         Current Receivable, the Seller agrees to respond to such request within
         five (5) Business Days after such request is received by the Seller. As

                                                                              11

         Current Receivables, the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser a collection
         fee equal to 2% of the payments collected by the Purchaser on Retained
         Current Receivables (the "Collection Fee").

                           (ii)     The Purchaser shall remit to the Seller on a
         bi-weekly basis: (A) all payments received by the Purchaser on Retained
         Current Receivables less the Collection Fee and (B) a reasonably
         detailed accounting of the Retained Current Receivables as of such
         date, which shall include the amount received, the Retained Current
         Receivables as to which such payment was received and the Retained
         Current Receivables outstanding. During the Collection Period, upon
         reasonable notice, the Purchaser shall afford the Seller reasonable
         access, during normal business hours, to the books and records of the
         Purchaser relating to the Retained Current Receivables. The Seller may,
         in its sole discretion, elect to have a Representative of the Seller
         present at the Purchaser's offices during normal business hours to
         monitor the collection by the Purchaser of the Retained Current
         Receivables.

                           (iii)    All records and other information regarding
         the Retained Current Receivables not collected by the Purchaser during
         the Collection Period shall be provided to the Seller on the 181st day
         after the Closing Date. The Seller may elect, in its sole discretion,
         to notify the Purchaser at any time during the Collection Period of its
         desire to collect on an account-by-account basis any or all Retained
         Current Receivables. Upon receipt of such notification, the Purchaser
         shall immediately terminate its efforts to collect the designated
         Retained Current Receivables and provide, with regard to such
         uncollected Retained Current Receivables, all records and other
         information. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it is not
         entitled to the Collection Fee for any Retained Current Receivable
         collected by the Seller nor for any uncollected Retained Current
         Receivable.

                  (c)      Unidentified Accounts Receivables. In the event that
the Purchaser receives a payment from a third party that, pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement, should have been paid to the Seller or the Foreign
Subsidiaries, the Purchaser agrees to promptly remit such payment to the Seller.
In the event that the Seller or the Foreign Subsidiaries receive a payment from
a third party that, pursuant to the terms hereof, should have been paid to the
Purchaser, the Seller agrees to promptly remit such payment to the Purchaser. If
any party fails to forward payments to which another party is entitled, such
party shall be entitled to make a claim for indemnification pursuant to Article
VIII hereof, which claim shall not be subject to the Purchaser Recovery
Threshold or the Seller Recovery Threshold, as the case may be. In the event
that any party receives an unidentified payment from a customer, the recipient
shall inquire of the customer as to the application thereof and, lacking a
response, shall work closely and cooperatively with the other party to determine
how the payment shall be applied. If the parties are unable to make such a
determination, the payment shall be applied on a pro rata basis to the
outstanding invoices of that customer.

returned to the Purchaser after the Closing Date and for which a customer took

receipt of such Returned Goods, the Purchaser shall be entitled to be reimbursed

value of the Returned Goods, which shall be determined in the same manner as set

Goods returned to the Purchaser after the Closing Date and for which a customer

conducted. Subject to the entry of the Sale Approval Order, (a) the Seller has
all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement, carry
out its obligations hereunder and consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and (b) the execution and delivery by the Seller of this Agreement, the

authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement or to consummate the

(assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Purchaser), this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation
of the Seller enforceable against the Seller in accordance with its terms,

organization. Each of the Subsidiaries has all requisite corporate or other
power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its

authority would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (c)      Each Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do
business in all other jurisdictions where such Subsidiary currently conducts
business that requires such qualification or licensing, except where the failure
to so qualify or be licensed would not reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (d)      The authorized and issued shares of capital stock or
other ownership interests of each of the Subsidiaries are set forth on Schedule
2.2(d). All of the issued and outstanding capital stock and other ownership

Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell, or redeem, repurchase, acquire or pay
for or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, or redeemed, repurchased, acquired
or paid for additional shares of capital stock, equity interests or other voting
securities of any of the Subsidiaries, or obligating any of the Subsidiaries to

right commitment, Contract, arrangement or undertaking.

         2.3      No Conflicts. Subject only to the entry of the Sale Approval

the Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of any Material Contract or Assumed
Contract; or

Encumbrances, other than Permitted Encumbrances and other than Liens that shall
be released at or prior to the Closing.

                  (c)      Entire Premises. Except as set forth in Schedule

other improvement has been completed or commenced that would require the
issuance of a new certificate of occupancy or the amendment of an existing
Certificate of Occupancy.

proposed or pending proceeding to change or redefine the applicable legal

expected to have, individually and in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the use or operation of any portion of the Real Property.

                  (j)      Former Properties. Schedule 2.13(j) is a true and
complete schedule of all real property formerly owned or leased by the Seller
and any of its Subsidiaries on which manufacturing activities were conducted by
the Seller in connection with the Business over the past ten (10) years
("Formerly Owned and Leased Real Property").

         2.14     Intellectual Property. Schedule 2.14 sets forth a complete and

the Subsidiaries owns or possesses, free and clear of all Encumbrances, other
than Permitted Encumbrances, or has valid licenses on reasonable terms to use

Intellectual Property is valid and enforceable. The Seller has taken all
necessary actions to maintain and protect each item of such Intellectual
Property other than as would not reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Subject to (x) the
Bankruptcy Case (including any breaches or defaults relating to the commencement
thereof and any payables that would have been paid but for the commencement
thereof) and (y) payment of the Cure Costs by the Seller, the Seller and the
Subsidiaries are in compliance with the material terms of any license to or
license of Intellectual Property. Except as otherwise set forth on Schedule
2.14, neither the Seller nor any of the Subsidiaries has received any notice
that, and to the Seller's Knowledge, none of, the Intellectual Property or any
products or services owned, used, developed, provided, sold or licensed by the
Seller or any of the Subsidiaries in the operations of the Business by the

Subsidiaries or

(ii) opposing or attempting to cancel any of the rights associated with the
Intellectual Property, in each case, other than as would not reasonably be
expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect. Except as otherwise set forth on Schedule 2.14, the Intellectual
Property is not subject to any material outstanding decree, order, judgment,
settlement, agreement, or stipulation that restricts in any manner the Seller's
or any of its Subsidiaries' use, transfer, or licensing thereof. To the Seller's
Knowledge, neither the Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has knowingly
misrepresented or failed to disclose any facts or circumstances in any
application for Intellectual Property that would constitute fraud or
misrepresentation with respect to such application or that would otherwise
affect the validity or enforceability of the Intellectual Property. The
Intellectual Property and the license agreements transferred pursuant to this
Agreement constitute all of the Intellectual Property used in or necessary to
operate or conduct the Business as currently conducted. There are no Liens in
favor of the PBGC that will continue after the Closing with respect to the
Intellectual Property and, to the Seller's Knowledge as of the date hereof, the
PBGC has not taken any actions to impose any such Liens.

Seller of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) neither the

finders' fees or similar compensation in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

funding deficiency" within the meaning of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of
the Code, whether or not waived, and no liability (other than for annual

                  (e)      No Benefit Plan requires or obligates the Purchaser

threatened or anticipated claims by, related to or on behalf of any Benefit
Plan, by any participant or beneficiary of a Benefit Plan and there is no
pending or threatened proceeding , investigation or inquiry involving any

has taken or failed to take any action in connection with which the Seller, its
Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate would be subject to any liability for taxes
imposed pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code. There has not been any
"substantial elimination of coverage" (as described in Section 4980B(f)(3) of
the Code) with respect to a group health plan maintained by the Seller or any
ERISA Affiliate within one year before or after the Petition Date in respect of
any individual who would be an "M&A qualified beneficiary" (within the meaning
of Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9, Q&A-4) as a result of the
Acquisition.

                  (h)      With respect to each Benefit Plan that is subject to
applicable laws other than the laws of the United States and covers only
employees of the Foreign Subsidiaries (individually, a "Foreign Plan," and
collectively, "Foreign Plans") to the Seller's Knowledge: (i) each Foreign Plan
is in compliance in all material respects with the laws and regulations
regarding employee benefits, mandatory contributions and retirement plans in
each jurisdiction in which it has employees or conducts business; (ii)
contributions to and payments from each Foreign Plan, which are required to be
made on or prior to the Closing have been timely made; (iii) each Foreign Plan
has been administered at all times, and in all material respects, in accordance
with its terms; (iv) there are no pending investigations by any governmental
body involving any Foreign Plan, and no pending claims (except for claims for
benefits payable in the normal operation of the Foreign Plans), suits or
proceedings against any Foreign Plan or asserting any rights or claims to
benefits under any Foreign Plan; (v) the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not by itself create or otherwise result in
any material liability, accelerated payment or any enhanced benefits with
respect to any Foreign Plan; (vi) none of the Foreign Plans is a "registered
pension plan" under applicable Canadian laws and regulations; and (vii) each
Foreign Plan can be amended or terminated without any material liability to any
of the Foreign Subsidiaries.

                  (i)      To the Seller's Knowledge, Schedule 2.17(i) is a true
and complete list of: (i) the plans and agreements pursuant to which any current
or former employee of the Seller is entitled to receive any severance or
termination payment, or retention or other similar bonus; (ii) the names of the
employees or former employees who are entitled to receive such bonuses; and
(iii) the amount of such bonuses.

         2.18     Labor Matters. Except as otherwise set forth on Schedule 2.18
hereto:

                  (a)      none of the active employees of the Seller and the
Subsidiaries (the "Seller's Employees") is represented by a labor union that is
a party to any collective bargaining agreement, and, to the Seller's Knowledge,
there are currently no organizational campaigns, petitions or other unionization
activities seeking recognition of a collective bargaining unit including any of
the Seller's Employees; and

                  (b)      there are no strikes, slowdowns or work stoppages
pending or, to the Seller's Knowledge, threatened involving any of the Seller's

         2.19     Insurance. Schedule 2.19 sets forth a true and complete list
of all insurance policies, binders of insurance or programs of self-insurance
held by the Seller and its Subsidiaries relating to the Business (collectively,
the "Insurance Policies"). True and complete copies of all Insurance Policies
have been provided or made available to the Purchaser. No insurer under any
Insurance Policy has canceled or generally disclaimed liability under any such
policy or, to the Seller's Knowledge, indicated any intent to do so or not to
renew any Insurance Policy except as required by state insurance law or as
replaced by comparable policies. The Seller and its Subsidiaries maintain, with
responsible insurance carriers, property, auto liability, workers' compensation,
and general liability insurance. The Insurance Policies are in full force and
effect and, except as otherwise set forth on Schedule 2.19, such Insurance
Policies have been in full force and effect, without gaps, continuously for at
least the past three (3) years. Neither the Seller nor any Subsidiary is in
default under any of the Insurance Policies, and none have failed to give any
notice or to present any claim under any such Insurance Policy in a due and
timely fashion.

         2.20     Suppliers and Customers. Schedule 2.20 hereto lists, by dollar
volume paid for the year ended on December 31, 2002, the 10 largest suppliers
and the 10 largest customers of the Seller and each of the Subsidiaries other
than the suppliers and customers of the Excluded Operations. The relationships
of the Seller and the Subsidiaries with such suppliers and customers are, as of
the date hereof good commercial working relationships and as of the date hereof,
except as set forth on Schedule 2.20 hereto, no Person listed on Schedule 2.20
within the twelve months preceding the date hereof has threatened in writing to
cancel, materially reduce, or otherwise terminate, or to the Seller's Knowledge,
as of the date hereof, intends to cancel, materially reduce, or otherwise
terminate, its current level of business with the Seller or any of the
Subsidiaries.

         2.21     Interested Party Transactions. To the Seller's Knowledge,
Schedule 2.21 sets forth a true, complete and correct list, as of the date
hereof, of any transaction, arrangement or relationship involving an amount of
$60,000 or more that any director, officer or other Affiliate of the Seller has
or has had in the last three years, directly or indirectly relating to: (i) an
economic interest in any Person that purchases from or sells or furnishes to,
the Seller or any Subsidiary, any goods or services other than Excluded
Securities; (ii) a beneficial interest in any material Contract; or (iii) any
contractual or other arrangement with the Seller or any Subsidiary; provided,
however, that ownership of no more than one percent (1%) of the outstanding
voting stock of a publicly traded corporation shall not be deemed an "economic
interest in any Person" for purposes of this Section 2.21.

         2.22     Off Balance Sheet Liabilities. Schedule 2.22 sets forth a
true, complete and correct list, as of the date hereof, of all material
transactions, arrangements and other relationships between and/or among SHC,

purpose entity beneficially owned by or formed at the direction of SHC, Inc. or
any of its controlled Affiliates.

         2.23     All Assets. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.23, the Assets
(other than the Excluded Assets) constitute all assets necessary for the
operation of the Business in substantially the manner heretofore conducted by
the Seller.

         2.24     Inventory. The Seller has completed a physical inventory of
the Business on or after December 31, 2002. The Assigned Inventory consists, and
as of the close of business on the Closing Date, the Assigned Inventory will
consist, of items which are in all material respects free of any Defect and,
subject to inventory reserves set forth in the Financial Statements, of a
quality and quantity usable and salable in the ordinary course of business.
Since December 31, 2002, there have been no recalls or withdrawals of Inventory
produced or sold by or as a part of the Business or other similar federal,
state, or private actions with respect to such Assigned Inventory. All items
included in the Assigned Inventory are the property of the Seller or one of its
Subsidiaries. Except for Liens that will be released prior to the Closing, no
items included in the Assigned Inventory have been pledged as collateral or are
held by the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries on consignment from others.

         2.25     Receivables. As of the date hereof, no account debtor (owing
more than $25,000 to the Seller) has refused (or to the Seller's Knowledge,
threatened to refuse) to pay its obligations with respect to any Assigned
Account Receivable for any reason. To the Seller's Knowledge, as of the date
hereof, no account debtor (owing more than $25,000 to the Seller) is insolvent
or bankrupt. All Current Receivables have been generated in the ordinary course
of the Business. With respect to unbilled Current Receivables in amounts greater
than $25,000, there exists no material fact that would prohibit or restrict the
billing of any such unbilled Accounts Receivable in the ordinary course of
business. Since March 31, 2003, neither the Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries
has made any material change in the selling, distribution, advertising, terms of
sale or collection practices of the Business, entered into any practices,
programs or long-term allowances not previously used in the ordinary course of
business of the Business or, with respect to the Business, engaged in the
practice of "loading" or any program, activity or other action that would
reasonably be expected to result, directly or indirectly, in a trade buy-in that
significantly in excess of normal customer purchasing patterns consistent with
past practice over the period beginning January 1, 2002 until the date hereof.

         2.26     DISCLAIMER. The representations and warranties made by the
Seller in this Agreement are the exclusive representations and warranties made
by the Seller. The Seller hereby disclaims any other express or implied
representations and warranties. The Seller, directly or indirectly, does not
make, and hereby disclaims, any representations or warranties regarding
pro-forma financial information, financial projections or other forward-looking
statements of the Business. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE
SELLER MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES AS TO THE
BUSINESS, THE ASSETS OR THE ASSUMED LIABILITIES, INCLUDING AS TO THEIR PHYSICAL
CONDITION, USABILITY, MERCHANTABILITY, PROFITABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

         3.       Representations and Warranties of the Purchaser. The Purchaser
represents and warrants to the Seller as follows:

         3.1      Due Incorporation and Authority. The Purchaser is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of the State of Delaware. The Purchaser has all requisite power and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being
conducted, except where the failure to have such power and authority would not
reasonably be expected to materially impair or delay the ability of the
Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The Purchaser has
all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement, carry
out its obligations hereunder and consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. The execution and delivery by the Purchaser of this Agreement, the
performance by the Purchaser of its obligations hereunder and the consummation
by the Purchaser of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of the Purchaser and no
other corporate proceedings on the part of the Purchaser are necessary to
authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement or to consummate the
other transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by the Purchaser, and, assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery hereof by the Seller, this Agreement will constitute the legal,
valid and binding obligation of the Purchaser, enforceable against the Purchaser
in accordance with its terms, except to the extent enforceability may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors
rights generally or by general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

         3.2      No Conflicts. The execution and delivery by the Purchaser of
this Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
the performance by the Purchaser of this Agreement in accordance with its terms
will not:

                  (a)      violate the certificate of incorporation or by-laws
of the Purchaser;

                  (b)      require the Purchaser to obtain any material
consents, approvals, authorizations or actions of, or make any filings with or
give any notices to, any Governmental Bodies or any other Person, except for (i)
the notification requirements of the HSR Act (and any foreign counterpart
thereof) or (ii) consents, approvals or authorizations of, or declarations or
filings with, the Bankruptcy Court;

                  (c)      violate or result in the breach of any of the terms
and conditions of, cause the termination of or give any other contracting party
the right to terminate, or constitute (or with notice or lapse of time, or both,
constitute) a material default under, any material Contract to which the
Purchaser is a party or by or to which each of the Purchaser or any of its
properties is or may be bound or subject; or

                  (d)      violate any Requirement of Law to which the Purchaser
is subject;

<PAGE>

                                                                              31

                  (e)      provided, however, that each of the cases set forth
in clauses (b) through (d) above is subject to exceptions that would not
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
material adverse effect on the Purchaser.

         3.3      Brokers. Except for Lazard Freres & Co. LLC, the fees and
expenses of which will be paid by the Purchaser, no Person retained by or on
behalf of the Purchaser or any of its respective Affiliates is entitled to any
brokerage commissions, finders' fees or similar compensation in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby.

         3.4      Financing. The Purchaser has, and at the Closing will have,
sufficient available funds to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including making all payments required pursuant to Article I.
Immediately following the Closing Date, the Purchaser will have sufficient funds
to operate the Business in all material respects in the ordinary course and in a
manner consistent with past practice and to assume the Assumed Liabilities.

         3.5      Litigation. There are no Claims pending or, to the knowledge
of the Purchaser, threatened against the Purchaser, before any Governmental Body
that would prevent or materially delay the consummation by the Purchaser of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         3.6      Independent Investigation. The Purchaser hereby acknowledges
and affirms that it has conducted and completed its own investigation, analysis
and evaluation of Business, that it has made all such reviews and inspections of
the financial condition, results of operations, properties, assets and prospects
of the Business as it has deemed necessary or appropriate, that it has had the
opportunity to request all information it has deemed relevant to the foregoing
from the Seller and has received responses it deems adequate and sufficient to
all such requests for information, and that in making its decision to enter into
this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby it has
relied solely on (i) its own investigation, analysis and evaluation of the
Business and (ii) the representations, warranties and covenants of the Seller
contained in this Agreement.

         4.       Covenants and Agreements.

         4.1      Conduct of Business. Subject to (x) any obligations of the
Seller as a debtor or debtor-in-possession under the Bankruptcy Code, or (y) any
order of the Bankruptcy Court or other court of competent jurisdiction that, in
the case of clause (x) or (y) would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, the Seller agrees
that, from the date of this Agreement until the Closing, that:

required or necessary for the consummation of the transactions under, the

otherwise agreed to in writing by the Purchaser (which agrees to respond in a
commercially reasonable time frame to any request for such agreement and to not
unreasonably withhold its agreement), none of the Seller or the Subsidiaries
shall:

                           (i)      sell or convey any of its material assets,

                           (xxi)    agree in writing or otherwise to take any of
         the actions described in (i) through (xx) above.

                           (xxii)   Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, all of the actions described in this Section 4.1 relate solely
to the Business and the Purchaser acknowledges that the Seller can take any
actions, in its sole and absolute discretion, relating solely to the Excluded
Assets and Excluded Liabilities.

         4.2      Confidentiality. Each party hereto hereby reaffirms the
confidentiality letter agreement, dated September 16, 2002 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), between the Seller and the Purchaser, and agrees to fulfill its
obligations thereunder. To the extent

<PAGE>

                                                                              35

that a party hereto is not a party to the Confidentiality Agreement, such party
hereby agrees to be bound by the confidentiality provisions contained therein.
If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect.
The Purchaser agrees to maintain, before and after the Closing, the
confidentiality of all information concerning the Seller (including the amounts
paid to the Seller hereunder) except as may be required under a Requirement of
Law, in which case the Purchaser shall promptly notify the Seller of any such
requirement and the Seller shall be permitted to seek confidential treatment for
such information. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any party to
this Agreement (and each of its Representatives) may disclose to any and all
Persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and all materials of any kind
(including opinions or other tax analyses) related to such tax treatment and tax
structure; provided that this sentence shall not permit any Person to disclose
the name of, or other information that would identify, any party to such
transactions or to disclose confidential information regarding such
transactions.

         4.3      Expenses. Other than all HSR Act filing fees (and fees
required to be paid by foreign counterparts of the HSR Act), which shall be the
responsibility of the Purchaser, and except as otherwise specifically provided
herein, the Purchaser and the Seller shall bear their respective expenses
incurred in connection with the preparation, execution and performance of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including all fees and
expenses of their Representatives.

         4.4      Public Announcements. No party to this Agreement shall make,
or cause to be made, any press release or public announcement in respect of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise communicate with
any news media without prior approval of the other party, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless such disclosure is required by
applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange. The parties shall cooperate,
using commercially reasonable efforts, as to the timing and contents of any such
announcement, including any such announcement required by applicable law or the
rules of any stock exchange. Notwithstanding the above, the parties shall agree
as to the timing and contents of the first press release announcing this
Agreement.

         4.5      Access to Information.

                  (a)      From the date hereof until the Closing, upon
reasonable notice, the Seller shall, and shall cause each of its officers,
directors, employees, auditors and agents to, (i) afford the officers, employees
and Representatives of the Purchaser reasonable access, during normal business
hours, to the offices, plants, warehouses, properties, books and records of the
Seller and the Subsidiaries and (ii) furnish to the officers, employees and
Representatives of the Purchaser such additional financial and operating data
and other information regarding the operations of the Seller and the
Subsidiaries as the Purchaser may from time to time reasonably request;
provided, however, that such investigation shall not unreasonably interfere with
the operations of the Seller, the Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates; and
provided further, however, that the auditors of

<PAGE>

                                                                              36

the Seller shall not be obliged to make any work papers available to any Person.
The Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect
notwithstanding anything therein to the contrary and all information received by
the Purchaser under this Section 4.5 shall be subject thereto.

                  (b)      From the date hereof until the Closing, the Seller
shall furnish to the Purchaser, as soon as reasonably practicable after the end
of each fiscal month or quarter, as the case may be, such monthly or quarterly
financial reports, statements and other information as the Seller customarily
prepares at the end of such fiscal periods. Such information shall be prepared
in accordance with the books and records of the Seller and shall fairly present
the matters covered by such information.

         4.6      Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Consents.

                  (a)      Each of the parties hereto shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action,
and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under any
Requirement of Law or otherwise to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) obtain any consents, licenses,
permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders required to be obtained or
made in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Seller Consents and Notices, and (iii) make all filings and give
any notice, and thereafter make any other submissions either required or
reasonably deemed appropriate by each of the parties, with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby required under any
Requirement of Law, including applicable securities and antitrust Requirements
of Law, and the rules and regulations of any stock exchange on which the
securities of any of the parties are listed or traded. Commercially reasonable
efforts shall not obligate the Seller or the Purchaser to make or offer to make
any payments to obtain any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals,
authorizations or orders.

                  (b)      The parties hereto shall work closely and
cooperatively and consult with each other in connection with the making of all
such filings and notices, including by providing copies of all such documents to
the non-filing party and its advisors a reasonable period of time prior to
filing or the giving of notice. No party to this Agreement shall consent to any
voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to any
voluntary delay of the consummation and the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement at the behest of any Governmental Body without the consent and
agreement of the other parties to this Agreement, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each party shall promptly inform the others of
any material communication from any Governmental Body regarding any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         4.7      Further Action; Additional Assignments of Intellectual
Property. Each of the parties hereto shall execute such documents and take such
further actions as may be reasonably required or desirable to carry out the
provisions hereof and give effect to the transactions contemplated hereby. From
time to time after the Closing, the Seller shall at

<PAGE>

                                                                              37

the Purchaser's expense prepare all documents and take all actions reasonably
necessary to further the sale and assignment of the Intellectual Property to the
Purchaser hereunder. Such Intellectual Property assignments shall be in
recordable form based on the local law requirements. The Purchaser assumes
responsibility for and will bear the expenses of recording such Intellectual
Property assignments in all jurisdictions. Following the Closing, the Seller
shall have no obligation or responsibility for maintaining or prosecuting any
Intellectual Property transferred to the Purchaser hereunder.

         4.8      Employee Matters.

                  (a)      From and after the date of this Agreement, the
Purchaser, or any of its Affiliates, in their sole and absolute discretion and
after consulting the management of the Seller, may: (i) communicate with any of
the Seller's or the Subsidiaries' current employees about possible employment
with the Purchaser after the Closing Date; and/or (ii) offer employment to any
of the Seller's or the Subsidiaries' employees as of the Closing Date on terms
and conditions which are generally comparable to those applicable to similarly
situated employees of the Purchaser. It is the intent of the Purchaser to make
offers of employment to a substantial number of the Seller's and the
Subsidiaries' active employees on the Closing Date. Those of the employees that
accept the Purchaser's offer of employment and become employed by the Purchaser
are referred to in this Agreement as "Transferred Employees," as of the Closing
Date. Nothing contained herein shall require the Purchaser to provide any
specific form of benefit or inhibit the Purchaser's ability to establish, amend
or terminate any employee benefit plan of the Purchaser following the Closing.
All employment offers are subject to the satisfactory completion by the
Purchaser of its customary employment interview, background checks and drug
testing procedures. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Purchaser from
terminating the employment of any Transferred Employee at any time.

                  (b)      To the extent that service is relevant for purposes
of eligibility or vesting under any employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement established or maintained by the Purchaser and provided to the
Transferred Employees (excluding any equity-related plan, program or
arrangement), the Purchaser shall credit the Transferred Employees under such
plan, program or arrangement for service on or prior to the Closing with the
Seller and its Subsidiaries as service with the Purchaser to the extent the
Seller recognized such service under any comparable plan, program or arrangement
of the Seller; provided, however, that Purchaser shall not be required to
provide the Transferred Employees with any credit for service with the Seller
and its Subsidiaries for the purpose of benefit accrual under any of the
Purchaser's defined benefit plans.

                  (c)      The Seller and its Subsidiaries acknowledge that,
except as required by Requirements of Law, the Purchaser shall not assume any
liability related to any Benefit Plan that is sponsored or maintained by the
Seller, any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate (whether former or current).

                  (d)      The Purchaser acknowledges that to the extent the
Seller and its ERISA Affiliates cease to provide any group health plan to any
employee, if required by a Requirement of Law, the Purchaser shall be treated as
a "successor employer" pursuant

<PAGE>

                                                                              38

to Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9, Q&A-8(c). The Seller will notify the
Purchaser in writing of the termination of any "group health plan" maintained by
the Seller or any of its ERISA Affiliates and will use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide to the Purchaser as soon as practicable following the
Seller's decision to terminate such plan (but in no event later than 15 days
following the termination of such plan) a list of the names and addresses of any
individual who would be an "M&A qualified beneficiary" (within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9, Q&A-4) under such group health plan.

                  (e)      The Seller shall be responsible for any liabilities
or obligations (i) arising under the WARN Act, if any, and (ii) resulting from
or precipitated by layoffs, if any, in respect of employees of the Seller whose
employment was terminated on or prior to Closing. The Purchaser shall be
responsible for any liabilities or obligations arising under the WARN Act in
respect of any Transferred Employees. For the sake of clarity, and without
limiting any other provision of this Agreement, the parties acknowledge and
agree that, except as set forth in Section 4.8(d), the Purchaser shall have no
liability for the payment of any amounts due to the Seller's current or former
employees under agreements with or plans of the Seller, including, without
limitation, termination, severance, and retention payments and any obligation to
provide health, disability, life, retirement, or other benefits (whether covered
by insurance or not).

                  (f)      The Purchaser shall pay the Signing Bonuses to the
Transferred Employees set forth on Schedule 1.5(f) promptly after the Closing.

                  (g)      In the event that the Sporting Goods Transition
Services Agreement is not terminated prior to the Closing Date, and the
Purchaser, therefore, assumes such Contract in accordance with Section 1.1(b),
the Purchaser shall be reimbursed in an amount (the "Transitional Employee
Reimbursement Amount") equal to the lesser of (i) the actual out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the Purchaser associated with the termination of the
Transferred Employees whose services are no longer required to carry out the
transactions contemplated by the Sporting Goods Transition Services Agreement
(the "Transitional Employees") and (ii) $100,000. In order to determine the
amount of the Transitional Employee Reimbursement Amount, the Purchaser shall
provide the Seller, within fifteen (15) days after the termination of the
Sporting Goods Transition Services Agreement, with a statement, prepared in good
faith and certified by the chief financial officer of the Purchaser, that
identifies (A) the terminated Transitional Employees and (B) the amount of
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Purchaser in connection with the
termination of such Transitional Employees. Upon delivery of the foregoing
statement, the Purchaser shall be immediately, and no later than three (3)
Business Days after delivery of such statement, reimbursed from the Indemnity
Deposit (without giving effect to the Purchaser Recovery Threshold) in an amount
equal to the Transitional Employee Reimbursement Amount determined in accordance
with this Section 4.8(g). For the sake of clarity, only those Transferred
Employees terminated within fifteen (15) days of the termination of the Sporting
Goods Transition Services Agreement may be deemed by the Seller to be terminated
Transitional Employees.

         4.9      Bankruptcy Court Approval. No later than three (3) Business
Days after the execution of this Agreement, the Seller will file a motion or
motions with the Bankruptcy Court seeking entry of (a) an order of the
Bankruptcy Court regarding the Acquisition establishing notice and service
requirements to creditors and parties in interest with respect to the
Acquisition, approving the Break-Up Fee and the Expense Reimbursement, and

conditioned or delayed)) of Exhibit C hereto, and shall, among other matters:

                           (i)      approve the Break-Up Fee and the Expense
         Reimbursement and provide that, if the obligation of the Seller to pay
         the Purchaser the Break-Up Fee and/or the Expense Reimbursement arises,
         such obligation shall constitute an administrative expense under
         Section 503(b) and 507(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code and shall be
         payable in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement without
         further order of the Bankruptcy Court;

                           (ii)     approve the Bidding Procedures; and

                           (iii)    schedule a hearing to consider entry of the
         Sale Approval Order and provide that notice of such hearing be given to
         all of the Seller's creditors, interest holders of record, the
         Environmental Protection Agency, all state/local environmental agencies
         in any jurisdiction where the Seller owns or has owned or used real
         property, the Internal Revenue Service, all state/local taxing
         authorities in jurisdictions where the Seller has or may have any tax
         liability, and potential other purchasers identified by the Seller and
         otherwise in accordance with Bankruptcy Rule 2002, and that the Seller
         publish notice of such hearing in the Chicopee Gazette.

                  (b)      The Sale Approval Order. The Sale Approval Order
shall be substantially in the form (with such changes thereto as the Purchaser
shall approve (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed)) of Exhibit D hereto, and shall, among other matters:

                           (i)      approve the Acquisition on the terms set
         forth herein;

                           (ii)     find that, as of the Closing Date, the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement effect a legal, valid,
         enforceable and effective sale and transfer of the Assets to the
         Purchaser and shall vest the Purchaser with title to the Assets free
         and clear of all Encumbrances, except as expressly provided by this
         Agreement;

<PAGE>

                                                                              40

                           (iii)    find that the consideration provided by the
         Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement constitutes reasonably equivalent
         value and fair consideration for the Assets;

                           (iv)     find that, as of the Closing Date, the
         Contracts to be assumed by the Seller and assigned to the Purchaser
         pursuant to this Agreement will have been duly assigned to the
         Purchaser in accordance with Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code;

                           (v)      find that the Purchaser is a good faith

         the Seller and assigned to the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement
         will be transferred to, and remain in full force and effect for the
         benefit of the Purchaser, notwithstanding any provision in any such
         Contract or lease or any Requirement of Law (including those described
         in Sections 365(b)(2) and (f) of the Bankruptcy Code) that prohibits,
         restricts or limits in any way such assignment or transfer;

                           (vii)    approve any other agreement to the extent
         provided by this Agreement;

                           (viii)   find that the Seller gave due and proper

         to the Purchaser each of the Assumed Contracts;

                           (x)      find that the Purchaser has satisfied all
         requirements under Sections 365(b)(1) and 365(f)(2) of the Bankruptcy

         Acquisition;

                           (xii)    enjoin and forever bar the nondebtor party

         of Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure 6004(g) and 6006(d), the Sale

all books and records in respect of the operations of the Business in the
Purchaser's possession for a period of at least seven (7) years from the Closing

                  (b)      If, in order to properly prepare documents required
to be filed with Governmental Bodies or its financial statements, it is
necessary that either party hereto or any successors thereto be furnished with
additional information relating to the Business, the Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities, and such information is in the possession of the other party hereto
or any successor thereto or any of their respective Affiliates, such party
agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to furnish or cause to be

         4.12     Directors, Officers and Affiliates. Except in the case of

of the Seller or any of the Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date shall have any
Liability or responsibility to the Purchaser for (and the Purchaser
unconditionally releases such officers, directors and Affiliates from) any
Liability:

                  (a)      arising out of, or relating to, the organization,

or in any certificate contemplated hereby and delivered by the Seller in

<PAGE>

                                                                              42

oral), documents or materials furnished by the Seller.

         4.13     Tax Matters.

                  (a)      Sales, Use and Other Transfer Taxes. The Purchaser
shall provide the Seller with resale exemption certificates as is appropriate.
In accordance with Section 1146(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, the parties
acknowledge that the making or delivery of any instrument of transfer, including
the filing of any deed or other document of transfer to evidence, effectuate or
perfect the rights, transfers and interest contemplated by this Agreement, shall
be in contemplation of a plan or plans of reorganization to be confirmed in the
Bankruptcy Case, and as such shall be free and clear of any and all transfer
Tax, stamp Tax or similar Taxes. The instruments transferring the Assets to the
Purchaser shall contain the following endorsement:

                  "Because this [instrument] has been authorized pursuant to
                  Order of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District
                  of Delaware, in contemplation of a plan of reorganization of
                  the Seller, it is exempt from transfer taxes, stamp taxes or
                  similar taxes pursuant to 11 U.S.C. Section 1146(c)."

                  In the event real estate transfer Taxes are required to be
paid in order to record the deeds to be delivered to the Purchaser in accordance
herewith, or in the event any such Taxes are assessed at any time thereafter,
such real estate transfer Taxes incurred as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Purchaser. The Purchaser shall also be
responsible for all of the excise, sales, value added, use, registration, stamp,
franchise, transfer and similar Taxes, levies, charges and fees incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and which are
not otherwise exempt pursuant to the applicable sections of the Bankruptcy Code.
The Seller shall be responsible for all income, profit, and similar taxes
incurred or imposed with respect to the sale of the Assets by the Seller. The
parties hereto agree to cooperate in the filing of all necessary documentation
and all Tax Returns with respect to all such Taxes, including any available
pre-sale filing procedure.

                  (b)      Wage Reporting. The Purchaser and the Seller agree to
utilize, or cause their respective Affiliates to utilize, the standard procedure
set forth in Revenue Procedure 96-60, 1996-2 C.B. 399, with respect to wage
reporting.

                  (c)      Cooperation. The parties hereto shall cooperate with
each other and with each other's respective Representatives, including
accounting firms and legal counsel, in connection with the preparation or audit
of any Tax Return(s) and any Tax claim or litigation in respect of the Assets
and Assumed Liabilities that include whole or partial taxable periods,
activities, operations or events on or prior to the Closing Date, which
cooperation shall include, but not be limited to, making available employees, if
any, for the purpose of providing testimony and advice, or original documents,
or either of them.

         4.14     Cure Costs. The Seller shall be exclusively responsible for
payment all Cure Costs.

         4.15     Notification of Certain Matters. Each party promptly shall
provide the other written notice of (a) the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any
event the occurrence or nonoccurrence of which has caused or would be likely to
cause any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to become
untrue or inaccurate such that the conditions set forth in Sections 5 and 6, as
applicable, would not be satisfied and (b) any failure of the Seller or the
Purchaser, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy in any material respect
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder such that the conditions set forth in Sections 5 and 6, as applicable,
would not be satisfied; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 4.15 shall not cure such breach or non-compliance or
limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving such notice; provided further, however, that if such notified party
consummates the transactions herein after waiving satisfaction of the condition
set forth in Section 5.1 or 6.1, as the case may be, such consummation will be
deemed to cure such breach or non-compliance and such notified party shall be
deemed to waive any remedies hereunder to the extent of such notification. For
the sake of clarity, in accordance with Section 5.1 and Section 6.1, if a party
notifies the other of a breach of one or more representations or warranties, but
such breach or breaches do not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute a
Material Adverse Effect, as to the Seller, or a material adverse effect, as to
the Purchaser (each such breach, if any, being referred to herein as a "Minor
Deficiency"), the Purchaser or the Seller, as the case may be, will be required,
in accordance with Section 5.1 or 6.1, as applicable, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (assuming that all other enumerated
conditions are satisfied). In no event shall the notification of, or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with notice of,
a Minor Deficiency be deemed to be a waiver of such Minor Deficiency, or limit
or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party having notice
of such Minor Deficiency after the Closing.

         4.16     Title Insurance. The Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain:

                           (i)      an ALTA Owner's Policy of Title Insurance
         (with no exclusion for creditor's rights) issues by Chicago Title
         Company for each parcel of Owned Real Property listed on Schedule 4.16,
         with liability in the amount of that portion of the Purchase Price
         allocated to such parcel of Owned Real Property, insuring fee title in
         the Owned Real Property as vested in the Purchaser subject only to
         those matters as may have been specifically approved by the Purchaser;
         and

                           (ii)     an ALTA Leasehold Owner's Policy of Title
         Insurance (with no exclusion for creditor's rights) issued by Chicago
         Title Company for each parcel of Leased Real Property, listed on
         Schedule 4.16, with liability in the amount of that portion of the
         Purchase Price allocated to such parcel of Leased Real Property,
         insuring leasehold title in the Leased Real Property as vested in the

                                                                              44

         Purchaser subject only to those matters as may have been specifically
         approved by the Purchaser.

         4.17     Name Change. From and after the Closing, the Purchaser shall
own all of the corporate names, trade names and trademarks included in the
Intellectual Property, including, without limitation, the "Top-Flite" name,
together with all related designs (collectively, the "Top-Flite Name"). The
Seller and Top-Flite, Inc. shall, and shall cause each Subsidiary to, promptly,
following the Closing Date, but in no event later than 6 months, change its name
so that it ceases to use the Top-Flite Name.

         4.18     Performance by the Foreign Subsidiaries. The Seller shall take
all actions necessary to ensure that the Foreign Subsidiaries shall perform and
comply with this Agreement and shall (and cause any of the Foreign Subsidiaries,
if applicable, to) take such further actions as may be reasonably required to
carry out the provisions hereof and give effect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. The Foreign Subsidiaries shall not be a "Seller" hereunder.
The Seller shall convey as soon as practicable after the Closing any Assets of
the Foreign Subsidiaries not conveyed at the Closing by executing an instrument
of transfer substantially in the form of the Bill of Sale. The Purchaser
acknowledges that certain or all of the Assets of the Foreign Subsidiaries may
not be conveyed at the Closing and that the failure to convey such Assets will
not breach any representation and warranty, covenant or condition herein. Until
such Assets of the Foreign Subsidiaries have been conveyed, the Seller shall
cooperate, and shall cause Foreign Subsidiaries to cooperate, to provide the
Purchaser with the benefit of such Assets and the Purchaser shall cooperate to
assume the obligations associated with such Assets. If a material amount of the
Assets held by the Foreign Subsidiaries cannot be transferred at the Closing,
the parties agree that the payment of a portion of the Closing Cash Payment (the
exact amount of which shall be mutually agreed upon by the parties based upon
the facts and circumstances then existing) shall be delayed until such time as
such Assets are successfully transferred to the Purchaser.

         5.       Conditions Precedent to the Obligation of the Purchaser. The
obligation of the Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is subject to the fulfillment on or prior to the Closing Date of each
of the following conditions, any one or more of which (to the extent permitted
by law) may be waived by the Purchaser:

         5.1      Representations and Warranties; Covenants. The representations
and warranties of the Seller contained in this Agreement shall be true and
correct (without giving effect to any materiality or Material Adverse Effect
qualifiers set forth therein), as of the date of this Agreement and as of the
Closing with the same force and effect as if made as of the Closing, other than
such representations and warranties that are made as of another date, which
representations and warranties shall be true and correct as of such date, except
where the failure of the representations and warranties described in this
Section 5.1 to be true and correct would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement to be complied with by the Seller at or
before the Closing

shall have been complied with in all material respects. The Purchaser shall have
received a certificate of the Seller to such effect signed by a duly authorized
officer thereof.

         5.2      No Order. No Governmental Body shall have enacted, issued,
promulgated, enforced or entered any statute, rule, regulation, injunction or

has the effect of making the transactions contemplated by this Agreement illegal

which are not satisfied or resolved or preempted by the Sale Approval Order.

         5.3      HSR Act Filing. Each party to this Agreement required to file
a notification and report form in compliance with the HSR Act (and foreign

have expired or been terminated.

         5.4      Bankruptcy Filing. The Bankruptcy Case shall not have been
dismissed or converted to Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code and no trustee shall
have been appointed. The Bankruptcy Court shall have entered the Sale Approval
Order and it shall not have been vacated, reversed or stayed.

         5.5      Consents. All material consents and notices required to be
obtained or made to enable the Seller and the Subsidiaries to assign and the
Purchaser to assume the Assigned Contracts listed on Schedule 5.5 shall have
been obtained or made by the Seller or the Subsidiaries.

         5.6      Closing Documents. The Seller shall have delivered to the
Purchaser on the Closing Date the documents required to be delivered pursuant to
Section 1.9.

         5.7      Releases. The Seller shall release, and shall execute such
documents as are necessary or appropriate to evidence such release, all
Transferred Employees, as of the time of the Closing, from any and all
noncompetition and nonsolicitation restrictions to which such transferred
Employees may be subject pursuant to any agreement with or plan of the Seller.

         6.       Conditions Precedent to the Obligation of the Seller to Close.

and warranties of the Purchaser contained in this Agreement shall be true and
correct (without giving effect to any materiality or material adverse effect to
the Purchaser qualifiers set forth therein), as of the date of this Agreement
and as of the Closing, with the same force and effect as if made as of the
Closing, other than such representations and warranties that are made as of
another date, which representations and warranties shall be true and correct as
of such date, except where failure of the representations and warranties

                                                                              46

described in this Section 6.1 to be true and correct would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect
to the Purchaser. The covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement to be
complied with by the Purchaser at or before the Closing shall have been complied
with in all material respects. The Seller shall have received a certificate of
the Purchaser to such effect signed by a duly authorized officer thereof.

         6.2      No Order. No Governmental Body shall have enacted, issued,
promulgated, enforced or entered any statute, rule, regulation, injunction or

by it pursuant to Section 1.10.

         7.       Termination of Agreement.

         7.1      Termination Prior to Closing; Break-Up Fee. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, this Agreement may be terminated, and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement abandoned, upon notice by the
terminating party to the other party:

                  (a)      at any time before the Closing, by the mutual written
consent of the Seller and the Purchaser;

                  (b)      by either the Seller or the Purchaser if the Closing
shall not have occurred prior to October 31, 2003; provided, however, that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b) shall not be
available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, the failure
of the Closing to occur prior to such date;

                  (c)      at any time before the Closing, by the Purchaser on
the one hand, or the Seller, on the other hand, in the event of a material
breach of this Agreement by the non-terminating party or if the satisfaction of
any condition to such party's obligations under this Agreement becomes
impossible with the use of commercially reasonable

                                                                              47

efforts and the failure of such condition to be satisfied is not caused by a
breach by the terminating party;

                  (d)      by either the Seller or the Purchaser, if the
Bankruptcy Court approves a sale, transfer or other disposition by the Seller of
all or substantially all of the assets of the Seller relating to the Business or
all or a substantial part of any of the Assets to a Person (or group of Persons)
other than the Purchaser (a "Competing Transaction");

                  (e)      by the Purchaser (provided that the Purchaser is not
then in material breach of any provision of this Agreement), if any of the
following shall occur:

                           (i)      the Bankruptcy Case is dismissed or
         converted to chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code or a trustee is appointed
         for the Seller;

                           (ii)     the Bidding Procedures Order shall not have
         been entered on or before the thirtieth (30th) day after the date
         hereof; provided, however, that the Purchaser shall not be entitled to
         exercise its rights under this clause (ii) later than five (5) Business
         Days after such thirty day period has expired or if the Bidding
         Procedures Order has been entered by the Bankruptcy Court prior to the
         Purchaser exercising such rights;

                           (iii)    if the Sale Approval Order has not been
         entered by the Bankruptcy Court within seventy-five (75) days after the
         date hereof; provided, however, that the Purchaser shall not be
         entitled to exercise its rights under this clause (iii) later than five
         (5) Business Days after such seventy-five day period has expired or if
         the Sale Order has been entered by the Bankruptcy Court prior to the
         Purchaser exercising such rights.

         7.2      Termination Payments.

                  (a)      In the event that this Agreement is terminated under
Section 7.1(b), (c) (with respect to Sections 7.1(b) and (c), only if and to the
extent that the Seller has not used commercially reasonable efforts to
consummate the transactions herein) or (e), and provided that the Purchaser is
not in material breach of any provision of this Agreement prior to such
termination, the Seller shall be obligated to pay the Purchaser an amount in
cash equal to the total amount of fees, costs and expenses incurred by the
Purchaser in connection with the preparation, execution and performance of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including without limitation
all filing and notification fees, and all fees and expenses of the Purchaser's
Representatives (the "Expense Reimbursement"). The Expense Reimbursement shall
not exceed $1,250,000 (the "Expense Reimbursement Limit"). For purposes of both
this Section 7.2(a) and Section 7.2(b) below, and provided that the Expense
Reimbursement does not exceed the Expense Reimbursement Limit, the Seller
acknowledges and agrees that the Expense Reimbursement is a reasonable amount
given the size and complexity of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Expense Reimbursement shall be paid by wire transfer or other
means acceptable to the Purchaser not later than five (5) Business Days
following the Seller's receipt of written notice from the Purchaser describing
the fees and

<PAGE>

                                                                              48

expenses which constitute the Expense Reimbursement in reasonable detail (the
"Expense Reimbursement Notice").

                  (b)      In the event that this Agreement is terminated under
Section 7.1(d), and provided that the Purchaser is not in material breach of any
provision of this Agreement prior to such termination, the Seller shall: (i) pay
the Purchaser, in cash, the Expense Reimbursement (up to the Expense
Reimbursement Limit) by wire transfer or other means acceptable to the Purchaser
not later than five (5) Business Days following receipt by the Seller of the
Expense Reimbursement Notice; and (ii) pay to the Purchaser, in cash, the sum of
$4,375,000 (the "Break-up Fee") not later than the earlier of: (A) five (5)
Business Days after the closing of a Competing Transaction and (B) five (5)
Business Days after the date of the termination of a Competing Transaction prior
to closing; provided that the Break-up Fee shall only be payable by the Seller
pursuant to Section 7.2(b)(ii)(B) if the Seller retains a good faith deposit
remitted to the Seller by a purchaser in a Competing Transaction. The Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that if the Bidding Procedures, other than the amount of
the Break-Up Fee and/or the Expense Reimbursement, set forth in the Bidding
Procedures Order are approved and if payment of the full amount of such Break-Up
Fee and/or Expense Reimbursement are otherwise assured to the Purchaser, then
the Purchaser may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(e)(ii).

                  (c)      The Purchaser acknowledges that the Purchaser shall
not be relieved of its obligations hereunder if approval by the Bankruptcy Court
of the provisions of Section 7.2(b)(ii)(B) herein is not obtained but payment of
the Break-Up Fee in the circumstances set forth in Section 7.2(b)(ii)(B) is
otherwise assured.

         7.3      Survival After Termination. If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 7.1 and the transactions contemplated hereby are not
consummated, this Agreement shall become null and void and have no further force
or effect, except that any such termination shall be without prejudice to the
rights of any party on account of the nonsatisfaction of the conditions set
forth in Articles 5 and 6 resulting from the intentional or willful breach or
violation of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of another
party under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the provisions of Sections 4.2, 4.3, 7.2, this Section 7.3, and
Section 9 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

         7.4      Waiver. Each party hereto may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party hereto,
(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements of the other party contained herein, or
(d) waive satisfaction of any condition to its obligations hereunder. Any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing
signed by the party to be bound thereby.

8.       Indemnification.

         8.1      Indemnification by the Seller. Subject to Section 4.15 and to
the extent provided in this Article VIII, from and after the Closing Date, the
Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Purchaser's Indemnified
Persons, and each of them, from and against any Losses incurred or suffered by
the Purchaser's Indemnified Persons as a result of or arising from:

                  (a)      any breach of any representation or warranty of the
Seller;

                  (b)      the breach of any covenant, agreement or other
obligation of the Seller set forth in this Agreement;

                  (c)      the Excluded Liabilities;

                  (d)      payments to be made under the Infiniti Settlement
Agreement with regard to sales made on or before June 30, 2004;

                  (e)      the Seller's pro rata portion of the Year End Bonuses
paid by the Purchaser and calculated in accordance with Section 1.5(e);

pursuant to Section 1.7(c); and

                  (h)      any payments required to be paid by the Seller
pursuant to Section 4.8(g).

         8.2      Seller Limitations. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, in no event shall any of the Purchaser's Indemnified Persons
recover, or seek to recover, by claim for indemnification or otherwise, any
Losses until:

                  (a)      notice thereof shall have been given by or on behalf
of any of the Purchaser's Indemnified Persons to the Seller in the manner
provided in Section 8.5; and

                  (b)      the aggregate of all Losses recoverable by the
Purchaser's Indemnified Persons exceeds $750,000 (the "Purchaser Recovery
Threshold"), in which event all Losses in excess of the Purchaser Recovery
Threshold shall be recoverable by the Purchaser's Indemnified Persons in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement; provided, that no loss exceeding
the Indemnity Deposit shall be recoverable; and provided further that amounts
payable by the Seller pursuant to Sections 8.1(d), (e), (f), (g) and (h): (A)
shall not be subject to the Purchaser Recovery Threshold; (B) shall be paid
promptly out of the Indemnity Deposit in accordance with the Indemnity Escrow
Agreement, and (C) shall not be included in the calculation of determining
whether the aggregate of all Losses recoverable by the Purchaser's Indemnified
Parties for claims made pursuant to Sections 8.1(a), (b), and (c) exceeds the
Purchaser Recovery Threshold.

                                                                              50

                  (c)      the obligations of the Seller under Section 8.1 shall
be deemed to be waived by the Purchaser's Indemnified Persons to the extent of
any waiver of Section 6.1 as provided in Section 4.15.

                  The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the Indemnity
Deposit is the sole source of funding for any Claims for indemnification for the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties and under no circumstances shall any Purchaser
Indemnified Party be entitled to be indemnified to the extent the Losses exceed
the Indemnity Deposit.

         8.3      Indemnification by the Purchaser. Subject to Section 4.15 and
to the extent provided in this Article VIII, from and after the Closing Date,
the Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller's Indemnified

                  (a)      any breach in any representation or warranty of the
Purchaser;

                  (b)      the breach of any covenant, agreement or other
obligation of the Purchaser set forth in this Agreement;

                  (c)      the Assumed Liabilities; and

                  (d)      any payments required to be paid by the Purchaser
pursuant to Section 1.7(c).

         8.4      Purchaser's Limitations. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall any of the Seller's Indemnified
Persons recover, or seek to recover, by claim for indemnification or otherwise,
any Losses until:

                  (a)      notice thereof shall have been given by or on behalf

provided in Section 8.5;

                  (b)      the aggregate of all Losses recoverable by the
Seller's Indemnified Persons exceeds $750,000 (the "Seller Recovery Threshold"),
in which event all Losses in excess of the Seller Recovery Threshold shall be
recoverable by the Seller's Indemnified Persons in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement; provided that amounts payable by the Purchaser pursuant to
Section 8.3(d): (A) shall not be subject to the Seller Recovery Threshold; (B)
shall be paid promptly by the Purchaser; and (C) shall not be included in the
calculation of determining whether the aggregate of all Losses recoverable by
the Seller's Indemnified Parties for claims made pursuant to Section 8.3(a),
(b), and (c) exceeds the Seller Recovery Threshold; and

                  (c)      the obligations of the Purchaser under Section 8.3
shall be deemed to be waived by the Seller's Indemnified Persons to the extent
of any waiver of Section 5.1 as provided in Section 4.15.

                                                                              51

         8.5      Notice and Procedure. All claims for indemnification by any
Indemnified Party against an Indemnifying Party under this Article VIII shall be
asserted and resolved as follows:

                  (a)      (i) If any claim or demand for which an Indemnifying
Party would be liable for Losses to an Indemnified Party is alleged or asserted
by a Person other than any of Purchaser's Indemnified Persons or any of Seller's
Indemnified Persons (a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall deliver
written notice (a "Claim Notice") promptly to the Indemnifying Party, together
with a copy of all papers served, if any, and specifying the nature of and
alleged basis for the Third Party Claim and, to the extent then feasible, the
alleged amount or the estimated amount of the Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnified Party fails to deliver the Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party
within twenty (20) days after the Indemnified Party receives notice of such
Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be obligated to indemnify the
Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim if, and only to the
extent that, the Indemnifying Party's ability to defend the Third Party Claim
has been prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnifying Party will notify the
Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Claim Notice (the
"Notice Period") whether the Indemnifying Party intends, at the sole cost and
expense of the Indemnifying Party, to defend the Indemnified Party against the
Third Party Claim. Should the Indemnifying Party elect to assume the defense of
a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the
Indemnified Party for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, except as provided by
Section 8.5(a)(ii).

                           (i)      If the Indemnifying Party notifies the
         Indemnified Party within the Notice Period that the Indemnifying Party
         intends to defend the Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim,
         then the Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend, at its sole
         cost and expense, the Third Party Claim by all appropriate proceedings,
         which proceedings will be diligently prosecuted by the Indemnifying
         Party to a final conclusion or settled at the discretion of the
         Indemnifying Party (with the consent of the Indemnified Party, which
         shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Indemnifying Party
         will have full control of such defense and proceedings; provided,
         however, that the Indemnified Party may file during the Notice Period,
         at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnified Party, any motion,
         answer or other pleading that the Indemnified Party may deem necessary
         or appropriate to protect its interests and not prejudicial to the
         Indemnifying Party (it being understood and agreed that if an
         Indemnified Party takes any such action that is prejudicial or
         conclusively causes a final adjudication that is materially adverse to
         the Indemnifying Party (including, but not limited to, any admission of
         any liability with respect to, or settlement, compromise or discharge
         of, such Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying Party's prior
         written consent), the Indemnifying Party will be relieved of its
         obligations hereunder with respect to that portion of the Third Party
         Claim prejudiced by the Indemnified Party's action); provided, further,
         however, that, if requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified
         Party shall cooperate, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying
         Party, with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any
         Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party elects to contest or,

<PAGE>

                                                                              52

         if appropriate in the judgment of the Indemnified Party, in making any
         counterclaim or cross-claim against any Person (other than the
         Indemnified Party). Such cooperation shall include the retention and
         (upon the Indemnifying Party's request) the provision to the
         Indemnifying Party of records and information that are reasonably
         relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available on a
         mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
         explanation of any material provided thereunder. The Indemnified Party
         may participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any
         Third Party Claim assumed by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
         Section 8.5(a)(ii) and, except as provided in this Section 8.5(a)(ii),
         the Indemnified Party will bear its own costs and expenses with respect
         to such participation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying
         Party may not assume the defense of the Third Party Claim if (1) the
         Persons against whom the claim is made, or any impleaded Persons,
         include both the Indemnifying Party and any Indemnified Party, and (2)
         representation of both such Persons by the same counsel would be
         inappropriate due to conflicting interests between them, in which case
         any Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend the Third Party
         Claim and to employ counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party.

                           (ii)     If the Indemnifying Party fails to notify
         the Indemnified Party within the Notice Period that the Indemnifying
         Party intends to defend the Indemnified Party against the Third Party
         Claim, or if the Indemnifying Party gives such notice but fails to
         diligently prosecute or settle the Third Party Claim, or if the
         Indemnifying Party fails to give any notice whatsoever within the
         Notice Period, then the Indemnified Party will have the right (but not
         the obligation) to defend, at the sole cost and expense of the
         Indemnifying Party, the Third Party Claim by all appropriate
         proceedings, which proceedings will be diligently prosecuted by the
         Indemnified Party to a final conclusion or settled at the discretion of
         the Indemnified Party. In any such instance, the Indemnified Party will
         have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any
         compromise or settlement thereof; provided, however, that, if requested
         by the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate, at
         the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, with the
         Indemnified Party and its counsel in contesting the Third Party Claim
         which the Indemnified Party is contesting, or, if appropriate and
         related to the Third Party Claim in question, in making any
         counterclaim or cross claim against any Person (other then the
         Indemnifying Party).

                           (iii)    If the Indemnifying Party notifies the
         Indemnified Party within the Notice Period that the Indemnifying Party
         disputes its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party against the
         Third Party Claim, and if such dispute is resolved in favor of the
         Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party will not be required to bear
         the costs and expenses of the Indemnified Party's defense pursuant to
         Section 8.5(a) or of the Indemnifying Party's participation therein at
         the Indemnified Party's request, and the Indemnified Party will
         reimburse the Indemnifying Party in full for all reasonably incurred
         costs and expenses.

                                                                              53

                  (b)      In the event any Indemnified Party should have a
claim against any Indemnifying Party that is not a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver a written notice (an "Indemnity Notice") with
reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying Party specifying the nature of and
specific basis for the claim and, to the extent then feasible, the amount or the
estimated amount of the claim. The failure by any Indemnified Party to give
timely notice referred to in the preceding sentence shall not impair such
Person's rights hereunder except to the extent that an Indemnifying Party
demonstrates that it has been significantly prejudiced thereby. If the
Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days
following its receipt of the Indemnity Notice that the Indemnifying Party
disputes its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder, the claim
will be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder.

                  (c)      If the Indemnifying Party timely disputes its
liability with respect to a claim described in a Claim Notice or an Indemnity
Notice, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall proceed promptly
and in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute within sixty (60)
days following receipt of the Claim Notice or Indemnity Notice.

                  (d)      Except where liability is disputed pursuant to
Section 8.5(c), the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of any liability to
the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days following the final resolution of
any Third Party Claim or any such other Claim by the Indemnified Party. In the
event the Indemnified Party is not paid in full for its claim in a timely manner
after the Indemnifying Party's obligation to indemnify and the amount thereof
has been determined, the amount due shall bear interest from the date that the
Indemnifying Party received the Claim Notice or the Indemnity Notice until paid
at the Discount Rate provided, and in addition to any other rights it may have
against the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
set-off the unpaid amount of such Claim against any amounts owed by it to the
Indemnifying Party.

                  (e)      Any estimated amount of a Claim submitted in a Claim
Notice or an Indemnity Notice shall not be conclusive of the final amount of
such Claim, and the giving of a Claim Notice when an Indemnity Notice is
properly due, or the giving of an Indemnity Notice when a Claim Notice is
properly due, shall not impair such Indemnified Party's rights hereunder except
to the extent that an Indemnifying Party demonstrates that it has been
prejudiced thereby.

         8.6      Remedies. The indemnification provisions of this Article VIII
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties following the Closing,
including for any Claims for the recovery of Losses, whether directly or by way
of contribution, for any and all breaches or alleged breaches of any
representation, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or other
provision of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby other than
for claims of, or causes of action arising from fraud. Under no circumstances
shall any Indemnified Party be entitled to be indemnified for punitive or other
similar damages.

investigate the Business or any right of any party (whether or not exercised) to
investigate the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other

Purchaser has, on the other hand, the right to rely fully upon the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the other contained in
this Agreement. The representations and warranties in this Agreement made by the
Seller and the Purchaser respectively will survive the Closing until the one
year anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Survival Period"); provided that:

that would otherwise terminate in accordance with the Survival Period shall
survive if a Claim Notice or an Indemnity Notice , in either case specifying in
reasonable detail the nature of the Claim, shall have been given on or prior to
the expiration of such Survival Period, until the related Claim for
indemnification has been satisfied or otherwise resolved as provided in this
Section 8; provided, however, that all Claims for indemnification specified in
the Claim Notice or Indemnity Notice must be asserted prior to the expiration of
the Survival Period and if any such Claim is not made before the expiration of
the Survival Period, the Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to
indemnification; and

                  (b)      covenants and agreements to be performed after the
Closing Date will survive the Closing for the term specified therein, or, if no
term is specified, indefinitely.

hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered
shall be an original, but all such counterparts together shall constitute one
and the same instrument. Each counterpart may consist of a number of copies
hereof each signed by less than all, but together signed by all, of the parties
hereto.

         9.13     No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as otherwise set forth in
Section 4.12 or with respect to the Assumed Sporting Goods Obligations, no
provision of this Agreement is intended to, or shall, confer any third party
beneficiary or other rights or remedies upon any Person other than the parties
hereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and except as otherwise
set forth in Section 4.12 or, with respect to the Assumed Sporting Goods
Obligations, the Sporting Goods Sale Agreements, no provision of this Agreement
shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any employee or former
employee of the Seller or any of the Subsidiaries (including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof) in respect of continued employment by the Seller or any of
the Subsidiaries or otherwise.

the Seller with the provisions of any so-called bulk transfer laws of any
jurisdiction in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         meanings ascribed to them in the Motion or in the Agreement.

<PAGE>

Debtors, their estates, their creditors and other parties-in-interest; and due
and adequate notice of the Motion having been given under the circumstances; and
upon the Declarations of Matthew Cwiertnia and Kevin M. Golmont in support of
the Motion and the Debtors' motion to authorize the Asset Sale, and the
remainder of the record herein; and after due deliberation thereon; and good and
sufficient cause appearing therefore, it is hereby

                  FOUND, CONCLUDED AND DECLARED THAT:(2)

                  A.       This Court has jurisdiction over this matter and over
the property of the Debtors and their bankruptcy estates pursuant to 28
U.S.C. Sections 157(a) and 1334.

                  B.       This is a core proceeding pursuant to 28
U.S.C. Section 157(b)(2)(A), (M) and (O).

                  C.       Good and sufficient notice of the Motion and the
relief sought therein has been given and no other or further notice is required.
A reasonable opportunity to object or be heard regarding the relief requested in
the Motion has been afforded to parties in interest.

                  D.       The Debtors' proposed notices of (i) the Asset Sale,
(ii) the assumption and assignment of unexpired leases, license agreements and
executory contracts and any cure amounts payable in respect thereof, as
described or referred to in the Agreement, and (iii) the Sale Procedures, are
appropriate and reasonably calculated to provide all interested parties with
timely and proper notice of the Auction, the Asset Sale,

------------------
(2)      Findings of fact shall be construed as conclusions of law and
         conclusions of law shall be construed as findings of fact when
         appropriate. See Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7052.

and the assumption and assignment of unexpired leases, license agreements and
executory contracts and the Sale Procedures to be employed in connection
therewith.

                  E.       The Debtors have demonstrated a sound business
justification for authorizing the payment of the Expense Reimbursement and
Break-Up Fee to the Purchaser under the circumstances set forth in the Motion
and the Agreement.

                  F.       The Expense Reimbursement and Break-Up Fee are fair
and reasonable, and were negotiated by the parties in good faith and at arms'
length.

                  G.       The Debtors' payment of the Expense Reimbursement and
Break-Up Fee to the Purchaser, as set forth in the Agreement, is (a) an actual
and necessary cost and expense of preserving the Debtors' bankruptcy estates,
within the meaning of section 503(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, (b) of substantial
benefit to the Debtors' estates, (c) reasonable and appropriate, including in
light of the size and nature of the Asset Sale and the efforts that have been
and will be expended by the Purchaser even though the proposed Asset Sale to the
Purchaser is subject to higher or better offers, and (d) necessary to ensure
that the Purchaser will continue to pursue its proposed acquisition of the
Assets.

                  H.       The Expense Reimbursement and Break-Up Fee were and
are material inducements for, and conditions of, the Purchaser's entering into
the Agreement. The Purchaser is unwilling to commit to hold open its offer to
purchase the Assets under the terms of the Agreement unless it is assured of
payment of the Expense Reimbursement and Break-Up Fee as more fully set forth in
the Agreement. Assurance to the Purchaser of payment of the Expense
Reimbursement and Break-Up Fee has

                                       3

<PAGE>

promoted and will promote more competitive bidding by inducing the Purchaser's
bid that otherwise would not have been made, and without which bidding would
have been and would continue to be limited. Further, because the Expense
Reimbursement and Break-Up Fee induced the Purchaser to research the value of
the Assets and submit a bid that will serve as a minimum or floor bid for all of
the Assets on which other bidders and the Debtors can rely, the Purchaser has
provided a benefit to the Debtors' bankruptcy estates by increasing the
likelihood that the price at which the Assets are sold will reflect their true
worth.

                  I.       Absent authorization of the payment of the Expense
Reimbursement and Break-Up Fee, the Debtors may lose the opportunity to obtain
the highest and best available offer for the Assets and the downside protection
afforded by the Agreement. In light of the benefit to the Debtors' estates
realized by having a fully negotiated Agreement, an Agreement which will enable
the Debtors to preserve the value of their business, ample support exists for
the approval of the Expense Reimbursement and Break-Up Fee as contemplated in
the Agreement.

                  J.       The entry of this Order is in the best interests of
the Debtors, their estates, their creditors and other parties-in-interest; and
it is therefore

                  ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED THAT:

                  1.       The relief requested in the Motion is granted.

                  2.       All objections to the entry of this Order that have
not been withdrawn, waived, resolved or settled, and all reservations of rights
included therein, are hereby denied and overruled on the merits with prejudice.

<PAGE>

                  3.       The Sale Procedures attached hereto as Exhibit A are
hereby approved and shall apply with respect to the Asset Sale.

                  4.       The Expense Reimbursement and Break-Up Fee are each
hereby approved.

                  5.       Subject to the conditions and limitations set forth
in the Agreement, in the event that the Agreement is terminated, the Debtors
shall pay the Expense Reimbursement and Break-Up Fee to the Purchaser pursuant
to the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement.

                  6.       The Debtors' obligation to pay the Expense
Reimbursement and Break-Up Fee shall constitute an administrative expense claim
in these cases under sections 503(b) and 507(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, and
shall be payable in accordance with the terms of the Agreement without further
order of this Court.

                  7.       The Debtors may sell the Assets by conducting an
Auction in accordance with the Sale Procedures.

                  8.       The Auction shall take place at __:__ a.m./p.m.
(prevailing Eastern Time) on August __, 2003 or such later time as the Debtors
shall notify the Purchaser and all Qualified Bidders who have submitted a

due deliberation thereon; and good cause appearing therefore, it is hereby

                  FOUND AND DETERMINED THAT:(3)

                  A.       The findings and conclusions set forth herein
constitute the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Fed.
R. Bankr. P. 7052, made applicable to this proceeding pursuant to Fed. R. Bankr.
P. 9014.

                  B.       The Court has jurisdiction over this Motion and the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sections 157
and 1334, and this matter is a core proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section
157(b)(2)(A) and (N). Venue of these cases and the Motion in this district is

                  C.       The statutory predicates for the relief sought in the
Motion are sections 105, 363 and 365 and 1146(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, and
Fed. R. Bankr. P. 2002, 6004, 6006 and 9014.

------------------------
(3) Findings of fact shall be construed as conclusions of law and conclusions of
law shall be construed as findings of fact when appropriate. See Fed. R. Bankr.
P. 7052.

<PAGE>

                  D.       As evidenced by the affidavits of service and
publication previously filed with the Court, and based on the representations of
counsel at the Sale Hearing, (i) due, proper, timely, adequate and sufficient
notice of the Motion, the Sale Hearing, the Auction, the Sale, and the
assumption and assignment of the Assumed Contracts has been provided in
accordance with sections 102(1), 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code and Fed. R.
Bankr. P. 2002, 6004 and 9014 and in compliance with the Procedures Order to
each party entitled thereto, (ii) such notice was good and sufficient, and
appropriate under the particular circumstances, and (iii) no other or further
notice of the Motion, the Sale Hearing, the Auction, or the assumption and
assignment of the Assumed Contracts is or shall be required.

                  E.       As demonstrated by (i) the testimony and other
evidence proffered or adduced at the Sale Hearing and (ii) the representations
of counsel made on the record at the Sale Hearing, the Debtors have marketed the
Assets and conducted the sale process in compliance with the Procedures Order
and the Auction was duly noticed.

                  F.       The Debtors (i) have full corporate power and
authority to execute the Agreement and all other documents contemplated thereby,
and the sale of the Assets by the Debtors has been duly and validly authorized
by all necessary corporate action, (ii) have all of the corporate power and
authority necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by the
Agreement, (iii) have taken all corporate action necessary to authorize and
approve the Agreement and the consummation by the Debtors of the transactions
contemplated thereby, and (iv) no consents or approvals, other than those
expressly provided for in the Agreement, are required for the Debtors to
consummate such transactions.

                  G.       Approval of the Agreement and consummation of the
Sale at this time are in the best interests of the Debtors, their creditors,
their estates, and other parties in interest.

<PAGE>

                  H.       The Debtors have demonstrated both (i) good,
sufficient, and sound business purposes and justifications and (ii) compelling
circumstances for the Sale pursuant to section 363(b) of the Bankruptcy Code
prior to, and outside of, a plan of reorganization in that, among other things,
absent the Sale the value of the Assets will be harmed.

                  I.       A reasonable opportunity to object or be heard with
respect to the Motion and the relief requested therein has been afforded to all
interested persons and entities, including: (i) the Office of the United States
Trustee; (ii) counsel for the Purchaser; (iii) counsel any statutory committee
appointed in these cases; (iv) all entities known to have expressed a bona fide
interest in acquiring the Assets; (v) all entities (or counsel therefor) known
to have asserted any lien, claim, encumbrance, right of refusal or other
interest in or upon the Assets; (vi) all federal, state, and local regulatory or
taxing authorities or recording offices which have a reasonably known interest
in the relief requested by the Motion; (vii) all non-debtor parties to the
Assumed Contracts; (viii) the United States Attorney's office; (ix) the
Securities and Exchange Commission; (x) the Internal Revenue Service; (xi) the
Environmental Protection Agency; (xii) all state and local environmental
agencies in any jurisdiction where the Seller owns or has owned or used real
property; and (xiii) all entities who have filed a request for service of papers
in these cases.

                  J.       The Agreement was negotiated, proposed and entered
into by the Debtors and the Purchaser without collusion, in good faith, and from
arm's-length bargaining positions. Neither Top-Flite, Lisco nor the Purchaser
have engaged in any conduct that would cause or permit the Agreement to be
avoided under section 363(n) of the Bankruptcy Code.

                  K.       The Purchaser is a good faith purchaser under section
363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code and, as such, is entitled to all of the
protections afforded thereby.

<PAGE>

                  L.       The Purchaser is not an "insider" of any of the
Debtors, as that term is defined in section 101 of the Bankruptcy Code.

                  M.       The consideration provided by the Purchaser for the
Assets pursuant to the Agreement (i) is fair and reasonable, (ii) is the highest
or otherwise best offer for the Assets, (iii) will provide a greater recovery
for the Debtors' creditors than would be provided by any other practical
available alternative, and (iv) constitutes reasonably equivalent value and fair
consideration under the Bankruptcy Code and under the laws of the United States,
any state, territory, possession, and the District of Columbia.

                  N.       The Sale must be approved and consummated promptly in
order to preserve the value of the Assets.

                  O.       As of the Closing and pursuant to the terms of the
Agreement, the transfer of the Assets to the Purchaser will be a legal, valid,
enforceable, and effective transfer of the Assets, and will vest the Purchaser
with all right, title, and interest of Top-Flite and Lisco in the Assets free
and clear of all liens, claims, encumbrances and interests, including, but not
limited to: (i) those that purport to give to any party a right or option to
effect any forfeiture, modification, right of first refusal, or termination of
the Debtors' or the Purchaser's interest in the Assets, or any similar rights;
(ii) those relating to taxes arising under or out of, in connection with, or in
any way relating to the operation of the Assets prior to the Closing, (iii) all
mortgages, deeds of trust, security interests, conditional sale or other title
retention agreements, pledges, liens, judgments, demands, encumbrances, options,
rights of first refusal or charges of any kind or nature, if any, including, but
not limited to, any restriction on the use, voting, transfer, receipt of income
or other exercise of any attributes of ownership and (iv) all debts arising in
any way in connection with any agreements, acts, or failures to act, of any of
the Debtors or any of the

<PAGE>

Debtors' predecessors or affiliates, claims (as that term is defined in the
Bankruptcy Code), obligations, liabilities, demands, guaranties, options,
rights, contractual or other commitments, restrictions, interests and matters of
any kind and nature, whether known or unknown, contingent or otherwise, whether
arising prior to or subsequent to the commencement of these bankruptcy cases,
and whether imposed by agreement, understanding, law, equity or otherwise,
including but not limited to claims otherwise arising under doctrines of
successor liability (collectively, "Interests").

                  P.       The Purchaser would not have entered into the
Agreement and would not consummate the transactions contemplated thereby, thus
adversely affecting the Debtors, their estates, and their creditors, if the sale
of the Assets to the Purchaser and the assignment of the Assumed Contracts and
Assumed Liabilities to the Purchaser was not free and clear of all Interests of
any kind or nature whatsoever, or if the Purchaser would, or in the future
could, be liable for any of the Interests, including, without limitation, the
Excluded Liabilities.

                  Q.       The Debtors may sell the Assets free and clear of all
Interests of any kind or nature whatsoever because, in each case, one or more of
the standards set forth in section 363(f)(l)-(5) of the Bankruptcy Code has been
satisfied. Those (i) holders of Interests and (ii) non-debtor parties to Assumed
Contracts who did not object, or who withdrew their objections, to the Sale or
the Motion are deemed to have consented pursuant to section 363(f)(2) of the
Bankruptcy Code. Those (i) holders of Interests and (ii) non-debtor parties to
Assumed Contracts who did object fall within one or more of the other
subsections of section 363(f) of the Bankruptcy Code and are adequately
protected by having their Interests, if any, attach to the cash proceeds of the
Sale ultimately attributable to the property against or in which they claim an
Interest.

<PAGE>

                  R.       The Purchaser is not a successor to the Debtors or
their bankruptcy estates by reason of any theory of law or equity, and the
Purchasers shall not assume or in any way be responsible for any liability or
obligation of any of the Debtors and/or their bankruptcy estates, except as
otherwise expressly provided in the Agreement.

                  S.       The sale of the Assets to the Purchaser is a
prerequisite to the Debtors' ability to confirm and consummate chapter 11 plans.

                  T.       The Debtors have demonstrated that it is an exercise
of their sound business judgment to assume and assign the Assumed Contracts to
the Purchaser in connection with the consummation of the Sale, and the
assumption and assignment of the Assumed Contracts is in the best interests of
the Debtors, their estates, and their creditors. The Assumed Contracts being
assigned to the Purchaser, and the Assumed Liabilities are an integral part of
the Agreement and the Acquired Business and, accordingly, such assumption and
assignment of Assumed Contracts and the Assumed Liabilities are reasonable and
enhance the value of the Debtors' estates.

                  U.       The Debtors have (i) cured, or provided adequate
assurance of cure, of any default existing prior to the date hereof under any of
the Assumed Contracts, within the meaning of section 365(b)(l)(A) of the
Bankruptcy Code and (ii) provided compensation or adequate assurance of
compensation to any party for any actual pecuniary loss to such party resulting
from a default prior to the date hereof under any of the Assumed Contracts,
within the meaning of section 365(b)(1)(B) of the Bankruptcy Code, and the
Purchaser has provided adequate assurance of their future performance of and
under the Assumed Contracts, within the meaning of sections 365(b)(1) and
365(f)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code.

<PAGE>

                  V.       Approval of the Agreement and assumption and
assignment of the Assumed Contracts and consummation of the Sale of the Assets
at this time are in the best interests of the Debtors, their creditors, their
estates and other parties in interest.

                  NOW THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED
THAT:

                  1.       The Motion is granted, as further described herein.

                  2.       All objections to the Motion or the relief requested
therein that have not been withdrawn, waived, or settled, and all reservations
of rights included therein, hereby are overruled on the merits.

                            APPROVAL OF THE AGREEMENT

                  3.       The Agreement, and all of the terms and conditions
thereof, is hereby approved.

                  4.       Pursuant to sections 363(b) of the Bankruptcy Code,
the Debtors are authorized to perform their obligations under and comply with
the terms of the Agreement, and consummate the Sale, pursuant to and in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Agreement.

                  5.       The Debtors are authorized and directed to execute
and deliver, and empowered to perform under, consummate and implement, the
Agreement, together with all additional instruments, documents, and agreements
that may be reasonably necessary or desirable to implement the Agreement, and to
take all further actions as may be requested by the Purchaser for the purpose of
assigning, transferring, granting, conveying and conferring to the Purchaser or
reducing to possession, the Assets, or as may be necessary or appropriate to the
performance of the obligations as contemplated by the Agreement.

<PAGE>

                  6.       This Order and the Agreement shall be binding in all
respects upon all creditors (whether known or unknown) of any Debtor, all
non-debtor parties to the Assumed Contracts, all successors and assigns of the
Purchaser, the Debtors and their affiliates and subsidiaries, and any subsequent
trustees appointed in the Debtors' chapter 11 cases or upon a conversion to
chapter 7 under the Bankruptcy Code, and shall not be subject to rejection.
Nothing contained in any chapter 11 plan confirmed in these bankruptcy cases or
the confirmation order confirming any such chapter 11 plan shall conflict with
or derogate from the provisions of the Agreement or this Order.

                  7.       The Agreement and any related agreements, documents,
or other instruments may be modified, amended or supplemented by the parties
thereto in a writing signed by both parties, and in accordance with the terms
thereof, without further order of the Court, provided that any such
modification, amendment, or supplement does not have a material adverse effect
on the Debtors' estates.

                               TRANSFER OF ASSETS

                  8.       Except as expressly permitted or otherwise
specifically provided for in the Agreement or this Order, pursuant to sections
105(a) and 363(f) of the Bankruptcy Code, the Assets shall be transferred to the
Purchaser, and upon consummation of the Agreement (the "Closing"), shall be free
and clear of all Interests of any kind or nature whatsoever with all such
Interests of any kind or nature whatsoever to attach to the net proceeds of the
Sale in the order of their priority, with the same validity, force and effect
which they now have as against the Assets, subject to any claims and defenses
the Debtors may possess with respect thereto.

                  9.       Except as expressly permitted or otherwise
specifically provided by the Agreement or this Order, all persons and entities,
including, but not limited to, all debt security

<PAGE>

holders, equity security holders, governmental, tax, and regulatory authorities,
parties to executory contracts, customers, lenders, trade and other creditors,
holding Interests of any kind or nature whatsoever against or in the Debtors or
the Assets (whether legal or equitable, secured or unsecured, matured or
unmatured, contingent or non-contingent, senior or subordinated), arising under
or out of, in connection with, or in any way relating to, the Debtors, the
Assets, the operation of the Debtors' business prior to the Closing, or the
transfer of the Assets to the Purchaser, hereby are forever barred, estopped,
and permanently enjoined from asserting against the Purchaser, its successors or
assigns, its property, or the Assets, such persons' or entities' Interests.

                  10.      The transfer of the Assets to the Purchaser pursuant
to the Agreement shall constitute a legal, valid, and effective transfer of the
Assets, and shall vest the Purchaser with all right, title, and interest of the
Debtors in and to the Assets free and clear of all Interests of any kind or
nature whatsoever.

                  11.      If any person or entity that has filed financing
statements, mortgages, mechanic's liens, lis pendens, or other documents or
agreements evidencing Interests in the Debtors or the Assets shall not have
delivered to the Debtors prior to the Closing, in proper form for filing and
executed by the appropriate parties, termination statements, instruments of
satisfaction, releases of all Interests which the person or entity has with
respect to the Debtors or the Assets or otherwise, then (a) the Debtors are
hereby authorized and directed to execute and file such statements, instruments,
releases and other documents on behalf of the person or entity with respect to
the Assets and (b) the Purchaser is hereby authorized to file, register, or
otherwise record a certified copy of this Order, which, once filed, registered
or otherwise recorded, shall

<PAGE>

constitute conclusive evidence of the release of all Interests in the Assets of
any kind or nature whatsoever.

                            ASSUMPTION AND ASSIGNMENT
                        TO PURCHASER OF ASSUMED CONTRACTS

                  12.      Pursuant to sections 105(a) and 365 of the Bankruptcy
Code, and subject to and conditioned upon the Closing, the Debtors' assumption
and assignment to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser's assumption on the terms set
forth in the Agreement, of the Assumed Contracts is hereby approved, and the
requirements of section 365(b)(l) of the Bankruptcy Code with respect thereto
are hereby deemed satisfied.

                  13.      The Debtors are hereby authorized and directed in
accordance with sections 105(a) and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code to (a) assume and
assign to the Purchaser, effective upon the Closing, the Assumed Contracts free
and clear of all Interests of any kind or nature whatsoever and (b) execute and
deliver to the Purchaser such documents or other instruments as may be necessary
to assign and transfer the Assumed Contracts and Assumed Liabilities to the
Purchaser.

                  14.      With respect to the Assumed Contracts: (a) the
Assumed Contracts shall be transferred and assigned to, and following the
Closing of the Sale remain in full force and effect for the benefit of, the
Purchaser in accordance with their respective terms, notwithstanding any
provision in any such Assumed Contract (including those of the type described in
sections 365(b)(2) and (f) of the Bankruptcy Code) that prohibits, restricts, or
conditions such assignment or transfer and, pursuant to section 365(k) of the
Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors shall be relieved from any further liability with
respect to the Assumed Contracts after such transfer and assignment to the
Purchaser; (b) which are executory contracts of the Debtors under Section 365 of
the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors may assume such Assumed Contracts in accordance
with

<PAGE>

section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code; (c) the Debtors may assign each Assumed
Contract in accordance with sections 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, and any
provisions in any Assumed Contract that prohibit or condition the assignment of
such Assumed Contract or allow the non-debtor party to such Assumed Contract to
terminate, recapture, impose any penalty, condition renewal or extension, or
modify any term or condition upon the assignment of such Assumed Contract, shall
constitute unenforceable anti-assignment provisions which are void and of no
force and effect; (d) all other requirements and conditions under sections 363
and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code for the assumption and assignment by the Debtors
to the Purchaser of each Assumed Contract have been satisfied; and (e) upon
Closing, in accordance with sections 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, the
Purchaser shall be fully and irrevocably vested in all right, title and interest
of each Assumed Contract. Any portion of any Assumed Contract which purports to
permit the landlord to cancel the remaining term of such Assumed Contract if the
Debtors discontinue their use or operation of the leased premises are void and
of no force and effect, and shall not be enforceable against Purchaser, its
assignees and sublessees; and the landlords under any such Assumed Contract
shall not have the right to cancel or otherwise modify the Assumed Contract or
increase the rent, assert any claim or impose any penalty by reason of such
discontinuation, the Debtors' cessation of operations, the assignment of such
Assumed Contract to Purchaser, or the interruption of business activities at any
of the leased premises.

                  15.      All defaults or other obligations of the Debtors
under the Assumed Contracts arising or accruing prior to the Closing under the
Agreement (without giving effect to any acceleration clauses or any default
provisions of the kind specified in section 365(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code)
shall be cured by the Debtors at the Closing of the Sale or as soon

<PAGE>

thereafter as practicable, and the Purchaser shall have no liability or
obligation arising or accruing prior to the date of the Closing, except as
otherwise expressly provided in the Agreement.

                  16.      The Debtors are hereby authorized and directed to pay
all Cure Costs under the Assumed Contracts out of the proceeds of the Sale.

                  17.      Each non-debtor party to an Assumed Contract hereby
is forever barred, estopped, and permanently enjoined from asserting against the
Purchaser, or its property, any default existing as of the Closing. The Debtors
shall be exclusively responsible for payment of all cure costs with respect to
the Assumed Contracts pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code.

                  18.      Except as provided in the Agreement or this Order,
after the Closing, the Debtors and their estates shall have no further
liabilities or obligations with respect to any Assumed Liabilities and all
holders of such claims are forever barred and estopped from asserting such
claims against the Debtors, their successors or assigns, their property or their
assets or estates.

                              ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS

                  19.      The consideration provided by the Purchaser for the
Assets under the Agreement shall be deemed to constitute reasonably equivalent
value and fair consideration under the Bankruptcy Code and under the laws of the
United States, any state, territory, possession, and the District of Columbia.

                  20.      The consideration provided by the Purchaser for the
Assets under the Agreement is fair and reasonable and may not be avoided under
section 363(n) of the Bankruptcy Code.

<PAGE>

                  21.      On the Closing, each of the Debtors' creditors is
authorized and directed to execute such documents and take all other actions as
may be necessary to release its Interests in the Assets, if any, as such
Interests may have been recorded or may otherwise exist.

                  22.      This Order (a) shall be effective as a determination
that, on the Closing, all Interests of any kind or nature whatsoever existing as
to the Debtors or the Assets prior to the Closing have been unconditionally
released, discharged and terminated (other than the Assumed Liabilities), and
that the conveyances described herein have been effected and (b) shall be
binding upon and shall govern the acts of all entities including without
limitation, all filing agents, filing officers, title agents, title companies,
recorders of mortgages, recorders of deeds, registrars of deeds, administrative
agencies, governmental departments, secretaries of state, federal, state, and
local officials, and all other persons and entities who may be required by
operation of law, the duties of their office, or contract, to accept, file,
register or otherwise record or release any documents or instruments, or who may
be required to report or insure any title or state of title in or to any of the
Assets.

                  23.      Except as otherwise expressly provided in the
Agreement, Purchaser shall have no obligation to pay wages, bonuses, severance
pay, benefits (including, without limitation, contributions or payments on
account of any under-funding with respect to any and all pension plans) or any
other payment to employees of the Debtors. Purchaser shall have no liability
with respect to any collective bargaining agreement, employee pension plan,
employee welfare or retention, benefit and/or incentive plan to which any
Debtors are a party (including, without limitation, arising from or related to
the rejection or other termination of any such agreement), and Purchaser shall
in no way be deemed a party to or assignee of any such agreement, and no
employee of Purchaser shall be deemed in any way covered by or a party to any
such agreement,

<PAGE>

and all parties to any such agreement are hereby enjoined from asserting against
Purchaser any and all claims arising from or relating to such agreement. Any and
all notices required to be given to the Debtors' employees pursuant to The
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (the "WARN Act"), or any
similar federal or state law, shall be the sole responsibility and obligation of
the Debtors and Purchaser shall have no responsibility or liability therefor.

                  24.      Any amounts that become payable by the Debtors to
Purchaser pursuant to the Agreement (and related agreements executed in
connection therewith) (a) shall constitute administrative expenses of the
Debtors' estates under Section 503(b) and 507(a)(l) of the Bankruptcy Code and
(b) shall be paid by the Debtors in the time and manner provided for in the
Agreement (and such related agreements) without further Court order.

                  25.      All entities who are presently, or on the Closing may
be, in possession of some or all of the Assets are hereby directed to surrender
possession of the Assets to the Purchaser on the Closing.

                  26.      Except for the Assumed Liabilities or as expressly
permitted or otherwise specifically provided for in the Agreement or this Order,
the Purchaser shall have no liability or responsibility for any liability or
other obligation of the Debtors arising under or related to the Assets. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and except as otherwise specifically
provided herein and in the Agreement, to the extent allowed by law, the
Purchaser shall not be liable for any claims against the Debtors or any of their
predecessors or affiliates, and the Purchaser shall have no successor or
vicarious liabilities of any kind or character including but not limited to any
theory of antitrust, environmental, successor or transferee liability, labor
law, de facto merger, or substantial continuity, whether known or unknown as of
the Closing, now existing or hereafter arising, whether fixed or contingent,
with respect to the Debtors or any

<PAGE>

obligations of the Debtors arising prior to the Closing, including, but not
limited to, liabilities on account of any taxes arising, accruing, or payable
under, out of, in connection with, or in any way relating to the operation of
the Debtors' business prior to the Closing.

                  27.      Following the Closing, no holder of an Interest in
the Debtors or the Assets shall interfere with the Purchaser's title to or use
and enjoyment of the Assets based on or related to such Interest, or any actions
that the Debtors may take in their chapter 11 cases.

                  28.      This Court retains jurisdiction to enforce and
implement the terms and provisions of the Agreement, all amendments thereto, any
waivers and consents thereunder, and of each of the agreements executed in
connection therewith in all respects, including, but not limited to, retaining
jurisdiction to (a) compel delivery of the Assets to the Purchaser, (b) compel
delivery of the purchase price or performance of other obligations owed to the
Debtors, (c) resolve any disputes arising under or related to the Agreement,
except as otherwise provided therein, (d) interpret, implement, and enforce the
provisions of this Order, and (e) protect the Purchaser against (i) any of the
Excluded Liabilities or (ii) any Interests in the Debtors or the Assets, of any
kind or nature whatsoever.

                  29.      Notwithstanding Fed. R. Bankr. P. 6004(g) and
6006(d), this Order shall be effective and enforceable immediately upon entry
and its provisions shall be self-executing. In the absence of any entity
obtaining a stay pending appeal, the Debtors and the Purchaser are free to close
under the Agreement at any time. The transactions contemplated by the Agreement
are undertaken by the Purchaser in good faith, as that term is used in section
363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code, and accordingly, the reversal or modification on
appeal of the authorization provided herein to consummate the Sale shall not
affect the validity of the Sale to the Purchaser (including the assumption and
assignment of any of the Assumed Contracts), unless such

<PAGE>

authorization is duly stayed pending such appeal. The Purchaser is a purchaser
in good faith of the Assets, and is entitled to all of the protections afforded
by section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code.

                  30.      The terms and provisions of the Agreement and this
Order shall be binding in all respects upon, and shall inure to the benefit of,
the Debtors, their estates, and their creditors, the Purchaser, and its
respective affiliates, successors and assigns, and any affected third parties
including, but not limited to, all persons asserting Interests in the Assets to
be sold to the Purchaser pursuant to the Agreement, notwithstanding any
subsequent appointment of any trustee(s) under any chapter of the Bankruptcy
Code, as to which trustee(s) such terms and provisions likewise shall be
binding.

                  31.      The failure specifically to include any particular
provisions of the Agreement in this Order shall not diminish or impair the
effectiveness of such provision, it being the intent of the Court that the
Agreement be authorized and approved in its entirety.

                  32.      Each and every federal, state and local government
agency or department is hereby authorized to accept any and all documents and
instruments necessary and appropriate to consummate the transfer of any of the
Assets, all without imposition or payment of any stamp tax, transfer tax, or
similar tax, pursuant to section 1146(c) of the Bankruptcy Code.

                                    [FORM OF]

                           INDEMNITY ESCROW AGREEMENT

                  THIS INDEMNITY ESCROW AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), is made as
of [______], 2003, by and among [U.S. Bank National Association] having an
office at [______], (the "Escrow Agent"), The Top-Flite Golf Company, a Delaware
corporation (the "Seller"), and Callaway Golf Company, a Delaware corporation
(the "Purchaser").

                  WHEREAS, the Purchaser and the Seller are parties to that
certain Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of June 30, 2003 (as the same may be
amended from time to time, the "Purchase Agreement"), pursuant to which the
Purchaser is acquiring the Assets of the Business; and

                  WHEREAS, pursuant to Article VIII of the Purchase Agreement,
the Seller has agreed to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Purchaser's
Indemnified Persons from and against Losses; and

                  WHEREAS, at the Closing the Purchaser shall have delivered to
the Escrow Agent the Indemnity Deposit. Such Indemnity Deposit is to be used as
security for Losses incurred by the Purchaser's Indemnified Persons in a manner
set forth herein.

                  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the
mutual promises and covenants contained herein, the parties hereby agree as
follows:

                  1.       Definitions. Capitalized terms used and not defined
herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Purchase
Agreement.

                  2.       Escrow Agent and Escrow Account.

                           2.1      Escrow Agent. The Purchaser and the Seller
hereby appoint the Escrow Agent as the escrow agent to hold the Indemnity
Deposit in accordance with the terms, conditions and provisions of this
Agreement, and the Escrow Agent hereby accepts such appointment subject to the
terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement.

                           2.2      Escrow Account. On the Closing Date, the
Purchaser shall deposit with the Escrow Agent, by wire transfer of the Indemnity
Deposit in immediately available funds to the escrow account set forth on
Schedule A attached hereto (the "Escrow Account"). The Escrow Agent hereby
acknowledges receipt of such sum.

                  3.       Investment of the Indemnity Deposit.

                           3.1      Investment. The Escrow Agent, as directed in
writing by the Seller, shall invest any or all of the Indemnity Deposit, and any
undistributed income or interest earned or accrued with respect thereto, in any
of the following: (i) obligations issued or guaranteed by the United States of
America or any agency or instrumentality thereof with a maturity of not more

<PAGE>

                                                                               2

than 30 days; (ii) certificates of deposit (including money market certificates
and similar instruments) of or accounts with national banks, holding companies
of national banks or corporations endowed with trust powers having, in any case,
capital and surplus in excess of $250,000,000 at the time of investment, with a
maturity in each case not to exceed 30 days; (iii) commercial paper at the time
of investment and any renewal rated A-1 by Standard & Poor's Corporation or
Prime-1 by Moody's Investor's Service, Inc.; and (iv) money market funds
substantially all of whose funds are invested in any of the foregoing.

                           3.2      Quarterly Statements. As soon as practicable
following each September 30th, December 31st, March 31st and June 30th
commencing after the Closing Date during the term of this Agreement, the Escrow
Agent shall deliver to the Purchaser and the Seller a statement (a "Quarterly
Statement") setting forth: (a) the value of the Escrow Account at such date; (b)
the amount of income or interest earned or accrued with respect thereto during
the period covered by such Quarterly Statement; and (c) the amounts owed or paid
to the Purchaser from the Escrow Account pursuant to Sections 8.1 and 8.2 of the
Purchase Agreement with respect to the period covered by such Quarterly
Statement.

                           3.3      Distribution of Income. Any income or
interest earned in respect of the Indemnity Deposit, if any, shall be
distributed to the Seller on a monthly basis.

                           3.4      Certificate of Incumbency. The Purchaser and
the Seller shall each execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a certificate of
incumbency substantially in the form of Schedule C hereto for the purpose of
establishing the identity of the Representatives of the Purchaser and the Seller
entitled to issue instructions or directions to the Escrow Agent on behalf of
each such party. In the event of any change in the identity of such
Representatives, a new certificate of incumbency shall be executed and delivered
to the Escrow Agent by the appropriate party. Until such time as the Escrow
Agent shall receive a new incumbency certificate, the Escrow Agent shall be
fully protected in relying without inquiry on any then current incumbency
certificate on file with the Escrow Agent.

                  4.       Assigned Inventory Adjustment. The Escrow Account
shall be used to pay all amounts due and owing to the Purchaser, if any,
pursuant to the terms and conditions of Section 1.6 of the Purchase Agreement.
Upon determination of the Final Closing Date Statement, the Seller and the
Purchaser shall deliver a notice, signed by both the Seller and the Purchaser,
to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to pay to the Purchaser the
appropriate amount, if any, from the Escrow Account.

                  5.       Procedures with Respect to Indemnity Claims.

                           5.1      Claims by Purchaser. If, at any time and
from time to time on or prior to the one year anniversary of the date hereof,
the Purchaser incurs any Losses for which it is entitled to be indemnified in
accordance with Sections 8.1 and 8.2 of the Purchase Agreement, the Purchaser
shall deliver to the Seller and the Escrow Agent written notice (a "Loss
Notice") specifying the amount of any such Losses for which the Purchaser
believes in good faith it is entitled to indemnification (the "Claimed Amount").
Such Loss Notice shall be accompanied by a reasonably full description of the
basis for such claim and shall reference the provisions of the Purchase
Agreement pursuant to which liability is asserted.

<PAGE>

                                                                               3

                           5.2      Response by Seller. Within 30 days after
receipt by the Seller of any Loss Notice, the Seller shall, with respect to such
Loss Notice, by notice to the Purchaser and the Escrow Agent (a "Response
Notice"), either (a) concede liability for the Claimed Amount in whole or (b)
deny liability for the Claimed Amount in whole or in part (it being understood
that any portion of the Claimed Amount for which the Seller has not denied
liability shall be deemed to have been conceded). If the Seller shall deny
liability in whole or in part, such Response Notice shall be accompanied by a
reasonably full description of the basis for such denial. The portion of the
Claimed Amount for which the Seller has conceded liability is referred to herein
as the "Conceded Amount." If the Seller shall fail to deliver the Response
Notice within the aforesaid 30-day period, the Seller shall be deemed to have
conceded the entire Claimed Amount.

                           5.3      Resolutions of Disputes. If the Seller has
denied liability for the Claimed Amount, in whole or in part, the parties shall
attempt to resolve such dispute as promptly as possible. If the Purchaser and
the Seller resolve such dispute, they shall deliver a notice to that effect to
the Escrow Agent (a "Settlement Notice") signed by each of them. Such Settlement
Notice shall permit the Escrow Agent to pay to the Purchaser the amount, if any,
agreed to by both the Purchaser and the Seller in settlement of such dispute
(the "Agreed Settlement Amount"). If the Purchaser and the Seller fail to
resolve such dispute within 60 days after receipt by the Purchaser of the
Response Notice corresponding to such dispute, the Purchaser may (i) commence
appropriate legal proceedings in order to obtain a final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction that is not subject to further appeal (a "Final Order").
In the event that the Final Order contains a finding of liability against the
Seller in a specified amount (the "Judgment Amount"), the Purchaser shall
promptly deliver written notice to the Escrow Agent and the Seller (which notice
shall be accompanied by such Final Order), advising the Escrow Agent and the
Seller to pay to the Purchaser such Judgment Amount to the extent available from
the Escrow Account. In the event that (a) the Purchaser shall fail to commence
such proceedings within 90 days after receipt by the Purchaser of the Response
Notice or (b) the Seller shall have obtained a Final Order dismissing such
proceeding or finding no liability on the part of Seller, the relevant Loss
Notice shall be deemed to have expired and the Purchaser shall have no recourse
against the Escrow Account with respect to such Loss; provided, however, that
clause (a) above shall not preclude the Purchaser from claiming the amount equal
to such Claimed Amount with respect to a completely distinct, other Loss.

                           5.4      Payment of Claims. As promptly as
practicable (and in any event no more than fifteen (15) days following the
resolution or settlement of a dispute pursuant to Section 5.2 and 5.3 hereof),
the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Purchaser from the Escrow Account by wire
transfer of immediately available funds the following amounts, as applicable:
(a) following any concession of liability by the Seller, in whole or in part,
the Conceded Amount; (b) following the receipt by the Escrow Agent of any
Settlement Notice, the Agreed Settlement Amount; or (c) following receipt by the
Seller of any Final Order, the Judgment Amount; provided, however, that the
payments made to the Purchaser's Indemnified Parties out of the Escrow Account
shall not exceed the Indemnity Deposit subject to Section 6.1 below in the
aggregate.

                           5.5      Outstanding Claims. Any Loss Notice that is
not resolved or disposed of pursuant to Section 5.2, 5.3 or 5.4 shall constitute
an "Outstanding Claim." Following the one year anniversary of the date hereof,
the Purchaser may not amend or otherwise modify any

Outstanding Claim or deliver a new Loss Notice. For the avoidance of doubt, any
claim of the Purchaser's Indemnified Persons pursuant to the Purchase Agreement
made after the expiration of the one year anniversary of the dated hereof shall
not be secured and may not be satisfied by the Escrow Account.

                  6.       Distributions to the Seller from the Escrow Account.

                           6.1      On the six month anniversary of the Closing
Date, the Escrow Agent shall distribute to the Seller, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds as directed by the Seller from time to time, the
Released Amount, if any. The "Released Amount" shall be (i) the remaining
Indemnity Deposit on the six month anniversary of the Closing Date minus (ii)
the sum of (A) $6,250,000, plus (B) any amount then payable to the Purchaser's
Indemnified Persons, plus (C) any additional Third Party Claims or Indemnity
Claims claimed in good faith by the Purchaser's Indemnified Persons and disputed
in good faith by the Seller as the Indemnifying Party. If the result of the
foregoing calculation results in the Released Amount being zero or a negative
number, then no amount shall be released from the Indemnity Deposit on the six
month anniversary of the Closing Date.

                           6.2      On the one year anniversary of the date
hereof, the Escrow Agent shall distribute to the Seller, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds as directed by the Seller from time to time, the
entire Escrow Account less the aggregate amount of all Outstanding Claims and
(ii) any amount then payable to the Purchaser's Indemnified Persons.

                  7.       Termination of this Escrow Agreement. This Agreement
shall terminate as to the Escrow Account, upon the full distribution of the
Escrow Account pursuant to Sections 4, 5 and 6.

                  8.       Disputes. In the event of any dispute as to the
disposition of the Escrow Account, as the case may be or as to any other matters
under this Agreement, the Escrow Agent is hereby authorized to deposit, upon
five (5) Business Days' notice to the parties, the funds constituting the Escrow
Account, with a court of competent jurisdiction. In connection with any such
dispute, the Escrow Agent may elect, in its commercially reasonable discretion,
to commence an interpleader action relating thereto.

                  9.       Sole Duties. The Escrow Agent's sole duties hereunder
are as indicated herein, and upon the disposition of the Escrow Account, as
herein provided, the Escrow Agent shall be deemed to have performed its duties
and shall be automatically discharged from any further obligation in connection
therewith.

                  10.      Escrow Agent Not Liable. The Escrow Agent, in the
performance of its duties hereunder, shall not be liable or responsible for any
authorization or omitted to be taken hereunder in good faith as herein provided,
except for its own willful misconduct, recklessness, or gross negligence and
except as provided in Section 14.6 of this Agreement.

                  11.      Resignation; Successor Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent
or any successor escrow agent, as the case may be, may resign its duties and be
discharged from all further duties or obligations hereunder at any time upon
giving ten (10) Business Days' prior written notice to the parties hereto. The
Seller and the Purchaser will thereupon jointly designate a successor escrow

agent hereunder within said ten (10) Business Day period to whom the Escrow
Account shall be delivered. In default of such joint designation of a successor
escrow agent, the Escrow Agent shall retain the Escrow Account as custodian
thereof until otherwise directed by the Seller and the Purchaser, jointly,
without further liability or responsibility.

                  12.      Notices. All notices, requests, consents and demands
to or upon the respective parties hereto shall be in writing, and, unless
otherwise expressly provided herein, shall be deemed to have been duly given or

service if sent by overnight delivery for next morning delivery, (c) in the case
of mail, three (3) Business Days after deposit in United States first class

                                    Attention: ________________

The Escrow Agent shall promptly deliver a copy of any notice received by it in
its capacity as the Escrow Agent to the Purchaser and the Seller.

                  13.      Indemnification of Escrow Agent.

                           13.1     From and at all times after the date of this
Escrow Agreement, the Seller and the Purchaser, jointly and severally, shall, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify and hold harmless the Escrow
Agent and each director, officer, employee, attorney, agent and affiliate of the
Escrow Agent (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against any and all
actions, claims, losses, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses of any kind or
nature whatsoever (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees,
costs and expenses) incurred by or asserted against any of the Indemnified
Parties from and after the date hereof as a result of or arising from any claim,
demand, suit, action or proceeding (including any inquiry or investigation) by
any person, including without limitation the Seller or the Purchaser, whether
threatened or initiated, asserting a claim for any legal or equitable remedy
against any person under any statute or regulation, including, but not limited
to, any federal or state securities laws, or under any common law or equitable
cause or otherwise, arising from or in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution, performance or failure of performance of this Agreement
or any transactions contemplated herein, whether or not any such Indemnified
Party is a party to any such action, proceeding, suit or the target of any such
inquiry or investigation; provided, however, that no Indemnified Party shall
have the right to be indemnified hereunder for any liability finally determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction, subject to no further appeal, to have
resulted solely from the gross negligence, recklessness, or willful misconduct
of such Indemnified Party. The obligations of the Seller and the Purchaser under
this Section 13 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

                           13.2     The parties agree that neither the payment
by the Seller or the Purchaser of any claim by the Escrow Agent for
indemnification hereunder nor the disbursement of any amounts to the Escrow
Agent from the Escrow Account in respect of a claim by Escrow Agent for
indemnification shall impair, limit, modify, or affect, as between the Seller
and the

<PAGE>

                                                                               7

Purchaser, the respective rights and obligations of the Seller, on the one hand,
and the Purchaser, on the other hand, under the Purchase Agreement.

                  14.      Miscellaneous Matters Concerning Escrow Agent.

                           14.1     The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
refrain from taking any action contemplated by this Agreement in the event that
it becomes aware of any disagreement between the parties hereto as to any facts
or as to the happening of any contemplated event precedent to such action.

                           14.2     The Escrow Agent shall have no
responsibility or liability for any diminution in value of any assets held
hereunder which may result from any investments or reinvestment made in
accordance with any provision which may be contained herein.

                           14.3     The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
compensation for its services hereunder as per Schedule B attached hereto, which
is made a part hereof, and for reimbursement of its reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket expenses including, but not by way of limitation, the fees and
costs of attorneys or agents which it may find necessary to engage in the
performance of its duties hereunder, all to be paid one half (1/2) by the
Purchaser and one half (1/2) by the Seller, and the Escrow Agent shall have, and
is hereby granted, a prior lien upon any property, cash, or assets of the Escrow
Account, as the case may be, with respect to its unpaid fees and nonreimbursed
expenses, superior to the interests of any other persons or entities. In the
event any such compensation, expenses, fees or costs are drawn by the Escrow
Agent from the Escrow Account, as the case may be, the Seller and the Purchaser
each agree to make appropriate payment to the other party such that each party
ultimately receives the amount of the Indemnity Deposit that it is entitled to
receive without reduction or deduction for the other party's one half (1/2)
share of such compensation, expenses, fees or costs.

                           14.4     The Escrow Agent shall be entitled and is
hereby granted the right to set off and deduct any unpaid fees and/or
nonreimbursed expenses from amounts in the Escrow Account.

                           14.5     The Escrow Agent shall be under no
obligation to invest the deposited funds or the income generated thereby until
it has received a Form W-9 or W-8, as applicable, from the Purchaser and the
Seller, regardless of whether such party is exempt from reporting or withholding
requirements under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

                           14.6     The Escrow Agent shall have only those
duties as are specifically provided herein, which shall be deemed purely
ministerial in nature, and shall under no circumstance be deemed a fiduciary for
any of the parties to this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall neither be
responsible for, nor chargeable with, knowledge of the terms and conditions of
any other agreement, instrument or document between the other parties hereto, in
connection herewith, including, without limitation, the Purchase Agreement. This
Agreement sets forth all matters pertinent to the escrow contemplated hereunder,
and no additional obligations of the Escrow Agent shall be inferred from the
terms of this Agreement or any other agreement.

                           14.7     The Escrow Agent shall have the right, but
not the obligation, to consult with counsel of choice and shall not be liable
for action taken or omitted to be taken by the

<PAGE>

                                                                               8

Escrow Agent in accordance with the advice of such counsel. If the Escrow Agent
becomes involved in litigation on account of this Agreement, it shall have the
right to retain counsel and shall have a first lien on the property deposited
hereunder for any and all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs,
attorneys' fees, charges, disbursements, and expenses in connection with such
litigation; and shall be entitled to reimburse itself therefor out of the
property deposited hereunder, and if it shall be unable to reimburse itself from
the property deposited hereunder, the Purchaser and the Seller jointly and
severally agree to pay to the Escrow Agent on demand its reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket charges, counsel and attorneys' fees, disbursements,
and expenses in connection with such litigation.

                           14.8     Any entity into which the Escrow Agent may
be merged, converted or with which the Escrow Agent may be consolidated, or any
entity resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the
Escrow Agent shall be a party, or any entity to which all or substantially all
of the business of the Escrow Agent shall be transferred, shall succeed to all
the Escrow Agent's rights, obligations and immunities hereunder without the
execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the
parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding.

                           14.9     In the event that any escrow property shall
be attached, garnished or levied upon by any court order (including, by
bankruptcy), or the delivery thereof shall be stayed or enjoined by an order of
a court, or any order, judgment or decree shall be made or entered by any court
order affecting the property deposited under this Agreement, the Escrow Agent is
hereby expressly authorized, in its sole discretion, to obey and comply with all
writs, orders or decrees so entered or issued, which it is advised by legal
counsel of its own choosing is binding upon it, whether with or without
jurisdiction, and in the event that the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any
such writ, order or decree it shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto
or to any other person, firm or entity, by reason of such compliance
notwithstanding such writ, order or decree be subsequently reversed, modified,
annulled, set aside or vacated.

                           14.10    The Escrow Agent shall report to the
Internal Revenue Service, as of each calendar year-end, all income earned from
the investment of the Escrow Account against the Purchaser or the Seller,
whether or not said income has been distributed during such year, as and to the
extent required by law. The Escrow Agent agrees, to the extent permitted by law,
to make any such report as near as possible to the filing deadline therefor in
order that it may report any income earned to the party which actually received
the same. If the filing deadline for any calendar year shall occur prior to the
distribution of such income, the Escrow Agent may report such income as earned
by the Purchaser. Any tax returns required to be prepared and filed will be
prepared and filed by the party which is reported to have received such income
with the Internal Revenue Service in all years income is earned, whether or not
income is received or distributed in any particular tax year, and Escrow Agent
shall have no responsibility for the preparation and/or filing or any tax return
with respect to any income earned by the Escrow Account. Any taxes payable on
income earned from the investment of the Escrow Account shall be paid by the
party which is reported to have received such income, whether or not the income
was distributed by the Escrow Agent during any particular year. The Escrow Agent
shall have no obligation to pay any taxes or estimated taxes. After the Escrow
Account and the income earned thereon has been distributed by the Escrow Agent,
the parties agree to cooperate and to file any amended reports

<PAGE>

                                                                               9

which may be necessary in order to correct any filings with the Internal Revenue
Service which reported income as having been earned by a party which did not
actually receive such income.

                  15.      Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Purchase
Agreement contain the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby and supersede all prior agreements, written or
oral, with respect thereto.

                  16.      Amendment; Waiver. This Agreement may not be amended
or modified except by an instrument in writing signed by the Seller, the
Purchaser and the Escrow Agent. No failure or delay by any party in exercising
any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof.

                  17.      Governing Law. This Agreement and all Claims with
respect thereto shall be governed by and construed in accordance with federal
bankruptcy law, to the extent applicable, and, where state law is implicated,
the laws of the State of New York without regard to any conflict of laws rules
thereof that might indicate the application of the laws of any other
jurisdiction.

                  18.      Consent to Jurisdiction; Service of Process.

                           18.1     Consent of Jurisdiction. The Purchaser and
the Seller irrevocably and unconditionally consent to submit to the jurisdiction
of the Bankruptcy Court for any litigation arising out of or relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (and agree not to commence
any litigation relating hereto except in the Bankruptcy Court).

                           18.2     Service of Process. Any and all service of
process and any other notice in any such Claim shall be effective against any
party if given personally or by registered or certified mail, return receipt
requested, or by any other means of mail that requires a signed receipt, postage
prepaid, mailed to such party as herein provided. Nothing herein contained shall
be deemed to affect the right of any party to serve process in any manner
permitted by law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against
any other party in any other jurisdiction.

                  19.      WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.

                           19.1     EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY
TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY.

                           19.2     EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
(i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE WAIVER IN SECTION 19.1, (ii) SUCH PARTY
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (iii) SUCH PARTY
MAKES SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (iv) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG

OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS, AGREEMENTS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN SECTION 19.1
AND THIS SECTION 19.2.

                  20.      Assignment. This Agreement shall not be assigned
without the express written consent of the Seller and the Purchaser (which
consent may be granted or withheld in the sole discretion of the Seller and the
Purchaser). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no assignment of the interest of any
of the parties hereto shall be binding upon the Escrow Agent unless and until
reasonable written evidence of such assignment shall be delivered to the Escrow
Agent.

                  21.      Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by the
parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and
delivered shall be an original, but all such counterparts shall together
constitute one and the same instrument. Each counterpart may consist of a number
of copies hereof each signed by less than all, but together signed by all of the
parties hereto.

                  22.      Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for
reference only, and shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement.

                      CURRENT RECEIVABLES ESCROW AGREEMENT

                  THIS CURRENT RECEIVABLES ESCROW AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"),
is made as of [______], 2003, by and among [U.S. Bank National Association]
having an office at [______], (the "Escrow Agent"), The Top-Flite Golf Company,
a Delaware corporation (the "Seller"), and Callaway Golf Company, a Delaware
corporation (the "Purchaser").

                  WHEREAS, the Purchaser and the Seller are parties to that
certain Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of June 30, 2003 (as the same may be
amended from time to time, the "Purchase Agreement"), pursuant to which the
Purchaser is acquiring the Assets of the Business; and

                  WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 1.7 of the Purchase Agreement,
the Seller has agreed to reimburse the Purchaser, at the Purchaser's election,
for any Assigned Current Receivable which remains uncollected on the 181st day
after the Closing Date; and

                  WHEREAS, at the Closing the Purchaser shall have delivered to
the Escrow Agent the Current Receivables Deposit. Such Current Receivables
Deposit is to be used as security for any Assigned Current Receivables which
remain uncollected on the 181st day after the Closing Date.

                  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the
mutual promises and covenants contained herein, the parties hereby agree as
follows:

                  1.       Definitions. Capitalized terms used and not defined
herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Purchase
Agreement.

                  2.       Escrow Agent and Escrow Account.

                           2.1      Escrow Agent. The Purchaser and the Seller
hereby appoint the Escrow Agent as the escrow agent to hold the Current
Receivables Deposit in accordance with the terms, conditions and provisions of
this Agreement, and the Escrow Agent hereby accepts such appointment subject to
the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement.

                           2.2      Escrow Account. On the Closing Date the
Purchaser shall deposit with the Escrow Agent, by wire transfer of the Current
Receivables Deposit in immediately available funds to the escrow account set
forth on Schedule A attached hereto (the "Escrow Account"). The Escrow Agent
hereby acknowledges receipt of such sum.

                  3.       Investment of the Current Receivables Deposit.

                           3.1      Investment. The Escrow Agent, as directed in
writing by the Seller, shall invest any or all of the Current Receivables
Deposit, and any undistributed income

<PAGE>

                                                                               2

or interest earned or accrued with respect thereto, in any of the following: (i)
obligations issued or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency
or instrumentality thereof with a maturity of not more than 30 days; (ii)
certificates of deposit (including money market certificates and similar
instruments) of or accounts with national banks, holding companies of national
banks or corporations endowed with trust powers having, in any case, capital and
surplus in excess of $250,000,000 at the time of investment, with a maturity in
each case not to exceed 30 days; (iii) commercial paper at the time of
investment and any renewal rated A-1 by Standard & Poor's Corporation or Prime-1
by Moody's Investor's Service, Inc.; and (iv) money market funds substantially
all of whose funds are invested in any of the foregoing.

                           3.2      Quarterly Statements. As soon as practicable
following each September 30th, December 31st, March 31st and June 30th
commencing after the Closing Date during the term of this Agreement, the Escrow
Agent shall deliver to the Purchaser and the Seller a statement (a "Quarterly
Statement") setting forth: (a) the value of the Escrow Account at such date and
(b) the amount of income or interest earned or accrued with respect thereto
during the period covered by such Quarterly Statement.

                           3.3      Distribution of Income. Any income or
interest earned in respect of the Current Receivables Deposit, if any, shall be
distributed to the Seller on a monthly basis.

                           3.4      Certificate of Incumbency. The Purchaser and
the Seller shall each execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a certificate of
incumbency substantially in the form of Schedule C hereto for the purpose of
establishing the identity of the Representatives of the Purchaser and the Seller
entitled to issue instructions or directions to the Escrow Agent on behalf of
each such party. In the event of any change in the identity of such
Representatives, a new certificate of incumbency shall be executed and delivered
to the Escrow Agent by the appropriate party. Until such time as the Escrow
Agent shall receive a new incumbency certificate, the Escrow Agent shall be
fully protected in relying without inquiry on any then current incumbency
certificate on file with the Escrow Agent.

                  4.       Assigned Current Receivables Deficiency.

                           4.1      If the Purchaser (i) elects, in its sole
discretion on an account-by-account basis, within (5) Business Days after the
181st day after the Closing Date to assign any uncollected Assigned Current
Receivables to the Seller and deduct an amount from the Current Receivables
Deposit equal to the Deemed Closing Date A/R Value of such uncollected Assigned
Current Receivables and/or (ii) is entitled to receive an amount calculated in
accordance with Section 1.7(d) of the Purchase Agreement on account of Returned
Goods (the sum of (i) and (ii) being referred to as the "A/R Claim Amount"), the
Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller and to the Escrow Agent (i) a notice (the
"A/R Claim Notice") setting forth the A/R Claim Amount and (ii) a certificate
signed by the chief financial officer of the Purchaser certifying that such
uncollected Assigned Current Receivables have been assigned to the Seller free
and clear of all Liens (except for those uncollected Assigned Current
Receivables which relate to Returned Goods, which, by their nature, cannot be
assigned).

                           4.2      If the Seller agrees with the A/R Claim
Amount set forth on the A/R Claim Notice, then a notice signed by both the
Seller and the Purchaser shall be delivered to

<PAGE>

                                                                               3

the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to promptly pay to the Purchaser
the A/R Claim Amount, if any, from the Escrow Account.

                           4.3      If the Seller in good faith disagrees with
the A/R Claim Amount set forth on the A/R Claim Notice, the Seller shall inform
the Purchaser and the Escrow Agent in writing (the "Objection") no later than
five (5) Business Days after receipt of the A/R Claim Notice, setting forth a
description in reasonable detail of the basis of its objection(s) and the
adjustments to the A/R Claim Notice and the A/R Claim Amount reflected thereon
which the Seller believes should be made. The parties shall cooperate and seek
in good faith to resolve any differences which they may have with respect to the
Objection and to agree upon an adjusted amount, if any, to be paid to the
Purchaser from the Current Receivables Deposit (the "Adjusted A/R Claim
Amount"). Upon such resolution, a notice signed by both the Seller and the
Purchaser shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to
promptly pay to the Purchaser the Adjusted A/R Claim Amount from the Escrow
Account.

                           4.4      If the Seller fails to provide a notice of
Objection to the Purchaser and the Escrow Agent within five (5) Business Days
after its receipt of the A/R Claim Notice, then the Escrow Agent shall promptly
pay to the Purchaser the A/R Claim Amount.

                           4.5      The "Final A/R Claim Amount" shall be either
(i) the A/R Claim Amount or (ii) the Adjusted A/R Claim Amount.

                  5.       Distributions to the Seller from the Escrow Account.
On the sixth Business Day after the 181st day after the Closing Date, the Escrow
Agent shall distribute to the Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds as directed by the Seller from time to time, the entire Escrow Account
less the Final A/R Claim Amount; provided, however, that the Escrow Agent shall
not distribute any funds from the Escrow Account if it has not received an A/R
Claim Notice from the Purchaser. If the Purchaser fails to provide an A/R Claim
Notice within (5) Business Days after the 181st day after the Closing Date it
will be deemed to have elected to assign any uncollected Assigned Current
Receivables to the seller and deduct an amount from the Current Receivables
Deposit equal to the A/R Claim Amount. In such event, the Purchaser and Seller
shall work closely and cooperatively to agree upon the A/R Claim Amount, and
shall, upon reaching such agreement, deliver to the Escrow Agent instructions
regarding the amount to be disbursed to the Purchaser and the Seller. The Escrow
Agent, upon receipt of such joint writing, shall promptly disburse to the
parties the amounts set forth on such notice.

                  6.       Termination of this Escrow Agreement. This Agreement
shall terminate as to the Escrow Account, upon the full distribution of the
Escrow Account pursuant to Sections 4 and 5.

                  7.       Disputes. In the event of any dispute as to the
disposition of the Escrow Account, as the case may be or as to any other matters
under this Agreement, the Escrow Agent is hereby authorized to deposit, upon
five (5) Business Days' notice to the parties, the funds constituting the Escrow
Account, with a court of competent jurisdiction. In connection with any such
dispute, the Escrow Agent may elect, in its commercially reasonable discretion,
to commence an interpleader action relating thereto.

                  8.       Sole Duties. The Escrow Agent's sole duties hereunder

herein provided, the Escrow Agent shall be deemed to have performed its duties

except for its own willful misconduct, recklessness, or gross negligence and
except as provided in Section 13.6 of this Agreement.

giving ten (10) Business Days' prior written notice to the parties hereto. The
Seller and the Purchaser will thereupon jointly designate a successor escrow
agent hereunder within said ten (10) Business Day period to whom the Escrow
Account shall be delivered. In default of such joint designation of a successor
escrow agent, the Escrow Agent shall retain the Escrow Account as custodian

without further liability or responsibility.

                  12.      Indemnification of Escrow Agent.

                           12.1     From and at all times after the date of this
Escrow Agreement, the Seller and the Purchaser, jointly and severally, shall, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify and hold harmless the Escrow
Agent and each director, officer, employee, attorney, agent and affiliate of the
Escrow Agent (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against any and all
actions, claims, losses, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses of any kind or
nature whatsoever (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees,
costs and expenses) incurred by or asserted against any of the Indemnified
Parties from and after the date hereof as a result of or arising from any claim,
demand, suit, action or proceeding (including any inquiry or investigation) by
any person, including without limitation the Seller or the Purchaser, whether
threatened or initiated, asserting a claim for any legal or equitable remedy
against any person

<PAGE>

                                                                               6

under any statute or regulation, including, but not limited to, any federal or
state securities laws, or under any common law or equitable cause or otherwise,
arising from or in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution,
performance or failure of performance of this Agreement or any transactions
contemplated herein, whether or not any such Indemnified Party is a party to any
such action, proceeding, suit or the target of any such inquiry or
investigation; provided, however, that no Indemnified Party shall have the right
to be indemnified hereunder for any liability finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction, subject to no further appeal, to have resulted solely
from the gross negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct of such
Indemnified Party. The obligations of the Seller and the Purchaser under this
Section 12 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

                           12.2     The parties agree that neither the payment
by the Seller or the Purchaser of any claim by the Escrow Agent for
indemnification hereunder nor the disbursement of any amounts to the Escrow
Agent from the Escrow Account in respect of a claim by Escrow Agent for
indemnification shall impair, limit, modify, or affect, as between the Seller
and the Purchaser, the respective rights and obligations of the Seller, on the
one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand, under the Purchase Agreement.

                  13.      Miscellaneous Matters Concerning Escrow Agent.

                           13.1     The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
refrain from taking any action contemplated by this Agreement in the event that
it becomes aware of any disagreement between the parties hereto as to any facts
or as to the happening of any contemplated event precedent to such action.

                           13.2     The Escrow Agent shall have no
responsibility or liability for any diminution in value of any assets held
hereunder which may result from any investments or reinvestment made in
accordance with any provision which may be contained herein.

                           13.3     The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
compensation for its services hereunder as per Schedule B attached hereto, which
is made a part hereof, and for reimbursement of its reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket expenses including, but not by way of limitation, the fees and
costs of attorneys or agents which it may find necessary to engage in the
performance of its duties hereunder, all to be paid one half (1/2) by the
Purchaser and one half (1/2) by the Seller, and the Escrow Agent shall have, and
is hereby granted, a prior lien upon any property, cash, or assets of the Escrow
Account, as the case may be, with respect to its unpaid fees and nonreimbursed
expenses, superior to the interests of any other persons or entities. In the
event any such compensation, expenses, fees or costs are drawn by the Escrow
Agent from the Escrow Account, as the case may be, the Seller and the Purchaser
each agree to make appropriate payment to the other party such that each party
ultimately receives the amount of the Current Receivables Deposit that is
entitled to receive without reduction or deduction for the other party's one
half (1/2) share of such compensation, expenses, fees or costs.

                           13.4     The Escrow Agent shall be entitled and is
hereby granted the right to set off and deduct any unpaid fees and/or
nonreimbursed expenses from amounts in the Escrow Account.

<PAGE>

                                                                               7

                           13.5     The Escrow Agent shall be under no
obligation to invest the deposited funds or the income generated thereby until
it has received a Form W-9 or W-8, as applicable, from the Purchaser and the
Seller, regardless of whether such party is exempt from reporting or withholding
requirements under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

                           13.6     The Escrow Agent shall have only those
duties as are specifically provided herein, which shall be deemed purely
ministerial in nature, and shall under no circumstance be deemed a fiduciary for
any of the parties to this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall neither be
responsible for, nor chargeable with, knowledge of the terms and conditions of
any other agreement, instrument or document between the other parties hereto, in
connection herewith, including, without limitation, the Purchase Agreement. This
Agreement sets forth all matters pertinent to the escrow contemplated hereunder,
and no additional obligations of the Escrow Agent shall be inferred from the
terms of this Agreement or any other agreement.

                           13.7     The Escrow Agent shall have the right, but
not the obligation, to consult with counsel of choice and shall not be liable
for action taken or omitted to be taken by the Escrow Agent in accordance with
the advice of such counsel. If the Escrow Agent becomes involved in litigation
on account of this Agreement, it shall have the right to retain counsel and
shall have a first lien on the property deposited hereunder for any and all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs, attorneys' fees, charges,
disbursements, and expenses in connection with such litigation; and shall be
entitled to reimburse itself therefor out of the property deposited hereunder,
and if it shall be unable to reimburse itself from the property deposited
hereunder, the Purchaser and the Seller jointly and severally agree to pay to
the Escrow Agent on demand its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket charges,
counsel and attorneys' fees, disbursements, and expenses in connection with such
litigation.

                           13.8     Any entity into which the Escrow Agent may
be merged, converted or with which the Escrow Agent may be consolidated, or any
entity resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the
Escrow Agent shall be a party, or any entity to which all or substantially all
of the business of the Escrow Agent shall be transferred, shall succeed to all
the Escrow Agent's rights, obligations and immunities hereunder without the
execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the
parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding.

                           13.9     In the event that any escrow property shall
be attached, garnished or levied upon by any court order (including, by
bankruptcy), or the delivery thereof shall be stayed or enjoined by an order of
a court, or any order, judgment or decree shall be made or entered by any court
order affecting the property deposited under this Agreement, the Escrow Agent is
hereby expressly authorized, in its sole discretion, to obey and comply with all
writs, orders or decrees so entered or issued, which it is advised by legal
counsel of its own choosing is binding upon it, whether with or without
jurisdiction, and in the event that the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any
such writ, order or decree it shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto
or to any other person, firm or entity, by reason of such compliance
notwithstanding such writ, order or decree be subsequently reversed, modified,
annulled, set aside or vacated.

                           13.10    The Escrow Agent shall report to the

                                                                               8

the Purchaser or the Seller, whether or not said income has been distributed
during such year, as and to the extent required by law. The Escrow Agent agrees,
to the extent permitted by law, to make any such report as near as possible to
the filing deadline therefor in order that it may report any income earned to
the party which actually received the same. If the filing deadline for any
calendar year shall occur prior to the distribution of such income, the Escrow
Agent may report such income as earned by the Purchaser. Any tax returns
required to be prepared and filed will be prepared and filed by the party which
is reported to have received such income with the Internal Revenue Service in
all years income is earned, whether or not income is received or distributed in
any particular tax year, and Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility for the
preparation and/or filing or any tax return with respect to any income earned by
the Escrow Account. Any taxes payable on income earned from the investment of
the Escrow Account shall be paid by the party which is reported to have received
such income, whether or not the income was distributed by the Escrow Agent
during any particular year. The Escrow Agent shall have no obligation to pay any
taxes or estimated taxes. After the Escrow Account and the income earned thereon
has been distributed by the Escrow Agent, the parties agree to cooperate and to
file any amended reports which may be necessary in order to correct any filings
with the Internal Revenue Service which reported income as having been earned by
a party which did not actually receive such income.

                  14.      Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Purchase
Agreement contain the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby and supersede all prior agreements, written or
oral, with respect thereto.

                  15.      Amendment; Waiver. This Agreement may not be amended
or modified except by an instrument in writing signed by the Seller, the
Purchaser and the Escrow Agent. No failure or delay by any party in exercising
any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof.

                  16.      Governing Law. This Agreement and all Claims with
respect thereto shall be governed by and construed in accordance with federal
bankruptcy law, to the extent applicable, and, where state law is implicated,
the laws of the State of New York without regard to any conflict of laws rules
thereof that might indicate the application of the laws of any other
jurisdiction.

                  17.      Consent to Jurisdiction; Service of Process.

                           17.1     Consent of Jurisdiction. The Purchaser and
the Seller irrevocably and unconditionally consent to submit to the jurisdiction
of the Bankruptcy Court for any litigation arising out of or relating to this

process and any other notice in any such Claim shall be effective against any
party if given personally or by registered or certified mail, return receipt
requested, or by any other means of mail that requires a signed receipt, postage
prepaid, mailed to such party as herein provided. Nothing herein contained shall
be deemed to affect the right of any party to serve process in any manner

or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against any other party in
any other jurisdiction.

                  18.      WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.

                           18.2     EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
