 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING BUYER AND BUYER SUB_

 

Buyer and Buyer Sub hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to the
Company as follows:

 

Section 5.1 _Organization, Existence and Good Standing_. Each of Buyer and
Buyer Sub is a corporation or limited company duly incorporated and validly
existing as a corporation

 



27  or limited company in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware
or the Bailiwick of Guernsey, and each of Buyer and Buyer Sub is qualified to
do business as a foreign corporation or other entity and is in good standing,
under the laws of each state or other jurisdiction in which either the
ownership or use of the properties owned or used by it, or the nature of the
activities conducted by it, require such qualification, except where any
failure of Buyer or Buyer Sub to be so qualified and in good standing would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have or be reasonably likely to have a
material adverse effect on the ability of Buyer and Buyer Sub to perform
their obligations under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.

Section 5.2 _Power and Authority; Authorization_. Buyer and Buyer Sub have,
respectively, all requisite corporate or limited company power and authority
to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents to which either is a party and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution, delivery and

Documents to which either is or at the Closing will be a party and the
consummation by Buyer and Buyer Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby

and Buyer Sub. This Agreement has been and, when executed and delivered at the

party will be, duly executed and delivered by Buyer or Buyer Sub, as
applicable. This Agreement constitutes and, when executed and delivered at the
Closing, the other Transaction Documents to which Buyer or Buyer Sub is a
party will constitute, the legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer or
Buyer Sub, as applicable, enforceable against it in accordance with their
respective terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable
laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar legal requirement relating to or affecting creditors rights generally
and except as such enforceability is subject to general principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity
or at law).

Section 5.3 _No Conflicts_. The execution and delivery by each of Buyer
and Buyer Sub of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which
it is or will be a party, the performance by each of Buyer and Buyer Sub of
its obligations hereunder and thereunder and the consummation by each of Buyer
and Buyer Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby do not and
shall not: (a) conflict with or violate any provision of the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of Buyer or Buyer Sub; (b) require any consent,
waiver, approval or order of, notice or filing with, or any Permit or other
authorization of, or any exemption by, any Government Authority, except in
connection with or in compliance with the provisions of the HSR Act and the
other Antitrust Laws; (c) with such exceptions as, individually and in the
aggregate, do not have, and are not reasonably likely to have, a material
effect on Buyer and Buyer Sub, taken as a whole, conflict with, result in a
violation or breach of, constitute a default under, result in
the acceleration of, give rise to any right to accelerate, terminate, modify
or cancel, or require any notice, consent, authorization, approval or waiver
under, or result in any other adverse consequence under, any Permit or any
Company Contract; (d) result in the imposition of any Lien upon any assets or
properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (e) violate or breach
the terms of or cause any default under any Law; or (f) with the passage of
time, the giving of notice or the taking of any action by another Person,
have any of the effects described in clauses (a) through (e) of this _Section
5.3_.

 



28 Section 5.4 _No Prior Activities_. Buyer Sub has not engaged in any business
or activities. As of the Closing, Buyer Subs common stock will be the only
class or series of its capital stock that is issued and outstanding. All of
such stock will be owned directly by Buyer.

 

Section 5.5 _Litigation_. There is no Proceeding pending or, to the knowledge
of Buyer or Buyer Sub, threatened against Buyer or Buyer Sub at law or in
equity, before any Government Authority that is, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the ability
of Buyer or Buyer Sub to perform its obligations hereunder or under any
of the other Transaction Documents.

Section 5.6 _Financing_. Buyer has prior to the date of this Agreement
delivered to the Company copies, as of the date of this Agreement, of: (a)
executed equity commitment letters (the "Equity Funding Letters") from certain
parties (the "Equity Providers") to provide, subject to the terms
and conditions therein, equity financing in the aggregate amounts set forth
therein (being collectively referred to as the "Equity Financing"), and (b)
executed debt commitment letters and redacted fee letters (the
"Debt Commitment Letters" and, together with the Equity Funding Letters, the
"Financing Letters") from the financial institutions identified therein
(together with their Affiliates, equityholders, members, officers,
directors, employees and representatives involved in the Debt Financing and
their successors and assigns, the "Debt Financing Source", together with the
Equity Providers, the "Financing Sources") to provide, subject to the terms
and conditions therein, debt financing in an aggregate amount set forth
therein (being collectively referred to as the "Debt Financing"; and together
with the Equity Financing collectively referred to as the "Financing"). As of
the date of this Agreement, neither the Equity Funding Letters nor Debt
Commitment Letters have been amended or modified and no such amendment or
modification is contemplated, and the respective commitments contained in
such letters have not been withdrawn or rescinded. As of the date hereof,
there are no side letters or other Contracts or arrangements related to the
funding or investing, as applicable, of the financing contemplated pursuant to
the Financing Letters other than as expressly set forth in the Financing
Letters furnished to the Company pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ and other
than agreements among the Equity Providers regarding the terms of the equity
arrangements. Assuming the Financing is funded in accordance with the terms
and conditions of the Financing Letters and assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in _Article III_ and performance by
the Company of its obligations hereunder, the net proceeds contemplated by
the Financing Letters will, together with the cash or cash equivalents
available to the Company and its Subsidiaries, in the aggregate be sufficient
for Buyer and Buyer Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents on the terms and conditions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including the payment of all amounts payable
at Closing pursuant to _Section 2.1_. As of the date of this Agreement, the
Financing Letters in the form so delivered are, as to Buyer and, to the best
of Buyers knowledge, the other parties thereto, valid, binding and
enforceable obligations (except as such enforceability (i) may be limited
by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, and other
similar laws affecting or relating to creditors rights generally; and (ii) is
subject to general principles of equity), in full force and effect, and not
subject to any conditions precedent or other similar contractual
contingencies other than as set forth therein. Buyer has fully paid any and
all commitment fees, if any, or other fees required by the Financing Letters
to be paid as of the date of this Agreement to the extent the same are due
and payable and Buyer is unaware of any fact or occurrence existing on the
date hereof that would reasonably be expected to make any of the

 



29  assumptions or any of the statements set forth in the Financing Letters
inaccurate or that would reasonably be expected to cause the Financing Letters
to be ineffective. Assuming satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
_Article VII_ , as of the date hereof, Buyer has no reason to believe that the
conditions to the funding contemplated by the Financing Letters will not be
satisfied. The obligations of Buyer under this Agreement are not contingent
on the availability of financing for, or related to, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.7  _Guarantee_. The Guarantee is in full force and effect and is
the valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the Guarantor, and no event
has occurred, which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default on the part of the Guarantor under the Guarantee.

Section 5.8 _Solvency_. Assuming (a) the satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_, (b) the accuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in _Article III_ and (c) that
immediately prior to the Closing and without giving effect to the
Financing or any of the other transactions to occur at Closing, the Company
and each of its Subsidiaries are Solvent, immediately after giving effect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer, and each of its
respective Subsidiaries shall be Solvent. No transfer of property is being
made and no obligation is being incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud
either present or future creditors of the Company or the Companys
Subsidiaries.

Section 5.9 _Investment Representation_. Buyer is acquiring the Securities for
its own account with the present intention of holding such securities for
investment purposes and not with a view to, or for sale in connection with,
any distribution of such securities in violation of any federal or state
securities laws. Buyer acknowledges that the Company Capital Stock has not
been registered under the Securities Act or any state or foreign securities
laws and that the Company Capital Stock may not be sold, transferred, offered
for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of unless such
transfer, sale, assignment, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition is
pursuant to the terms of an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act and the Company Capital Stock is registered under any
applicable state or foreign securities laws or sold pursuant to an exemption
from registration under the Securities Act and any applicable state or foreign
securities laws.

 

Section 5.10 _Brokers or Finders_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.10_,
neither Buyer nor Buyer Sub has incurred any obligation or liability,
contingent or otherwise, for brokerage or finders fees or agents commissions
or other similar payment in connection with this Agreement for which the
Company will be responsible prior to the consummation of the Closing.

comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be performed or complied
with by it under this Agreement, in any such case if and only to the extent
that such untruth or inaccuracy, or such failure, would cause any of the
conditions to the Closing set forth in _7.2(a)_ or  _(b)_ to not be
satisfied at such time.

(c) the Company shall promptly deliver notice to Buyer in writing of any
specific event or circumstance, to the extent not disclosed in the Disclosure

hereby or thereby; and (iii) not incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise
become liable for any Funded Debt if such action would result in a net
increase in the amount of Funded Debt over the amount of Funded Debt as of
the date of this Agreement;

(e) the Company shall, and the Sellers shall cause the Company to, not take
or refrain from taking any action that, if taken, caused to be taken or
refrained from being taken after December 31, 2013 and prior to the date of
this Agreement and not set forth on _Schedule 3.6_ would cause any of the
representations and warranties in _Section 3.6_ (Absence of Certain Changes)
to be inaccurate or breached; and

 



31 (f) except as required by law, the Company shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, and the Sellers shall not cause the Company to, make any

that may result in a material increase of each of the Companys or any of its
Subsidiaries Tax liabilities or a material reduction of the Companys or any
of its Subsidiaries refunds of Taxes in any taxable period ending
following the Closing.

Section 6.2 _No Solicitation_. From and after the date of this Agreement and
until the earlier of the consummation of the Closing or the termination of

submission or announcement of, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist,
an Acquisition Proposal, (b) furnish to any Person (other than Buyer or any
designees of Buyer) any non-public information relating to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or afford to any Person (other than Buyer or any of
its Representatives) access to the business, properties, assets, books,
records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, in any such case with the intent to induce the
making, submission or announcement of, or the intent to encourage, facilitate

expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (c) participate or engage in
discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to an Acquisition

Buyer if any Seller, director or executive officer of the Company becomes
aware of any receipt by such Seller or the Company of (i) any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) any request for information that would reasonably be expected
to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) any inquiry with respect to, or
which would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, the
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and the

or inquiry. The Sellers, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall, and shall
cause their Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any existing discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than Buyer and
its Affiliates) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing.

 

Section 6.3 _Access; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement and until the consummation of
the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, to (a)
provide to Buyer and its Representatives reasonable access during at
reasonable times upon prior notice to the officers, employees, properties,
books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and (b) furnish
promptly such information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries as
Buyer may reasonably request. Nothing herein shall require the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to

 



32  disclose information to the extent such disclosure (x) would give rise to a
material risk that a waiver of attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine or similar privilege could occur, or (y) is reasonably likely to
violate any applicable Law or any confidentiality obligation of such party. In
the event that the Company does not provide access or information in reliance
on the preceding sentence, it shall (i) provide notice to Buyer that such
information is being withheld and (ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts
to communicate the applicable information to Buyer in a way that would not

fulfilled and performed under this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents to which it is a party, and to cause the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby to be fully carried out. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each party agrees, as applicable, to: (a) file or
cause to be filed a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act as
promptly as practicable following the execution of this Agreement and in the
case of filings under the HSR Act no later than ten (10) Business Days after

practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act or by any Government Authority and to take
all other actions necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the
waiting period under, or obtain the approval under, the HSR Act or any other
applicable Law, including any other applicable Antitrust Law, as soon as
practicable and in any event, prior to the Termination Date. None of Buyer,
Buyer Sub or the Company will directly or indirectly extend any waiting
period under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law or enter into any

transactions contemplated by this Agreement except with the prior written
consent of the others, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld in
light of closing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on or before
the Termination Date.

the Closing, each party hereto shall, in furtherance of the matters

Government Authority and of any material communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding the
transactions contemplated hereby and, unless prohibited by applicable Law,
permit the other party to review in advance any proposed communication by
such party to any Government Authority or such private party. No party to this
Agreement shall agree to participate in any meeting with any Government
Authority in respect of any filings, investigation (including any settlement
of the investigation), or other inquiry unless it consults with the others in
advance and, unless prohibited by applicable Law, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. The parties to this
Agreement shall provide each other with copies of all correspondence, filings
or communications between them or any of their respective representatives, on
the one hand, and any Government Authority or members of its staff, on the
other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that materials may be redacted:
(i) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries; (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements or
applicable Laws; and (iii) as is necessary to address reasonable attorney-
client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns.

 

(c) The parties hereto shall file with the Directorate of Defense Trade
Controls (the "DDTC"), U.S. Department of State, the requisite 60-day notice
of intended sale or transfer of control of an ITAR registrant to a foreign

of Defense Trade Controls ("DDTC"), a notice informing DDTC that the Company,
as well as its Subsidiaries identified on the current Form DS-2032

articles under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations ("ITAR"). Such
notice, which shall comply with the form and guidance provided on DDTCs
website, shall be submitted to Buyers counsel for review and comment in draft
form at least three (3) business days prior to filing with DDTC. On or before
the date of filing of such notice with DDTC, the Company shall (a) cause to be
destroyed, transferred, or otherwise lawfully removed from the Companys
possession and control all ITAR-controlled technical data and defense
articles, including such technical data in hard copy and electronic formats;
and (b) inform all relevant U.S.-based defense industry customers that the
Company and its Subsidiaries are no longer in the business of manufacturing
defense articles and that no further such orders or technical data should be
submitted to the Company or its Subsidiaries.

 

(d) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, and in
compliance with the Indenture, dated July 19, 2011, by and among the Company,

transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the other party unless otherwise required by Law, regulation or applicable
stock exchange regulation (including without limitation the filing of one or
more Current Reports on Form 8-K by the Company in respect of the transactions
contemplated by the Agreement and any other required disclosure under the
Exchange Act), and the parties to this Agreement shall cooperate as to the
timing and contents of any such press release, public announcement or
communication.

Section 6.6 _Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification_.

(a) Buyer and Buyer Sub shall cause all rights to indemnification and
exculpation from liability for acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the
Closing Date now existing in favor of the current or former directors,
managers, officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as
provided in their certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or similar
organizational documents with different names) or in indemnification
agreements, to survive the consummation of the Closing and to continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their respective terms for a period of
not less than six (6) years after the Closing Date.

(b) On the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Company to obtain (at
Buyers sole cost and expense) a non-cancelable run-off insurance policy
(providing coverage that, taken as a whole, is no less favorable than under
the Companys policy as in effect on the date of this Agreement), for a period
of six (6) years after the Closing Date to provide directors and officers
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage, comparable in scope to
such insurance coverage provided prior to the date hereof, for events, acts or
omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing Date (including in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby) for
all persons who were directors, managers or officers of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries on or prior to the Closing Date.

(c) In the event that the Company or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then, and in each such case, the Company shall take all
necessary action so that the successors or assigns of the Company, as the case
may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.6_.

 

(d) The rights of each of the Companys and its Subsidiaries current and
former directors, managers, officers and employees under this _Section 6.6_
shall be in addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate
of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under
any applicable Law or under any agreement of any such individual with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights shall survive the Closing and
are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each such director,
manager, officer and employee.

 



35 Section 6.7 _Financing; Assistance in Financing_.

 

(a) Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange, obtain and consummate the Debt Financing on
the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter(s) on or
prior to the Closing Date. Such commercially reasonable efforts shall
include: (i) maintaining in full force and effect the Debt Commitment
Letter(s) in the form provided to the Company on or prior to the date of this
Agreement, (ii) satisfying (or obtaining a waiver of) on a timely basis all of
the conditions precedent and covenants to the Debt Financing applicable to
Buyer that are to be satisfied by Buyer, and (iii) negotiating, executing and
delivering definitive documents ("Debt Financing Documents") that reflect the
terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter(s) (including, as necessary,
agreeing to any requested changes to the commitments thereunder in accordance
with any "flex" provisions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter(s) or any
related fee letter), in each case which terms shall not impose material new
conditions precedent to the funding of the Debt Financing at Closing that are
not contained in the Debt Commitment Letter(s), or reduce the aggregate amount
of the Debt Financing available to be funded on the Closing Date (unless such
reduction is matched with an equal increase of the Equity Financing under the
Equity Funding Letters). Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any of its
controlled Affiliates to, without the prior written consent of the Company,
take or fail to take any action or enter into any transaction that could
reasonably be expected to materially impair, delay, or prevent consummation of
the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter(s). Buyer shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all of its obligations
under each of the Debt Financing Documents. Buyer shall obtain the Equity
Financing contemplated by the Equity Funding Letters upon satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions to the Closing set forth in _Section 7.1_, _7.2_
and _7.3_. Buyer shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned) permit or consent to (w) any amendment, supplement or
modification to be made to the Equity Funding Letters (other than to increase
the amount of Equity Financing), (x) any amendment, supplement or modification
to be made to the Debt Commitment Letter(s) if such amendment, supplement or
modification would (A) impose new conditions precedent to the funding of the
Debt Financing that are not contained in the Debt Commitment Letter(s), (B)
reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede or materially impair the
consummation of the Debt Financing to fund the amounts required to be paid by
Buyer in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (C)
reduce the aggregate cash amount of the Debt Financing (including by changing
the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount of the Debt Financing
(except as set forth in any "flex" provisions existing on the date of this
Agreement)) unless any such reduction is matched with an equal increase of
the Equity Financing under the Equity Funding Letters) or (D) otherwise
materially adversely affect the ability of Buyer to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the timing of the Closing
(collectively, the "Restricted Commitment Letter Amendments"); _provided_ ,
that subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section 6.7_, Buyer may,
without the written consent of the Company, amend the Debt Commitment
Letter(s) to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or
similar entities that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter(s) as of
the date of this Agreement and to grant to such persons such approval rights
as are customarily granted to additional lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities, but only if the addition

and Buyer Sub under this Agreement are not contingent or conditioned on the
availability of such insurance for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 6.9 _Appointment of Sellers  Representative_.

 

(a) Each of the Sellers does hereby (i) make, constitute and appoint Izurium

such Sellers name, place and stead, as if such Seller had personally done
such act, and Izurium as the Sellers Representative hereby accepts such
appointment. The death, incapacity, dissolution, liquidation, insolvency or
bankruptcy of any Seller shall not terminate such appointment or the authority
and agency of the Sellers Representative. The power-of-attorney granted in
this _Section 6.10(a)_ is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable.

(b) The Sellers Representative shall not be liable for any act done or
omitted under this Agreement in its capacity as the Sellers Representative
unless such act or omission is found to be grossly negligent or as a result of

any Seller, Buyer, Buyer Sub, any third party or any other evidence deemed by
the Sellers Representative to be reliable, and the Sellers Representative
shall be entitled to act on the advice of counsel selected by it. The
Sellers Representative shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to
take any action under this Agreement or any related document or agreement
unless it shall have received such advice or concurrence of such Sellers as
it deems appropriate or it shall have been expressly indemnified to its
satisfaction by the Sellers appointing it, severally according to their
respective Consideration received, against any and all liability and expense
that the Sellers Representative may incur by reason of taking or continuing
to take any such action.

 



40 (c) The Sellers Representative shall be entitled to retain counsel and to
incur such expenses as the Sellers Representative deems to be necessary or
appropriate in connection with its performance of its obligations under this

service to assist in the administrative tasks required to be performed by the
Sellers Representative hereunder), and, except as otherwise set forth in this
Agreement, all such fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses, reasonable fees and expenses of any trust or escrow service and
any other amounts in connection with the initiation, defense and/or settlement
of claims for indemnification) incurred by the Sellers Representative shall
be borne by the Sellers _pro rata _according to their respective
Consideration received hereto.

(d) The Sellers hereby agree to indemnify the Sellers Representative (in its
capacity as such) ratably according to the Consideration received by the
Sellers, and to hold the Sellers Representative (in its capacity as such)
harmless from, any and all losses of whatever kind which may at any time be
imposed upon, incurred by or asserted against the Sellers Representative in
such capacity in any way relating to or arising out of its action or failures
to take action pursuant to this Agreement or any related document or agreement
or in connection herewith or therewith in such capacity. The agreements in
this _Section 6.10(d)_ shall survive termination of this Agreement.

 

(e) Izurium shall serve as the Sellers Representative until its resignation.
Upon the resignation of Izurium, the Sellers who represent a majority of the
total Consideration shall select a new Sellers Representative. Each time a
new Sellers Representative is appointed pursuant to this Agreement, such
Person, as a condition precedent to the effectiveness of such appointment,
shall accept such position in writing.

(f) Buyer and Buyer Sub and their Affiliates shall be entitled to rely upon,
and shall be fully protected in relying upon, the power and authority of the
Sellers Representative without independent investigation. Buyer and Buyer Sub
and their respective Affiliates shall have no liability whatsoever to the
Sellers or any other constituencies for any acts or omissions of the Sellers

precedent in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ (other than those conditions
precedent that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction of those conditions precedent) have been
satisfied, and remain satisfied, at the time when the Closing would have
occurred but for the failure of the Equity Financing to be funded and the
Closing to be consummated, (ii) the financing provided for by the Debt
Financing Documentation (or, if alternative financing is being used in
accordance with _Section 6.7(c)_, pursuant to the commitments with respect

the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction of those conditions precedent) or
that Sellers Representative is willing to waive such conditions precedent,
and (B) if such injunction, specific performance or other form of equitable
relief is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then
each of the Sellers and the Company will take all actions required of it
under this Agreement in order to cause the consummation of the Closing to
occur and (iv) this Agreement shall not have been validly terminated. For the
avoidance of doubt, (A) nothing in this _Section 9.3(b)_ shall prohibit the
Sellers Representative or the Company from seeking an injunction, specific

payment of the Reverse Termination Fee under _Section 9.3_, under
no circumstances shall the Sellers Representative and the Company be
permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance and
payment of the Reverse Termination Fee.

 



46 (c) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this  _Section 9.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) the Reverse Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is
liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Sellers
and the Company in the circumstances in which the Reverse Termination Fee is
payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, and
(iii) without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if Buyer fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant
to this _Section 9.3_ and, in order to obtain such payment, the Sellers
Representative or the Company commence a suit that results in a judgment
against Buyer for the payment of any amount set forth in this _Section 9.3_,
Buyer shall pay the Company its costs and expenses in connection with such
suit, together with interest on such amount at the annual rate of five percent
plus the prime rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on
the date such payment was required to be made through the date such payment
was actually received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted by
applicable Law.

_GENERAL PROVISIONS_

Section 10.1 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement,
and will become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by a

considered original executed counterparts for purposes of this _Section
10.1_, provided that receipt of copies of such counterparts is confirmed.

 

Section 10.2 _Governing Law_. In each case except as expressly set forth in
_Section 10.16_:

 

(a) This Agreement and (except to the extent, if any, expressly set forth
therein) the other Transaction Documents, and any disputes arising hereunder
or (except to the extent, if any, expressly set forth therein) thereunder or
controversies related hereto, or (except to the extent, if any, expressly set
forth therein) thereto, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the internal laws, and not the laws of conflicts, of the State of Delaware
that apply to contracts made and performed entirely within such state.

 

(b) Any Proceeding with respect to this Agreement or (except to the extent, if
any, expressly set forth therein) any other Transaction Document, any matter
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or (except to the extent,
if any, expressly set forth therein) any other Transaction Document shall be
brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in the State of
Delaware. By execution and delivery of this Agreement, each party hereto
hereby accepts for itself and in respect of such Persons property, generally
and unconditionally, the sole

 



47  and exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and appellate courts
thereof. Each party hereto irrevocably consents to service of process in any
Proceeding in any of the aforementioned courts by the mailing of copies
thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, or by recognized
overnight delivery service, to such party at such partys address referred to
in _Section 10.6_. Each party hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives any objection which such Person may now or hereafter have to the laying
of venue of any of the aforesaid actions or proceedings arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement or (except to the extent, if any, expressly
set forth therein) any other Transaction Document brought in the courts
referred to above and hereby further irrevocably waives and agrees, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, not to plead or claim in any such court
that any such Proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Final judgment in any such Proceeding shall be conclusive
and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by Law. Nothing herein shall affect the right of any
party hereto to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

(c) To the extent that any party hereto has or hereafter may acquire any
immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether
through service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to itself, or to such
Persons property, each such party hereto hereby irrevocably waives such
immunity in respect of such Persons obligations with respect to this
Agreement or (except to the extent expressly set forth therein) any other
Transaction Document.

(d) _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HERETO, FOR ITSELF AND ITS AFFILIATES,
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED

THE PARTIES HERETO OR THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT
(INCLUDING ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM INVOLVING THE DEBT FINANCING

Documents contain the entire agreement by and among the parties with respect
to the subject matter hereof and all prior negotiations, writings and
understandings relating to the subject matter of this Agreement are
superseded and canceled by, this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Confidentiality Agreement shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with its term until Closing. This
Agreement is not intended to confer upon any Person not a party hereto, other
than the Non-Party Affiliate (or their successors and permitted assigns) any
rights or remedies hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Debt
Financing Sources shall be third party beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled
to enforce the provisions of this _Section 10.3_ and _Sections 9.3_ , _10.2_
,  _10.7_ , _10.9_ , _10.15_ and _10.16_.

 



48 Section 10.4 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement,

Returns shall be borne fifty (50) percent by the Buyer and fifty (50) percent

50 Section 10.7 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement will be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns; _provided_ , _however_ , that no party hereto may
assign its rights or delegate its obligations, in whole or in part, under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto,
_provided_ , _further_ however that Buyer and Buyer Sub may assign their
rights, interests and obligations hereunder, without the consent of any
Person, to an Affiliate, provided that the Equity Commitment Letters are
simultaneously assigned to such Affiliate and the Guarantees continue to be
applicable to the obligations of such Affiliate hereunder. Any purported
assignment or delegation in violation of this Agreement shall be null and
void _ab_ _initio_.

Section 10.8 _Headings_. The Section, Article and other headings contained in
this Agreement are inserted for convenience of reference only and will not
affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.9 _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may not be modified or
amended except by an instrument or instruments in writing signed by the
Buyer, the Company and the Sellers Representative; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that without the express written consent of MIHI, (i) MIHIs economic rights
or consideration to be received under this Agreement may not be adversely
affected, (ii) MIHI may not be subjected to increased representations,
warranties, liabilities, covenants or obligations under any Transaction
Documents, and (iii) the provisions of this  _Section 10.9_ shall not be
amended. Any party hereto may, only by an instrument in writing, waive
compliance by any other party or parties hereto with any term or provision
hereof on the part of such other party or parties hereto to be performed or
complied with. No failure or delay of any party in exercising any right or
remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or
partial exercise of any right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance
of steps to enforce such right or power, preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The waiver by
any party hereto of a breach of any term or provision hereof shall not be
construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach. The rights and remedies of
the parties hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or
remedies that they would otherwise have hereunder. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, any amendment or modification to this _Section
10.9_, _Sections 9.3_ , _10.2_ , _10.3_ , _10.7_ , _10.15_ or _10.16_ that is
adverse to the Debt Financing Source, shall not be made without the prior
written consent of such Debt Financing Source.

Section 10.10 _Interpretation; Absence of Presumption_.

 

(a) For the purposes hereof: (i) words in the singular shall be held to
include the plural and vice versa and words of one gender shall be held to
include the other gender as the context requires; (ii) the terms "hereof",
"herein", and "herewith" and words of similar import shall, unless otherwise
stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole (including all of
the Schedules and Exhibits) and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement, and Article,

 



51  Section, paragraph, Exhibit and Schedule references are to the Articles,
Sections, paragraphs, Exhibits, and Schedules to this Agreement unless
otherwise specified; (iii) the word "including" and words of similar import
when used in this Agreement shall mean "including, without limitation", unless
the context otherwise requires or unless otherwise specified; (iv) the word
"or" shall not be exclusive; and (v) an item arising with respect to a
specific representation or warranty shall be deemed to be "reflected on" or
"set forth in" a balance sheet or financial statements, to the extent (A)
there is a reserve, accrual or other similar item underlying a number on such
balance sheet or financial statement that is related to the subject matter of
such representation, (B) such item is otherwise specifically set forth on the
balance sheet or financial statement or (C) such item is reflected on the
balance sheet or financial statement and is specifically referred to in the
notes thereto. Further, prior drafts of this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents or the fact that any clauses have been added, deleted
or otherwise modified from any prior drafts of this Agreement or any of the
other Transaction Documents shall not be used as an aid of construction or
otherwise constitute evidence of the intent of the parties hereto, and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party
hereto by virtue of such prior drafts.

(b) With regard to each and every term and condition of this Agreement and
each of the other Transaction Documents, the parties hereto understand and
agree that the same have or has been mutually negotiated, prepared and
drafted, and if at any time the parties hereto desire or are required to
interpret or construe any such term or condition or any other Transaction
Document, no consideration will be given to the issue of which party hereto
actually prepared, drafted or requested any term or condition of this
Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents.

Section 10.11 _Severability_. Any provision hereof that is held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent
jurisdiction, shall be ineffective only to the extent of such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability, without affecting in any way the remaining
provisions hereof, _provided_ , _however_ , that the parties will attempt in
good faith to reform this Agreement in a manner consistent with the intent of
any such ineffective provision for the purpose of carrying out such intent.

 

Section 10.12 _Business Days_. If any date provided for in this Agreement
shall fall on a day that is not a Business Day, the date provided for shall
be deemed to refer to the next Business Day.

Section 10.13 _Remedies_.

 

(a) This Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy.

 

(b) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in
the event that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this
Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of it
hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its 

 



52  specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, subject to _Section 9.3_, such
parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties hereto
agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that any other party has
an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not
an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any party hereto
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or
the Equity Financing and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement or the Equity Financing shall not be required to provide any
bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.
Nothing in this _Section 10.13(b)_ shall be deemed to permit the Sellers, the
Sellers Representative, the Company or any Person to seek an injunction,
specific performance or other form of equitable relief, to cause Buyer to
cause, or for the Company to directly cause, the Equity Financing to be funded
and the Closing to be consummated at any time (it being understood that any
such matters shall be governed exclusively by _Section 9.3(b)_).

Section 10.14 _Schedules_. Any information disclosed in any Schedule shall be
deemed fully disclosed for the purposes of all of the Schedules and shall be
deemed to qualify all representations and warranties of the Company to the
extent reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure. Neither the
specification (directly or indirectly by reference to a defined term hereof)
of any dollar amount in the representations and warranties set forth in
_Article III_ or _V_ nor the inclusion of any items in the Schedules shall be
deemed to constitute an admission by the Company or Buyer, or otherwise imply,
that any such amount or such items so included are material for the purposes
of this Agreement. The inclusion of, or reference to, any item within
any particular Schedule does not constitute an admission by the Company or
Buyer that such item meets any or all of the criteria set forth in this
Agreement for inclusion on such Schedule.

 

Section 10.15 _No Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claims or causes of action (whether in contract or in tort, at Law or in
equity) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or
the other Transaction Documents, or the negotiation, execution or performance
of this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents (including
any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement
or the other Transaction Documents or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents), may be made only against the
entities that are expressly identified as parties hereto and thereto. No
Person who is not a named party to this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents, including any past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or
representative of any named party to this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents ("Non-Party Affiliates"), shall have any liability (whether in
contract or in tort, at Law or in equity, or based upon any theory that seeks
to impose liability of an entity party against its owners or affiliates) for
any obligations or liabilities arising under, in connection with or related to
this Agreement or such other Transaction Document (as the case may be) or for
any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or such
other Transaction Document (as the case may be) or the negotiation or
execution hereof or thereof; and each party hereto waives and releases all
such liabilities, claims and obligations against any such Non-Party
Affiliates. Non-Party Affiliates are expressly intended as third party
beneficiaries of this provision of this Agreement.

 



53 Section 10.16 _Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto: (i) agrees that it
will not bring or support any person in any action, suit, proceeding, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against the Debt Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, but not limited
to, any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment
Letter(s) or the performance thereof or the financing contemplated thereby, in
any forum other than, and will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of,
the federal and New York state courts located in the Borough of Manhattan
within the City of New York and hereby waive to the fullest extent permitted
by law, any objection that any of them may have to the laying of venue of, and
their defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such legal
proceeding in any such court; (ii) agrees that, except as specifically set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter(s), all claims or causes of action
(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against the
Debt Financing Source in any way relating to the Debt Commitment Letter(s) or
the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, shall be
exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws
of the State of New York, without giving effect to principles or rules or
conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require or
permit the application of laws of another jurisdiction; and (iii) hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such party may have to a
trial by jury in respect of any litigation (whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise) directly or indirectly arising
out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter(s) or
the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby.
