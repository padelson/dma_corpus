the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any party hereto seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or the Equity Financing and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement or the
Equity Financing shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction. Nothing in this <U>Section&nbsp;10.13(b)</U> shall be deemed to permit the Sellers, the Sellers&#146; Representative, the
Company or any Person to seek an injunction, specific performance or other form of equitable relief, to cause Buyer to cause, or for the Company to directly cause, the Equity Financing to be funded and the Closing to be consummated at any time (it
being understood that any such matters shall be governed exclusively by <U>Section&nbsp;9.3(b)</U>). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Section&nbsp;10.14 <U>Schedules</U>.

Schedules shall be deemed to constitute an admission by the Company or Buyer, or otherwise imply, that any such amount or such items so included are material for the purposes of this Agreement. The inclusion of, or reference to, any item within any
