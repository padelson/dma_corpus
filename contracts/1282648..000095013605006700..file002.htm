(f) Fractional Shares. No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock  will be issued by virtue of the Merger, and each holder of shares of  Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a  share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of  Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder) shall,  upon compliance with Section 1.7, receive from Parent, in lieu of such  fractional share, one (1) share of Parent Common Stock.   1.7 Surrender of Certificates.   (a) Exchange Procedures. Upon surrender of Certificates at the  Closing, the holders of such Certificates shall receive in exchange  therefor such amounts of cash and certificates representing the number of  shares of Parent Common Stock into which their shares of Company Common  Stock shall be converted at the Effective Time, and the Certificates so  surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.

If cash and certificates representing  shares of Parent Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than that in  which the Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it  will be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificates so  surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for  transfer and that the persons requesting such exchange will have paid to  Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes required  by reason of the issuance of certificates representing shares of Parent  Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the  Certificates surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or  any agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.   (d) Required Withholding. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation  shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or  otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former  holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as are required to be deducted  or withheld therefrom under the Code or under any provision of state, local  or foreign tax law or under any other applicable legal requirement. To the  extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be  treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the  person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.   (e) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  Section 1.7, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation, the Company or  any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Parent Common  Stock or Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public  official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar  law.   1.8 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock.

If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.   1.9 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.

(b) Each Stockholder, for itself only, represents and warrants as  follows: (i) all Parent Common Stock to be acquired by such Stockholder  pursuant to this Agreement will be acquired for his, her or its account and  not with a view towards distribution thereof other than, with respect to  Stockholders that are entities, transfers to its stockholders, partners or  members; (ii) it understands that he, she or it must bear the economic risk  of the investment in the Parent Common Stock, which cannot be sold by he,  she or it unless it is registered under the Securities Act, or an exemption  therefrom is available thereunder; (iii) he, she or it has had both the  opportunity to ask questions and receive answers from the officers and  directors of Parent and all persons acting on Parent\'s behalf concerning  the business and operations of Parent and to obtain any additional  information to the extent Parent possesses or may possess such information  or can acquire it without unreasonable effort or expense necessary to  verify the accuracy of such information; and (iv) he, she or it has had  access to the Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement.

(a) Environmental Review. Insofar as the Company has the power and  authority to grant such right, Parent and its employees, agents and  contractors shall have the right, at the sole risk and expense of Parent,  but with the cooperation and assistance of the Company, to:   (i) enter all or any portion of the Mineral Properties, the Owned  Real Properties or the Leased Real Properties (collectively, the  "Environmental Properties" and, individually, an "Environmental  Property") to inspect, inventory, test, investigate, study and examine  the Properties in any manner Parent reasonably determines to be  warranted and to verify the accuracy of the representations made in  Section 2.16;   (ii) conduct air, water or soil tests on the Environmental  Properties and make such samples and borings and analysis as Parent  may consider necessary or appropriate for such purposes.    (iii) conduct such other independent inspections, inventories,  tests, investigations, studies or examinations as may be necessary or  appropriate in the sole judgment of Parent for the preparation of  health, safety, environmental or other reports or assessments relating  to the operation, use, maintenance, condition or status of the  Environmental Properties, and their compliance with all applicable  Laws, regulations, ordinances, orders, permits and licenses; and   (iv) conduct an independent assessment of the extent of any  possible existing or contingent liabilities due or related to the  operation, use, maintenance, condition or status of the Environmental  Properties.   (b) Conduct of Review. All inspections and reviews shall be undertaken  with a minimum of disruption to ongoing operations and shall be undertaken  only after reasonable notice to the Company. Parent shall not undertake any  destructive testing without the prior approval of the Company, which  approval will not be unreasonably withheld. Parent shall provide the  Company with a copy of the results and reports of all such inspections,  testing and reviews.   (c) Conditions of Access. Access to the Environmental Properties to  conduct Parent\'s environmental assessment shall be subject to the following  conditions: Parent   38    waives and releases all claims against the Company, its owners, directors,  officers, employees, agents and contractors, for injury to or death of  persons or damage to property arising in any way from the exercise of  rights granted to Parent hereby or the activities of Parent or its  employees, agents, consultants or contractors on the Environmental  Properties, provided that Parent does not hereby assume the risk of damage,  injury or death attributable to the willful misconduct or gross negligence  of the Company or its employees, agents or contractors. Parent shall  indemnify the Company and its owners, directors, officers, employees,  agents and contractors, and shall hold each and all of said indemnities  harmless from and against any and all loss whatsoever arising out of: (i)  any and all statutory or common law liens or other encumbrances for labor  or materials furnished in connection with such tests, samplings, studies or  surveys as Parent may conduct with respect to the Environmental Properties;  and (ii) any injury to or death of persons or damage to property occurring  in, on or about the Environmental Properties as a result of such exercise  or activities (except for any such injuries or damages caused by the gross  negligence or willful misconduct of any said indemnitees). Notwithstanding  any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the foregoing obligation  of indemnity shall survive the Closing or the termination of this Agreement  without Closing.   ARTICLE V   ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS  ---------------------   5.1 Proxy Statement; Special Meeting.   (a) As soon as is reasonably practicable after receipt by Parent from  the Company of all financial and other information relating to the Company  as Parent may reasonably request for its preparation, Parent shall prepare  and file with the SEC under the Exchange Act, and with all other applicable  regulatory bodies, proxy materials for the purpose of soliciting proxies  from holders of Parent Common Stock to vote in favor of,: (i) the adoption  of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger ("Parent Stockholder  Approval"); (ii) the change of the name of Parent to a name selected by the  Company (the "Name Change Amendment"); (iii) an increase in the number of  authorized shares of Parent Common Stock to 100,000,000 (the  "Capitalization Amendment"); (iv) an amendment to remove the preamble and  Sections A through D, inclusive, of Article Sixth from Parent\'s Certificate  of Incorporation from and after the Closing and to redesignate section E of  Article Sixth as Article Sixth; and (v) the adoption of a Performance  Equity Plan in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F (the "Parent Plan"),  at a meeting of holders of Parent Common Stock to be called and held for  such purpose (the "Special Meeting"). The Parent Plan shall provide that an  aggregate of 2,400,000 shares of Parent Common Stock shall be reserved for  issuance pursuant to the Parent Plan. Such proxy materials shall be in the  form of a proxy statement to be used for the purpose of soliciting such  proxies from holders of Parent Common Stock (the "Proxy Statement"). The  Company shall furnish to Parent all information concerning the Company as  Parent may reasonably request in connection with the preparation of the  Proxy Statement. The Company and its counsel shall be given an opportunity  to review and comment on the Proxy Statement prior to its filing with the  SEC. Parent, with the assistance of the Company, shall   39    promptly respond to any SEC comments on the Proxy Statement and shall  otherwise use reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be  approved for issuance by the SEC as promptly as practicable. Parent shall  also take any and all such actions to satisfy the requirements of the  Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent  shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common  Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger to be registered or qualified  under all applicable Blue Sky Laws of each of the states and territories of  the United States in which it is believed, based on information furnished  by the Company, holders of the Company Common Stock reside and to take any  other such actions that may be necessary to enable the Parent Common Stock  to be issued pursuant to the Merger in each such jurisdiction.   (b) As soon as practicable following its approval by the Commission,  Parent shall distribute the Proxy Statement to the holders of Parent Common  Stock and, pursuant thereto, shall call the Special Meeting in accordance  with the DGCL and, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement,  solicit proxies from such holders to vote in favor of the adoption of this  Agreement and the approval of the Merger and the other matters presented to  the stockholders of Parent for approval or adoption at the Special Meeting,  including, without limitation, the matters described Section 5.1(a).   (c) Parent shall comply with all applicable provisions of and rules  under the Exchange Act and all applicable provisions of the DGCL in the  preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement, the  solicitation of proxies thereunder, and the calling and holding of the  Special Meeting. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall ensure that  the Proxy Statement does not, as of the date on which it is distributed to  the holders of Parent Common Stock, and as of the date of the Special  Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a  material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of  the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (provided that  Parent shall not be responsible for the accuracy or completeness of any  information relating to the Company or any other information furnished by  the Company for inclusion in the Proxy Statement). The Company represents  and warrants that the information relating to the Company supplied by the  Company for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will not as of date of its  distribution to the holders of Parent Common Stock (or any amendment or  supplement thereto) or at the time of the Special Meeting contain any  statement which, at such time and in light of the circumstances under which  it is made, is false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or  omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary  in order to make the statement therein not false or misleading.   (d) Parent, acting through its board of directors, shall include in  the Proxy Statement the recommendation of its board of directors that the  holders of Parent Common Stock vote in favor of the adoption of this  Agreement and the approval of the Merger, and shall otherwise use  reasonable best efforts to obtain the Parent Stockholder Approval.   5.2 Directors and Officers of Parent and the Company and the Subsidiaries After Merger. Parent and the Company shall take all necessary action so that the persons listed on   40   Schedule 5.2 are elected to the positions of officers and directors of Parent and the Company, as set forth therein, to serve in such positions effective immediately after the Closing. The Stockholders and directors of the Company and the directors of Parent shall enter into a Voting Agreement in the form of Exhibit G hereto concurrently with the execution of this Agreement. At his election, Lawrence S. Coben may attend, as an observer, any and all meetings of the Board of Directors of Parent during any period prior to the third anniversary of the Closing Date in which he is not a director of Parent. During such period, Mr. Coben shall be given notice of all meetings of the Board of Directors of Parent in the same manner and at the same time as notice thereof is given to the members of the Board of Directors, shall be provided with copies of all materials that are provided to the members of the Board of Directors in connection with any meeting and shall be reimbursed for his out-of-pocket expenses incurred in attending any meeting.   5.3 Adverse Title or Environmental Conditions.   (a) If on or prior to the Notice Date (as hereinafter defined), Parent  determines (i) that the Company does not have title to any Titled Property  as represented and warranted by the Company in Article II, or (ii) that the  environmental condition of any Environmental Property is not as warranted  in Article II, each, an "Adverse Condition" and collectively, "Adverse  Conditions"), then Parent shall give written notice thereof to the Company  not later than January 3, 2006 (the "Notice Date"). Each such notice shall  include, with respect to each Property covered thereby (x) a brief  description of each Adverse Condition existing with respect to such  Property, (y) a statement of the action required to cure each such Adverse  Condition; and (z) a statement and calculation of the proposed adjustment  to the Merger consideration to be received by the Stockholders (the "Merger  Consideration") by reason of the existence of each such Adverse Condition  (an "Adjustment"). Each Adjustment shall be the sum of (I) the estimated  diminution in value of such Property by reason of the existence of such  Adverse Condition, and (II) without duplication of the foregoing, the  estimated potential liability for cure or remediation of such Adverse  Condition, with the amounts determined at (I) and (II) to be estimated in  good faith by Parent, with the bases therefor set out in the notice. Parent  shall be deemed to have waived any inaccuracy of representation or breach  of warranty constituting an Adverse Condition with respect to the Titled  Properties and Environmental Properties except to the extent set out in a  notice substantially in the form described above, given on or prior to the  Notice Date. The Company may, but shall have no obligation to, attempt to  cure any Adverse Conditions of which notice is timely and properly given by  Parent. As used in this Agreement, the term "Property" shall include any  and all Titled Properties and Environmental Properties.   (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) in no event may Parent give  notice of Adverse Conditions existing with respect to any particular  Property unless the sum of all Adjustments with respect to such Property  exceed $25,000 (the "Property Threshold"), provided, however, that in the  event the same or substantially the same circumstances constituting a  particular Adverse Condition affect 100 or more of the wells located on the  Mineral Properties, the Property Threshold with respect to the Properties  on which such wells are located shall be $1,000 with respect, only, to such  Adverse Condition; and (ii)   41    in no event may Parent give any notice of Adverse Conditions unless the sum  if all Adjustments with respect to all of the Properties of which notice is  timely and properly given exceed $500,000 (the "Aggregate Threshold"). In  the event some or all of the Adverse Conditions affecting any Property and  specified in any notice timely and properly given by Parent are cured prior  to the Cure Date (as hereinafter defined), and as a result of such cure the  Adjustments attributable to any remaining uncured Adverse Conditions  specified in the notice given with respect to such Property do not satisfy  the Property Threshold, then such uncured Adverse Conditions shall be  deemed waived. In the event some or all of the Adverse Conditions affecting  the Properties and specified in notices timely and properly given by Parent  are cured prior to the Cure Date, and as a result of such cure the  Adjustments attributable to any remaining uncured Adverse Conditions  specified in notices given with respect to all the Properties do not  satisfy the Aggregate Threshold, then all of such uncured Adverse  Conditions shall be deemed waived.   5.4 Adjustments for Uncured Adverse Conditions; Condemnation or Casualty.   (a) If all of the Adverse Conditions of which notice has been timely  and properly given by Parent have not been cured to the reasonable  satisfaction of Parent, or waived by Parent, on or prior to January 31,  2006 (the "Cure Date"), then Parent and the Company shall in good faith  attempt to determine (i) whether in fact the Adverse Conditions exist, and  if so, (ii) whether in fact the Adjustment proposed by Parent with respect  to each Adverse Condition is reasonable and accurate, and if both (i) and  (ii) are determined in the affirmative, (iii) an appropriate aggregate  Adjustment by reason of the existence of such Adverse Conditions, with the  understanding that any such Adjustment shall be made solely with respect to  the Parent Common Stock portion of the Merger Consideration to the extent  such Adjustment will not impair the tax-exempt treatment of the Parent  Common Stock portion of the Merger Consideration received by the  Stockholders in the Merger. In the event Parent and the Company are able to  agree on an appropriate Adjustment to the Merger Consideration by reason of  such Adverse Conditions, the Merger Consideration will be adjusted  accordingly at Closing. In the event Parent and the Company are unable to  agree on an appropriate Adjustment to the Merger Consideration by reason of  such Adverse Conditions, then Parent and the Company shall postpone the  Closing for a period of up to thirty (30) days, during which period the  parties shall meet or confer regularly (not less than once each week) and  with their respective experts in a good faith effort to resolve their  differences. If at the conclusion of such thirty (30) day period the  parties still are unable to agree, then either Parent or the Company may,  by written notice to the other, terminate this Agreement, in which event  such termination shall be deemed to be by mutual agreement of the parties.   (b) Except as otherwise hereinafter provided, the parties\' obligation  to proceed with the Closing shall not be excused and no adjustment to the  Merger Consideration shall be required if, after the execution of this  Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, any item of the Properties is  damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty or is taken under the right  of eminent domain. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall not  voluntarily compromise, settle or adjust any claims, causes of action or  demands against third parties,   42    arising out of such damage, destruction or taking, or commit, use or apply  any insurance proceeds or payments toward the repair, restoration or  replacement of the affected property without the prior written consent of  Parent. In the event Properties are damaged or destroyed by fire or other  casualty or are taken under the right of eminent domain and as a result  thereof the value of the Properties is, in Parent\'s good faith judgment,  reduced by an amount exceeding $1,000,000 (net of insurance proceeds), then  Parent may terminate this Agreement in its entirety without liability to  either party.   5.5 Other Actions.   (a) At least five (5) days prior to Closing, Parent shall prepare a  draft Form 8-K announcing the Closing, together with, or incorporating by  reference, the financial statements prepared by the Company and its  accountant, and such other information that may be required to be disclosed  with respect to the Merger in any report or form to be filed with the SEC  ("Merger Form 8-K"), which shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to the  Company and in a format acceptable for EDGAR filing. Prior to Closing,  Parent and the Company shall prepare the press release announcing the  consummation of the Merger hereunder ("Press Release"). Simultaneously with  the Closing, Parent shall file the Merger Form 8-K with the SEC and  distribute the Press Release.   (b) The Company and Parent shall further cooperate with each other and  use their respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken  all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary, proper or  advisable on its part under this Agreement and applicable laws to  consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby as  soon as practicable, including preparing and filing as soon as practicable  all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other  filings and to obtain as soon as practicable all consents, registrations,  approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained  from any third party (including the respective independent accountants of  the Company and Parent) and/or any Governmental Entity in order to  consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby.  This obligation shall include, on the part of Parent, sending a termination  letter to Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company ("Continental") in  substantially the form of Exhibit A attached to the Investment Management  Trust Agreement by and between Parent and Continental dated as of May 12,  2004. Subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information  and the preservation of any applicable attorney-client privilege,  work-product doctrine, self-audit privilege or other similar privilege,  each of the Company and Parent shall have the right to review and comment  on in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the other  on, all the information relating to such party that appears in any filing  made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any  Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other  transactions contemplated hereby. In exercising the foregoing right, each  of the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as  practicable.   43    5.6 Required Information. In connection with the preparation of the Merger Form 8-K and Press Release, and for such other reasonable purposes, the Company and Parent each shall, upon request by the other, furnish the other with all information concerning themselves, their respective directors, officers and stockholders (including the directors of Parent and the Company to be elected effective as of the Closing pursuant to Section 5.2 hereof) and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Merger, or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of the Company and Parent to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Each party warrants and represents to the other party that all such information shall be true and correct in all material respects and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.   5.7 Confidentiality; Access to Information.   (a) Confidentiality. Any confidentiality agreement previously executed  by the parties shall be superseded in its entirety by the provisions of  this Agreement. Each party agrees to maintain in confidence any non-public  information received from the other party, and to use such non-public  information only for purposes of consummating the transactions contemplated  by this Agreement. Such confidentiality obligations will not apply to (i)  information which was known to the one party or their respective agents  prior to receipt from the other party; (ii) information which is or becomes  generally known; (iii) information acquired by a party or their respective  agents from a third party who was not bound to an obligation of  confidentiality; and (iv) disclosure required by law. In the event this  Agreement is terminated as provided in Article VIII hereof, each party (i)  will return or cause to be returned to the other all documents and other  material obtained from the other in connection with the Merger contemplated  hereby, and (ii) will use its reasonable best efforts to delete from its  computer systems all documents and other material obtained from the other  in connection with the Merger contemplated hereby.   (b) Access to Information.   (i) Company will afford Parent and its financial advisors,  accountants, counsel and other representatives reasonable access  during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to the  properties, books, records and personnel of the Company during the  period prior to the Closing to obtain all information concerning the  business, including the status of product development efforts,  properties, results of operations and personnel of the Company, as  Parent may reasonably request. No information or knowledge obtained by  Parent in any investigation pursuant to this Section 5.7 will affect  or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained herein  or the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the  Merger.   44    (ii) Parent will afford the Company and its financial advisors,  underwriters, accountants, counsel and other representatives  reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable  notice, to the properties, books, records and personnel of Parent  during the period prior to the Closing to obtain all information  concerning the business, including the status of product development  efforts, properties, results of operations and personnel of Parent, as  the Company may reasonably request. No information or knowledge  obtained by the Company in any investigation pursuant to this Section  5.7 will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty  contained herein or the conditions to the obligations of the parties  to consummate the Merger.   (iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,  each party ("Subject Party") hereby agrees that by proceeding with the  Closing, it shall be conclusively deemed to have waived for all  purposes hereunder any inaccuracy of representation or breach of  warranty by another party which is actually known by the Subject Party  prior to the Closing.   5.8 Charter Protections; Directors\' and Officers\' Liability Insurance.   (a) All rights to indemnification for acts or omissions occurring  through the Closing Date now existing in favor of the current directors and  officers of Parent as provided in the Charter Documents of Parent or in any  indemnification agreements shall survive the Merger and shall continue in  full force and effect in accordance with their terms.   (b) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, Parent shall  cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors\' and  officers\' liability insurance maintained by Parent (or policies of at least  the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no  less advantageous) with respect to claims arising from facts and events  that occurred prior to the Closing Date.   (c) If Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates  with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or  surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or  conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any  Person, then, in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision  shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent assume the  obligations set forth in this Section 5.8.   (d) The provisions of this Section 5.8 are intended to be for the  benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Person who will have been a  director or officer of Parent for all periods ending on or before the  Closing Date and may not be changed without the consent of Committee  referred to in Section 1.16(a).   5.9 Public Disclosure. From the date of this Agreement until Closing or termination, the parties shall cooperate in good faith to jointly prepare all press releases and public announcements pertaining to this Agreement and the transactions governed by it, and no party   45   shall issue or otherwise make any public announcement or communication pertaining to this Agreement or the transaction without the prior consent of Parent (in the case of the Company and the Stockholders) or the Company (in the case of Parent), except as required by any legal requirement or by the rules and regulations of, or pursuant to any agreement of a stock exchange or trading system. Each party will not unreasonably withhold approval from the others with respect to any press release or public announcement. If any party determines with the advice of counsel that it is required to make this Agreement and the terms of the transaction public or otherwise issue a press release or make public disclosure with respect thereto, it shall, at a reasonable time before making any public disclosure, consult with the other party regarding such disclosure, seek such confidential treatment for such terms or portions of this Agreement or the transaction as may be reasonably requested by the other party and disclose only such information as is legally compelled to be disclosed. This provision will not apply to communications by any party to its counsel, accountants and other professional advisors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto agree that promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, Parent will file with the SEC a Current Report on Form 8-K pursuant to the Exchange Act to report the execution of this Agreement, with respect to which Parent shall consult with the Company. Unless objected to by the Company by written notice given to Parent within five (5) days after such filing specifying the language to which objection is taken, any language included in such Current Report shall be deemed to have been approved by the Company and may be used in other filings made by Parent with the SEC.   5.10 Reasonable Efforts.

ARTICLE VII   INDEMNIFICATION  ---------------   7.1 Indemnification of Parent and Company.

Great  Plains Pipeline et. al., District Court of Woods County, Oklahoma,  Case No. CJ-2002-70. (the "Great Plains Claim").   (b) As used in this Article VII, the term "Losses" shall include all  losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, orders, penalties,  settlements, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, interest,  penalties, court costs and reasonable legal fees and expenses) including  those arising from any demands, claims, suits, actions, costs of  investigation, notices of violation or noncompliance, causes of action,  proceedings and assessments whether or not made by third parties or whether  or not ultimately determined to be valid. Solely for the purpose of  determining the amount of any Losses (and not for determining any breach)  for which any party may be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Article  VII, any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement that is  qualified by a term or terms such as "material," "materially," or "Material  Adverse Effect" shall be deemed made or given without such qualification  and without giving effect to such words.   7.2 Indemnification of Third Party Claims. The indemnification obligations and liabilities under this Article VII with respect to actions, proceedings, lawsuits, investigations, demands or other claims brought against Parent by a Person other than the Company (a "Third Party Claim") shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:   (a) Notice of Claim. Parent, acting through the Committee, will give  the Representative prompt written notice after receiving written notice of  any Third Party Claim or discovering the liability, obligation or facts  giving rise to such Third Party Claim (a "Notice of Claim") which Notice of  Third Party Claim shall set forth (i) a brief description of the nature of  the Third Party Claim, (ii) the total amount of the actual out-of-pocket  Loss or the anticipated potential Loss (including any costs or expenses  which have been or may be reasonably incurred in connection therewith), and  (iii) whether such Loss may be covered (in whole or in part) under any  insurance and the estimated amount of such Loss which may be covered under  such insurance, and the Representative shall be entitled to participate in  the defense of Third Party Claim.   (b) Defense. The Representative shall have the right, at his option  (subject to the limitations set forth in subsection 7.2(c) below), by  written notice to Parent, to assume the entire control of, subject to the  right of Parent to participate (at its expense and with counsel of its  choice) in, the defense, compromise or settlement of the Third Party Claim  as to which such Notice of Claim has been given, and shall be entitled to   53    appoint a recognized and reputable counsel reasonably acceptable to Parent  to be the lead counsel in connection with such defense. If the  Representative is permitted and elects to assume the defense of a Third  Party Claim:   (i) the Representative shall diligently and in good faith defend  such Third Party Claim and shall keep Parent reasonably informed of  the status of such defense; provided, however, that in the case of any  settlement providing for remedies other than monetary damages for  which indemnification is provided, Parent shall have the right to  approve the settlement, which approval will not be unreasonably  withheld; and   (ii) Parent shall cooperate fully in all respects with the  Representative in any such defense, compromise or settlement thereof,  including, without limitation, the selection of counsel, and Parent  shall make available to the Representative all pertinent information  and documents under its control.   (c) Limitations of Right to Assume Defense. The Representative shall  not be entitled to assume control of such defense if (i) the Third Party  Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding,  action, indictment, allegation or investigation; (ii) the Third Party Claim  seeks an injunction or equitable relief against Parent; or (iii) there is a  reasonable probability that a Third Party Claim may materially and  adversely affect Parent other than as a result of money damages or other  money payments.   (d) Other Limitations. Failure to give prompt Notice of Claim or to  provide copies of relevant available documents or to furnish relevant  available data shall not affect the Representative\'s duty or obligations  under this Article VII, except to the extent (and only to the extent that)  such failure shall have adversely affected the ability of the  Representative to defend against or reduce the Stockholders\' liability or  caused or increased such liability or otherwise caused the damages for  which the Stockholders are obligated to be greater than such damages would  have been had Parent given the Representative prompt notice hereunder. So  long as the Representative is defending any such action actively and in  good faith, Parent shall not settle such action. Parent shall make  available to the Representative all relevant records and other relevant  materials required by them and in the possession or under the control of  Parent, for the use of the Representative and its representatives in  defending any such action, and shall in other respects give reasonable  cooperation in such defense.   (e) Failure to Defend. If the Representative, promptly after receiving  a Notice of Claim, fails to defend such Third Party Claim actively and in  good faith, Parent will (upon further written notice) have the right to  undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim  as it may determine in its reasonable discretion, provided that the  Representative shall have the right to approve any settlement, which  approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.   54    (f) Parent\'s Rights. Anything in this Section 7.3 to the contrary  notwithstanding, the Representative shall not, without the written consent  of Parent, settle or compromise any action or consent to the entry of any  judgment which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving  by the claimant or the plaintiff to Parent of a full and unconditional  release from all liability and obligation in respect of such action without  any payment by Parent.   (g) Representative Consent. Unless the Representative has consented to  a settlement of a Third Party Claim, the amount of the settlement shall not  be a binding determination of the amount of the Loss and such amount shall  be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow Agreement.   7.3 Insurance Effect. To the extent that any Losses that are subject to indemnification pursuant to this Article VII are covered by insurance, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the maximum recovery under such insurance; provided that Parent shall nevertheless be entitled to bring a claim for indemnification under this Article VII in respect of such Losses and the time limitations set forth in Section 7.4 hereof for bringing a claim of indemnification under this Agreement shall be tolled during the pendency of such insurance claim. The existence of a claim by Parent for monies from an insurer or against a third party in respect of any Loss shall not, however, delay any payment pursuant to the indemnification provisions contained herein and otherwise determined to be due and owing. If Parent has received the payment required by this Agreement from the Representative in respect of any Loss and later receives proceeds from insurance or other amounts in respect of such Loss, then it shall hold such proceeds or other amounts in trust for the benefit of the Stockholders and shall pay to the Representative, as promptly as practicable after receipt, a sum equal to the amount of such proceeds or other amount received, up to the aggregate amount of any payments received from the Escrow Account pursuant to this Agreement in respect of such Loss. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, it is the intention of the parties that no insurer or any other third party shall be (i) entitled to a benefit it would not be entitled to receive in the absence of the foregoing indemnification provisions, or (ii) relieved of the responsibility to pay any claims for which it is obligated.   7.4 Limitations on Indemnification.   (a) Survival: Time Limitation. The representations, warranties,  covenants and agreements in this Agreement or in any writing delivered by  the Company to Parent in connection with this Agreement (including the  certificate required to be delivered by the Company pursuant to Section  6.3(a)) shall survive the Closing until June 30, 2007 (the "Survival  Period"), except that the representations and warranties set forth in  Sections 2.14 and 2.16 shall not survive the Closing and any claims for  indemnification with respect to the warranties set forth in Sections 2.14  and 2.16 shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Sections 5.3  and 5.4. The indemnification and other obligations under this Article VII  shall survive for the same Survival Period and shall terminate with the  expiration of such Survival Period, except that: (i) any claims for breach  of representation or warranty made by a party hereunder by filing a demand  for arbitration under Section 10.12 shall be preserved until final  resolution thereof despite the   55    subsequent expiration of the Survival Period, (ii) any claims set forth in  a Notice of Claim sent prior to the expiration of such Survival Period  shall survive until final resolution thereof and (iii) any claim for  indemnification with respect to the Great Plains Claim shall survive until  same is fully adjudicated, settled, dismissed or otherwise resolved in its  entirety with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates.  Except as set forth in clause (ii) and (iii) above, no claim for  indemnification under this Article VII shall be brought after the end of  the applicable Survival Period.   (b) Deductible. No amount shall be payable under Article VII unless  and until the aggregate amount of all indemnifiable Losses otherwise  payable exceeds $1,000,000 (the "Deductible"), in which event the amount  payable shall only be the amount in excess of the amount of the Deductible.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Deductible shall not apply to  indemnifiable Losses arising out of the Great Plains Claim.   (c) Aggregate Amount Limitation. The aggregate liability for Losses  pursuant to Section 7.1 shall not in any event exceed the Escrow Shares,  and Parent shall have no claim against the Company\'s stockholders other  than for the Escrow Shares (and any proceeds of the Escrow Shares or  distributions with respect to the Escrow Shares).   7.5 Exclusive Remedy. Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the Closing, its sole remedy with respect to any and all claims for money damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be pursuant and subject to the requirements of the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VII. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing contained in this Article VII shall in any way impair, modify or otherwise limit Parent\'s or Company\'s right to bring any claim, demand or suit against the other party based upon such other party\'s actual fraud or intentional or willful misrepresentation or omission, it being understood that a mere breach of a representation and warranty, without intentional or willful misrepresentation or omission, does not constitute fraud.   7.6 Damages; No Adjustment to Merger Consideration. Amounts paid for indemnification under Article VII shall constitute damages paid by the Stockholders for breach of contract and not as an adjustment to the value of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued by Parent as a result of the Merger.   7.7 Representative Capacities; Application of Escrow Shares. The parties acknowledge that the Representative\'s obligations under this Article VII are solely as a representative of the Company\'s stockholders in the manner set forth in the Escrow Agreement with respect to the obligations to indemnify Parent under this Article VII and that the Representative shall have no personal responsibility for any expenses incurred by him in such capacity and that all payments to Parent as a result of such indemnification obligations shall be made solely from, and to the extent of, the Escrow Shares. Out-of-pocket expenses of the Representative for attorneys\' fees and other costs shall be borne in the first instance by Parent, which may make a claim for reimbursement thereof against the Escrow Shares upon the claim with respect to which such expenses are incurred becoming an Established Claim (as defined in the Escrow Agreement). The parties further acknowledge that all actions to be taken by Parent pursuant to this Article VII shall be taken on its behalf by the Committee in accordance with the   56   provisions of the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent, pursuant to the Escrow Agreement after the Closing, may apply all or a portion of the Escrow Shares to satisfy any claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article VII. The Escrow Agent will hold the remaining portion of the Escrow Shares until final resolution of all claims for indemnification or disputes relating thereto.

Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. Delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right.   10.12 Arbitration. Except with respect to pre-Closing disputes between the parties with respect to title and environmental issues, the procedures for resolution of which are set out in Section 5.4 as the exclusive means for resolving such disputes, any disputes or claims arising under or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Notice of a demand to arbitrate a dispute by either party shall be given in writing to the other at their last known address. Arbitration shall be commenced by the filing by a party of an arbitration demand with the American   67   Arbitration Association ("AAA").

In the event that preliminary or permanent injunctive relief is necessary or desirable in order to prevent a party from acting contrary to this Agreement or to prevent irreparable harm prior to a confirmation of an arbitration award, then either party is authorized and entitled to commence a lawsuit solely to obtain equitable relief against the other pending the completion of the arbitration in a court having jurisdiction over the parties. Each party hereby consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in the State of Oklahoma, Oklahoma or Tulsa County, for such purpose. All rights and remedies of the parties shall be cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies obtainable from arbitration.

(a) Except as stated on Schedule I-1, all wells on or constituting a  part of the Properties (the "Wells") have been in all material respects  drilled and (if completed) completed, operated and produced in accordance  with generally accepted oil and gas field practices and in compliance in  all material respects with applicable oil and gas leases and applicable  Laws. In all material respects, the Wells have been drilled and completed  within the limits permitted by contract, pooling or unit agreement. No Well  is subject to penalties on allowables because of any overproduction or any  other violation of applicable Laws that would prevent such Well from being  entitled to its full legal and regular allowable from and after the Closing  Date as prescribed by any Governmental Authority.   (b) With respect to the oil, gas and other mineral leases, unit  agreements, pooling agreements, communitization agreements and other  documents creating interests comprising the Properties, the Company has  fulfilled all requirements in all material respects for filings,  certificates, disclosures of parties in interest, and other similar matters  contained in (or otherwise applicable thereto by law) such leases or other  documents and is fully qualified to own such leases or other interests.   2.

Gas Balancing. Except as set forth on Schedule 1-4, the Company has no obligation to deliver gas (or cash in lieu thereof) from the Properties to other owners of interests or to gatherers, transporters or processors as a result of past production by the Company or its predecessors in excess of the share to which they were entitled.   5. Calls on Production. No Person has any call upon, option to purchase, or similar right to obtain production from the Properties at a price less than the prevailing price in the field.   6. Non-Competition Commitments. There are no agreements or arrangements that will be binding on the Company or the Properties after Closing that limit the freedom of the   71   owner of the Properties to compete in any line of business or with any Person or in any geographical area, except customary area of mutual interest provisions.   7. Production Sales Agreements. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.19(e), there are no agreements or arrangements for the sale of oil, gas or other minerals attributable to the Properties that may be not terminated at will without penalty by the Company after Closing on notice of sixty (60) days or less.   8.

There are no express obligations to drill additional wells in order to maintain in force and effect the rights of the Company in any Property other than customary provisions for the conduct of continuous drilling operations for the perpetuation of leases.   9. Compliance with Laws.

Permits. The Company has, and to the knowledge of the Company, each other Person who operates a Property has, obtained all permits, licenses, franchises, authorities, consents and approvals necessary for owning and operating the Properties and has made all material filings with all governmental bodies having jurisdiction necessary for owning and operating the Properties, and all such permits, licenses, franchises, authorities, consents, approvals and filings are in full force and effect.   12. [Intentionally Omitted.]   13. Preferential Rights of Purchase and Consents to Assignment. No material Property is subject to any preferential right of purchase, right of first refusal or other agreement that gives a third party the right to purchase a Property as a result of the Merger or requires the consent of any third party to consummate the Merger.   14. Status of Payout Accounts. Various of the Properties describe interests before a payout ("BPO") or after a payout ("APO"). Attached as Schedule I-14 is a schedule setting forth the status of the respective payout accounts described thereon, as of the dates stated   72   thereon.

Except as set forth in Schedule I-17, the Company is not a party to any contract or agreement with a seismic vendor. The Company is in possession of and has good title to the proprietary data described on Schedule I-17.   18. Previously Owned Properties. Except as set forth on Schedule I-18, the Company has no obligations or liabilities, contingent or otherwise, with respect to any properties previously owned or leased by the Company but not currently owned or leased.   19.
