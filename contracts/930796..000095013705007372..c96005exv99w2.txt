with the Certificate of Incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation, and (b) the officers of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall

their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.  
2.5 Effect on Company Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or any stockholder of the Company:   (a) each issued and outstanding
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub shall be
converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation;  
(b) each share of Company Capital Stock then held by the Company or any
wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company (or held in the Company\'s treasury)
shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor;   13    (c) each share of
Company Capital Stock then held by Parent or Merger Sub shall be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in

share of Company Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Company Class A Common
Stock canceled and retired in accordance with Sections 2.5(b) and (c) and any
Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive $24.00 in
cash per share, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). As of the
Effective Time, each share of Company Class A Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired, and each holder
of record of a certificate representing any such shares (a "Certificate")
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, other than the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, in accordance with Section 2.8.   (e)
each share of Company Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Company Class B Common
Stock canceled and retired in accordance with Sections 2.5(b) and (c) and any
Dissenting Shares) shall remain outstanding as one share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the rights set forth
in the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, as amended
pursuant to Section 2.2;   (f) Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, if required by the DGCL, but only to the extent
required thereby, shares of Company Capital Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by
holders of such shares of Company Capital Stock who have properly exercised
appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") will not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, and the holders of such Dissenting Shares
will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such shares of
Company Capital Stock in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262
of the DGCL unless and until such holders fail to perfect or effectively
withdraw or lose their rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If,
after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively
withdraws or loses such right, such shares of Company Capital Stock will
thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and
become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. The Company shall (i)
give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisals of shares of Company Capital Stock and (ii) consult with and keep
Parent informed, on an on-going basis, regarding the status and negotiation
of such demands. The Company shall not make any payment or settlement offer,
or agree to or effect any settlement, prior to the Effective Time with
respect to any such demand unless Parent shall have consented in writing to
such payment or settlement offer, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.   14    2.6 Company Stock Options. Not later than the earlier
of the time at which the Company gives notice of the transactions
contemplated hereby to its stockholders and the date that is 30 days prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall notify each holder of a Company Stock
Option, in writing, of the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance
with each Company Plan (the "Option Holder Notice"). Such Option Holder
Notice shall (a) apprise the holders of outstanding Company Stock Options of
their ability to exercise the Company Stock Options in accordance with the
applicable Company Plan prior to the Effective Time, (b) disclose that, if
not exercised, such Company Stock Options will terminate at the Effective
Time and (c) disclose that if any Company Stock Options are not exercised
prior to the Effective Time and terminate as contemplated in clause (b), the
holders of such Company Stock Options will be entitled to receive the Option
Consideration (as defined below) in respect of such Company Stock Options. As
of the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Stock Option shall be
terminated by virtue of the Merger and each holder of a Company Stock Option
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, other than the right to
receive, in respect of each such terminated Company Stock Option, a special
bonus per Company Stock Option (without interest and subject to the deduction
and withholding of such amounts as the Surviving Corporation is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law) in cash equal
to $24 minus the exercise price for such Company Stock Option (the
"Option Consideration"). Payment of the Option Consideration to each of the
holders of Company Stock Options entitled thereto shall be made by the
Surviving Corporation, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
as soon as practicable after the Effective Time. Any amounts withheld and
paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by the Surviving Corporation
will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the Company Stock Option in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding was made. The Company shall take all actions required under each
Company Plan under which such Company Stock Options were granted to cause
such Company Plan and all Company Stock Options granted thereunder to
terminate at the Effective Time.   2.7 Adjustment of the Merger
Consideration. In the event that, prior to the Effective Date, any stock
split, combination, reclassification or stock dividend with respect to the
Company Capital Stock, any change or conversion of Company Capital Stock into
other securities or any other dividend or distribution with respect to the
Company Capital Stock (other than regular quarterly dividends) should occur
or, if a record date with respect to any of the foregoing should occur,
appropriate and proportionate adjustments shall be made to the Merger
Consideration, and thereafter all references to the Merger Consideration
shall be deemed to be to the Merger Consideration as so adjusted.   2.8
Exchange Procedures; Stock Transfer Books.   (a) Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to
the Company to act as paying and exchange agent hereunder (the "Paying
Agent"). Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying
Agent cash in an amount necessary to pay all of the Merger Consideration.
Such amount shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund."   (b)
As soon as reasonably practicable (and in no event more than three business
days) after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall send to each Person
who was, at   15   the Effective Time, a holder of record of Certificates
(i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions
as Parent may reasonably specify (including (A) a provision confirming that
delivery of Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates to the
Paying Agent, and (B) a form of certification by the Person executing such
letter of transmittal to the effect that either (1) such Person is not
"foreign" for purposes of Sections 897 and 1445 of the Code or (2) such
Person has not owned, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the outstanding
Company Capital Stock at any time during the five years preceding the
Effective Time), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate to the Paying Agent, together with a duly executed letter of
transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the
Paying Agent or Parent, (A) the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the applicable Merger Consideration, and (B)
the Certificates so surrendered shall be canceled. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.8, each Certificate shall be deemed, from and
after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this Section 2. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment of any portion of the Merger
Consideration, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a
bond (in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any
claims that may be made against the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate.   (c) If any Merger
Consideration is to be paid to any Person other than the registered holder of
the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition to
such exchange that such surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed
and otherwise in proper form for transfer and such Person either (i) shall
pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of
the distribution of such cash payment to such Person, or (ii) shall establish
to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such tax has been
paid or is not applicable. Parent or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Class A Common Stock such
amounts as Parent or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by Parent or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of
Company Class A Common Stock in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made by Parent or the Paying Agent. All amounts in
respect of taxes received or withheld by Parent shall be disposed of by
Parent in accordance with the Code or such state, local or foreign tax law,
as applicable.   (d) As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company Class
A Common Stock (other than shares of Company Class A Common Stock to be
canceled and retired in accordance with Sections 2.5(b) and (c) and any
Dissenting Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of any such shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the Merger Consideration upon surrender of the Certificate representing such
shares in accordance with this Section 2.8. The Merger Consideration paid
upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this  
16    Section 2.8 shall be deemed to have been delivered (and paid) in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company Class A Common
Stock previously represented by such Certificates.   (e) At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of the
Company\'s capital stock on the records of the Company.   (f) The Paying
Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund in liquid debt
securities rated AA or higher by at least two nationally-recognized rating
agencies; provided, that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the
amounts payable to the Company\'s stockholders pursuant to this Section 2.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall promptly
be paid to Parent.   (g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to holders of Certificates as of the date 180 days
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any
holders of Certificates who have not theretofore surrendered their
Certificates in accordance with this Section 2.8 shall thereafter look only
to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for any portion of the Merger
Consideration.   (h) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall
be liable to any holder or former holder of Company Class A Common Stock or
to any other Person with respect to any portion of the Merger Consideration
(or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or for any cash
amounts, properly delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property law, escheat law or similar Legal Requirement.   2.9
Further Assurances. If at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale,
assignments or assurances or any other acts or things are
necessary, desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or

assets of either the Company or Merger Sub, or (b) otherwise to carry out the

necessary, desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm its right, title
or interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers,
franchises, properties or assets of the Company or Merger Sub, as applicable,

shares of capital stock or other voting securities of the Company are issued,
reserved for issuance or outstanding and no shares of capital stock or other
voting securities of the Company will be issued or become outstanding after

available through EDGAR, are, collectively, the "Company SEC Reports" and, to
the extent available in full without redaction on the SEC\'s website through
EDGAR two days prior to the date of this Agreement, are, collectively, the
"Filed Company SEC Reports"), (vi) all certifications and statements required
by (x) the SEC\'s Order dated June 27, 2002 pursuant to Section 21(a)(1) of
the Exchange Act (File No. 4-460), (y) Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the
Exchange Act, or (z) 18 U.S.C. Section 1350 (Section 906 of the Sarbanes-

(ii) above (collectively, the "Certifications"), and (vii) all comment
letters received by the Acquired Corporations from the Staff of the SEC since

the Acquired Corporations. The Company SEC Reports (x) were or will
be prepared in all material respects in accordance with the requirements of
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules
and regulations thereunder and (y) did not at the time they were filed with
the SEC, or will not at the time they are filed with the SEC, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The Certifications are each true and correct. Except as set forth
on Schedule 3.4, no Subsidiary of the Company is or has been required to file
any form, report, registration statement or other document with the SEC. The
Acquired Corporations maintain disclosure controls and procedures required by
Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act; such controls and procedures
are designed to ensure that all material information concerning the Acquired
Corporations is made known on a timely basis to the individuals responsible
for the preparation of the Company\'s filings with the SEC and other public
disclosure documents. The Company has delivered to Parent copies of all
written descriptions of, and all policies, manuals and other documents
promulgating, such disclosure controls and procedures. The Company is in
compliance with the applicable listing rules of The American Stock Exchange
and has not since January 1, 2003 received any notice from The American Stock
Exchange asserting any non-   21   compliance with such rules. To the
Company\'s knowledge, each director and executive officer of the Company has
filed with the SEC on a timely basis all statements required by Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder since January 1,
2003. As used in this Section 2.4, the term "file" shall be broadly construed
to include any manner in which a document or information is furnished,
supplied or otherwise made available to the SEC (regardless of whether public
or confidential).   3.5 Financial Statements. The financial statements and
notes contained or incorporated by reference in the Company SEC Reports
fairly present the financial condition and the results of operations, changes
in stockholders\' equity and cash flow of the Acquired Corporations as at the
respective dates of and for the periods referred to in such financial
statements; all of such statements and notes have been prepared in accordance
with GAAP and Regulation S-X of the SEC, subject, in the case of interim
financial statements, to normal recurring year-end adjustments (the effect of
which will not, individually or in the aggregate, be materially adverse) and
the omission of notes to the extent permitted by Regulation S-X of the SEC
(that, if presented, would not differ materially from notes to the financial
statements included in the most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K included in
the Filed Company SEC Reports (the consolidated balance sheet included in
such Annual Report is the "Balance Sheet")); the financial statements
referred to in this Section 3.5 reflect the consistent application of such
accounting principles throughout the periods involved, except as disclosed in
the notes to such financial statements. No financial statements of any Person
other than the Acquired Corporations are required by GAAP to be included in
the consolidated financial statements of the Company. Schedule 3.5 contains a
description of all non-audit services performed by the Company\'s auditors
for the Acquired Corporations since the beginning of the immediately
preceding fiscal year of the Company and the fees paid for such services; all
such non-audit services were approved as required by Section 202 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Acquired Corporations maintain a system of
internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance
that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with management\'s general
or specific authorizations, (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to
maintain asset accountability, (iii) access to assets is permitted only in
accordance with management\'s general or specific authorization and (iv) the
recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at
reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences. Schedule 3.5 lists, and the Company has delivered to Parent
copies of, the documents creating or governing all of the Acquired
Corporations\' Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. The corporate records and
minute books of the Acquired Corporations have been maintained in accordance
with all applicable Legal Requirements and are complete and accurate in all
material respects. Financial books and records and accounts of the Acquired
Corporations used in preparation of the Acquired Corporations\' financial
statements: (x) have been maintained in accordance with good business
practices on a basis consistent with prior years, (y) are stated in
reasonable detail and reflect the transactions of the Acquired Corporations
in all material respects and (z) reflect the basis for the Company\'s
consolidated financial statements in all material respects.   3.6 Property;

constitute a material default by any Acquired Corporation or the other
parties thereto.   (j) Schedule 3.8(j) lists each parcel of real property

or otherwise disposed of by any Acquired Corporation since January 1,

have been made by any Acquired Corporation to any Governmental Body, utility
company, school board, church or other religious body or any homeowners\'
association or any other Person relating to any of the Properties which would

material amount of money or land or to construct, install or maintain, at a
material cost to the Acquired Corporations, any improvements of a public or
private nature on or off the real estate comprising any of the
Properties.   3.9 Intellectual Property.   (a) The Acquired Corporations

loans and advances made by any of the Acquired Corporations to any employee,
director, consultant or independent contract, other than routine travel and

any of its Subsidiaries is party or by which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets are bound. Parent and each of
its Subsidiaries are duly qualified to do business as foreign corporations or
limited liability companies, as the case may be, and are in good standing
under the laws of each state or other jurisdiction in which either the
ownership or use of the properties owned or used by them, or the nature of
the activities conducted by them, requires such qualification, except where
the failure to be so qualified would not be reasonably likely
to, individually or in the aggregate, adversely affect Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in any material respect.   4.2 Authority;
No Conflict.   (a) Parent has all necessary limited liability company
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the other
agreements referred to in this Agreement, to perform its obligations
hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the Contemplated Transactions. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and the consummation by
Parent of the Contemplated Transactions have been duly and validly authorized
by all necessary limited liability company and member action and no other
limited liability company or member proceedings on the part of Parent or its
members are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions (other than, with respect to the Merger, the filing
of appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL). This Agreement has
been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent, enforceable against Parent in
accordance with its terms.   40    (b) Neither the execution and delivery
of this Agreement nor the consummation of any of the Contemplated
Transactions do or will, directly or indirectly (with or without notice or
lapse of time or both), (i) contravene, conflict with, or result in a
violation of (A) any provision of the Organizational Documents of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries, or (B) any resolution adopted by manager or the
members of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) contravene, conflict with
or result in a violation of, or give any Governmental Body or other Person
the right to exercise any remedy or obtain any relief under, any Legal
Requirement or any order, writ, injunction or decree to which Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries, or any of the assets owned or used by Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, is or may be subject; (iii) contravene, conflict with or
result in a violation of any of the terms or requirements of, or give any
Governmental Body the right to revoke, withdraw, suspend, cancel, terminate
or modify, any Governmental Authorization that is held by Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, or that otherwise relates to the business of, or any of the
assets owned or used by, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries; (iv) cause Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries to become subject to, or to become liable for the
payment of, any Tax; (v) cause any of the assets owned by Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries to be reassessed or revalued by any Taxing Authority or
other Governmental Body; (vi) contravene, conflict with or result in a
violation or breach of any provision of, or give any Person the right to
declare a default or exercise any remedy under, or to accelerate the maturity
or performance of, or to cancel, terminate or modify, any Contract to which
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is party or by which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets are bound; (vii) require
a Consent from any Person; or (viii) result in the imposition or creation of
any Encumbrance upon or with respect to any of the assets owned or used by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in the case of clauses (ii),
(iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii) and (viii), for any such contraventions,
conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences that would not
prevent or materially delay consummation of the Merger or otherwise prevent
Parent from performing any of its obligations under this Agreement, and could
not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, adversely
affect Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in any material
respect.   4.3 Information Supplied for Proxy Statement and Schedule

for nonpublic information relating to any of the Acquired Corporations
(including the identity of the Person making or submitting such Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest or request, and the terms thereof)

the request of Parent. The Company also will promptly request each Person
that has executed, within 18 months prior to the date of this Agreement, a

information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of any of the
Acquired Corporations.   5.4 Financing. The Company shall provide such

terminated prior to the Closing, subject to Section 11.16.   5.5 Company

copy of the Option Holder Notice prior to its delivery to the holders

substance reasonably acceptable to Parent. The Company shall take all actions
required under each Plan under which Company Stock Options were granted to
cause such Plan and all Company Stock Options granted thereunder to terminate
at the Effective Time.   5.6 Mailing Notice. Not later than 10 days prior
to the date on which the Company intends to mail the Proxy Statement to its

or a statement to the effect that the Board of the Company has determined and
believes that the Merger is in the best interests of the Company\'s
stockholders, the Company may provide written notice of such intention (the
"Mailing Notice") to Parent, which Mailing Notice, if given, shall constitute
a covenant of the Company to commence mailing such Proxy Statement to its
stockholders on or about the date specified in the Mailing Notice, which date
shall be not more than five business days following the date on which Parent
delivers the Commitment Letter to the Company. Parent shall deliver to the
Company the Commitment Letter or Replacement Commitment Letter, if
applicable, not later than seven days following the date on which Parent

in definitive form but for information to be provided by, or regarding,
Parent, then the Company may notify Parent of such deficiency and its intent
to commence mailing of the Proxy Statement once it receives the requisite
information from Parent, in which case, such notice shall constitute a
"Mailing Notice" for purposes of this Agreement.   5.7 Agreements Among
Parent, Merger Sub and Hammons Affiliates. Parent and Merger Sub will not
enter into any agreements, arrangements or understandings with any of the
Hammons Affiliates during the Pre-Closing Period, nor amend, modify or
otherwise alter any of the Hammons Agreements, in each case without the prior
approval of the Special Committee, which approval will not be withheld
unless, in the reasonable opinion of the Special Committee,   49   after
consultation with the Special Committee\'s outside legal counsel, the Special
Committee concludes that failing to withhold such approval would
be inconsistent with the fiduciary obligations of the Special Committee
under applicable Legal Requirements.   Section 6. Additional Covenants of

inform Parent, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request by
the SEC for the amendment of the Proxy Statement or comments thereon and
responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information, and will

its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other
hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement, the Merger or any other filings in
connection herewith or therewith and will consult with Parent in connection
therewith. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information
relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so
that any of such document would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the

subpoena or otherwise in connection with any threatened, pending or completed
claim, action, suit, proceeding, arbitration or alternative
dispute resolution mechanism, investigation, inquiry, administrative hearing,
appeal or any other actual, threatened or completed proceeding, whether
brought in the right of a Covered Party (as defined below) or otherwise and
whether of a civil (including intentional or unintentional tort claims),
criminal, administrative, arbitrative or investigative nature (each, an
"Indemnification Event") by reason of the fact that such person is now, or
has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (the "Covered Parties"), from (x) any and all direct and
indirect fees and costs, retainers, court costs, transcript costs, fees of
experts, witness fees, travel expenses, duplicating, printing and binding
costs, telephone charges, postage and delivery service fees and all other

whatsoever incurred by such Covered Party in connection with or arising from
any Indemnification Event arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the
Covered Party is or was an officer or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (including the taking of any action or the failure to take any
action as a director or officer of any Acquired Corporation in connection
with the Contemplated Transactions), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the Effective Time. Each Covered Party will be entitled, subject to
applicable Legal Requirements, to advancement of expenses incurred in the
defense of or other participation in any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation from each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation within ten
business days of receipt by Parent or the Surviving Corporation from the
Covered Party of a request therefor; provided, that any person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, to the extent required by the
DGCL, to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person
is not entitled to indemnification.   53    (b) The Organizational
Documents of the Surviving Corporation shall contain, and Parent shall cause
the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation to so contain,
provisions no less favorable to the Covered Parties with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and
former directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries than are
presently set forth in the Organizational Documents of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.   (c) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation
or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its stock, properties or assets to any Person, then, and

assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 6.5.   (d) The Company

Contemplated Transactions or the Hammons Transactions. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, neither Parent nor the Company shall, and shall
not permit any of its Representatives to, make any disclosure regarding the

in good faith, after taking into account the advice of its outside legal
counsel, that such disclosure is required by applicable
Legal Requirements.   6.7 Resignation of Officers and Directors. The

Commitment Letter that are within its control and to obtain the funding
contemplated by the Commitment Letter on the terms contained therein. If the
Commitment Letter is terminated prior to the Effective Time or the funding
contemplated thereby shall not otherwise be available at the Effective Time,
Parent shall use its best efforts consistent with prudent business judgment
to find alternative financing and enter into a written commitment or
commitments reflecting such alternative financing (the "Replacement
Commitment Letter") in form and substance that is not less favorable in any
material respect to Parent, Merger Sub and the Acquired Corporations (from
and after the Effective Time) to that provided in the Commitment Letter and
otherwise reasonably acceptable to the Company, which Replacement Commitment
Letter shall be delivered to the Company and the Special Committee promptly
following execution by the parties thereto. Parent shall promptly disclose to
the Company and the Special Committee any amendment, termination or
cancellation of the Commitment Letter or Replacement Commitment Letter or any

are to be satisfied on the Closing Date) shall have been satisfied (the later
of the dates set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) is referred to herein as the

the date on which the Parent Affiliates cease to pursue in good faith a Legal
Proceeding seeking to enforce the Hammons Agreements;
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, no party may

termination;   (c) by either Parent or the Company by notice to the other
if a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Body shall have

such party to perform any material obligation required to be performed by
such party as of or prior to the proposed date of termination;   (e) by
Parent by notice to the Company (at any time prior to the adoption of this
Agreement by the Required Company Stockholder Vote or, if the Minority

compliance with Section 5.3 shall not be considered for purposes of this
Section 10.1(f) to the extent that it has not resulted in,   59    or

for a Superior Proposal, an offer from Parent that the Board of the Company,
in its good faith judgment, after consultation with its financial and legal

Class A Common Stock as the Superior Proposal; provided, that during such
72-hour period, the Company shall negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the
extent Parent wishes to negotiate) to enable Parent to make such an offer;
provided, however, that any such purported termination pursuant to this
Section 10.1(f) shall be void and of no force or effect unless the Company,
prior to the time of, and as a condition to the effectiveness of, such
termination pays to Parent the amounts required pursuant to Section 10.3;

forth in Section 8.1 would not be satisfied, or (iii) any of the Company\'s
covenants contained in this Agreement shall have been breached, such that the

consummation of the Hammons Transactions other than by reason of a voluntary
termination of the Transaction Agreement by the Parent Affiliates (if this
Agreement is terminated at a time at which it may be terminated under

to have been terminated under this Section 10.1(j)); or   (k) by either
Parent or the Company if the Transaction Agreement shall have been terminated
by any of the Hammons Affiliates pursuant to Section 6.1(a)(iii) of the

this Section 10.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions shall be paid by the party

forms relating to the Merger under the HSR Act and the filing of any notice
or other document under any applicable foreign antitrust law or

pursuant to Section 10.1(b) (unless the Extended Outside Date means a date

of this Agreement and, in the case of this clause (E), at or prior to the
time of the termination of this Agreement, an Acquisition Proposal shall have
been disclosed, announced, commenced, submitted or made, then the Company
shall pay to Parent, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 10.3(g),
an amount equal to the lesser of (x) $8,000,000 and (y) the aggregate amount
of the fees and expenses (including all attorneys\' fees, accountants\' fees,

printing and mailing expenses) that have been paid or that become payable by
or on behalf of Parent in connection with the preparation, negotiation and
enforcement of this Agreement and otherwise in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions or its consideration of the Contemplated
Transactions (the "Parent Expenses"). The Company shall deliver, within two
business days following the date on which notice of termination is given,
instructions to the Escrow Agent to pay any fee payable to Parent by
the Company pursuant to this Section 10.3(a)(ii) through a distribution of
the Expense Amount to Parent from   61    the Expense Amount Escrow
Account. The excess of the Expense Escrow Amount over the aggregate amount of
the Parent Expenses shall be distributed by the Escrow Agent to the Company

Parent of the Parent Expenses from the Expense Amount Escrow Account pursuant
to the preceding sentence.   (b) In addition to any amounts payable to
Parent pursuant to Section 10.3(a), and subject to the limitations set forth
in Section 10.3(g), the Company shall pay to Parent an amount equal to
$4,000,000 if this Agreement is terminated as follows:   (i) by Parent or
the Company pursuant to Section 10.1(d) if, following the date of this
Agreement and at or prior to the time of the termination of this Agreement,
an Acquisition Proposal (x) shall not have been disclosed, announced,
commenced, submitted or made, or (y) shall have been disclosed, announced,
commenced, submitted or made and the Company has rejected such Acquisition
Proposal; or   (ii) by Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 10.1(j).   (c) In addition to any amounts payable to Parent
pursuant to Section 10.3(a), the Company shall pay to Parent an amount equal
to $15,000,000, but in each case, minus any amount paid to Parent pursuant to
Section 10.3(b), and subject to the limitations set forth in Section 10.3(g),
if this Agreement is terminated as follows:   (i) by Parent pursuant to
Section 10.1(e) or by the Company pursuant to Section 10.1(f);   (ii) by
Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 10.1(b) or pursuant to Section
10.1(d) if, following the date of this Agreement and at or prior to the time
of the termination of this Agreement, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been
disclosed, announced, commenced, submitted or made, and (x) the Company has
rejected such Acquisition Proposal and, within 18 months of the date of
termination of this Agreement, the Company consummates or enters into an
agreement to consummate or otherwise approves, accepts or publicly announces
an Acquisition Transaction with the party that made such rejected Acquisition
Proposal (or any of its Affiliates), or (y) the Company shall not have
rejected such Acquisition Proposal;   (iii) by (x) the Company after the
Extended Outside Date pursuant to Section 10.1(b) (unless the Extended
Outside Date means a date earlier than the six month anniversary of the
Initial Expiration Date), or (y) Parent or the Company pursuant to Section
10.1(j) or Section 10.1(k) if, in any such case, within 18 months of the date
of termination of this Agreement, the Company consummates or enters into an
agreement to consummate or otherwise approves, accepts or publicly announces
an Acquisition Transaction.   (d) If this Agreement is terminated by the
Company pursuant to Section 10.1(h) or Section 10.1(i), then the Fee Amount
shall be distributed to the Company from the Fee Amount Escrow Account. If
this Agreement is terminated for any reason other than by the Company
pursuant to Section 10.1(h) or Section 10.1(i), then the Fee Amount shall be
distributed to Parent from the Fee Amount Escrow Account. The Fee Amount
shall secure all   62    of Parent\'s payment obligations pursuant to
this Section 10.3. The maximum aggregate liability of Parent under this
Section 10.3, or under any other circumstances if the Merger does not occur,
shall be equal to the Fee Amount.   (e) Any fee payable pursuant to this
Section 10.3 pursuant to a termination of this Agreement by the Company shall
be paid prior to the time of, and as a condition to the effectiveness of,
such termination (including, without limitation, any amount to be distributed
to Parent from the Expense Amount Escrow Account pursuant to Section
10.3(a)(ii)); provided, that any fee payable pursuant to Section 10.3(c)(ii)
or Section 10.3(c)(iii) shall be made prior to and as a condition to the
consummation of the applicable Acquisition Transaction. Parent shall deliver,
within two business days following the date on which notice of termination is
given, instructions to the Escrow Agent to pay any fee payable to the Company
by Parent pursuant to this Section 10.3 through a distribution of the Fee
Amount to the Company from the Fee Amount Escrow Account.   (f) The Company
acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 10.3 are an
integral part of the Contemplated Transactions and that, without these
agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the
Company fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 10.3,
and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit which results
in a judgment against the Company for any fee set forth in this Section 10.3,
the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys\' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate of interest as
most recently reported in The Wall Street Journal as of the date such payment
was required to be made.   (g) The maximum aggregate amount payable by the
Company to Parent pursuant to this Section 10.3, or under any other
circumstances if the Merger does not occur, shall not exceed $20,000,000.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Parent agrees
that, at any time prior to the delivery of the Commitment Letter or the
Replacement Commitment Letter to the Company, any payment obligations of the
Company to Parent pursuant to this Section 10.3, or under any other
circumstances if the Merger does not occur, shall not exceed in the aggregate
$3,000,000.   Section 11. Miscellaneous Provisions.   11.1 Amendment. This
Agreement may be amended only by an instrument in writing signed by the
Company, Merger Sub and Parent at any time (whether before or after adoption

Boards of Directors of the Company and Merger Sub and (ii) after adoption of
this Agreement by the Company\'s stockholders, no amendment shall be made

Company without the further approval of such stockholders.   11.2
Waiver.   (a) Neither any failure nor any delay by any party in exercising
any right, power or privilege under this Agreement or any of the documents
referred to in this   63    Agreement will operate as a waiver of such
right, power or privilege and no single or partial exercise of any such
right, power or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such
right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (i) no claim or
right arising out of this Agreement or any of the documents referred to in
this Agreement can be discharged by one party, in whole or in part, by a
waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the
other party; (ii) no waiver that may be given by a party will be applicable
except in the specific instance for which it is given; and (iii) no notice to
or demand on one party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of

further action without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the
documents referred to in this Agreement.   (b) At any time prior to the
Effective Time, Parent (with respect to the Company) and the Company (with
respect to Parent and Merger Sub), may, to the extent legally allowed, (i)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts
of such party to this Agreement, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representation and warranties contained in this Agreement or any document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement and (iii) waive compliance with any
covenants, obligations or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any

waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on
behalf of such party.   11.3 No Survival. None of the representations and
warranties, or any covenant to be performed prior to the Effective Time,
contained in this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time.   11.4 Entire
Agreement.   (a) This Agreement (including the documents relating to
the Merger referred to in this Agreement) and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties to this Agreement
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all other
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among or between
any of the parties with respect thereto.   (b) If there is any conflict
between the provisions of this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement,
the provisions of this Agreement shall supersede the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement.   11.5 Execution of Agreement; Counterparts;
Electronic Signatures.   (a) This Agreement may be executed in several
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which
shall constitute one and the same instrument, and shall become effective when
counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the
other parties; it being understood that all parties need not sign the same
counterpart.   (b) Notwithstanding the Electronic Signatures in Global
and National Commerce Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. 7001 et seq.), the Uniform
Electronic Transactions Act, or any other Legal Requirement relating to or
enabling the creation, execution, delivery or recordation   64    of
any contract or signature by electronic means, and notwithstanding any
course of conduct engaged in by the parties, no party shall be deemed to have
executed this Agreement or any other document contemplated by this Agreement
(including any amendment or other change thereto) unless and until such party
shall have executed this Agreement or such document on paper by a handwritten
original signature or any other symbol executed or adopted by a party with
current intention to authenticate this Agreement or such other document
contemplated.   11.6 Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by the
laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflicts of laws
principles.   11.7 Jurisdiction; Service of Process. Any action or
proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any right arising
out of, this Agreement shall be brought against any of the parties only in
the Courts of the State of Delaware or, if it has or can acquire
jurisdiction, in the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware, and each of the parties consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of
such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts) in any such action or
proceeding and waives any objection to venue laid therein. Process in any
action or proceeding referred to in the preceding sentence may be served on
any party anywhere in the world.   11.8 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY
