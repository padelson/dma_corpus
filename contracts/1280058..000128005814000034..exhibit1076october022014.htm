of Actual Working Capital or Actual Cash, the Sellers' Representative shall
provide written notice to Purchaser no later than 30 days following the
delivery by Purchaser to the Sellers' Representative of the calculation of
Actual Working Capital and Actual Cash (the "Dispute Notice"), setting forth
in reasonable detail those items that the Sellers' Representative disputes.
During the 30 day period following delivery of a Dispute Notice, Purchaser and
the Sellers' Representative shall negotiate in good faith with a view to
resolving their disagreements over the disputed items. During such 30 day
period and until the final determination of Actual Working Capital and/or
Actual Cash in accordance with this Section 2.5(c)(ii) or Section 2.5(c)(iii),
as the case may be (as so determined, or as

determined pursuant to Section 2.5(c)(i) above, "Final Working Capital" and
"Final Cash," respectively), the Sellers' Representative and its agents shall
be provided with such access to the financial books and records of the Company
Group and Purchaser as it may reasonably request to enable it to address all
matters set forth in any Dispute Notice. If the parties resolve their
differences over the disputed items in accordance with the foregoing
procedure, Final Working Capital and/or Final Cash shall be the amounts agreed
upon by them. If the parties fail to resolve their differences over the
disputed items within such 30 day period, then Purchaser and the Sellers'
Representative shall forthwith jointly request that a nationally recognized
independent public accounting firm as shall be mutually agreed by the
Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative (the "Accounting Arbitrator") make a
binding determination as to the disputed items in accordance with this
Agreement.

(iii) The Accounting Arbitrator will under the terms of its engagement have no
more than 30 days from the date of referral and no more than ten Business Days
from the final submission of information and testimony by Purchaser and the
Sellers' Representative within which to render its written decision with
respect to the disputed items (and only with respect to any unresolved
disputed items set forth in the Dispute Notice) and the final calculation of
Actual Working Capital and/or Actual Cash shall be based solely on the
resolution of such disputed items. The Accounting Arbitrator shall review such
submissions and base its determination solely on such submissions. In
resolving any disputed item, the Accounting Arbitrator may not assign a value
to any item greater than the maximum value for such item claimed by either
party or less than the minimum value for such item claimed by either party.
The decision of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be deemed final and binding
upon the parties and enforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction and
the Accounting Arbitrator's final calculation of Actual Working Capital shall
be deemed the Final Working Capital and/or the Accounting Arbitrator's final
calculation of Actual Cash shall be deemed the Final Cash. The fees and
expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be allocated to be paid by
Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Sellers' Representative (on behalf of the
Sellers), on the other, based upon the percentage that the portion of the
contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the amount actually
contested by such party, as determined by the Accounting Arbitrator.

(d) Payment following Calculation of Final Working Capital and Final Cash.

(i) Following the determination of the Final Working Capital and the Final
Cash pursuant to Section 2.5(c), the Initial Purchase Price shall be
recalculated by substituting the Final Working Capital for the Estimated
Working Capital in Section 2.5(a), and the Final Cash for the Estimated Cash
in Section 2.5(a) (the "Adjusted Purchase Price") and if (after taking into
account any Upward Closing Working Capital Adjustment or Downward Closing
Working Capital Adjustment at the Closing):

(A) the Adjusted Purchase Price is greater than the Initial Purchase Price on
the Closing Date (any such excess, the "Surplus Amount"), then (1) the Working
Capital Escrow Amount plus the accrued interest thereon (the "Accrued
Interest") shall be released to the Sellers' Representative (for the benefit
of the Sellers pursuant to the Distribution Waterfall) and (2) Purchaser shall
pay to the Sellers' Representative (for the benefit of the Sellers pursuant to
the Distribution Waterfall)

| | 

|

18 

an amount equal to the Surplus Amount minus the Accrued Interest by wire
transfer of immediately available funds;

(B) the Initial Purchase Price on the Closing Date is greater than the
Adjusted Purchase Price (any such excess, the "Shortfall Amount"), then (1) an
amount equal to the Shortfall Amount plus the Accrued Interest on such
Shortfall Amount shall be paid to Purchaser from the Working Capital Escrow
Fund and then, to the extent the Working Capital Escrow Fund (after taking
into account such Accrued Interest) is insufficient for payment of the full
amount payable pursuant to this clause (B)(1), from the Indemnity Escrow Fund,
and then, to the extent the Indemnity Escrow Fund is insufficient, Purchaser
may seek recovery directly from the Sellers, and (2) the funds remaining (if
any) in the Working Capital Escrow Fund, after giving effect to clause (B)(1),
shall be released to the Sellers' Representative (for the benefit of the
Sellers pursuant to the Distribution Waterfall); and

(C) the Initial Purchase Price on the Closing Date is equal to the Adjusted
Purchase Price, then an amount equal to the Working Capital Escrow Amount plus
the Accrued Interest shall be released from the Working Capital Escrow Fund to
the Sellers' Representative (for the benefit of the Sellers pursuant to the
Distribution Waterfall).

(ii) All payments pursuant to this Section 2.5(d) shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in advance by
the Sellers' Representative or Purchaser, as applicable, and all such payments
and releases from the Working Capital Escrow Fund, as applicable, shall be
made on or prior to the 5th Business Day following: (A) the 30 day period
following Purchaser's delivery of the calculation of the Actual Working
Capital and Actual Cash pursuant to Section 2.5(b) if the Sellers'
Representative does not timely dispute either of such amounts pursuant to
Section 2.5(c)(i); (B) the date of the Sellers' Representative's and
Purchaser's mutual determination of Final Working Capital and Final Cash in
the event the Sellers' Representative timely disputes either of such amounts
pursuant to Section 2.5(c)(i) and the Sellers' Representative's and
Purchaser's differences are resolved without the engagement of an Accounting
Arbitrator pursuant to Section 2.5(c)(ii); and (C) the date of the Accounting
Arbitrator's determination of Final Working Capital and/or Final Cash pursuant
to Section 2.5(c)(iii) in the event the Sellers' Representative timely
disputes either of such amounts pursuant to Section 2.5(c)(i) and the Sellers'
Representative and Purchaser are unable to resolve their differences pursuant
to Section 2.5(c)(ii).

2.6 Purchase Price Allocation. Within 60 days of the determination of the
Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.5(d), Purchaser shall provide
Sellers' Representative with an allocation of the Adjusted Purchase Price paid
in respect of Units of the Company and the relevant portion of the liabilities
of the Company Group (plus other relevant items) to the assets of the Company
Group for all Tax purposes in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
Code (the "Purchase Price Allocation"). If within 10 days after the delivery
of the Purchase Price Allocation, Sellers' Representative notifies Purchaser
in writing that Sellers' Representative objects to the allocation set forth in
the Purchase Price Allocation, Purchaser, Sellers and Sellers' Representative
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute within 20
days. In the event that Purchaser and Sellers' Representative are unable to
resolve such dispute within 20 days, Purchaser and Sellers' Representative
shall engage an Accounting Arbitrator to resolve such dispute. Upon resolution
of the disputed items, the allocation reflected on the Purchase Price
Allocation shall be adjusted to reflect such resolution. The costs, fees and
expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be borne equally by Purchaser and
Sellers' Representative (on behalf of the Sellers). Purchaser, the Company
Group, and Sellers shall file all Tax Returns (including amended Tax returns
and claims for Tax refunds) and information reports in a manner consistent
with the Purchase Price Allocation.

effect on the ability of Bregal Seller to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the execution, delivery and performance by
Bregal Seller of this Agreement, the other agreements contemplated hereby and
the consummation of each of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
will not (a) violate, conflict with, result in any material breach of,
constitute a material default under, result in the termination or acceleration
of, create in any party the right to accelerate, terminate, modify or cancel,

to the Vista Blocker. Except as set forth in the attached "Blocker Taxes

by it, and all such Tax Returns were true and complete in all material
respects. All Taxes shown as payable by the Blocker on such Tax Returns have

(ii) has performed no activities other than activities directly related to its
investment in Units.

(d) The "Blocker Taxes Schedule" contains a list of all jurisdictions (whether

Authority in a jurisdiction where any the Blocker does not file Tax Returns
that it is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction, which remains
unresolved. To Bregal Blocker's Knowledge and Vista Blocker's Knowledge, no
Blocker has a permanent establishment in a jurisdiction where it does not
currently file Tax Returns.

ARTICLE 9 
ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS; COVENANTS AFTER CLOSING



9.1 Indemnification.

(a) Sellers' Indemnification.

(i) Subject to the other limitations in this Article 9, from and after the
Closing, each Seller (collectively, the "Seller Indemnitors"), severally and
not jointly, in proportion to the applicable percentage set forth on the
"Applicable Percentage Schedule," which shall be updated as necessary by the
Company prior to the Closing (the "Applicable Percentage"), agrees to
indemnify Purchaser and its Affiliates and their respective officers,
directors, employees, stockholders, agents and representatives (collectively,
the "Purchaser Indemnitees") in respect of any loss, liability, fine, penalty,
deficiency, damage or expense (including reasonable legal expenses and costs)
(a "Loss") which such Purchaser Indemnitee suffers solely as a result of:

(A) the breach by the Company of any representation or warranty contained in
Article 5 hereof;

(B) the breach by the Company of any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement required to be performed by the Company prior to Closing;

excess of the consideration received by such Seller pursuant to the
Distribution Waterfall or relating to any alleged action or failure to act on
its behalf by the Sellers' Representative;

(D) failure of the amounts set forth on the "Repaid Indebtedness Schedule" and
the "Transaction Expenses Schedule", each as funded by Purchaser at Closing
pursuant to Section 2.4, to be complete, accurate, true and correct in all
respects as of immediately prior to the Closing, to the extent such failure
results in Purchaser making or being required to make any payment or payments
in respect of Equity Interests in excess of the consideration that otherwise
would have been payable in respect thereof in accordance with this Agreement
had such items been so complete, accurate, true and correct in all respects as
of immediately prior to the Closing;

(E) Covered Taxes of the Company Group;

(F) failure by the Sellers' Representative to pay any amounts required to be

55 

Any amount payable to any Purchaser Indemnitee by any Seller Indemnitor for
indemnification under this Agreement shall be satisfied (i) first, from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund, and then (ii) second, directly from such Seller
Indemnitor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that sufficient funds
are available in the Indemnity Escrow Fund to cover the cost of any Losses
suffered or incurred by the Purchaser Indemnitees that are indemnifiable
pursuant to this Article 9, the Seller Indemnitors shall be jointly and
severally liable for such Losses without regard to their Applicable
Percentage.

(ii) Subject to the other limitations in this Article 9, from and after the
Closing, each of the Sellers, solely with respect to itself and not as to any
other Seller, agrees to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees and hold each
Purchaser Indemnitee harmless against any Loss which such Purchaser Indemnitee
suffers, solely as a result of:

(A) the breach by such Seller of any representation or warranty made by such
Seller contained in Article 6 hereof;

(B) the breach by such Seller of any covenant or agreement of such Seller
contained in this Agreement;

(C) in the case of the Bregal Seller, Covered Taxes of Bregal Blocker; and

(D) in the case of the Vista Seller, Covered Taxes of Vista Blocker.

(iii) For purposes of this Article 9, when determining whether there has been
any breach of any representation or warranty that is qualified or limited in
scope as to materiality, "Material Adverse Effect" or "material adverse
effect" contained therein or with respect thereto, and when determining the
amount of Losses suffered as a result of a breach of any representation or
warranty that is so qualified or limited, any such representation or warranty
shall be deemed to be made or given without such qualification or limitation.

(iv) Any claims by any Purchaser Indemnitee pursuant to this Article 9 must be
made in writing to the Sellers' Representative (in the case of Section
9.1(a)(i)) or to the applicable Seller Indemnitor (in the case of Section
9.1(a)(ii)) on or before the Survival Date, it being understood that so long
as such written notice is given on or prior to the Survival Date, such claim
shall continue to survive until such matter is resolved. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Survival Date" shall mean the date that is eighteen (18)
months following the Closing Date; provided, that (i) the Survival Date with
respect to the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 5.1, 5.2,
5.3, 5.4(a)(i), 5.18, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3(a)(i), 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, and 6.8
(collectively, the "Fundamental Representations") shall mean the fourth
anniversary of the Closing Date, (ii) the Survival Date with respect to the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 5.17 and 6.9
(collectively, the "Tax Representations") shall mean the date that is the 90th
day following the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to such
matters, and (iii) the indemnities set forth in Sections 9.1(a)(i)(B), (C),
(D), (E), (F), and (G) and in Sections 9.1(a)(ii)(B), (C) and (D) shall

|

56 

(v) The indemnification provided for in Sections 9.1(a)(i) and (ii) above is
subject to each of the following limitations:

(A) Except in the case of a breach of a Fundamental Representation or a Tax
Representation or willful fraud, the aggregate amount of all payments made by
the Seller Indemnitors in satisfaction of claims for indemnification pursuant
to Section 9.1(a)(i)(A) shall not exceed sixteen million Dollars ($16,000,000)
(the "General Indemnification Cap"); provided, that in no event (except in the
case of willful fraud) will any Seller Indemnitor be liable for any Losses of
the Purchaser Indemnitees in an amount in excess of the proceeds actually
received by such Seller Indemnitor on account of the sale by such Person of
its Equity Interests hereunder.

(B) None of the Seller Indemnitors shall be liable to indemnify the Purchaser
Indemnitees pursuant to Section 9.1(a)(i)(A) (other than for the breach of a
Fundamental Representation or a Tax Representation) unless and until such
Purchaser Indemnitee has collectively suffered Losses as a result of breaches
in excess of eight hundred thousand Dollars ($800,000) in the aggregate (the
"Indemnification Basket") (at which time the Seller Indemnitors shall only be
obligated to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees for Losses to the extent
exceeding the Indemnification Basket); provided that notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Seller Indemnitors shall not be liable to indemnify the
Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to Section 9.1(a)(i)(A), unless and until such
Purchaser Indemnitee has suffered aggregate Losses arising out of a claim in
excess of $10,000 (provided that any claim not exceeding such amount shall not
be aggregated to count towards the Indemnification Basket).

(C) Any indemnification under Section 9.1(a)(i)(A) and 9.1(a)(ii)(A) for
Losses in respect of Taxes shall be limited to such Losses incurred with
respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period; provided that the foregoing limitation
shall not apply with respect to Losses in respect of Taxes as a result of a
breach of a representation contained in Section 5.17(d), (e) or (f).

(b) [Intentionally Omitted]

(c) Indemnification Procedures.

(i) Any indemnified party making a claim for indemnification pursuant to
Section 9.1(a) (an "Indemnified Party") must give the Sellers' Representative
written notice of such claim (which such written notice shall state in
reasonable detail the nature and amount of such claim and the provisions of
this Agreement upon which such claim for indemnification is made) promptly
after the Indemnified Party receives any written notice of any action,
lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim (a "Proceeding") against or
involving the Indemnified Party by a third party or otherwise discovers the
liability, obligation or facts giving rise to such claim for indemnification;
provided that a failure to notify or delay in notifying the Sellers'
Representative will not relieve the indemnifying party (the "Indemnifying
Party") of its obligations pursuant to Section 9.1(a), except to the


 

--- 
| | 

|

57 

extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced as a result
thereof. The Indemnified Party shall keep the Indemnifying Party apprised of
any significant developments relating to any Proceeding or other claims for
indemnification.

(ii) With respect to the defense of any Proceeding by a third party against or
involving an Indemnified Party for which indemnification is provided in which
the third party seeks only the recovery of a sum of money that, together with
the other pending claims, is less than the then-remaining amount of the
Indemnity Escrow Fund, at its option the Indemnifying Party may assume the
defense of such Proceeding provided, that, prior to assuming control of such
defense, the Indemnifying Party must acknowledge in writing that the
Indemnifying Party would have an indemnification obligation for any Losses
resulting from such claim as provided under this Article 9. If the
Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense of such Proceeding, (A) the
Indemnifying Party shall not, in the defense of such Proceeding, consent to
entry of any judgment (other than a judgment of dismissal against the third
party claimant on the merits without costs) except with the written consent of
the Indemnified Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) and (B) the Indemnified Party, with counsel of its
choice shall be able to participate in the defense of any such Proceeding. The
fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the Indemnified
Party; provided that the Indemnifying Party shall pay the fees and expenses of
such separate counsel if representation of both the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party by the same counsel would create an actual conflict of
interest. In all cases, the Indemnified Party shall provide its reasonable
cooperation with the Indemnifying Party in the defense of claims or
litigation, including by making employees, information, and documentation
reasonably available.

(iii) If the Indemnifying Party shall not assume the defense of a Proceeding
pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(i), the Indemnified Party may defend against such
Proceeding in such manner as it reasonably deems appropriate; provided, that
(x) the Indemnified Party shall, to the extent permitted by law, permit the
Indemnifying Party to review any material communication given to it by, and
consult with the Indemnifying Party in advance of any meeting or conference
with, the claimant in such Proceeding or any Governmental Authority in
connection with such Proceeding and (y) if the Indemnified Party settles such
Proceeding without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Person (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), then the
amount of such settlement shall not be dispositive of Losses payable pursuant
to this Article 9.

(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of Section 9.8(c)(ii), and
not this Section 9.1(c), shall control with respect to all Proceedings with
respect to Taxes.

(d) Net Recovery; Mitigation. The amount of any Loss shall be net of any
amounts recovered by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates under insurance
policies, indemnities, reimbursement arrangements, or contracts (including
with respect to any breaches thereof) with respect to such Loss, offset by the
net present value of any resulting premium increases. The amount of any Loss
claimed by any Indemnified Party hereunder shall be reduced to the extent of
any net Tax savings or benefits actually realized by any Indemnified Party or
its Affiliates in the taxable year that includes or precedes the taxable
period in which payment is due in respect of such Loss, pursuant to this
Article 9, that is attributable to any deduction, loss, credit or other Tax
benefit, resulting from or arising out of such Loss. An Indemnified Party
shall be deemed to have "actually


 

--- 
| | 

|

58 

realized" a net Tax saving or benefit to the extent that, and at such time as,
the amount of Taxes paid by such Indemnified Party is reduced below the amount
of Taxes that such Person would have been required to pay but for the Tax
benefit. In computing the amount of any such net Tax saving benefit, an
Indemnified Party shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income,
gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any items arising from the
incurrence or payment in respect of the Loss for which indemnification is
provided under this Section 9.1. Any Loss under this Agreement shall be
determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts
giving rise to such Loss constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Seller Indemnitors shall have no
liability under this Agreement with respect to any matter to the extent the
expense, loss or liability comprising the Loss (or a part thereof) with
respect to such matter (i) has been taken into account in the determination of
Final Working Capital or Final Cash or (ii) arises out of changes after the
Closing Date in applicable laws, rules or regulations or interpretations
applicable thereto. The Indemnified Party shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, take all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss
upon becoming aware of any claim as to which indemnification may be sought
pursuant to this Section 9.1; provided, that nothing set forth in this Section
9.1(d) shall require any Indemnified Party to pursue payments from any
applicable insurance policies (after making the initial claim under such
policies) or recovery from third parties.

(e) Recoupment under the Escrow Agreement; Release of the Indemnity Escrow
Fund. From and after the Closing (but subject to the provisions of this
Article 9, including, without limitation, the provisions of Section
9.1(a)(iv)), any indemnification to which a Purchaser Indemnitee is entitled
under Section 9.1(a)(i)(A) as a result of any Loss (other than any Loss in
respect of a breach of a Fundamental Representation or a Tax Representation
after the date that is eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date (the
"General Survival Date")) shall be satisfied solely and exclusively by
recouping all of such Loss from the Indemnity Escrow Fund by such Purchaser
Indemnitee in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. On the
General Survival Date, Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative shall direct
the Escrow Agent to release to the Sellers' Representative (on behalf of the
Sellers) the then-remaining amount of the Indemnity Escrow Fund less the
aggregate amount of all Losses specified in any then-unresolved good faith
claims for indemnification.

(f) Payments. Any payment pursuant to a claim for indemnification shall be
made not later than 30 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Party of written
notice from the Indemnified Party stating the amount of the claim, unless the
claim is subject to defense as provided in Section 9.1(c) or is a dispute,
claim or controversy which is the subject of an unresolved arbitration
proceeding pursuant to Section 9.9, in which case payment shall be made not
later than 30 days after the amount of the claim is finally determined or any
such dispute is resolved.

(g) Exclusive Remedy. Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that
from and after the Closing, the indemnification provisions in this Section 9.1
shall be the exclusive remedy of the Purchaser Indemnitees with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, without limitation,
with respect to any environmental, health or safety matters and matters
arising under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act of 1980, as amended, or any other Environmental Laws) (except
for claims of willful fraud and disputes under Section 2.5, which disputes
under Section 2.5 will be resolved in accordance with the dispute resolution
mechanism set forth in Section 2.5). After the Closing Date, no party may seek
the rescission of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.


 

--- 
| | 

|

59 

(h) Subrogation. After any indemnification payment is made pursuant to this
Article 9, the Indemnifying Party shall, to the extent of such payment, be
subrogated to all rights (if any) of the Indemnified Party against any third
party in connection with the Losses to which such payment relates. Without
limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, any Indemnified Party
receiving an indemnification payment pursuant to the preceding sentence shall
execute, upon the written request of the Indemnifying Party, any instrument
reasonably necessary to evidence such subrogation rights.

9.2 Mutual Assistance. Each of the parties hereto agrees that they will
mutually cooperate in the expeditious filing of all notices, reports and other
filings with any Governmental Authority required to be submitted jointly by
any of the parties hereto in connection with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the other agreements contemplated hereby and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Subsequent to the Closing,
each of the parties hereto, at their own cost, will assist each other
(including by the retention of records and the provision of access to relevant
records) in the preparation of their respective Tax Returns and the filing and
execution of Tax elections, if required, as well as in the defense of any
audits or litigation that may ensue as a result of the filing thereof, to the
extent that such assistance is reasonably requested.

9.3 Press Release and Announcements; Confidentiality.

(a) The initial press release(s) regarding the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be jointly approved prior to the execution of this
Agreement. From and after the date hereof and prior to the Closing, the
parties hereto will not issue any press release with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise issue any written
public statements with respect to such transactions without the prior written
consent of the other party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by applicable law or
regulation, in which case the party making such disclosure will first provide
to the other party the text of the proposed disclosure, the reasons such
disclosure is required and the time and manner in which the disclosure is
intended to be made. Sellers' Representative and Purchaser agree to keep the
terms of this Agreement confidential, except to the extent required by
applicable law or for financial reporting purposes and except that the parties
may disclose such terms to their respective employees, accountants, advisors
and other representatives as necessary in connection with the ordinary conduct
of their respective businesses (so long as such Persons agree to or are bound
by contract to keep the terms of this Agreement confidential). Purchaser
acknowledges that, following the Closing or the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article 8, that certain letter agreement by and between Purchaser

provided, and may continue to provide after the date hereof (but no later than

Subsidiaries' executives and certain other employees with access to Vista's
Standard Operating Procedures ("VSOPs") (e.g., training materials labelled
"VSOP" or otherwise labelled Vista confidential information that is provided
through WatchDox or Huddle or at Vista sponsored conferences) and certain
other Confidential Information of Vista (the "Vista Confidential

other Vista Confidential Information by any person or entity other than such
Permitted Recipients, (iv) none of Purchaser, its Affiliates or their
respective directors, managers, officers, employees or agents shall request
access to the VSOPs or other Vista Confidential Information and (v) Purchaser

acknowledge and agree that certain information that may otherwise be part of
the VSOPs or Vista Confidential Information may be retained in the unaided

Subsidiaries, or any of their executives or employees, to have access to the

claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring

modify (in a manner adverse to the beneficiary thereof) any provision in the
Indemnification Agreements or in any member of the Company Group's articles of
incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents relating to the
exculpation or indemnification of any officers or directors, it being the

Representative with respect to all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs
and expenses (including attorney's fees and expenses), judgments, fines,
losses, and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or
threatened action, suit, claim, proceeding or investigation (each a "DandO
Claim") to the extent that any such DandO Claim is based on, or arises out of,
(a) the fact that such DandO Beneficiary is or was a director or officer of any
member of the Company Group at any time prior to the Closing Date or is or was
serving at the request of any member of the Company Group as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,

contemplated hereby or thereby in each case to the extent that any such DandO

claimed prior to, at or after the Closing Date. The provisions of this Section
9.7 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each

(c) Cooperation; Procedures Relating to Tax Claims.

Taxes and Tax Returns and (iii) the preparation of any financial statements to
the extent related to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention, and
(upon the other party's request) the provision, of records and information
which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other
proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder; provided, that the party requesting assistance shall pay the
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the party providing such
assistance; provided, further, no party shall be required to provide
assistance at times or in amounts that would interfere unreasonably with the
business and operations of such party.

(ii) Purchaser agrees to give written notice to Sellers' Representative, with
respect to the Company Group, and to the Vista Seller or Bregal Seller with
respect to the Vista Blocker or Bregal Blocker, respectively, of the receipt
of any written inquiries, audits, examinations or proposed adjustments by any
Taxing Authority with respect to Taxes and Tax Returns relating to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period (a "Tax Matter") within ten days of the
receipt of such notice; provided, that the failure to give such notice shall
not affect the indemnification obligations provided under Section 9.1 except
to the extent the indemnifying party has been materially prejudiced as a
result of such failure. Furthermore, the Sellers' Representative, Vista Seller
or Bregal Seller, as applicable, shall have the right to elect to control the
contest or resolution of any Tax Matter that relates solely to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period and for which Purchaser, the Company Group, Vista Blocker and
Seller Blocker, as applicable, either has no liability or is entitled to
indemnification under Section 9.1 from any Taxes under dispute in such Tax
Matter. The Purchaser shall have the right to participate in any such Tax

Tax Matter),


 

--- 
| | 

|

64 

and the Person controlling any such Tax Matter shall not settle any such
proceedings without the written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, of
Purchaser. If the Sellers' Representative, Vista Seller or Bregal Seller, as
applicable, elects not to control any such Tax Matter or is not entitled to
control such Tax Matter under this Section 9.8(c)(ii), then Purchaser shall
control such Tax Matter, provided, that (x) the Sellers' Representative, Vista
Seller or Bregal Seller, as applicable, shall have the right to participate in
any such Tax Matter (at its own expense), (y) Purchaser shall keep the
Sellers' Representative, Vista Seller or Bregal Seller, as applicable,
reasonably informed of the status of such Tax Matter (including by providing
copies of all written correspondence regarding such Tax Matter), and (z)
Purchaser shall not settle any such proceedings without the written consent,
not to be unreasonably withheld, of the Sellers' Representative Vista Seller
or Bregal Seller, as applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of
this Section 9.8(c)(ii) shall govern the audit of any Tax Return for, or any
other matter related to (including a breach of representations and warranties
related to Taxes), any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date
and for any Straddle Period.

(d) Tax Allocation; Straddle Period. To the extent permitted under applicable
law and to the extent necessary to cause such effect, each party hereto agrees
to, and agrees to cause its Affiliates to, elect for all Tax purposes to end
on the Closing Date (at the end of the Closing Date) all taxable periods of
the Vista Blocker, the Bregal Blocker and each member of the Company Group
beginning on or before the Closing Date. In the case of any taxable period
that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"),
the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income or receipts of the
Vista Blocker, the Bregal Blocker or the Company Group that are allocable to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the
books as of the Closing Date (it being understood, for avoidance of doubt,
that (i) any item of income, gain, loss or deduction attributable to amounts
accrued by the Company and/or its Subsidiaries on or before the Closing Date
and (ii) any item of income, gain, loss or deduction resulting directly from
or directly attributable to the transactions contemplated hereunder and
available under applicable law, shall in each case be deemed to occur in the
Pre-Closing Tax Period). For the foregoing purpose, (x) the taxable period of
the Company and any partnership or other pass-through entity in which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries holds a beneficial interest will be deemed
to terminate at such time and (y) no election for ratable allocation will be
made under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) or Section 706 of
the Code (or any similar provision of state, local, or foreign Tax law). The
amount of other Taxes of the Vista Blocker, the Bregal Blocker or the Company
Group for a Straddle Period which relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall
be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period.

(e) Taxes payable in respect of a Straddle Period ("Straddle Period Taxes")
and Transfer Taxes shall be timely paid, and all applicable filings, reports
and returns shall be filed, as provided hereunder and by applicable law. In
the event that a party pays any Straddle Period Tax or Transfer Tax that is to
be borne by another party (the "non-paying party") pursuant to this Agreement,
the paying party shall be entitled to reimbursement from the non-paying party
for the amount of such Straddle Period Taxes or Transfer Taxes that are to be
borne by such non-paying party in accordance with this Agreement. In the event
that any Straddle Period Taxes are paid by Bregal Blocker, to the extent such
Straddle Period Taxes are allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period pursuant to
Section 9.8(d), Bregal Seller shall be the non-paying party and reimbursement
for

|

65 

amounts paid with respect to such Taxes shall be satisfied first from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund, and second directly from Bregal Seller; and in the
event that any Straddle Period Taxes are paid by Vista Blocker, to the extent
such Straddle Period Taxes are allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period
pursuant to Section 9.8(d), Vista Seller shall be the non-paying party and
reimbursement for amounts paid with respect to such Taxes shall be satisfied
first from the Indemnity Escrow Fund, and second directly from Vista Seller.
In the event that any Straddle Period Taxes or Transfer Taxes are paid by the
Company Group, to the extent such Straddle Period Taxes are allocated to the
Pre-Closing Tax Period pursuant to Section 9.8(d) or such Transfer Taxes are
allocated to the Sellers pursuant to Section 9.6, the Sellers' Representative
shall be the non-paying party and reimbursement for amounts paid with respect
to such Taxes shall be satisfied from the Indemnity Escrow Fund. Upon payment
of any such Straddle Period Taxes or Transfer Taxes to the applicable Taxing
Authority, the paying party shall present a statement to the non-paying party
setting forth the amount of reimbursement to which the paying party is
entitled, together with such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to
calculate the amount to be reimbursed. The non-paying party shall make such
reimbursement promptly but in no event later than 30 days after the
presentation of such statement. Any payment not made within such time shall
bear interest at the rate of 8.00% for each day until paid. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, no party shall be entitled to indemnification
under Section 9.1 with respect to Straddle Period Taxes or Transfer Taxes that
have been reimbursed pursuant to this Section 9.8(e).

(f) Tax Refunds. Any refunds of Taxes with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period that are received by Purchaser, Bregal Blocker, Vista Blocker or the
Company Group after the Closing Date, (any such refund, a "Pre-Closing Tax
Refund"), shall be for the account of the Sellers, and Purchaser shall pay
over to Sellers' Representative for the benefit of the Sellers any such Pre-
Closing Tax Refund within fifteen (15) days after receipt thereof; provided,
that (i) to the extent any such Pre-Closing Tax Refunds are received with
respect to Bregal Blocker, such Pre-Closing Tax Refunds shall be for the
account of Bregal Seller; and (ii) to the extent any such Pre-Closing Tax
Refunds are received with respect to Vista Blocker, then such Pre-Closing Tax
Refunds shall be for the account of Vista Seller. Purchaser shall reasonably
cooperate with Sellers' Representative in obtaining such refunds, including
through the filing of amended Tax Returns or refund claims, it being
understood that (A) Purchaser shall not, and shall cause each of Bregal
Blocker, Vista Blocker and the Company Group not to waive any carryback of net
operating loss or other Tax attribute of any member of Bregal Blocker, Vista
Blocker or the Company Group generated or otherwise attributable to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period if such waiver would reduce the amount due to the Sellers
pursuant to this Section 9.8(f), (B) Purchaser, Bregal Blocker, Vista Blocker
and the Company Group will carryback any net operating losses for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period to prior taxable periods as allowable by applicable law and
shall claim Tax refunds as a result of such carryback (including through the
filing of amended Tax Returns), (C) any such Pre-Closing Tax Refunds will be
claimed in cash rather than as a credit against future Tax liabilities, (D)
Purchaser, Bregal Blocker, Vista Blocker and the Company Group shall
reasonably cooperate with Sellers in timely preparing and filing Tax Returns
(including amendments of prior Tax Returns and claims for refunds, including
claims for refunds on IRS Forms 1139 and/or 4466) for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period and for any Straddle Period, and (E) apportionment of any Pre-Closing
Tax Refund to the portion of a Straddle Period ending on and including the
Closing Date shall be determined in accordance with Section 9.8(d).

(g) Tax Elections. No party hereto nor any Affiliate thereof shall make an
election under Sections 336 or 338 of the Code or any similar provision of
foreign, state or local law in respect of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

(h) Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter. The Purchaser shall not take any
action or cause any action to be taken with respect to the Company subsequent
to the Closing that would cause the transactions contemplated hereby to
constitute part of a transaction that is the same as, or substantially similar
to, the "Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter" described in Internal Revenue
Service Notice 2001-16, 2001-1 C.B. 730, and Internal Revenue Service Notice
2008-20 I.R.B. 2008-6 (January 17, 2008), and Internal Revenue Service Notice
2008-111 I.R.B. 1299 (December 1, 2008).

(i) Purchase Price Adjustment. Any payments under this Agreement shall be
treated by all parties as adjustments to the Adjusted Purchase Price to the
extent permitted by applicable law.

9.9 Disputes; Arbitration Procedure.

(a) Except for any dispute, claim or controversy pursuant to Section 2.5,
Section 2.6 or Section 4.11, each of the parties hereto agrees that it will
attempt to settle any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of this
Agreement through good faith negotiations in the spirit of mutual cooperation
between senior business executives with authority to resolve the controversy.

(b) Except for any dispute, claim or controversy pursuant to Section 2.5,
Section 2.6 or Section 4.11, any dispute, claim or controversy that cannot be
resolved by the parties hereto through good faith negotiations within 30 days
of notification to the counter-party of the commencement of the dispute
resolution procedures of this Section 9.9 will then, upon the written request
of any party hereto, be resolved by binding arbitration conducted in
accordance with the then effective Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
American Arbitration Association by a panel of three arbitrators mutually
agreeable to the parties. If the parties cannot mutually agree upon the
selection, the arbitrators shall be selected in accordance with the rules of
the then effective Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association. To the extent not governed by such rules, such arbitrator shall
be directed by the parties to set a schedule for determination of such
dispute, claim or controversy that is reasonable under the circumstances. Such
arbitrator shall be directed by the parties to determine the dispute in
accordance with this Agreement and the substantive rules of law (but not the
rules of procedure or evidence) that would be applied by a federal court
required to apply the internal law (and not the law of conflicts) of the State
of New York. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language in New
York, New York. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be
entered by any court having jurisdiction.

(c) Nothing contained in this Section 9.9 shall prevent any party hereto from
resorting to judicial process if solely injunctive or equitable relief from a
court is necessary to prevent injury to such party or its Affiliates. The use
of arbitration procedures will not be construed under the doctrine of laches,
waiver or estoppel to affect adversely the rights of any party hereto to
assert any claim or defense. The prevailing party in the final, non-appealable
determination of any dispute, claim or controversy brought in arbitration,
court or other judicial process in accordance with this Agreement shall be
reimbursed fully and promptly by the non-prevailing party for all attorneys'
fees, court costs and other reasonable costs and expenses incurred by such
prevailing party in connection with the resolution of such dispute, claim or
controversy.

9.10 Release. Effective as of the Closing, each Seller, on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates (provided that with respect to the Bregal Seller, such
Affiliates shall be limited to the Affiliates of Bregal Sagemount I, L.P.), in
its capacity as a holder of Equity Interests, hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably and forever releases and discharges each member of the Company
Group and their respective Affiliates and each of their respective successors
and assigns, and any present or former directors, managers, officers,
employees or agents of such Person (each, a "Released Party"), of and from,

losses, expenses, proceedings, covenants, liabilities, suits, judgments,
damages, actions and causes of action, obligations, accounts, and liabilities
of any kind or character whatsoever, known or unknown, suspected or

without limitation, any management and consulting fees payable to such Seller
that are accrued but unpaid following the Closing (collectively, the
respective "Released Claims") that such Seller ever had, now has or ever may
have or claim to have against any Released Party, for or by reason of any
matter, circumstance, event, action, inaction, omission, cause or


 

--- 
| | 

|

68 

thing whatsoever, in each case arising from, relating to, or resulting from
such Seller's ownership of Equity Interests. Each Seller, on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates, expressly waives all rights afforded by any statute which
limits the effect of a release with respect to unknown claims. Each Seller, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates, understands the significance of this
release of unknown claims and waiver of statutory protection against a release
of unknown claims, and acknowledges and agrees that this waiver is an
essential and material term of this Agreement. Each Seller, on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates, acknowledges that the Company will be relying on
the waiver and release provided in this Section 9.10 in connection with
entering into this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth herein, no Seller releases, discharges, or waives, and nothing herein
shall operate to release, discharge, or waive, any (i) rights or claims of
such Seller under or for breach of the terms of this Agreement or any other
agreement entered into in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii) claims for accrued and unpaid compensation or benefits accrued by
such Seller in connection with such Seller's status as a present or former
director, officer, employee or consultant of the Company Group (other than in
connection with such Seller's ownership of MIUs), and (iii) any rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses or exculpation existing in favor of
any Seller under Section 9.7 in connection with such Seller's status as a
present or former director, officer, employee, fiduciary and agent of the
Company Group.

9.11 Sellers' Representative. The Sellers' Representative is hereby approved
by the Sellers (and is to be approved pursuant to the Letter of Transmittal)
to serve as the representative of the Sellers with respect to the matters
expressly set forth in this Agreement to be performed by the Sellers'
Representative. Effective as of the Closing, each of the Sellers hereby
irrevocably appoints the Sellers' Representative as the agent, proxy and
attorney‑in‑fact for such Seller for all purposes of this Agreement, including
full power and authority on such Seller's behalf (a) to consummate the
transactions contemplated herein, (b) to pay expenses (whether incurred on or

Agreement. Each of the Sellers shall agree to reimburse the Sellers'
Representative for any fees and expenses incurred by the Sellers'
Representative in its capacity as agent, proxy or attorney in fact of the
Sellers in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
herein. At the Closing, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Sellers'
Representative an amount equal to $1,000,000 (the "Sellers' Representative
Expense Fund") to be held in trust to cover and reimburse the fees and
expenses incurred by the Sellers' Representative for its obligations in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein. Any
balance of the Sellers' Representative Expense Fund not incurred for such
purposes shall be returned to the Sellers on a pro rata basis as soon as
reasonably practicable after payment of the Sellers' Representative the amount
due to it from the Sellers' Representative Expense Fund. A decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Sellers' Representative hereunder shall
constitute a decision, act, consent or instruction of all Sellers and shall be
final, binding and


 

--- 
| | 

|

69 

conclusive upon each of such Sellers, and all Indemnified Parties may rely
upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers'
Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each and
every Seller. All Indemnified Parties shall be relieved from any liability to
any Person for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Sellers' Representative.

9.12 Disclosure Schedules. Each disclosure schedule delivered pursuant to this
Agreement (each a "Schedule", and collectively, the "Schedules") shall be in
writing and shall qualify this Agreement. The Schedules are not intended to
constitute, and shall not be construed as constituting, representations or
warranties of the Company except to the extent expressly provided in this
Agreement and shall not be deemed to expand in any way the scope or effect of
any of such representations or warranties. Certain information set forth in
the Schedules is included solely for information purposes and may not be
required to be disclosed pursuant to this Agreement. The inclusion of an item
in a Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be
deemed to constitute an acknowledgment that such information is required to be
disclosed in connection with the representations or warranties of the Company
nor shall such information constitute an admission by any party hereto, as
applicable, that such item constitutes an item, event, circumstance or
occurrence that is material to the Company Group or constitutes a Material
Adverse Effect. Any fact or item that is disclosed in any Schedule in a way as
to make its relevance or applicability to information called for by any other
Schedule reasonably apparent shall be deemed to be disclosed in such other
Schedule, notwithstanding the omission of a reference or cross-reference
thereto. Disclosure of any allegations with respect to any alleged breach,
violation or default under any contractual or other obligation, or any law, is
not an admission that such breach, violation or default has occurred. Headings
and subheadings have been inserted on certain Schedules for convenience of
reference only and shall not be considered a part of or affect the
construction or interpretation of such Schedules. Where the terms of a
contract or other item have been summarized or described in the Schedules,
such summary or description does not purport to be a complete statement of the
material terms of such contract or other item, and, all such summaries and
descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the contract or
item being summarized and/or described. The information provided in the
Schedules is being provided solely for the purpose of making disclosures to
Purchaser under this Agreement. In disclosing this information, the Company
does not waive, and expressly reserves any rights under, any attorney-client
privilege associated with such information or any protection afforded by the
work-product doctrine with respect to any of the matters disclosed or
discussed therein.

9.13 Retention of Books and Records. Purchaser shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to retain all books, ledgers, files, reports, plans, operating
records and any other material documents pertaining to the Company and its
Subsidiaries in existence at the Closing that are required to be retained
under current retention policies for a period of seven years from the Closing
Date, and to make the same available after the Closing for inspection and
copying by the Sellers' Representative or its representatives at the Sellers'
Representative's expense, during regular business hours and upon reasonable
request and upon reasonable advance notice.

9.14 Restricted Activities. During the Restricted Period, no Seller that is an
individual (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include any Sellers
that are entities) (each, a "Restricted Seller") will, directly or indirectly,
for any reason, for its own benefit or for the benefit of or together with any
other Person:

(a) solicit or conspire with, or attempt to solicit or conspire with, any
employee, manager, director or advisor of Purchaser or its Affiliates to
terminate that Person's engagement or relationship with Purchaser or its
Affiliates;

(b) solicit or attempt to solicit, any of the Clients or Suppliers of
Purchaser or its Affiliates (as defined below) with whom such Restricted
Seller has had material contact during the one year prior to the Closing Date
to terminate their business relationship with Purchaser or its Affiliates (as
used herein, "Clients" and "Suppliers" shall be defined as any Person that has
been an active client/customer or supplier of the Company Group or a targeted
prospective client/customer or supplier of the Company Group or its Affiliates
during the one year prior to the Closing Date);

(c) divert or attempt to divert any or all of such Customers' or Suppliers'
business from Purchaser or its Affiliates in violation of any unfair
competition laws or other applicable laws; or

(d) be engaged as an executive officer, limited liability entity manager or
director or in any other managerial or sales capacity or as an owner, co-
owner, or other investor of or in, or lender to, whether as an employee,
independent contractor, consultant or advisor, or sales representative or
distributor of any kind, in any Restricted Business anywhere in the Restricted
Area, with the parties acknowledging that Purchaser and its Affiliates are
actively engaged in such business throughout and beyond all parts of the
Restricted Territory; provided, however, the foregoing prohibition on
ownership shall not apply to ownership of investments in: (A) a Person that is
a large organization whose business is highly diversified if the Restricted
Business is not a primary part of its business; or (B) any Person that is
listed on a recognised stock exchange so long as such Restricted Seller,
together with such Restricted Seller's Affiliates, collectively own less than
3% of the total outstanding equity interests of such Person

9.15 280G Shareholder Vote. Before the Closing Date, the Company will use
commercially reasonable efforts (to the extent the requisite waivers described
below are obtained) to seek the approval by such number of shareholders of the
Company as is required by the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code as to
whether any "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G of the
Code), who in the absence of such shareholder approval would receive payments
(including any accelerated vesting, payments, benefits, options and/or stock
provided pursuant to agreements, contracts or arrangements that might
otherwise result from the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement that would constitute "excess parachute payments" within the meaning
of Section 280G of the Code, has a right to receive such payments, with such
shareholder vote to be obtained in a manner that satisfies all applicable
requirements of applicable state Law and of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (the "280G Shareholder
Vote"); provided, however, that to the extent that any contract, agreement, or
plan is entered into by Purchaser, the Company Group or any of their
Affiliates and a "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G of the
Code) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
before the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall provide

|

71 

a copy of such contract, agreement or plan to the Company and the
Stockholders' Representative at least five (5) days before the Closing Date
and shall cooperate with the Company in good faith in order to calculate or
determine the value (for the purposes of Section 280G of the Code) of any
payments or benefits granted or contemplated therein, which may be paid or
granted in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that could constitute a "parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code. In
connection therewith, the Company shall take commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain and deliver to Purchaser, prior to the initiation of the 280G
Shareholder Vote, a parachute payment waiver agreement (a "280G Waiver") from
each person who the Company reasonably believes is a "disqualified individual"
(within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder), as determined immediately prior to the
280G Shareholder Vote, and who might otherwise have, receive or have the right
or entitlement to receive any payments or benefits from the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that would be subject to
treatment as parachute payments within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code. Drafts of all materials produced by the Company in connection with the
280G Shareholder Vote shall be provided to Purchaser reasonably in advance for
Purchaser's review and comment, which comment and any requested changes the
Company shall consider in good faith and not unreasonably omit.

10.5 No Strict Construction. The language used in this Agreement shall be
deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual
intent, and no rule of strict construction will be applied against any Person.
The words "hereof," "herein," "hereby," "herewith" and words of similar import
shall, unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a
whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement, and article,
section, paragraph and schedule references are to the articles, sections,
paragraphs and schedules of this Agreement unless otherwise specified or
unless the context otherwise requires. The words describing the singular
number shall include the plural and vice versa, words denoting either gender
shall include both genders and words denoting natural persons shall include
all persons and vice versa. The phrases "the date of this Agreement," "the
date hereof," "of even date herewith" and terms of similar import shall be
deemed to refer to the date set forth in the preamble to this Agreement. The
word "including" or any variation thereof means "including, without
limitation" and shall not be construed to limit any general statement that it
follows to the specific or similar items or matters immediately following it.
Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise requires, references to
agreements and other documents shall be deemed to include all subsequent
amendments and other modifications thereto; provided, that any such amendments
omitted from any Schedule, to the extent material, shall not be deemed
disclosed for purposes of the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Section 3.2 or Article 9. Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise
requires, references to statutes shall include all regulations promulgated
thereunder. Whenever this Agreement refers to a number of days, such number
shall refer to calendar days unless Business Days are specified.

10.6 Captions. The captions used in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and do not constitute a part of this Agreement and shall not be
deemed to limit, characterize or in any way affect any provision of this
Agreement, and all provisions of this Agreement shall be enforced and
construed as if no caption had been used in this Agreement.

10.7 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in
this Agreement (including as set forth in Section 9.7 above), nothing herein
expressed or implied is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give
to any Person, other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted
successors and assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason of this
Agreement, such third parties specifically including employees or creditors of
the Company Group.

10.8 Complete Agreement. This Agreement, including the Schedules, and the
exhibits hereto, together with the other instruments referred to herein,
including the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and
supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof.

10.9 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
any one of which may be by facsimile, and all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same instrument.

10.10 Governing Law and Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the State of New York,
without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or
rule (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would
cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
New York. Except as to matters subject to arbitration (other than enforcement
of awards therefrom or enforcement of any party's agreement to arbitrate) as
described in Section 9.9, to the extent permitted by law, each of the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state
court sitting in the State of New York or United States federal court sitting
in New York, New York, over any suit, action or other proceeding brought by
any party arising out of or relating to this Agreement, and each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims with respect to any
such suit, action or other proceeding shall be heard and determined in such
courts. In the event of any litigation regarding or arising from this
Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the non-
prevailing party its reasonable expenses, attorneys' fees and costs incurred
therein or in enforcement or collection of any judgment or award rendered
therein.

10.11 Attorney-Client Privilege and Conflict Waiver. Kirkland and Ellis LLP has
represented the Company, its Subsidiaries, certain of the Sellers and the
Sellers' Representative. All of the parties recognize the commonality of
interest that exists and will continue to exist until Closing, and the parties
agree that such commonality of interest should continue to be recognized after
the Closing. Specifically, the parties agree Purchaser shall not, and shall
not cause any member of the Company Group to, seek to have Kirkland and Ellis
LLP disqualified from representing the Sellers' Representative, the Sellers
and their respective Affiliates, and each of the foregoing's respective
officers, directors, employees, shareholders, equityholders, agents and
representatives (collectively, the "Seller Parties") in connection with any
dispute that may arise between the Sellers' Representative, the Seller Parties
or their respective Affiliates and the Purchaser or the Company in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and (b) in
connection with any such dispute that may arise between the Sellers'
Representative, the Seller Parties or their respective Affiliates and the
Purchaser or the Company, the Sellers' Representative (and not the Purchaser
or the Company) will have the right to decide whether or not to waive the
attorney client privilege that may apply to any communications between the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries and Kirkland and Ellis LLP that occurred before
the Closing.

10.12 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.

10.13 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed by Purchaser, the Company, the Sellers or the Sellers'
Representative as applicable, in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached by Purchaser, the Company, the Sellers or the Sellers'
Representative, as applicable. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall
be entitled

75 

to an injunction or injunctions, without any requirement to post or provide
any bond or other security in connection therewith, to prevent breaches of
this Agreement by any of Purchaser, the Company, the Sellers or the Sellers'
Representative, as applicable, and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof against Purchaser, the Company, the Sellers or the Sellers'
Representative, as applicable, in any court having jurisdiction, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which the parties hereto are entitled at law
or in equity.
