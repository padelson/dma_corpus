Agreement and Plan of Merger

  

This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this " _Agreement_ ") is dated as of
February 6, 2007, among Caritor, Inc., a California corporation (the "
_Buyer_ "), Renaissance Acquisition Corp., a Massachusetts corporation and a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Keane, Inc., a
Massachusetts corporation (the " _Company_ ").

  

 _Introduction_

  

This Agreement contemplates the merger (the " _Merger_ ") of Merger Sub with
and into the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, with the Company surviving the Merger. As a result of the
Merger, the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer.  The
Boards of Directors of each of the Buyer, Merger Sub and the Company have
adopted a resolution that deems the Merger and this Agreement to be advisable
and fair to and in the best interests of each corporation and
their respective stockholders.

  

Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a
condition and inducement to the Buyers willingness to enter into this
Agreement, the stockholders of the Company listed on _Schedule A_ have
entered into a Stockholder Voting Agreement, dated as of the date of this
Agreement, and previously approved by the Company Board, in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Company Stockholder Agreement_ "), pursuant to
which such stockholders have, among other things, agreed to vote all of the
shares of voting capital stock of the Company that such stockholders own in
favor of the Company Voting Proposal.

  

Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a
condition and inducement to the Companys willingness to enter into this
Agreement, the Buyer has delivered to the Company the duly executed guarantee
of Court Square Capital Limited (the " _Guarantor_ ") in the form attached as
_Exhibit B_ to this Agreement (the " _Guarantee_ ").

  

Buyer, Merger Sub and the Company therefore agree as follows:

  

# ARTICLE I

## 1.1 _Effective Time of the Merger_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, prior to the Closing, the Buyer and the Company shall jointly
prepare, and immediately following the Closing, the Company shall cause to be

_MBCA_ ") and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the
MBCA. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the

_Closing Date_ "), which shall be no later than the third Business Day after
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than
delivery of items to be delivered at the Closing and other than satisfaction
of those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
it being understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall remain subject
to the delivery of such items and the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions at the Closing), at the offices of WilmerHale, 60 State Street,
Boston, Massachusetts, unless another date, place or time is agreed to in
writing by the Buyer and the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
notwithstanding the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth
in Article VII as of any date, the parties shall not be required to effect
the Closing on such date ("Date") unless both (x) the financial statements
for the Company that paragraph (c) of Exhibit C to the Debt Commitment Letter
requires to have been provided by such Date to the lenders under the Debt
Commitment shall have been so provided or filed with the SEC before the open
of business on such Date and (y) either (i) the financial data for the
Company, which is required for the preparation of the pro forma financial
statements that paragraph (d) of Exhibit C to the Debt Commitment Letter
requires to have been provided by such Date to the lenders under the Debt
Commitment Letter, shall have been so provided to the Buyer at least 10 days
before such Date or (ii) such pro forma financial statements shall have been
provided to such lenders before the open of business on such Date (it being
understood that the financial data to be filed by the Company on Form 10-K or
10-Q, as the case may be, for the applicable period shall satisfy the
financial statement and data requirements of the Company under this clause
(y)); _provided_ , _further_ that the parties shall disregard the preceding
proviso on three Business Days written notice to the Company by the Buyer
indicating that such proviso is to be disregarded. For purposes of

in Boston, Massachusetts or New York, New York are permitted or required by
Law, executive order or governmental decree to remain closed.

  

## 1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time the separate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company (the Company following the Merger is sometimes referred to
herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). The Articles of Organization and
By-Laws of the Company, each as amended and in effect on the date of this
Agreement, shall be the Articles of Organization and By-Laws of the Surviving
Corporation.  The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 11.07 of
the MBCA.

  

## 1.4 _Directors and Officers_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation and the officers of the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving

        

## Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Articles
of Organization and By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation.

  

# ARTICLE II 
  
 CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

  

## 2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of and subject to the occurrence of
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holders of any shares of the capital stock of the Company or
capital stock of Merger Sub:

  

### (a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of the common stock of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  

### (b) _Excluded Shares_. All shares of common stock, $0.10 par value per
share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") that are owned by any
wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company and any shares of Company Common Stock
owned by the Buyer, Merger Sub or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Buyer immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

  

### (c) _Merger Consideration for Company Common Stock_. Subject to Section
2.2, each share of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be cancelled in
accordance with Section 2.1(b) and other than Restricted Shares that are
required to be cashed out in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.3)
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
automatically converted into the right to receive $14.30 in cash per share
without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time,
all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
a Certificate (as defined in Section 2.2(b)) shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.1(c) upon the surrender of
such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.2, without interest.

  

### (d) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration and
any other dependent items shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of
any reclassification, stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including
any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into or exercisable
for Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like
change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring (or for which a record
date is established) after the date hereof and prior to the Effective
Time, provided, that nothing in this Section 2.1(d) shall be construed to
permit the Company or its Subsidiaries to take any action that is prohibited
or not expressly permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

        

## 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. The procedures for exchanging
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration
pursuant to the Merger are as follows:

  

### (a) _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer shall
deposit with Computershare Shareholder Services, Inc. or another bank
or trust company mutually acceptable to the Buyer and the Company (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, for payment
through the Exchange Agent in accordance with this Section 2.2, cash in an
amount sufficient to make payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant
to Section 2.1(c) in exchange for all of the shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Exchange Fund_
"). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange
Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by the Buyer; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks
with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial
statements of such bank which are then publicly available).

  

### (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable (and in
any event within five (5) Business Days) after the Effective Time, the
Buyer shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of
a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "
_Certificate_ ") (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for
the Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto.  Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be paid
promptly in exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the Merger
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this Article II, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
immediately be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash
payable upon the surrender of such Certificate or Certificates. In the event
of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to
a Person (as defined in this Section 2.2(b)) other than the Person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate is
presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required
to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable
stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Section 2.2. As used in
this Agreement, " _Person_ " means any individual, corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, association, trust,
Governmental Entity, unincorporated organization or other entity.

        

### (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the
terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented
by such Certificates, and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Article II.

  

### (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for nine
(9) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Buyer, upon
demand, and any holder of Company Common Stock who has not previously
complied with this Section 2.2 shall be entitled to receive only from the
Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and similar
Laws) payment of its claim for Merger Consideration, without interest.

  

### (e) _No Liability_.  To the extent permitted by applicable Law, none of
the Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

  

### (f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other
applicable state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld by the Surviving Corporation, the Buyer or the Exchange Agent, as
the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by the Buyer,
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, to the
applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company
Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
the Surviving Corporation, the Buyer or the Exchange Agent, as the case may
be.

  

### (g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Exchange Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby pursuant to this Agreement;
provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent may,
in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance
thereof, require the record holder of any such Certificate to deliver a bond
in such sum as the Surviving Corporation may reasonably direct as indemnity

        

### against any claim that may be made against Buyer, the
Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent and/or any of their respective
representatives or agents with respect to such Certificate.

  

## 2.3 _Company Stock Plans_.

  

### (a) The Company shall take such action as shall be required:

  

#### (i) to cause the vesting of any unvested options to purchase Company
Common Stock (whether or not vested, " _Company Stock Options_ ") granted
under any stock option plans or other equity-related plans of the Company
(the " _Company Stock Plans_ ") to be accelerated in full effective
immediately prior to the Effective Time;

  

#### (ii) to effectuate the cancellation, as of the Effective Time, of all
Company Stock Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(without regard to the exercise price of such Company Stock Options);

  

#### (iii) to cause, pursuant to the Company Stock Plans, each outstanding
Company Stock Option to represent as of the Effective Time solely the right
to receive, in accordance with this Section 2.3, a lump sum cash payment in
the amount of the Option Consideration (as defined below), if any, with
respect to such Company Stock Option and to no longer represent the right to
purchase Company Common Stock or any other equity security of the Company,
the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any other Person or any other
consideration; and

  

#### (iv) to cause the vesting of any shares of Common Stock subject to
vesting or other lapse restrictions pursuant to any Company Stock Plan
(collectively, the " _Restricted Shares_ ") which is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (as such Company Stock Plan may be amended prior
to the Effective Time in accordance with the terms hereof).

  

### (b) Each holder of a Company Stock Option shall receive from the Buyer or
the Surviving Corporation, in respect and in consideration of each Company
Stock Option so cancelled, as soon as practicable following the Effective
Time (but in any event not later than five (5) Business Days), an amount (net
of applicable taxes, including any amounts required to be deducted or
withheld pursuant to Section 2.2(e)) equal to the product of (i) the
excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration per share of Company Common
Stock over (B) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, without any
interest thereon (the " _Option Consideration_ "). In the event that the
exercise price of any Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the
Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled without
payment and be of no further force or effect.

  

### (c) Each holder of a Restricted Share shall receive from the Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation, in respect and in consideration of each Restricted
Share, as soon as

        

### practicable following the Effective Time (but in any event not later than
five (5) Business Days), an amount (net of applicable taxes including
any amounts deducted or withheld pursuant to Section 2.2(e)) equal to the
product of (i) the Merger Consideration per share of Company Common Stock,
multiplied by (ii) the total number of Restricted Shares held by such holder,
without any interest thereon (the " _Restricted Share Consideration_ "), and
the holder shall cease to have any rights with respect to any such Restricted
Shares.

  

### (d) As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, the
Company shall mail to each Person who is a holder of Company Stock Options
and Restricted Shares a letter describing the treatment of and payment for
such Company Stock Options and Restricted Shares pursuant to this Section 2.3
and providing instructions for use in obtaining payment for such Company
Stock Options and Restricted Shares. The Buyer shall at all times from and
after the Effective Time and until such time as the obligations have been
satisfied maintain sufficient liquid funds to satisfy its obligations to
holders of Company Stock Options and Restricted Shares pursuant to this
Section 2.3.

  

### (e) The Company shall terminate its 1992 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and
its UK Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _Company ESPPs_ ") in accordance
with their terms as of or prior to the Effective Time.

  

### (f) The Surviving Corporation shall, as soon as practicable following the
Effective Time (but in any event not later than five (5) Business Days),
irrevocably set aside and contribute to the trust fund established by the
Company to fund its obligations under the Companys First Amendment and
Restatement of the Keane, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan, as amended, (the "
_Deferred Compensation Plan_ "), an amount sufficient to cause such trust to
hold assets equal in value to the accrued benefits in the aggregate for all
of the participants and beneficiaries of the Deferred Compensation Plan
determined as of the Effective Time.

  

## 2.4 _Subsequent Actions_. If at any time after the Effective Time it
is reasonably necessary for the Surviving Corporation to execute and deliver
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assurances or to take or do any
other actions or things necessary to continue, vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise the Surviving Corporations right, title or interest in,
to or under any of the rights, properties, privileges, franchises or assets
of the Company as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company, all such
deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of the Company, all such other actions and things as may
be necessary to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title and
interest in, to and under such rights, properties, privileges, franchises or
assets in the Surviving Corporation.

        

# ARTICLE III 
  
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

  

The Company represents and warrants to the Buyer and Merger Sub that the
statements contained in this Article III are true and correct, except (a) as
is disclosed in reasonable detail in the last annual report on Form 10-K
filed by the Company with the SEC and in any Company SEC Reports filed
subsequent to such annual report, in the case of both such annual report and
such other SEC Reports, filed prior to the date of this Agreement (other than
disclosures referred to in the "Factors That May Affect Future Results,"
"Risk Factors" or "Forward Looking Statements" sections of such Form 10-K or
Company SEC Reports) or (b) as set forth herein or in the disclosure schedule
(in accordance with Section 9.12) delivered by the Company to the Buyer and
Merger Sub and dated as of the date of this Agreement (the
"Company Disclosure Schedule").

  

## 3.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_. The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation, has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as now being conducted and is duly qualified to do business and,
where applicable as a legal concept, is in good standing as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction in which the character of the properties it
owns, operates or leases or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified or
in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, that have not had and are
not reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect (as
defined below). The Company has heretofore made available to the Buyer
complete and accurate copies of all the charter, bylaws or other
organizational documents of the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, the
term " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ " shall mean (i) any events,
circumstances, developments, changes and/or effects that are materially
adverse to the business, assets, condition (financial or otherwise) or
results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole;
provided, however, that none of the following shall constitute, or shall be
considered in determining whether there has occurred, and no event,
circumstance, development, change or effect resulting from or arising out of
any of the following shall constitute, a Company Material Adverse Effect:
(A) the announcement of the execution of this Agreement or the pendency
of consummation of the Merger, (B) changes in the national or world economy
or financial markets as a whole or changes in general economic conditions
that affect the industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries conduct
their business, so long as such conditions do not adversely affect the
Company and its Subsidiaries in a materially disproportionate manner relative
to other similarly situated participants in the industries or markets in
which they operate, (C) any change in general budget or appropriations
policies of any Governmental Entities (as opposed to individual procurement
decisions) or any applicable Law, rule or regulation or GAAP or
interpretation thereof after the date hereof, so long as such changes do not
adversely affect the Company and its Subsidiaries in a materially

        

## disproportionate manner relative to other similarly situated participants
in the industries or markets in which they operate, (D) any failure by the
Company to meet any published estimates of revenues, earnings or other
financial projections (it being understood, however, that any events, changes
or developments causing or contributing to such failures may, except as
provided in any of (A), (B), (C), (E), (F) or (G) of this definition, be
deemed to constitute or be taken into account in determining whether a
Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred), (E) any outbreak or escalation
of war or hostilities, any occurrence or threats of terrorist acts or any
armed hostilities associated therewith and any national or international
calamity, disaster or emergency or any escalation thereof, so long as such
conditions do not adversely affect the Company and its Subsidiaries in a
materially disproportionate manner relative to other similarly situated
participants in the industries or markets in which they operate, (F) a
decline in the price, or a change in the trading volume, of the Company
Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (including any
successor exchange, " _NYSE_ ") (it being understood, however, that any
events, changes or developments causing or contributing to such decline or
change may, except as provided in any of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) or (G) of
this definition, be taken into account in determining whether a Company
Material Adverse Effect has occurred), (G) taking any action outside of the
ordinary course of business required by this Agreement, or taking or not
taking any actions outside ordinary course of business at the written request
of, or with the written consent of, Buyer (including, without limitation, any
actions requested by the Buyer pursuant to Section 5.2(a), but, for the
avoidance of doubt, excluding compliance with undertakings to assure
operation in the ordinary course of business pursuant to Section 5.1) and (H)
any stockholder litigation commenced on or after the date of this Agreement
to the extent arising from or relating to the Merger and which does not
constitute a breach of the representations and warranties of the Company set
forth in the last sentence of Section 3.12 or (ii) an effect that prevents
the Company from being able to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby in accordance with this Agreement prior to the Outside Date.

of ERISA or in Section 413 of the Code (and regulations promulgated
thereunder). With respect to each Company Employee Plan that is an employee
welfare benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA), all
claims incurred by the Company are (i) insured pursuant to a contract of
insurance whereby the insurance company bears any risk of loss with respect
to such claims, (ii) covered under a contract with a health
maintenance organization pursuant to which the health maintenance
organization bears the liability for claims, or (iii) fully reflected as a
liability, or fully accrued for and disclosed, to the extent required by
GAAP, in the financial statements of the Company, its Subsidiaries, and its
ERISA Affiliates. The Company, its Subsidiaries and all ERISA Affiliates have
at all times complied with the applicable continuation requirements for its
welfare benefit plans, including Section 4980B of the Code (as well as its
predecessor provision, Section 162(k) of the Code) and Sections 601 through
608, inclusive, of ERISA and any applicable state statutes mandating health
insurance continuation coverage for employees, except for any such violation
that, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor
any ERISA Affiliates has unsatisfied obligations to any employees or
qualified beneficiaries pursuant to COBRA or any state Law governing health
care coverage extension, except for any such obligation that, individually or

Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

### (i) No party in interest or disqualified person (as defined,
respectively, in Section 3(14) of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code) has
engaged in a transaction with respect to any Company Employee Plan
which could subject the Company, its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate,
directly or indirectly, to a material Tax, penalty or other material
liability for prohibited transactions under ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code. No fiduciary of any Company Employee Plan has breached any of the
responsibilities or obligations imposed upon fiduciaries under Title I of
ERISA, which breaches, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. With respect to each
Company Employee Plan that is a "pension plan" within the meaning of ERISA
3(2), no equity interest of the Company, its Subsidiaries or of any ERISA
Affiliate has ever been an asset of any trust associated with any such
Company Employee Plan.

Company Employee Plan is under audit or is the subject of an investigation by
the IRS, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation, the SEC or any other Governmental Entity and (ii) no such audit
or investigation is pending or threatened.

  

### (l) Neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will, either
alone or in conjunction with any other event (whether contingent
or otherwise) result in any amount to fail to be deductible by the Company
by reason of Section 280G of the Code.

  

### (m) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has made any written
communications to its employees announcing any intent or commitment (whether
or not legally binding) to create or implement any additional employee
benefit plan or to amend, modify or terminate any Company Employee Plan.

  

### (n) Under each Company Employee Plan that is a defined benefit plan, as
of the last day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the date hereof,
the actuarially determined present value of all "benefit liabilities" within
the meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA or, with respect to any foreign
plan, as determined under any equivalent Law (in each case as determined on
the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in the Company Employee
Plans most recent actuarial valuation), did not exceed the then current
value of assets of such Company Employee Plan or, with respect to any foreign
plan not subject to any funding requirement, if such liabilities did exceed
such assets the amount thereof was properly reflected on the financial
statements of the Company or its applicable Subsidiary, to the
extent required by GAAP, and there has been no material adverse change in
the financial condition of such Company Employee Plan (with respect to either
assets or benefits) since the last day of the most recent plan year.

  

### (o) To the Companys Knowledge (i) each Company Employee Plan that is a

the proposed regulations issued thereunder or (2) Internal Revenue Service
Notice 2005-1 (clauses (A) and (B), together, the " _409A Authorities_ "),
and (ii) no Company Employee Plan that would be a Nonqualified Deferred
Compensation Plan subject to Section 409A of the Code but for the effective
date provisions that are applicable to Section 409A of the Code, as set forth
in Section 885(d) of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, as amended (the
" _AJCA_ "), has been

reasonably requested by Buyer in order to cause all, or such portion as Buyer

which cannot be distributed, contributed or otherwise delivered to the
Company in accordance with applicable Laws, including those relating to
solvency, adequate surplus and similar capital adequacy tests or (ii) held by

the Buyer the losses, costs and expenses that, to the Companys
Knowledge, the Company expects to incur in connection with such action. To
the extent action taken by the Buyer in accordance with such request causes
the Buyer to incur any losses, costs or expenses (other than losses, costs
and expenses that, to the Companys Knowledge, the Company expected to incur
in connection with such action before taking such

        

### action and that were not disclosed pursuant to the preceding sentence and

retention of Cash and Cash Equivalents.

  

## 5.3 _Confidentiality_. The parties acknowledge that the Buyer and the
Company have previously executed a confidentiality agreement, dated as
of November 13, 2006 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "),
which Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in

understood that until the termination of this Agreement, Section 7 therein
shall be of no force or effect).

  

## 5.4 _Financing Commitments_.

  

### (a) The Buyer will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, necessary or advisable to obtain the financing on the
terms and conditions set forth in the Commitment Letters (provided that the
Buyer may replace or amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not
executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement, or
otherwise so long as the terms are not materially less beneficial to the
Buyer, with respect to conditionality or, when taken together with all other
sources of financing, loan amount, than those in the Debt Commitment Letter
as in effect on the date of this Agreement). As soon as practicable after the
date hereof but in any event on or prior to the Closing, the Buyer will use
its reasonable best efforts to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements
with respect to the financings contemplated by the Commitment Letters on
terms and conditions substantially in accordance with the Commitment Letters
or on other terms no less favorable, in the aggregate, to the Buyer and not
in violation of this Section 5.3. The Buyer will furnish correct and
complete copies of such definitive agreements to the Company promptly upon
their execution.

  

### (b) The Buyer shall keep the Company reasonably informed with respect to
the status of the financings contemplated by the Commitment Letters and shall
give the Company prompt notice of any material adverse change with respect to
such financings. Without limiting the foregoing, the Buyer agrees to notify
the Company promptly, and in any event within two (2) Business Days, if at
any time prior to the Closing Date (i) any Commitment Letter shall expire or
be terminated for any reason, (ii) any financing source that is a party to
any Commitment Letter notifies the Buyer that such source no longer intends
to provide financing to the Buyer on the terms set forth therein, or (iii)
for any reason the Buyer no longer believes in good faith that it

        

### will be able to obtain all or any portion of the financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letters on substantially the terms described
therein or on other terms no less favorable, in the aggregate, to the Buyer.
The Buyer shall not knowingly, and shall not knowingly permit any of its
Affiliates to, without the prior written consent of the Company, take any
action or enter into any transaction, including any merger, acquisition,
joint venture, disposition, lease, contract or debt or equity financing, that
would reasonably be expected to materially impair, materially delay or
prevent the Buyers obtaining of the financing contemplated by any Commitment
Letter. The Buyer shall not knowingly amend or alter, or knowingly agree to
amend or alter, any Commitment Letter in any manner that would materially
impair, materially delay or prevent the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the Company.

  

### (c) If the Debt Commitment Letter shall be terminated or unavailable to
the Buyer for any reason, the Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain, and, if obtained, will provide the Company with a copy of, a new
financing commitment that provides for an amount of financing (when taken
together with all other sources of financing) sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and terms and conditions not less
favorable, in the aggregate, to the Buyer or Merger Sub than those included
in such Debt Commitment Letter as originally issued.

  

### (d) The Company agrees to provide, and to cause its Subsidiaries to
provide, the Buyer with such cooperation in connection with the arrangement
of the financings contemplated by the Commitment Letters as may be reasonably
requested by the Buyer (including during the 10 day period contemplated by
clause (y) in Section 1.2 hereof), including (i) upon reasonable prior
notice, participation in meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence
sessions and sessions with rating agencies, (ii) subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, assisting with the preparation of materials for
rating agency presentations, offering documents, bank information memoranda,
business projections and similar documents required in connection with
financings contemplated by the Commitment Letters, including execution
and delivery of customary representation letters in connection with
bank information memoranda, (iii) as promptly as practical (it being
agreed that the Company shall use reasonable efforts to act within the
timeframes set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters), furnishing the Buyer
and its debt financing sources with financial and other documents, materials
and information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be
reasonably requested by the Buyer, including all financial statements, pro
forma financial information, financial data, audit reports, audit opinions
and other documents, materials and information pertaining to the Company and
the Companys Subsidiaries of the types described in paragraphs (c) and (d)
of Exhibit C of the Debt Commitment Letter and (iv) facilitating the
guarantees, security and pledging of collateral contemplated by the Debt
Financing, including the loan, guaranty, security and collateral
documentation; provided that (A) any documents executed by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries in connection with the foregoing shall only become
effective upon the occurrence of the Effective Time and shall be executed
pursuant to authority granted by the Board of Directors of the Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation (and, for the avoidance of doubt, not by the Company
Board), (B) such requested cooperation shall occur during normal business
hours and in a

        

### manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (C) neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other
similar fee or incur any other liability in connection with the financings
contemplated by the Commitment Letters prior to the Effective Time, except to
the extent conditioned on the occurrence of the Effective Time. The Buyer
shall, promptly upon written request by the Company, reimburse the Company
for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation; _provided_
that the Company shall not incur any material expenses (including printer,
dealer manager and agency fees) without prior consultation with the Buyer.
 The Buyer and the Merger Sub shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify
and hold harmless the Company and its Representatives from and against any
and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest,
awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by any of them in
connection with the arrangement of the financings contemplated by
the Commitment Letters and any information utilized in connection therewith
(other than historical information relating to the Company approved by the
Company for use therein). The Company will periodically update any such
Required Information if to the Companys Knowledge such Required Information
contains an untrue statement of material fact or omits to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein not
misleading. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the financings contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter.

  

### (e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Buyer or
Merger Sub from entering into agreements that shall not delay or otherwise
impede the transactions contemplated by this Agreement relating to the
financing or the operation of the Buyer, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation, including adding other equity providers or operating
partners.

  

### (f) The Company shall cooperate with and provide reasonable assistance to
the Buyer prior to the Closing to replace any outstanding letter of credit
maintained or provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries effective as of the
Effective Time; provided that the actual replacement of such letters of
credit shall not itself constitute a condition of Closing.

### (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company (i) may (and may authorize and permit its
Representatives to), pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with terms and
conditions no less favorable in any material respect to the Company than the
Confidentiality Agreement (except for such changes as are necessary to allow
the Company to comply with the terms of this Agreement), furnish information

Proposa_ l"); (y) such Takeover Proposal was not solicited or initiated in
violation of Section 6.1(a) by the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or

committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside counsel, that such Takeover Proposal is, or is

more favorable, from a financial point of view, to the Companys stockholders
taking into account all of the terms and conditions of such proposal,
including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions
to consummation and the likelihood of consummation in light of all financing,
regulatory, legal, and other aspects of such proposal, and this Agreement
(including any binding written and complete proposal from the Buyer or the
Sponsor to amend the terms of this Agreement) and for which financing, to the
extent required, is then committed and on terms and conditions that the
Company Board (or any committee thereof) determines,after consultation with
its financial advisor, are reasonably likely to result in disbursement
sufficient for consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Takeover
Proposal; and (z) the Company Board (or any committee thereof) determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that providing
such information or access or entering into, participating, engaging or
assisting in such negotiations or discussions is or would be in the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders and that the failure to take
such action could violate the Company Boards fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law (a Takeover Proposal which
satisfies clauses (x), (y) and (z) being referred to herein as a " _Superior
Proposal_ "). The Company shall promptly, and in any event within one

Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Company Stockholder Approval (x)
the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall be permitted to make a

with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action could violate the Company Boards fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law and (y) the Company may enter
into a definitive agreement with respect to a Takeover Proposal if the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) has made the determination in clause
(x) in response to a Takeover Proposal that did not arise from a breach by
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives of Section 6.1(a), has determined in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that

agreed that any determination by the Company Board (or a committee thereof)
to send a Notice of Recommendation Change shall not, by itself, constitute a
breach of this Section 6.1 if such Notice of Recommendation Change conveys
intentions to take no action other than actions that would be permitted by
and in accordance with this Section 6.1(c)) and specifying the reasons
therefor, including, in the case of an intention to take action under clause
(y), the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal that is the
basis of such action specified in such Notice of Recommendation Change, and
stating that the Company intends to terminate the Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(f) or effect a Change in Recommendation, as applicable (it being
understood and agreed that (1) in determining whether to cause or permit the
Company to take any such action in response to a Takeover Proposal, the

thereof) from taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position

any such disclosure (other than a recommendation of rejection of such tender
or exchange offer or a "stop, look and listen" letter or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under
the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Change in Recommendation;
provided, however, that the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall
not (A) recommend that the stockholders of the Company tender their shares of
Company Common Stock in connection with such tender or exchange offer (or
otherwise approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal to facilitate such
tender or exchange offer) or (B) withdraw or modify its approval or
recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger, unless in each case the
applicable requirements of Section 6.1(c) shall have been satisfied.

information required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant
to the rules and regulations of any applicable Law (including all information
required to be included in the Proxy Statement) in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, Buyer shall not be required to provide to the Company
any non-public information relating to the Buyer, its Affiliates or its and
their respective operations, provided that this sentence shall not apply to
the provision of non-public information to the Companys counsel pursuant to
a joint

        

defense agreement between counsel to the Company and counsel to the Buyer
that assures that such information will not be shared by counsel to the
Company with any Company personnel.

  

### (b) Subject to the terms hereof, the Buyer and the Company agree, and
shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries, to cooperate and to use
their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain any government clearances
or approvals required for Closing under the HSR Act and any other federal,
state or foreign Law, regulation or decree designed to prohibit, restrict or
regulate actions for the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of
trade or any Laws relating to restrictions on foreign investment
(collectively " _Antitrust Laws_ "), to respond to any government requests
for information under any Antitrust Law, and to contest and resist any
action, including any legislative, administrative or judicial action, and to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction
or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) (an " _Antitrust
Order_ ") that restricts, prevents or prohibits the consummation of the
Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any
Antitrust Law.  The parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one
another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection
with, and provide to the other parties counsel in advance, any analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection
with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law. The parties may
designate any such documents "outside counsel only" and if so designated,
such documents may not be disclosed to the other party.

  

### (c) The Buyer shall propose, negotiate, offer to commit and effect (and
if such offer is accepted, commit to and effect), by consent decree, hold
separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such
immaterial assets or businesses of the Buyer or, effective as of
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation, or their respective
Subsidiaries, or otherwise offer to take or offer to commit to take any
commercially reasonable action which it is capable of taking and if the offer
is accepted, take or commit to take such action that limits its freedom of
action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the businesses,
services or assets of the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or their
respective Subsidiaries, in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any Antitrust Order, which would have the effect of
preventing or delaying the Effective Time beyond the Outside Date, provided
that no such action deprives the Buyer of the material benefits bargained for
in this Agreement or otherwise materially impacts any of the Buyers other
businesses.

  

### (d) Each of the Company and the Buyer shall give (or shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and use, and
cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, their commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any third party consents required in connection with the
Merger that are (i) necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii) disclosed or required to be disclosed in the Company Disclosure
Schedule or (iii) required to prevent the occurrence of an event that is
reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect prior to or
after the Effective Time, it being understood that neither the

        

### Company nor the Buyer shall be required to make any payments (other than
filing fees and attorneys fees) in connection with the fulfillment of
its obligations under this Section 6.6.

  

### (e) From and after the date hereof, the Company shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries and its and their respective employees and Representatives,
to use reasonable best efforts to take all actions reasonably necessary, and
to cooperate with the Buyer and its Affiliates in their reasonable best
efforts, to cause the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement not to adversely affect the security clearances that the Company,
its Subsidiaries and their respective employees have with
Governmental Entities, including the Defense Security Service, including by
complying with all reasonable requests for information, attending meetings on
reasonable advance notice and consulting with the Buyer about these matters.

  

## 6.7 _Public Disclosure_. Except as may be required by Law or stock market
regulations, (a) the press release announcing the execution of this Agreement
shall be issued only in such form as shall be mutually agreed upon by the
Company and the Buyer and (b) the Buyer and the Company shall each use its
commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the other party
before issuing any other press release or otherwise making any public
statement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement.

  

## 6.8 _Indemnification_.

  

### (a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Buyer and the Surviving
Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless each
person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who
becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against all claims,
losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and
expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to
the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by Law and
required by the Articles of Organization and By-Laws of the Company or the
organizational documents of such Subsidiaries or written agreements of the
Company existing as of the date hereof and disclosed in the Company
Disclosure Schedule. If any Indemnified Party becomes involved in any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation with respect to which such
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence after the Effective Time, each Indemnified Party will be
entitled (to the fullest extent permitted by Law and required by the Articles
of Organization and By-Laws of the Company or the organizational documents of
its Subsidiaries or written agreements of the Company existing as of the date
hereof and disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule) to advancement of
his or her legal expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation from each of the Buyer and the
Surviving Corporation within ten (10) business days of receipt by the Buyer
or the Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a request
therefor, provided that any such

        

### Indemnified Party provides an undertaking, to the extent required by the
MBCA, to repay such advancement if it is ultimately determined that
the Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified.

  

### (b) From the Effective Time through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
date on which the Effective Time occurs, the Articles of Organization and By-
Laws of the Surviving Corporation or any successors thereto shall contain,
and Buyer shall cause the Articles of Organization and By-Laws of the
Surviving Corporation to so contain, provisions no less favorable with
respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of
present and former directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries
than are presently set forth in the Articles of Organization and By-Laws of
the Company, to the extent permitted by the Law of the jurisdiction of
organization of the Surviving Corporation or any such successors thereto.

  

### (c) Subject to the next sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall either
(i) maintain, and the Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for six (6) years
from the Effective Time the current policies of the directors and officers
liability insurance maintained by the Company (the " _Current D andO
Insurance_") with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement),
so long as the annual premium therefor would not be in excess of 225% of the
last annual premium paid prior to the Effective Time (such 225%, the "
_Maximum Premium_ "), or (ii) purchase a six (6) year extended reporting
period endorsement with respect to the Current DandO Insurance (a "
_Reporting Tail Endorsement_ ") and maintain such endorsement in full force
and effect for its full term. If the Companys existing insurance expires,
is terminated or canceled during such six-year period or exceeds the Maximum
Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain, and Buyer shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to obtain, as much directors and officers liability
insurance as can be obtained for the remainder of such period for an
annualized premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium, on terms and
conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties than the
Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company may,
prior to the Effective Time, purchase a Reporting Tail Endorsement, provided
that the Company does not pay more than $1,650,000 for such Reporting Tail
Endorsement, in which case, provided that the Buyer causes the Surviving
Corporation to maintain such Reporting Tail Endorsement in full force and
effect for its full term, the Buyer shall be relieved from its obligations
under the preceding two sentences of this Section 6.8(c).

  

### (d) The Buyer shall pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees, that may be incurred by the persons referred to in this Section 6.8 in
connection with their enforcement of their rights provided in this Section
6.8.

  

### (e) The provisions of this Section 6.8 are intended to be in addition to
the rights otherwise available to the current and former officers and
directors of the Company by Law,

        

### charter, statute, bylaw or agreement, and shall operate for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties,
their heirs and their representatives.

  

## 6.9 _Notification of Certain Matters_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the
Buyer shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give
prompt notice to the Buyer, of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of
any event, which occurrence or failure to occur is reasonably expected to
cause any representation or warranty of such party contained in this
Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, in each case at
any time from and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time,
or (b) any material failure of the Buyer and Merger Sub or the Company, as
the case may be, or of any officer, director, employee or agent thereof, to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it under this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the above,
the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section will not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such
notice or the conditions to such partys obligation to consummate the Merger.

  

## 6.10 _Employee Benefits and Service Credit_. For the one-year period
commencing on the Effective Time, the Buyer shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, provide each employee of the
Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries who shall
have been an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than employees subject to a collective
bargaining or similar labor agreement) (" _Continuing Employees_ "), for so
long as such Continuing Employees remain so employed, health and welfare
benefits that are substantially no less favorable, in the aggregate, than
those provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or
the Buyer will give each Continuing Employee full credit for prior service
with the Company or its Subsidiaries (to the same extent as such service was
taken into account under the corresponding Company Employee Plan) for
purposes of (a) eligibility and vesting under any health plan of the Buyer,
the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, and (b) determination
of benefit levels under any Buyer Employee Plan or policy relating to
vacation or severance, in each case for which the Continuing Employee is
otherwise eligible and in which the Continuing Employee is
offered participation, but except where such credit would result in a
duplication of benefits. In addition, the Buyer shall waive, or cause to be
waived, any limitations on benefits relating to pre-existing conditions for
any condition for which the participant would have been entitled to coverage
under the corresponding Company Employee Plan in which they participated
prior to the Effective Time and recognize for purposes of annual deductible
and out-of-pocket limits under its medical and dental plans, deductible and
out-of-pocket expenses paid by Continuing Employees in the calendar year in
which the Effective Time occurs. Notwithstanding anything herein, nothing
in this Section 6.10 shall limit any right of the Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any
Continuing Employees at any time (subject to the terms and conditions of any
agreement or the terms of Company Employee Plan then existing with respect to
any such Continuing Employee). No later than five (5) Business Days prior to
its distribution, the Company shall provide Buyer

        

## with a copy of any communication intended to be made to all of
its employees relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and will
consider in good faith any reasonable comments thereto provided by the Buyer
on a timely basis.

  

## 6.11 _Director Resignations._ The Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to obtain and deliver to Buyer at the Closing evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer of the resignation, effective as of the Effective Time,
of those directors of Subsidiaries of the Company designated by Buyer to the
Company in writing at least five (5) business days prior to the Closing.

  

## 6.12 _Takeover Statutes._ If any Takeover Statute is or may become
applicable to the Merger, the Company Stockholder Agreement or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Company Stockholder
Agreement, the Company Board shall grant such approvals and take such actions
as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and the Company
Stockholder Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects
of such statute or regulation on such transactions.

  

## 6.13 _Stockholder Litigation._ Subject to a customary joint defense
agreement, the Company shall give Buyer the opportunity to participate in,
but not control, the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation
against the Company and/or its directors relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, provided, however, nothing herein shall
require either party to take any action that its counsel reasonably concludes
would jeopardize the work product privilege or the attorney-client privilege.
The Company shall not enter into any settlement of such litigation without
Buyers prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  

## 6.14 _Notification of Layoffs_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
provide the Buyer with written notice of the number of employees of the
Company and each of the Companys Subsidiaries laid off within the ninety
(90) calendar days preceding the Closing Date.

paid the applicable termination fee in accordance with Section 8.3(c); or

  

### (g) by the Buyer, if there has been a breach of or failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company
set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would
cause the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) not to be
satisfied, and (ii) cannot be cured by the Company by the Outside Date or, if
curable, shall not have been cured within 20 days following receipt by the
Company of written notice of such breach or failure to perform from the
Buyer; or

  

### (h) by the Company, if there has been a breach of or failure to perform
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Buyer
or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform
(i) would cause the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a) or 7.3(b) not to
be satisfied, and (ii) cannot be cured by the Buyer by the Outside Date or,
if curable, shall not have been cured within 20 days following receipt by the
Buyer of written notice of such breach or failure to perform from the
Company; or

  

### (i) by the Company if (i) the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 and
7.2 and the proviso to Section 1.2 have been satisfied (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at Closing, and on the
date of such termination no state of facts or circumstances exists that would
cause such conditions not to be satisfied if the Closing were to occur), (ii)
on or before the Closing Date, none of the Buyer, the Merger Sub or
the Surviving Corporation shall have received the proceeds of the
financings contemplated by the Commitment Letters or any substitute financing
for a similar amount and (iii) the Buyer fails to notify the Company in
writing with supporting evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company that,
notwithstanding the developments in clause (ii), it will still be able to
deposit the requisite funds with the Exchange Agent in accordance with
Section 2.2 on the Closing Date.

  

## 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall immediately become
void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of the Buyer,
the Company, Merger Sub or their respective officers, directors, stockholders
or Affiliates; provided that (a) any such termination shall not relieve
any party from liability for any fraud or willful breach of this
Agreement (including, in the case of the Buyer and Merger Sub, but subject to
the Buyer Liability Limitation, damages based on the consideration payable to
the stockholders of the Company as contemplated by this Agreement) and (b)
the provisions of Sections 5.2 (Company Cash), 5.3 (Confidentiality) and 8.3
(Fees and Expenses), this Section 8.2 (Effect of Termination) and Article IX
(Miscellaneous) of this

        

## Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and survive any termination of this Agreement.

  

## 8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

  

### (a) Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such fees and expenses, whether
or not the Merger is consummated.

  

### (b) If the Company or the Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(d), the Company shall promptly pay the Buyer the lesser of (i)
$4,250,000 and (ii) the documented, out-of-pocket fees and expenses of Buyer,
Sponsor and their Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

### (c) If the Buyer or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(e) or Section 8.1(f), respectively, the Company shall pay to the
Buyer or its designee a termination fee of $26,000,000 concurrently with (and
as a condition to) the termination of this Agreement by the Company or no
later than two (2) Business Days after such termination by the Buyer,
as applicable.

  

### (d) If the Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(g) or
if the Buyer or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(b) or Section 8.1(d), and (i) if prior to the date of such termination
(but on or after the date hereof) a bona fide Acquisition Proposal is
publicly announced or is otherwise communicated to the Company Board and (ii)
within twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, either the
Company consummates an Acquisition Proposal or the Company enters into
a definitive agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (which in
either case need not be the same Acquisition Proposal as under clause (i))
and such Acquisition Proposal is otherwise consummated, whether within or
without such 12 month period, the Company shall pay to the Buyer or its
designee a termination fee of $26,000,000 (less any amounts previously paid
or owing pursuant to Section 8.3(b)) concurrently with the consummation of
such Acquisition Proposal; provided, that solely for purposes of this
Section 8.3(d), the term Acquisition Proposal shall have the meaning ascribed
thereto in Section 6.1, except that all references to twenty percent (20%)
therein shall be changed to fifty percent (50%);

  

### (e) In the event this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 8.1(i) and the Buyer has failed to consummate the Merger by reason of
a failure of the Buyer or Merger Sub to receive the proceeds of the debt
financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, then the Buyer shall
pay to the Company a fee of $26,000,000 (the " _Buyer Termination Fee_ ")
within two (2) business days after such termination by the Company. If the
Buyer Termination Fee is paid, and the Buyer and Merger Sub are not otherwise
in willful breach of this Agreement (other than any such breach arising from
the failure by the Buyer, after complying with its obligations under Section
5.4 of this Agreement, to obtain the Debt

        

### Financing) and none of the Buyer, the Merger Sub or the Sponsor
has committed fraud against the Company, then the Companys termination of
this Agreement and receipt of payment of the Buyer Termination Fee shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy against the Buyer, Merger Sub, the Sponsor and
any of their respective Representatives, Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, partners, managers, members, or stockholders (each, a " _Buyer
Party_ ") for any loss or damage suffered as a result of the breach of this
Agreement or any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
herein by the Buyer or Merger Sub or the failure of the Merger to be
consummated or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (such losses or damages, collectively, "
_Company Damages_ "). Company Damages shall include, and the Company shall be
entitled to recover, notwithstanding the absence of third party beneficiary
rights, any damages suffered by the Companys stockholders as a group in the
event of a successful claim by the Company pursuant to Section 8.2(a) for the
Buyers or the Merger Subs willful breach of this Agreement or fraud prior
to termination.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the maximum aggregate liability of all the Buyer Parties for all Company
Damages shall be limited to $60,000,000 (the " _Buyer Liability Limitation_
") (it being understood that, for all purposes of determining whether the
aggregate amount of Company Damages paid by the Buyer Parties has reached the
Buyer Liability Limitation, the amount paid in respect of the Buyer
Termination Fee shall be included as Company Damages and therefore the
parties agree that the sum of the aggregate amount of Company Damages (not
including the Buyer Termination Fee) paid plus the aggregate amount of the
Buyer Termination Fee paid by all the Buyer Parties may never exceed
$60,000,000) under any circumstances.) In no event shall the Company seek, and
the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries not to seek, any Company Damages or
any other recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind, including
consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against any Buyer Party in
excess of Buyer Liability Limitation from any Buyer Party in connection
therewith and the Company, its Affiliates and its Subsidiaries shall be
precluded from any other remedy against any Buyer Party at Law or in equity
or otherwise. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in all cases, the maximum liability of the Sponsor, directly or
indirectly, shall be limited to the express obligations of the Sponsor under
its Guarantee. For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the first sentence of
this Section 8.3(e), there shall be no liability of any Buyer Party for
Company Damages other than liability for fraud or the willful breach by the
Buyer of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement.

  

### (f) Each of the Company and the Buyer acknowledge that the agreements
contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the
parties would not enter into this Agreement. Payment of the termination fees
described in this Section 8.3 shall not be in lieu of damages incurred in the
event of fraud or a willful breach of this Agreement described in clause (a)
of Section 8.2, but otherwise shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy
of the parties in connection with any termination of this Agreement. If the
Company shall fail to pay the termination fee payable under Section 8.3 when
due or the Buyer shall fail to pay the Buyer Termination Fee when due, the
defaulting party shall reimburse the non-defaulting party for all

        

### reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred or accrued by such non-
defaulting party (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel)
in connection with the collection under and enforcement of this Section
8.3 together with interest on the amount of the Companys termination fee
under Section 8.3 or the Buyer Termination Fee, as the case may be, from the
date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the
prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required
to be made.

  

## 8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by
action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any
time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the
Merger by the stockholders of any party, but, after any such approval, no
amendment shall be made which by Law requires further approval by
such stockholders without such further approval.  This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties hereto.

  

## 8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards
of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto
and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument
signed on behalf of such party. Such extension or waiver shall not apply
to any time for performance, inaccuracy in any representation or warranty,
or noncompliance with any agreement or condition, as the case may be, other
than that which is specified in the extension or waiver. The failure of any
party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

Any party to this Agreement may give any notice or other communication
hereunder using any other means (including personal delivery, messenger
service, telex, ordinary mail or electronic mail), but no such notice or
other communication shall be deemed to have been duly given unless and until
it actually is received by the party for whom it is intended. Any party to
this Agreement may change the address to which notices and other
communications hereunder are to be delivered by giving the other parties to
this Agreement notice in the manner herein set forth.

  

## 9.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules
and Exhibits hereto and the documents and instruments referred to herein that
are to be delivered at the Closing) constitutes the entire agreement among
the parties to this Agreement and supersedes any prior understandings,
agreements or representations by or among the parties hereto, or any of them,
written or oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof, and the parties
hereto specifically disclaim reliance on any such prior understandings,
agreements or representations to the extent not embodied in this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in
effect in accordance with its terms except to the extent expressly set forth
in the parenthetical at the end of Section 5.3.

  

## 9.4 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended, and
shall not be deemed, to confer any rights or remedies upon any Person (or any
Affiliate of such Person) other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, to create any agreement of employment with
any Person or to otherwise create any third-party beneficiary hereto, except:
(a) holders, as of the Effective Time, of Company Common Stock, Company Stock
Options and Restricted Shares shall be third party beneficiaries from and
after the occurrence of the Effective Time with respect to Article II, but
shall have no rights under this Agreement before the Effective Time or in the
event this Agreement terminates for any reason without the Effective
Time having occurred and (b) the Indemnified Parties shall be third
party beneficiaries from and after the occurrence of the Effective Time with
respect to Section 6.8, but shall have no rights under this Agreement before
the Effective Time or in the event this Agreement terminates for any reason
without the Effective Time having occurred. No provision in this Agreement
shall modify or amend any Company Employee Plan unless this Agreement
explicitly states that the provision "amends" such Company Employee Plan.
This shall not prevent the parties entitled to enforce this Agreement from
enforcing any provision in this Agreement, but no other party shall be
entitled to enforce any provision in this Agreement on the grounds that it is
an amendment to such Company Employee Plan. If a party not entitled to
enforce this Agreement brings a lawsuit or other action to enforce any
provision in this Agreement as an amendment to such Company Employee Plan and
that provision is construed to be such an amendment despite not
being explicitly designated as one in this Agreement, that provision shall
lapse retroactively as of its inception, thereby precluding it from having
any amendatory effect.

  

## 9.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests
or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or
in part, by operation of Law or

        

## otherwise by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent
of the other parties, and any such assignment without such prior written
consent shall be null and void; _provided_ that Buyer may assign its rights
and obligations to any wholly owned Subsidiary to which it transfers
substantially all of its assets, with the Buyer remaining responsible for any
of its obligations under this Agreement; and _provided_   _further_ , that
the Merger Sub may assign its rights to any Affiliate thereof, with the
Merger Sub remaining responsible for any of its obligations under this
Agreement.

  

## 9.6 _Severability._ Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall
not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and
provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or
provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that
the court making such determination shall have the power to limit the term or
provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and
enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid
or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable
as so modified.  In the event such court does not exercise the power granted
to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid
or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or
provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term.

  

## 9.7 _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two (2)
or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of
which together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall
become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties
hereto and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed
and delivered by facsimile transmission.

  

## 9.8 _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to an
Article or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of
this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, table of
defined terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and
no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any party. Whenever
the context may require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include
the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form
of nouns and pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa. For purposes
of this Agreement, references to any Law, including the Code, ERISA and
Takeover Statutes, shall also be deemed to be references to any successor,
amended or modified provisions thereof (except, that when used in Section
3.21(a) but not in Section 6.12, the statutes referenced in Section 3.21(a)
shall refer only to those statutes as in effect on the date hereof).
Any reference to any federal, state, local or foreign Law shall be deemed
also to refer to all rules and

        

## regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise.
Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." No summary of this Agreement prepared by any party shall affect
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

  

## 9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or any other jurisdiction) that
would cause the application of Laws of any jurisdictions other than those of
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

  

## 9.10 _Remedies._ The parties recognize and agree that if for any reason
any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed by the Company in
accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached, immediate and
irreparable harm or injury would be caused for which money damages would not
be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party agrees that, in addition to
other remedies, prior to any termination of this Agreement permitted by and
in accordance with Section 8.1, the Buyer and Merger Sub shall be entitled to
specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at
Law or equity. In the event that any action shall be brought in equity to
enforce the provisions of the Agreement, the Company shall not allege, and
hereby waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at Law. The
parties further acknowledge that the Company shall not be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Buyer
or Merger Sub or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement and that the Companys sole and exclusive remedy with respect
to any such breach shall be the Buyer Termination Fee (if applicable) and,
if applicable, the other remedies at Law available to the Company to the
extent set forth in Section 8.3 (subject to the Buyer Liability Limitation);
provided, however, that the Company shall be entitled to specific performance
against the Buyer and Merger Sub to prevent any breach by the Buyer or Merger
Sub of Section 6.4.

  

## 9.11 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties to this
Agreement (a) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any
state or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, State of New York
in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that all
claims in respect of such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined
in any such court, (c) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat
such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, and (d) agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or any of the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement in any other court. Each of the parties hereto waives any
defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding
so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that might be
required of any other party with respect thereto. Any party hereto may make
service on another party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to
the party to be served at the address and in the manner provided for the
giving of notices in Section 9.2.

        

## Nothing in this Section 9.11, however, shall affect the right of any party
to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law.

  

## 9.12 _Disclosure Schedules_. The Company Disclosure Schedule shall each
be arranged in Sections corresponding to the numbered sections contained in
this Agreement, and the disclosure in any section shall qualify (a) the
corresponding section of this Agreement and (b) the other sections of this
Agreement, to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from a reading of
such disclosure that it also qualifies or applies to such other sections. The
inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be
deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such
information is required by the terms hereof to be disclosed, is material, has
resulted in or is reasonably expected to result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect or is outside the Ordinary Course of Business.

  

## 9.13 _Company s Knowledge_. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Company s Knowledge_" means the actual knowledge of the individuals
identified in Section 9.13 of the Company Disclosure Schedule; provided,
however, that for purposes of Article III of this Agreement, the term
"Companys Knowledge" means the actual knowledge of such individuals as of
the date hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent that there would
be inaccuracies in representations and warranties in Article III if the
foregoing proviso were not to apply, the changes, conditions, events and
developments causing or contributing to such inaccuracies shall
not necessarily be disregarded for purposes of the first sentence of Section
3.7 notwithstanding the foregoing proviso or any provision that
limits representations about such changes, conditions, events and
developments to only a specified section of Article III.

  

## 9.14 _Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to
this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of
this Agreement may only be made against entities that are expressly
identified as parties hereto (or the Sponsor to the extent set forth in the
Guarantee) and no past, present or future Affiliate, director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, manager, partner, stockholder, agent,
attorney or representatives of any party hereto (other than the Sponsor to
the extent set forth in the Guarantee) shall have any liability for any
obligations or liabilities of the parties to this Agreement or for any claim
based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 **STOCKHOLDER VOTING AGREEMENT**

  

THIS STOCKHOLDER VOTING AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is entered into as of
, 2007 by and among the stockholders listed on the signature page(s)
hereto (collectively, the "Stockholders" and each individually, a
"Stockholder"), Keane, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (the "Company"), and
Caritor, Inc., a California corporation ("Buyer").  Capitalized terms used
and not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings assigned
to them in the Merger Agreement referred to below.

  

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, the Stockholders collectively own of record
and beneficially the shares of Common Stock, $.10 par value per share, of the
Company (such shares being referred to herein collectively as the "Shares"
and, for the avoidance of doubt, all references herein to a Stockholders
Shares shall include not only all the Shares opposite such Stockholders name
on Schedule I, but also all additional shares of Company Common Stock that
are owned directly or indirectly by such Stockholder or any Person controlled
by or under common control with such Stockholder, subject in all cases to
Transfers of such Shares that have been made to Permitted Transferees to the
extent permitted by and in accordance with Section 2(a)) set forth opposite
their respective names on _Schedule I_ hereto;

  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Buyer, Buyers
Subsidiary, a Massachusetts corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of
Buyer ("Merger Sub"), and the Company are entering into an Agreement and Plan
of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (as amended, restated, supplemented or
otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof,
the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions thereof, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, and
the Company will be the surviving corporation (the "Merger"); and

  

WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of Buyer to enter into the Merger
Agreement, Buyer has required that the Stockholders enter into, and in order
to induce Buyer to enter into the Merger Agreement, the Stockholders are
willing to enter into, this Agreement.

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants
and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby,
the parties hereby agree, severally and not jointly, as follows:

  

Section 1. _Voting of Shares_. Each Stockholder covenants and agrees
that until the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms
hereof, at the Company Meeting or any other meeting of the stockholders of
the Company, however called, and in any action by written consent of the
stockholders of the Company, such Stockholder (a) will vote or consent to, or
cause to be voted or consented to, all of his, her or its Shares to approve
the Merger Agreement and (b) will vote all of his, her or its Shares against,
and not provide consents to, any and all Acquisition Proposals and agreements
providing for Acquisition Proposals or any proposal or nomination made by a
Person who is, or whose Affiliate is, making, or has communicated an
intention to make, an Acquisition Proposal. In the event the
Merger Agreement is amended in accordance with its terms to provide for a
tender offer structure, such Stockholder shall tender his, her or its Shares
before the scheduled expiration date for such tender offer by Buyer.     

Section 2. _Transfer of Shares_.

  

(a) Each Stockholder covenants and agrees that, without the written consent
of Buyer, such Stockholder will not directly or indirectly (i) sell, assign,
transfer (including by merger, interspousal disposition pursuant to a
domestic relations proceeding or otherwise by operation of law), pledge,
encumber, assign or otherwise dispose of ("Transfer") any Shares or the
Beneficial Ownership (as hereinafter defined) thereof (except to a Permitted
Transferee), (ii) deposit any Shares into a voting trust or enter into a
voting agreement or arrangement with respect to any Shares or the Beneficial
Ownership thereof or grant or agree to grant any proxy or power of attorney
with respect thereto which is inconsistent with this Agreement or (iii) enter
into any contract, option or other arrangement or undertaking with respect to
the direct or indirect Transfer of any Shares or the Beneficial Ownership
thereof (except, in each case under clause (i) and this clause (iii), to a
Permitted Transferee). For purpose of this Agreement, "Beneficial Ownership"
shall have the meaning given to such term in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange
Act (disregarding the reference to "within 60 days" in Rule 13d-3(d)(1)(i)).
As used herein, a "Permitted Transferee" shall mean a Person that (A) is
a signatory to this Agreement as of the date hereof, owns Shares continuously
from the date hereof through the time of the action proposed under Section
2(a)(i) or Section 2(a)(iii), and has not violated this Agreement or (B)
before such action proposed under Section 2(a)(i) or Section 2(a)(iii)
occurs, agrees in writing, in form and substance to the reasonable
satisfaction of Buyer, to be bound as a Stockholder under this Agreement and
has not violated this Agreement. In connection with any Transfer of Shares
to a Permitted Transferee, the transferring Stockholder may transfer its
rights and obligations under this Agreement to the Permitted Transferee, but
the transferring Stockholder shall remain primarily liable for all breaches
of such obligations before such Transfer and shall remain secondarily liable
for all breaches of such transferred obligations from and after such
Transfer. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this
Agreement shall permit any Transfer of Shares, Beneficial Ownership, rights
or obligations or any other action that would otherwise be permitted by this
Section 2(a) if such Transfer or other action would create any material
impediment or delay to the performance or consummation of the Merger
Agreement or this Agreement, including, without limitation, triggering the
applicability of any Takeover Statute to the Merger Agreement, this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or this
Agreement.

  

(b) Each Stockholder undertakes that, while this Agreement is in effect,
except as contemplated by Section 7, such Stockholder shall not, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, propose or knowingly encourage or take any
other action to knowingly facilitate an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into
any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement, option
agreement, voting agreement or other agreement or arrangement with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) enter into, continue, participate, engage
or knowingly assist in any manner in negotiations or discussions with, or
provide any non-public information or data to, any person (other than Buyer
or any of its affiliates or representatives) relating to any Acquisition
Proposal.

        

Section 3. _Reasonable Efforts to Cooperate_.

  

(a) Except as contemplated by Section 7, each Stockholder will, without
further consideration, promptly provide any information reasonably requested
by the Company, Buyer or Merger Sub for any regulatory application or filing
made or approval sought in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Merger Agreement (including filings with the SEC or any
other Governmental Entity).

  

(b) Each Stockholder hereby consents to the publication and disclosure in the
Proxy Statement, statements of beneficial ownership filed by Buyer and its
Affiliates (and any other documents or communications provided by Buyer,
Merger Sub or the Company to any Governmental Entity or to security holders
of the Company) such Stockholders identity and Beneficial Ownership of the
Shares and the nature of such Stockholders commitments, arrangements and
understandings under and relating to this Agreement.

  

(c) Each Stockholder agrees, while this Agreement is in effect, (i) upon
written request by Buyer, to notify Buyer promptly in writing of the number
of additional Shares, any options to purchase Shares or other securities of
the Company acquired by such Stockholder, if any, after the date hereof and
(ii) to notify Buyer promptly in writing if it receives, in its capacity as a
Stockholder, any inquiries or proposals relating to the matters contemplated
by Section 2(b) and to include in such notice the identity of
the counterparty and the material provisions of the inquiry or proposal.

  

Section 4. _Representations and Warranties of the Stockholders_. Each
Stockholder on such Stockholders own behalf hereby severally, and not
jointly, represents and warrants to Buyer as follows:

  

(a) _Ownership of Shares_. Except as set forth on _Schedule I_ hereto, the
Stockholder (i) is the sole owner of record and Beneficial Owner of all of
the Shares as set forth opposite his, her or its name on _Schedule I_ hereto
and (ii) has sole voting power with respect to all of such Shares and has not
entered into any voting agreement or voting trust with respect to any such
Shares and has not as of the date hereof granted a proxy, a consent or power
of attorney with respect to such Shares and, so long as this Agreement is in
effect, will not grant any such proxies, consents and powers of attorney with
respect to such Shares that are inconsistent with this Agreement.

  

(b) _Power, Binding Agreement_. The Stockholder has the requisite power and
authority to enter into and perform all of its obligations under this
Agreement and no further proceedings or actions on the part of such
Stockholder are necessary to authorize the execution, delivery or performance
by such Stockholder of this Agreement or the consummation by such Stockholder
of the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by the Stockholder and constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of the Stockholder, enforceable against the Stockholder in
accordance with its terms.

        

(c) _No Conflicts_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Stockholder do not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby by the Stockholder will not, result in any breach or violation of,
require any consent under, be in conflict with or constitute a default
(whether with notice of lapse of time or both) under any mortgage, bond,
indenture, agreement, instrument, obligation, judgment, order, decree, law or
regulation to which the Stockholder is a party or by which the Stockholder
(or his, her or its Shares) are bound, except for any such breach, violation,
conflict or default which, individually or in the aggregate, would not in any
material respect impair or adversely affect the Stockholders ability to
perform his, her or its obligations under this Agreement. Except as expressly
contemplated hereby or as set forth on _Schedule I_ hereto, the Stockholder
is not a party to any voting agreement or voting trust relating to the
Shares.

  

Section 5. _Termination_. This Agreement shall terminate upon the first to
occur of (a) the Effective Time and (b) any termination of the
Merger Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof.  Any such termination
shall be without prejudice to liabilities arising hereunder before such
termination.

  

Section 6. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement
was not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties
shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to
any other remedy at law or in equity.

  

Section 7. _Fiduciary Duties_. Each Stockholder is signing this
Agreement solely in such Stockholders capacity as an owner of his, her or
its respective Shares, and nothing herein shall prohibit, prevent or preclude
such Stockholder from taking or not taking any action in his or her capacity
as an officer or director of the Company.

  

Section 8. _Miscellaneous_.

  

(a) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among
the parties hereto, written or oral, with respect to the subject matter
hereof, and the parties hereto specifically disclaim reliance on any such
prior understandings, agreements or representations to the extent not
embodied in this Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or
rescinded except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties
hereto; provided, that Buyer and Merger Sub may waive compliance by any other
party with any representation, agreement or condition otherwise required to
be complied with by any such party under this Agreement or release any other
party from its obligations under this Agreement, but any such waiver or
release shall be effective only if in writing and executed by Buyer and
Merger Sub.

  

(b) _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or
the validity or enforceability of the offending term

        

or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction.  If the
final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that
the court making such determination shall have the power to limit the term or
provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and
enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid
or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable
as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted
to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid
or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or
provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term.

  

(c) _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts.

  

(d) _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two (2)
or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of
which together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall
become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties
hereto and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and
delivered by facsimile transmission.

  

(e) _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be deemed duly delivered (i) four Business Days after being
sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage
prepaid, or (ii) one Business Day after being sent for next Business Day
delivery, fees prepaid, via a reputable nationwide overnight courier service,

Execution Copy

  

 **LIMITED GUARANTEE 
 OF 
 COURT SQUARE CAPITAL LIMITED**

  

LIMITED GUARANTEE, dated as of , 2007 (this "
_Guarantee_ "), by Court Square Capital Limited, a Delaware corporation (the
" _Guarantor_ "), in favor of Keane, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (the "
_Company_ ").

  

1. _GUARANTEE_. To induce the Company to enter into that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of , 2007 (as amended, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof, the " _Merger Agreement_ "; capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Merger Agreement), by and among the Company, Caritor, Inc., a California corporation (" _Buyer_ "), and Renaissance Acquisition Corp. a Massachusetts corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer (" _Merger Sub_ "), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, the Guarantor absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Company the due and punctual observance, payment, performance and discharge of (i) the payment obligations of Buyer with respect to the Buyer Termination Fee, (ii) any Company Damages for which Buyer is liable after the termination of the Merger Agreement as a result of any fraud by Sponsor, Buyer or Merger Sub or willful breach by Buyer or Merger Sub of any of their representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in the Merger Agreement in each case as provided in Section 8.2(a) of the Merger Agreement and (iii) any payment obligations of the Buyer pursuant to Section 5.4(d) (Companys financing expenses), 5.2(a) (expenses of liquidation and conversion of unrestricted cash equivalents) or 8.3(f) (expenses enforcing termination fee) of the Merger Agreement (each of (i), (ii) and (iii) is referred to herein individually as an " _Obligation_ " and collectively as the " _Obligations_ "); provided that in no event shall the Guarantors aggregate liability under this Guarantee exceed $60,000,000 (the "Cap"), it being understood that this Guarantee may not be enforced against the Guarantor without giving effect to the Cap.

  

If the Buyer is in breach of any of its Obligations, then all of the
Guarantors liabilities to the Company hereunder in respect of such
Obligations shall, at the Companys option, become immediately due and
payable and the Company may at any time and from time to time, at the
Companys option, and so long as Buyer remains in breach of its Obligations,
take any and all actions available hereunder or under applicable Law to
collect the Guarantors liabilities hereunder in respect of such Obligations,
subject to the Cap.

  

2. _NATURE OF GUARANTEE_. The Company shall not be obligated to file any claim relating to the Obligations in the event that Buyer or Merger Sub becomes subject to a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, and the failure of the Company to so file shall not affect the Guarantors obligations hereunder. In the event that any payment to the Company in respect of any Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any reason whatsoever, the Guarantor shall remain liable hereunder with respect to such Obligations as if such payment had not been made. This is an unconditional guarantee of payment and not of collectibility. The Guarantor reserves the right to assert defenses which Buyer or Merger Sub may have to payment of any Obligations other than defenses arising from the bankruptcy or insolvency of Buyer or Merger Sub and other defenses expressly waived hereby.     

3. _CHANGES IN OBLIGATIONS, CERTAIN WAIVERS_. The Guarantor agrees that the Company may at any time and from time to time, without notice to or further consent of the Guarantor, extend the time of payment of any of the Obligations, and may also make any agreement with Buyer or Merger Sub for the extension, renewal, payment, compromise, discharge or release thereof, in whole or in part, or for any modification of the terms thereof or of any agreement between the Company and Buyer or Merger Sub or any such other person without in any way impairing or affecting this Guarantee. The Guarantor agrees that the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall not be released or discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (a) the failure of the Company to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against Buyer or Merger Sub or any other entity or person interested in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (b) any change in the time, place or manner of payment of any of the Obligations or any rescission, waiver, compromise, consolidation or other amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of the Merger Agreement made in accordance with the terms thereof or any other agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any of the Obligations; (c) the addition, substitution or release of any other entity or person interested in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (d) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of Buyer or Merger Sub or any other entity or person interested in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (e) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting Buyer or Merger Sub or any other entity or person interested in the transactions contemplated in the Merger Agreement; (f) the existence of any claim, set-off or other rights which the Guarantor may have at any time against Buyer, Merger Sub or the Company, whether in connection with the Obligations or otherwise; or (g) the adequacy of any other means the Company may have of obtaining payment of the Obligations. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Guarantor hereby expressly waives any and all rights or defenses arising by reason of any Law which would otherwise require any election of remedies by the Company. The Guarantor waives promptness, diligence, notice of the acceptance of this Guarantee and of the Obligations, presentment, demand for payment, notice of non-performance, default, dishonor and protest, notice of any Obligations incurred and all other notices of any kind (except for notices to be provided to Buyer and Merger Sub in accordance with Section 9.2 of the Merger Agreement), all defenses which may be available by virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium law or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, any right to require the marshalling of assets of the Buyer or Merger Sub or any other entity or other person interested in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and all suretyship defenses generally (in all cases, other than fraud or willful misconduct by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or defenses to the payment of the Obligations that are available to Buyer or Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement or breach by the Company of this Guarantee). The Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and that the waivers set forth in this Guarantee are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits. The Company hereby covenants and agrees that it shall not institute, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to institute, any proceeding or bring any other claim arising under, or in connection with, the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, against the

        

Guarantor or any of the Guarantors former, current or future directors,
officers, agents, Affiliates (other than Buyer or Merger Sub) or employees,
or against any of the former, current or future general or limited partners,
members, managers or stockholders of the Guarantor or any Affiliate thereof
(other than Buyer or Merger Sub) or against any former, current or future
directors, officers, agents, Affiliates, general or limited partners,
members, managers or stockholders of any of the foregoing (other than Buyer
or Merger Sub), except for claims against Guarantor under this Guarantee.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Guarantee, the
Company hereby agrees that to the extent Buyer and Merger Sub are relieved of
any Obligations under the Merger Agreement (other than as a result of
defenses arising from the bankruptcy or insolvency of Buyer or Merger Sub or
other defenses expressly waived hereby), the Guarantor shall be similarly
relieved of its obligations under the Guarantee.

  

4. _NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE RIGHTS_. No failure on the part of the Company to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise by the Company of any right, remedy or power hereunder preclude any other or future exercise of any right, remedy or power hereunder. Each and every right, remedy and power hereby granted to the Company or allowed it by law or other agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other, and may be exercised by the Company at any time or from time to time.

  

5. _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_. The Guarantor hereby represents and warrants that:

  

(a) the execution, delivery and performance of this Guarantee have been duly
authorized by all necessary action and do not contravene any provision of the
Guarantors partnership agreement, operating agreement or similar
organizational documents or any law, regulation, rule, decree, order,
judgment or contractual restriction binding on the Guarantor or its assets;

  

(b) all consents, approvals, authorizations and permits of, filings with and
notifications to, any governmental authority necessary for the due execution,

delivery or performance of this Guarantee;

  

(c) this Guarantee constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the

subject to (i) the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors rights
generally, and (ii) general equitable principles (whether considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law); and

  

(d) Guarantor has the financial capacity to pay and perform its obligations
under this Guarantee, and all funds necessary for the Guarantor to fulfill
its obligations under this

        

Guarantee shall be available to the Guarantor for so long as this Guarantee
shall remain in effect in accordance with Section 8 hereof.

  

6. _NO ASSIGNMENT_. Neither the Guarantor nor the Company may assign or transfer its rights, interests or obligations hereunder to any other person (except by operation of Law) without the prior written consent of the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be; provided, however, that the Guarantor may transfer all or a portion of its obligations hereunder to an Affiliate or to an entity managed or advised by an Affiliate of the Guarantor, provided that no such transfer shall relieve the Guarantor of any liability or obligation hereunder except to the extent actually performed or satisfied by the transferee.

8. _CONTINUING GUARANTEE_. This Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect and shall be binding on the Guarantor, its successors and permitted assigns until all amounts payable under this Guarantee have been indefeasibly paid or satisfied in full. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Guarantee shall terminate and the Guarantor shall have no further obligations under this Guarantee as of the earlier of (a) the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement), (b) the valid termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms pursuant to Section 8.1(a), 8.1(d), 8.1(e), 8.1(f) or 8.1(g) and (c) the first anniversary of any other termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, except, in the case of clause (c), as to a claim for payment of any Obligation presented by the Company to Buyer, Merger Sub or the Guarantor by such first anniversary.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries asserts in any litigation or other proceeding that the provisions of Section 1 hereof limiting the Guarantors liabilities to the Cap or the provisions of Section 8 or 9 hereof are illegal, invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part or asserts any theory of liability against the Guarantor or any Affiliates of the Guarantor with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement other than liability of the Guarantor with respect to this Guarantee (as limited by the provisions of Section 1), then (i) the obligations of the Guarantor under this Guarantee shall terminate _ab initio_ and be null and void, (ii) if the Guarantor has previously made any payments under this Guarantee, it shall be entitled to recover such payments, and (iii) neither the Guarantor nor any Affiliate of the Guarantor shall have any liability to the Company with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or under this Guarantee; provided, however, that if the Guarantor asserts in any litigation or other proceeding that this Guarantee is illegal, invalid or unenforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors rights generally, and general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), then, to the extent the Company prevails in such litigation or proceeding, the Guarantor shall pay on demand all reasonable fees and out of pocket expenses of the Company in connection with such litigation or proceeding.

  

9. _NO RECOURSE_. The Company by its acceptance of the benefits hereof, covenants, agrees and acknowledges that no Person other than the Guarantor shall have any obligation hereunder and that no recourse hereunder or under any documents or instruments delivered in connection herewith shall be had against any former, current or future director, officer, agent, Affiliate (other than Buyer or Merger Sub) or employee of the Guarantor, against any former, current or future general or limited partner, member, manager or stockholder of the Guarantor or any Affiliate thereof (other than Buyer or Merger Sub) or against any former, current or future director, officer, agent, Affiliate, employee, general or limited partner, member, manager or stockholder of any of the foregoing (other than Buyer or Merger Sub), whether by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or other applicable Law. The Company acknowledges and agrees that Merger Sub has no assets and that no funds are expected to be contributed by Buyer or Merger Sub unless the Closing occurs.  Recourse against the Guarantor under this Guarantee shall be the exclusive remedy of the Company and its Subsidiaries against the Guarantor or any of its former,

        

current or future directors, officers, agents, Affiliates, general or limited
partners, members, managers or stockholders in respect of any liabilities or
obligations arising under, or in connection with, the Merger Agreement or the
transactions contemplated thereby. The Company hereby covenants and agrees
that it shall not institute, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to
institute, any proceeding or bring any other claim arising under, or in
connection with, the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated
thereby, against the Guarantor or any of its former, current or future
directors, officers, agents, Affiliates (other than Buyer or Merger Sub),
general or limited partners, members, managers or stockholder except
for claims against the Guarantor under this Guarantee. Except in accordance
with Section 6 hereof, nothing set forth in this Guarantee shall affect or be
construed to give any Person (other than the Guarantor and the Company
(including any Person acting in a representative capacity and any Affiliate
of the Company)) any rights or remedies against any Person.

  

10. _GOVERNING LAW_. This Guarantee shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of Laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  All actions arising out of or relating to this Guarantee shall be heard and determined exclusively in the state or federal courts of the United States of America located in the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York, New York. The parties hereto hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state or federal courts of the United States of America located in the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York, New York for the purpose of any action arising out of or relating to this Guarantee brought by any party hereto, and (b) irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such action, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named court, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the action is improper, or that this Guarantee or the transactions contemplated hereby may not be enforced in or by the above-named court.

  

11. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS GUARANTEE OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

  

12. _COUNTERPARTS_. This Guarantee may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
