3.2(b)_. If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent
Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased,
changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or
securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other
similar change in capitalization, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment
shall be made to the Merger Consideration.

(c) At the Effective Time, (i) all shares of Company Common Stock that are
owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company (in each case, other than in a
fiduciary capacity) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no stock
of Parent, cash or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor, and (ii) each share of Company Common Stock held by any direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Sub) or the
Company, in each case, immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

(d) The sole limited liability company interest of Merger Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain
outstanding as the sole limited liability company interest of the Surviving
Entity at and immediately after the Effective Time.

 

2.7 _Parent Common Stock_. At and immediately after the Effective Time, each
share of Parent capital stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be affected
by the Merger.

2.8 _Company Equity and Equity-Based Awards_.

(a) _Company Stock Options_. As of immediately prior to, but conditioned upon,
the consummation of the Merger, each option to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plan that is then-outstanding and
unvested shall vest and become fully exercisable, whether or not then subject
to any performance condition or other restriction. Subject to _Section 3.3_,
at the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
granted under the Company Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (the " _Company Stock Options_ "), after giving effect to
any vesting acceleration in connection with the Merger, shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
cancelled. In exchange for the cancellation of each Company Stock Option,
subject to this _Section 2.8(a)_, the Surviving Entity shall issue to the
holder of such Company Stock Option, in respect of such Company Stock Option,
the Merger Consideration (if any) that would otherwise be payable pursuant to
_Section 2.6_ in respect of such Company Stock Option (assuming such Company
Stock Option was exercised on a net exercise basis in accordance with the
Company Stock Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time in exchange for
Company Common Stock), as and when such Merger Consideration (or portion
thereof) would otherwise be payable to holders of Company Common Stock. With
respect to each Company Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, for purposes of this Agreement, the holder thereof shall
be deemed to have exercised such Company Stock Option on a net exercise basis,
and undertaken irrevocably to

 



17  convert the shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company Stock
Option pursuant to _Section 2.6_ and, in connection with such net exercise of
such Company Stock Option, agreed to relinquish that portion of the aggregate
Merger Consideration deliverable pursuant to _Section 2.6_ equal to the
aggregate per share exercise price of such Company Stock Option (such amount
of the Merger Consideration to be referred to as the " _Option Award
Consideration_ "). The Option Award Consideration (if a positive amount), less
applicable Tax withholdings, shall be paid or provided by Parent in accordance
with _Section 3.3_. Any Tax withholdings pursuant to this _Section 2.8(a)_
shall reduce the number of shares of Parent Common Stock deliverable pursuant
to this _Section 2.8(a)_, with such reduction based on the Parent Per Share
Value. Unless otherwise used to pay withholding Taxes, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 2.8(a)_, in lieu of the
issuance of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock in respect of Option
Award Consideration, Parent shall pay to any individual who otherwise would
be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded down
to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (x) the Parent Per Share Value
by (y) the fraction of a share (rounded down to the nearest thousandth when
expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock to which such individual
would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this _Section 2.8(a)_.

 

(b) _Company RSU Awards_. At the Effective Time, the restrictions and vesting
conditions applicable to each restricted stock unit award with respect to
shares of Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plan or
pursuant to the Founders Shares Stock Grant Award (each, a " _Company RSU
Award_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
that was granted prior to the date of this Agreement shall lapse at the
Effective Time in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Company
Stock Plan and the applicable Founders Shares Stock Grant Award, and each
such Company RSU Award shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, be converted as of the Effective Time into
the right to receive, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock
underlying such Company RSU Award, the Merger Consideration (the aggregate
amount of Merger Consideration in respect of all shares of Company Common
Stock underlying a Company RSU Award, the " _RSU Award Consideration_ "). The
RSU Award Consideration (if a positive amount), less applicable Tax
withholdings, shall be paid or provided by Parent in accordance with _Section
3.3_. Any Tax withholdings pursuant to this _Section 2.8(b)_ shall reduce the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock deliverable pursuant to this _Section
2.8(b)_, with such reduction based on the Parent Per Share Value. Unless
otherwise used to pay withholding Taxes, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this _Section 2.8(b)_, in lieu of the issuance of any
fractional share of Parent Common Stock in respect of RSU Award Consideration,
Parent shall pay to any Person who otherwise would be entitled to receive such
fractional share an amount in cash (rounded down to the nearest
cent) determined by multiplying (x) the Parent Per Share Value by (y) the
fraction of a share (rounded down to the nearest thousandth when expressed in
decimal form) of Parent Common Stock to which such Person would otherwise be
entitled to receive pursuant to this _Section 2.8(b)_.

2.9 _Intended Tax Treatment_. It is intended that the Merger will qualify as
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that
this Agreement is intended to be, and is adopted as, a "plan of
reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

 



18 2.10 _Payoff of Indebtedness and Unpaid Transaction Expenses; Deposit of
Escrow Amount; Deposit of Expense Fund Amount_. At the Effective Time, Parent
shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, (a) to each lender for which a Payoff
Letter was delivered pursuant to _Section 8.11(e)_, immediately available
funds in an amount equal to the aggregate amount owed by the Company or its
Subsidiaries to such Person as set forth in the applicable Payoff Letter, (b)
to each Person to which any portion of the Transaction Expenses are owed as
set forth in the certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 8.11(d)_,
immediately available funds in an amount equal to such Transaction Expenses as
set forth in the documentation delivered pursuant to _Section 8.11(f)_, (c)
the Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and
(d) the Expense Fund Amount to the Escrow Agent, which shall be held and
disbursed in accordance with _Section 10.3(e)_.

 

2.11 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(a) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date,
the Company shall deliver to Parent a written statement (the " _Estimated
Closing Statement_ ") setting forth its good faith estimate of the following
as of immediately prior to the anticipated Closing: (i) Net Adjusted Working
Capital (the " _Estimated Net Adjusted Working Capital_ "), (ii) Cash and
Cash Equivalents of the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than Restricted
Cash) (" _Estimated Closing Cash_ "), (iii) Indebtedness of the Company and
its Subsidiaries that remains (or is expected to remain) outstanding as of
immediately prior to the anticipated Closing (" _Estimated Closing
Indebtedness_ "), (iv) Transaction Expenses that remain (or are expected to
remain) outstanding as of immediately prior to the anticipated Closing ("
_Estimated Closing Transaction Expenses_ "), and (v) the Closing Liabilities.
The items set forth on the Estimated Closing Statement will be prepared in
accordance with GAAP on a basis consistent with the Companys practices used
in preparing the Financial Statements. The methodology and principles used in
the calculation of the items set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement
shall govern the calculation of the adjustments to the Initial Purchase Price
pursuant to this _Section 2.11_. A sample calculation of Net Adjusted Working
Capital of the Company as of May 31, 2014 is attached as _Exhibit I_ hereto.
The Estimated Closing Statement shall be used to make a preliminary
adjustment to the calculation of the Merger Consideration on the Closing Date
pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)_ (the " _Estimated Merger Consideration_ "),
subject to further adjustment in accordance with  _Section 2.11(c)_.

(b) If the Estimated Net Adjusted Working Capital reflected on the Estimated
Closing Statement is less than the Reference Net Adjusted Working Capital,
then the calculation of the Merger Consideration payable at Closing will be
decreased by such shortfall pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)(1)(x)(i)(D)_. If the
Estimated Net Adjusted Working Capital reflected on the Estimated Closing
Statement is greater than the Reference Net Adjusted Working Capital, then the
calculation of the Merger Consideration payable at Closing will be increased
by such excess pursuant to  _Section 2.6(a)(1)(x)(i)(D)_.

(c) The Estimated Merger Consideration shall be increased or decreased as set
forth in  _Section 2.11(g)_ hereof. Within sixty (60) days after the Closing
Date, Parent shall deliver to the Stockholders Representative a written
statement (the " _Preliminary Closing Statement_ ") setting forth (i)
Parents calculation of the following as of immediately prior to the Closing:
(A) Net Adjusted Working Capital; (B) Cash and Cash Equivalents of the Company
and its

 



19  Subsidiaries (other than Restricted Cash) (" _Final Closing Cash_ "); (C)
Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries that remained outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Closing (" _Final Closing Indebtedness_ "); and
(iv) Transaction Expenses that remained outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Closing (" _Final Closing Transaction Expenses_ "); and (ii) based on
the foregoing, Parents calculation of the Merger Consideration.

(d) The Stockholders Representative shall have a period of forty-five (45)
days after the date it receives the Preliminary Closing Statement from Parent
to deliver to Parent written notice of the Stockholders Representatives
disagreement with any item contained in the Preliminary Closing Statement,
which notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such
disagreement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ "). During the thirty (30)-day
period following the Stockholders Representatives receipt of
the Preliminary Closing Statement, Parent shall (i) permit the Stockholders
Representative and its accountants to consult with Parents accountants and
(ii) provide to the Stockholders Representative and its
accountants reasonable access during reasonable hours and under reasonable
circumstances to all relevant books and records and any work papers (including
those of Parents accountants, subject to execution of appropriate agreements
with Parents accountants) relating to the preparation of the Preliminary
Closing Statement, in each case as reasonably requested by the Stockholders
Representative in connection with the Stockholders Representatives review of
the Preliminary Closing Statement. If a Notice of Disagreement is timely
received by Parent, then the Preliminary Closing Statement (as revised in
accordance with clause (A) or (B) of this _Section 2.11(d)_) shall become the
Final Closing Statement and shall become final and binding upon the parties
on the earlier of (A) the date on which the Stockholders Representative and
Parent resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to the
matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement and (B) the date all matters
in dispute specified in the Notice of Disagreement are finally resolved in
writing by the Accounting Firm. During the thirty (30) days following Parents
receipt of a Notice of Disagreement, Parent and the Stockholders
Representative shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any differences
they have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement,
and upon such resolution, the Final Closing Statement shall be prepared in
accordance with the agreement of Parent and the Stockholders Representative.

(e) If Parent and the Stockholders Representative are unable to resolve the
disputed items set forth in the Notice of Disagreement within thirty (30) days
following Parents receipt of such Notice of Disagreement (or such longer
period as Parent and the Stockholders Representative may, in their
respective sole discretion, mutually agree in writing), following notice of
such dispute, such dispute shall be submitted to, and all issues having a
bearing on such dispute shall be resolved by a nationally recognized
accounting firm mutually agreed upon by Parent and the Stockholders
Representative or, if Parent and the Stockholders Representative do not
mutually agree on an accounting firm within thirty (30) days after timely
delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, each of Parent and the Stockholders
Representative shall select a nationally recognized accounting firm and such
two accounting firms shall designate a third nationally recognized accounting
firm that neither presently is, nor in the past three years has been, engaged
by any party to this Agreement or any holder of more than ten percent (10%) of
the outstanding Company Common Stock as of immediately prior to the Closing.
The nationally recognized accounting firm so agreed to by Parent and the
Stockholders Representative or the third accounting firm so selected by the
two accounting firms is hereinafter referred to as the " _Accounting Firm_ ".
Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall submit to the Accounting

 



20  Firm for review and resolution all matters (but only such matters) that are
set forth in the Notice of Disagreement which remain in dispute. Parent and
the Stockholders Representative shall instruct the Accounting Firm to select
one of its partners experienced in disputes with respect to purchase price
adjustments of the type contemplated by this _Section 2.11_ to (I) make a
final determination, in each case as of immediately prior to the Closing and
calculated with reference to the items that are in dispute as set forth in the
Notice of Disagreement, of (A) Net Adjusted Working Capital, (B) Cash and Cash
Equivalents of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (C) unpaid Indebtedness of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and (D) the unpaid Transaction Expenses, and
(II) based on the foregoing, calculate the Merger Consideration. The
Accounting Firm shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator. Parent and
the Stockholders Representative shall instruct the Accounting Firm that, in
resolving the items in the Notice of Disagreement that are still in dispute
and in determining Net Adjusted Working Capital, Cash and Cash Equivalents of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, unpaid Indebtedness of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and unpaid Transaction Expenses, the Accounting Firm shall (i)
not assign to any item in dispute a value that is (A) greater than
the greatest value for such item assigned by Parent, on the one hand, or the
Stockholders Representative, on the other hand, or (B) less than the smallest
value for such item assigned by Parent, on the one hand, or the
Stockholders Representative, on the other hand, (ii) make its determination
based on an independent review (which will be in accordance with the
guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement) and at the Accounting
Firms discretion a one-day conference concerning the dispute, at which
conference each of Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall have the
right to present their respective positions with respect to the dispute and
have present their respective advisors, counsel and accountants, (iii) render
a final resolution in writing to Parent and the Stockholders Representative
(which final resolution shall be requested by Parent and the Stockholders
Representative to be delivered not more than thirty (30) days following
submission of such disputed matters to the Accounting Firm), which shall be
final, conclusive and binding on the parties with respect to the calculation
of Net Adjusted Working Capital, Cash and Cash Equivalents of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, unpaid Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
unpaid Transaction Expenses, and (iv) provide a written report to Parent and
the Stockholders Representative, if requested by either of them, which sets
forth in reasonable detail the basis for the Accounting Firms final
determination. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be allocated
between Parent, on the one hand, and the Seller Indemnifying Parties, on the
other hand, by way of distribution from the Expense Fund Amount pursuant to
_Section 10.3(e)(i)_, based upon the percentage by which the portion of the
contested amount not awarded to each of Parent and the Stockholders
Representative bears to the amount actually contested by such party.

(f) The Preliminary Closing Statement shall be deemed final for the purposes
of this _Section 2.11_ upon the earliest of (i) the failure of the
Stockholders Representative to notify Parent of a dispute within forty-five
(45) days after the Stockholders Representative receives the
Preliminary Closing Statement, (ii) the resolution of all disputes, pursuant
to _Section 2.11(d),_ by the Parent and the Stockholders Representative and
(iii) the resolution of all disputes, pursuant to _Section 2.11(e)_, by the
Accounting Firm.

(g) Within five (5) Business Days following the determination of the Final
Closing Statement in accordance with  _Section 2.11(d)_ or _Section
2.12(e)_, as applicable:

 



21 (i) if the Final Closing Adjustment Amount is less than the Estimated
Closing Adjustment Amount, and (A) the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount
_minus_ (B) the Final Closing Adjustment Amount (such amount, the " _Closing
Adjustment Deficiency_ ") is an amount less than the Purchase
Price Adjustment Holdback Amount, then Parent shall issue an aggregate number
of shares of Parent Common Stock (together with cash in lieu of any fractional
shares) equal to, rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth of a share, the
quotient determined by dividing (x) (i) the Purchase Price Adjustment
Holdback Amount, _minus_ (ii) the Closing Adjustment Deficiency, by (y) the
Parent Per Share Value;

 

(ii) if the Final Closing Adjustment Amount is less than the Estimated Closing
Adjustment Amount, and the Closing Adjustment Deficiency is an amount equal
to the Purchase Price Adjustment Holdback Amount, then no additional shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be issuable to the Securityholders pursuant to this
_Section 2.11(g)_;

 

(iii) if the Final Closing Adjustment Amount is less than the Estimated
Closing Adjustment Amount, and the Closing Adjustment Deficiency is an amount
greater than the Purchase Price Adjustment Holdback Amount, then Parent and
the Stockholders Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to
promptly distribute to Parent from the Escrow Account an amount equal to (A)
the Closing Adjustment Deficiency, _minus_ (B) the Purchase Price Adjustment
Holdback Amount; or

 

(iv) if the Final Closing Adjustment Amount is greater than the Estimated
Closing Adjustment Amount, then Parent shall issue an aggregate number of
shares of Parent Common Stock (together with cash in lieu of any fractional
shares) equal to, rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth of a share, the
quotient determined by dividing (A) (w) the Final Closing Adjustment Amount,
_minus_ (x) the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount (such amount, the "
_Closing Adjustment Surplus_ "), _minus_ (y) two percent (2%) of the Closing
Adjustment Surplus, plus (z) the Purchase Price Adjustment Holdback Amount by
(B) the Parent Per Share Value, and Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, an
amount of cash equal to two percent (2%) of the Closing Adjustment Surplus to
the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, and upon such payment such
amount shall be included in the Escrow Amount.

(h) In the event that Parent is required to issue any shares of Parent Common
Stock pursuant to _Section 2.11(g)_, such shares shall be distributed to the
Securityholders in the same order and priority as the distribution of the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.2_ and _3.3_ , in each case
taking into account all prior distributions of the Merger Consideration and as
approved by the Stockholders Representative.

 

2.12 _Subsequent Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Entity shall reasonably determine that any deeds, bills of sale,
assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Entity its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of the Company or Merger Sub acquired or to be acquired
by the Surviving Entity pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise
to carry out this Agreement, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Entity shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf
of

 



22  each of the Company and Merger Sub or otherwise, all such deeds, bills of
sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf
of the Company and Merger Sub or otherwise, all such other actions and things
as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all
right, title and interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets
in the Surviving Entity or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

ARTICLE III

 

 _EXCHANGE OF SHARES_

3.1  _Parent to Make Merger Consideration Available_. Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall appoint an exchange agent reasonably acceptable to the
Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging
Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock and non-certificated
shares of Company Common Stock represented by book entry (" _Book-Entry
Shares_ ") for the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the
benefit of the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, for exchange in
accordance with this _Article III_ , (i) book entry shares representing the
shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient to deliver the aggregate stock
portion of the Merger Consideration to be delivered at Closing, (ii)
immediately available funds equal to any dividends or distributions payable in
accordance with _Section 3.2(b)_, and (iii) cash in lieu of any fractional
shares to be issued pursuant to _Section 2.6_ and paid pursuant to _Section
3.2(e)_ in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the
foregoing items (i)-(iii) are referred to collectively as the " _Exchange
Fund_ "). Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent will send, or will cause
the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of record of shares of Company
Common Stock as of the Effective Time, a letter of transmittal for use in
such exchange (which shall specify that, in the case of shares of Company
Common Stock represented by Certificates, the delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent) in such form as the Company and Parent may
reasonably agree, for use in effecting delivery of shares of Company Common
Stock to the Exchange Agent. Exchange of any Book-Entry Shares shall be
effected in accordance with Parents customary procedures with respect to
securities represented by book entry.

3.2 _Exchange of Shares_. 

(a) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted
into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, as finally adjusted in
accordance with _Section 2.11_, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a
Certificate (in the case of shares of Company Common Stock represented by
Certificates), together with a properly completed letter of transmittal will
be entitled to receive (i) one or more shares of Parent Common Stock
representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent Common
Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section
2.6_, (ii) a check in the aggregate amount equal to cash payable in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to _Section 3.2(e)_ plus any unpaid dividends and
other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 3.2(b)_ and (iii) one or
more shares of Parent Common Stock representing, in the aggregate, the whole
number of shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.11(h)_. No interest shall be paid or
accrued on any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares or on
any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to holders of shares of Company
Common

 



23  Stock. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall, after the
Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive such
Merger Consideration.

 

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Parent Common
Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the
holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this
_Article III_. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this
_Article III_ , the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive (i)
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid, without any interest thereon, with respect to
the whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in respect of such Certificate,
and (ii) at the applicable payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender, with respect to shares
of Parent Common Stock issued in respect of such Certificate.

(c) If any certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to be
issued in, or any cash is paid to, a name other than that in which the
Certificate or Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are
registered, it shall be a condition to the issuance or payment thereof that
the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or
accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper
form for transfer, and that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to
the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other Taxes required by reason
of the payment or issuance in any name other than that of the registered
holder of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered, or required for any
other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to
settle transfers of Company Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing any such shares
are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, such Certificates shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this
_Article III_.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
certificates or scrips representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender of Certificates for exchange and no
dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable
on or with respect to any such fractional share, and no such fractional share
shall entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a
stockholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share,
Parent shall pay to each former stockholder of the Company who otherwise would
be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to
the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the Parent Per Share Value by
(ii) the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed
in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be
entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 2.6_ or pursuant to _Section
2.11(g)_.

 

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of the Company as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time
shall be paid to Parent. Any former stockholders of the Company who have not
theretofore complied with this _Article III_

 



24  shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger
Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares and cash for any unpaid
dividends and distributions payable in accordance with  _Section 3.2(b)_ in
respect of each share of Company Common Stock, as the case may be, such former
stockholder of the Company holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in
each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none
of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Exchange Agent or any other Person
shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any
amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

(g) Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Entity and the Exchange Agent, as
applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration, the cash in lieu of fractional shares and any other amounts
otherwise payable to any holder of Company Common Stock pursuant to this
Agreement, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to such payments under the Code or any other provision of state, local or
foreign Law. Any such amounts so deducted and withheld shall be paid over to
the applicable Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law and
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

(h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the providing of a reasonable
bond or similar security to be posted in the case of lost Certificates, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares and cash for any unpaid dividends and distributions payable
in accordance with _Section 3.2(b)_ in respect of each share of Company
Common Stock, as the case may be, deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to
this Agreement.

(i) In the case of Book-Entry Shares, references in this Agreement
to Certificates or certificated shares shall be deemed to also refer (with
such modifications as the context requires) to such Book-Entry Shares.

 

3.3 _Exchange of Company Stock Options and Company RSU Awards_. Upon delivery
of an executed Equity Award Acknowledgment, Release and Indemnity Agreement,
each holder of Company Stock Options or Company RSU Awards, as applicable,
will be entitled to receive (a) one or more shares of Parent Common Stock
representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent Common
Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section
2.8_, (b) a check in the aggregate amount equal to cash payable in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.8_ and (c) one or more shares of
Parent Common Stock representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares
of Parent Common Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to _Section 2.11(h)_. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any
Option Award Consideration, RSU Award Consideration, or cash in lieu of
fractional shares payable to holders of Company Stock Options or Company RSU
Awards, as applicable. Until the applicable holder of Company Stock Options or
Company RSU Awards delivers an Equity Award Acknowledgment, Release and
Indemnity Agreement, all applicable Company Stock Options or Company RSU
Awards shall, after the Effective Time, represent for

 



25  all purposes only the right to receive such Option Award Consideration or
RSU Award Consideration, as applicable.

 

ARTICLE IV

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

Upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as of the Closing, the
Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

4.1 _Formation and Qualification_. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization, and the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
has all requisite power and authority to own, manage, lease and operate its
properties and to conduct its business as currently conducted. The Company
and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified to transact business as a

which the Company and each of its Subsidiaries are qualified or licensed to
do business. The Company has heretofore made available to Parent complete and
correct copies of its charter and bylaws, and the applicable governing
documents of each of its Subsidiaries, in each case as in effect as of the
date hereof. 

4.2 _Authorization; Enforceability_. The Company has the requisite corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements to which it is a party, to perform its obligations hereunder and

"reportable transaction," within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section

"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning

37 (l) No written power of attorney that has been granted by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary (other than to the Company or a Company Subsidiary)
currently is in force with respect to any matter relating to Taxes.

(m) The Company was formed on January 25, 2012. The Company issued stock on
January 25, 2012. From January 25, 2012 to March 31, 2012, the Company did not
transact any business other than obtaining qualification to do business in
Arizona, Nevada and California and incurring certain expenses in connection
therewith and did not have any income or earnings.

(n) The Company: (i) for all taxable years commencing with Companys taxable
year beginning April 1, 2012 and ending December 31, 2012 through the taxable
year ended December 31, 2013, has been subject to taxation as a REIT and has
satisfied all requirements to qualify as a REIT for such years; (ii) has
operated for the period commencing on January 1, 2014 and ending on the date

defined in Section 857(b)(2) of the Code, determined without regard to any
dividends paid deduction for such year and (y) Companys net capital gain for
such year.

(o) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary holds any asset
the disposition of which would reasonably be expected to be subject to, or to
rules similar to, Section 1374 of the Code.

(p) Each Company Subsidiary that is a partnership, joint venture or limited
liability company and which has not elected to be a Taxable REIT Subsidiary
has been since its formation treated for United States federal income tax
purposes as a partnership or disregarded entity, as the case may be, and not
as a corporation or an association taxable as a corporation.

(q) Since its respective inception, the Company and each Company Subsidiary
has not incurred (i) any liability for material Taxes under Section 857(b)(1),
857(b)(4), 857(b)(6)(A), 857(b)(7), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code which have not
been previously paid, (ii) any liability for Taxes under Sections 857(b)(5)
(for income test violations), 856(c)(7)(C) (for asset test violations), or
856(g)(5)(C) (for violations of other qualification requirements applicable to
REITs) or (iii) any material liability for Taxes other than (A) in the
ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice, or (B) transfer
or similar Taxes arising in connection with sales of property. No event has
occurred, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no condition or circumstances
exists, which presents a material risk that any material liability for Taxes
described in clause (i) or (iii) of the preceding sentence or any liability
for Taxes described in 

 



38  clause (ii) of the preceding sentence will be imposed upon Company or any
Company Subsidiary.

 

(r) There is no agreement, plan, arrangement or other contract covering any
current or former employee or other service provider of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound that, considered
individually or considered collectively with any other such
agreements, plans, arrangements or other contracts, will, or could reasonably
be expected to, as a result of the negotiation, execution, and delivery of
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(whether alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent
events), give rise directly or indirectly to the payment of any amount that
could reasonably be expected to be non-deductible under Section 162 of the
Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign
Law) or characterized as a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section
280G of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or
foreign Law). _Schedule 4.13(r)_ lists each Person who the Company reasonably
believes is, with respect to the Company, a "disqualified individual" (within
the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder) and the potential "excess parachute payments" within the meaning
of Section 280G of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of
state, local or foreign Law) payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (whether
alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events), as
determined as of the date hereof.

indenture, contract, agreement, ground lease, license, permit or other
legally binding obligation to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party, except, as to clauses (ii) and (iii), respectively, for any such
conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences which,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

_Parent Permits_ "), and all such Parent Permits are valid and in full force
and effect, except where the failure to be in possession of, or the failure to

5.7 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.

 

(a) Parent has filed with, or furnished (on a publicly available basis) to,
the SEC all forms, reports, schedules, statements and documents required to
be filed or furnished by it under the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, as the case
may be, including any amendments or supplements thereto, from and after July
31, 2013 (collectively, the " _Parent SEC Filings_ "). Each Parent SEC
Filing, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, (i) as of its date, or, if
amended or supplemented, as of the date of the most recent amendment or
supplement thereto, complied in all material respects with the requirements of
the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, as the case may be, and the applicable rules
and regulations of the SEC thereunder, and (ii) did not, at the time it was
filed (or became effective in the case of registration statements), or, if
amended or supplemented, as of the date of the most recent amendment or
supplement thereto, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, Merger
Sub is not separately subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the
1934 Act.

 

(b) Each of Parents consolidated financial statements contained or
incorporated by reference in the Parent SEC Filings (as amended, supplemented
or restated, if applicable), including the related notes and schedules, was
prepared (except as indicated in the notes thereto)

 



50  in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
indicated, and each such consolidated financial statement presented fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position, results of
operations, stockholders equity and cash flows of Parent and its consolidated
subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and for the respective periods
indicated therein (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial
statements, to normal year-end adjustments).

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Parent and its
Subsidiaries that are used in the system of internal accounting controls
described in the following sentence are recorded, stored, maintained and
operated under means that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Parent or its Subsidiaries or accountants, except for any non-exclusive
ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect on
the system of internal accounting controls. Parent and its Subsidiaries have
devised and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to
provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP, including that: (i) transactions are executed only in
accordance with managements authorization; (ii) transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements of Parent and its
Subsidiaries and to maintain accountability for the assets of Parent and its
Subsidiaries; (iii) access to such assets is permitted only in accordance with
managements authorization; (iv) the reporting of such assets is compared
with existing assets at regular intervals; and (v) accounts, notes and other
receivables and inventory are recorded accurately, and proper and adequate
procedures are implemented to effect the collection thereof on a current and
timely basis. Parents principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer have disclosed to Parents auditors and the audit committee of the
board of directors of Parent (A) all significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parents
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data, and (B) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in Parents internal controls, and Parent has made
available to the Company copies of any material written materials relating to
the foregoing. Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the 1934
Act) designed to ensure that material information relating to Parent required
to be included in reports filed under the 1934 Act, including its
consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to Parents principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer by others within those entities,
particularly during the periods in which the periodic reports required under
the 1934 Act are being prepared, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting Parents
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer to material
information required to be included in Parents periodic reports required
under the 1934 Act. Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, none of
Parent, Merger Sub or any other of Parents Subsidiaries has made any
prohibited loans to any director or executive officer of Parent (as defined
in Rule 3b-7 promulgated under the 1934 Act).

(d) To the Knowledge of Parent, none of the Parent SEC Filings is the subject
of ongoing SEC review and Parent has not received any comments from the SEC
with respect to any of the Parent SEC Filings which remain unresolved, nor has
it received any inquiry or information request from the SEC as to any matters
affecting Parent which has not been

 



51  adequately addressed. None of the Parent SEC Filings is the subject of any
confidential treatment request by Parent.

 

(e) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any material
liabilities that would be required to be reflected on a consolidated balance
sheet of the Company prepared in accordance with GAAP, other than (i)
liabilities reflected in the financial statements included in the Parent SEC
Filings, (ii) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business since
the date of the latest consolidated balance sheet of Parent included in the
Parent SEC Filings, (iii) liabilities incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and (iv) liabilities that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

5.8 _Disclosure Documents_. All documents that Parent is responsible for
filing with the SEC in connection with the transactions contemplated herein,
to the extent relating to Parent or any Subsidiary thereof or other
information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or any such Subsidiary for
inclusion therein, will comply as to form, in all material respects, with the
provisions of the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, as applicable and the rules and
regulations of the SEC thereunder and each such document required to be filed
with any Governmental Authority (other than the SEC) will comply in all
material respects with the provisions of any applicable Law as to the
information required to be contained therein.

 

5.9 _Material Contracts_. All Parent Material Contracts have been filed as
exhibits to the Parent SEC Filings made through and including the date of
this Agreement. Each Parent Material Contract is in full force and effect and
is valid, binding and enforceable against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary
party thereto, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each other party thereto
in accordance with its terms, except for such failures to be in such full
force and effect or to be valid, binding and enforceable as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. None of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to
the Knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto, is in material breach or
violation of, or default under, any Parent Material Contract, and no event has
occurred that with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a
violation, breach or default under any Parent Material Contract, except where
in each case such breach, violation or default would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. None of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary has received any
written notice of an event of default pursuant to the terms of any Parent
Material Contract.

 

5.10 _Taxes_.

(a) Parent, Merger Sub and each other Parent Subsidiary has filed with the
appropriate Governmental Authority all Tax Returns required to be filed on or
prior to the date hereof, taking into account any extensions of time within
which to file such Tax Returns, and all such Tax Returns were complete and
correct in all material respects. Parent and each Parent Subsidiary has duly
paid (or there has been paid on their behalf), or made adequate provisions
for, all material Taxes required to be paid by them. 

(b) Parent (i) for all taxable years commencing with Parents taxable year
ended December 31, 2012 through the taxable year ended December 31, 2013, has
been subject to

 



52  taxation as a REIT and has satisfied all requirements to qualify as a REIT
for such years; (ii) has operated since January 1, 2014 to the date hereof in
a manner consistent with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a
REIT; (iii) intends to continue to operate in such a manner as to qualify as a
REIT for its taxable year ending December 31, 2014; and (iv) has not taken or
omitted to take any action that could reasonably be expected to result in a
challenge by the IRS or any other Governmental Authority to its status as a
REIT, and no such challenge is pending or threatened in writing. No Parent
Subsidiary is a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes,
other than a corporation that qualifies as a Qualified REIT Subsidiary, or as
a Taxable REIT Subsidiary. The Parents dividends paid deduction, within the
meaning of Section 561 of the Code, for each taxable year, taking into
account any dividends subject to Sections 565, 857(b)(9) or 858 of the Code,
has not been less than the sum of (x) Parents REIT taxable income, as defined
in Section 857(b)(2) of the Code, determined without regard to any dividends
paid deduction for such year and (y) Parents net capital gain for such year.

(c) (i) There are no audits, investigations by any Governmental Authority or
other proceedings pending with regard to any material Taxes or Tax Returns of
Parent, Merger Sub or any other Parent Subsidiary; (ii) no deficiency for
Taxes of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Parent Subsidiary has been claimed,
proposed or assessed in writing or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened, by
any Governmental Authority, which deficiency has not yet been settled, except
for such deficiencies which are being contested in good faith, for which
adequate reserves are included in Parents consolidated financial statements
contained or incorporated by reference in the Parent SEC Filings, or with
respect to which the failure to pay, individually or in the aggregate,
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect; (iii) none of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Parent
Subsidiary has waived any statute of limitations with respect to Taxes or
agreed to any extension of time with respect to any Tax assessment or
deficiency for any open Tax year; and (iv) none of Parent, Merger Sub or any
of the other Parent Subsidiaries has entered into any "closing agreement" as
described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar
provision of state, local or foreign income Tax Law).

(d) Each Parent Subsidiary that is a partnership, joint venture, or limited
liability company and which has not elected to be a Taxable REIT Subsidiary
has been since its formation treated for United States federal income tax
purposes as a partnership or disregarded entity, as the case may be, and not
as a corporation or an association taxable as a corporation.

(e) None of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Parent Subsidiary holds any asset
the disposition of which would be subject to, or to rules similar to, Section
1374 of the Code.

(f) Since its inception, Parent, Merger Sub and the other Parent Subsidiaries
have not incurred (i) any liability for material Taxes under Section
857(b)(1), 857(b)(4), 857(b)(6)(A), 857(b)(7), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code
which have not been previously paid, (ii) any liability for Taxes under
Sections 857(b)(5) (for income test violations), 856(c)(7)(C) (for asset test
violations), or 856(g)(5)(C) (for violations of other qualification
requirements applicable to REITs) or (iii) any material liability for Taxes
other than (x) in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past
practice, or (y) transfer or similar Taxes arising in connection with sales of
property. No event has occurred, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no
condition or circumstances exists, which presents a material risk that any
material liability for Taxes

 



53  described in clause (i) or (iii) of the preceding sentence or any liability
for Taxes described in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence will be imposed
upon Parent, Merger Sub or any other Parent Subsidiary.

(g) Parent, Merger Sub and the other Parent Subsidiaries have complied, in all
material respects, with all applicable Laws, rules and regulations relating
to the payment and withholding of Taxes (including withholding of Taxes
pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445, 1446 and 3402 of the Code or similar
provisions under any foreign Laws) and have duly and timely withheld and have
paid over to the appropriate taxing authorities all material amounts required
to be so withheld and paid over on or prior to the due date thereof under all
applicable Laws.

 

(h) There are no Parent Tax Protection Agreements (as hereinafter defined) in
force as of the date hereof, and, as of the date hereof, no Person has raised
in writing, or to the Knowledge of Parent threatened to raise, a material
claim against Parent, Merger Sub or any other Parent Subsidiary for any breach
of any Parent Tax Protection Agreements. As used herein, " _Parent
Tax Protection Agreements_ " means any written agreement to which Parent,
Merger Sub or any other Parent Subsidiary is a party pursuant to which: (i)
any liability to holders of limited partnership interests in a Parent
Subsidiary Partnership relating to Taxes may arise, whether or not as a
result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
or (ii) in connection with the deferral of income Taxes of a holder of limited
partnership interests in a Parent Subsidiary Partnership, Parent, Merger Sub
or the other Parent Subsidiaries have agreed to (A) maintain a minimum level
of debt or continue a particular debt, (B) retain or not dispose of assets for
a period of time that has not since expired, (C) make or refrain from making
Tax elections, or (D) only dispose of assets in a particular manner. As used
herein, " _Parent Subsidiary Partnership_ " means a Parent Subsidiary that is
a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes.

(i) There are no Tax Liens upon any property or assets of Parent, Merger Sub
or any other Parent Subsidiary except Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable
or that are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for
which adequate reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP.

 

(j) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has requested, has received or is
subject to any written ruling of a Governmental Authority or has entered into
any written agreement with a Governmental Authority with respect to any Taxes.

qualification is inapplicable, or an exemption therefrom is available. Parent
will not transfer or otherwise dispose any of the equity interests of the
Company acquired hereunder or any interest therein in any manner that may
cause the Company to be in violation of the 1933 Act or any applicable state
securities Laws. Parent is an "accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501(a)

(ii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be obligated to
provide any access to any documents or data which they are prohibited from
doing so pursuant to applicable Law or contractual restriction; provided,
that 

 



59  the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the required
consent of the contractual counterparty to grant Parent such access or

directors; _provided_ , that nothing set forth in this _Section 6.2_ shall

60 ARTICLE VII

 

 _COVENANTS OF PARENT AND THE COMPANY_

 

7.1 _Registration; Reservation and Listing_.

 

(a) Parent shall no later than the later of (A) August 15, 2014 and (B) forty-
five (45) days after the Closing Date, file with the SEC a Registration
Statement on Form S-3 relating to the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
connection with the Merger pursuant to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement (the " _Registrable Shares_ ") which shall serve as the Resale
Registration Statement. Such Registration Statement may cover other securities
issued by Parent (including resales of such securities) in addition to the
Registrable Shares. Parent shall cause the Resale Registration Statement
to remain effective until the earlier of (i) any time that holders of
Registrable Shares are permitted to sell Registrable Shares under Rule
144(b)(1), (ii) the date that is one (1) year after the Closing Date and (iii)
such time as all of the Registrable Shares have been sold pursuant thereto
(such period, the " _Registration Period_ "). The holders of Registrable
Shares shall be named as selling security holders in the Resale Registration
Statement or related Prospectus. Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to:

(i) during the Registration Period, prepare and file with the SEC such
amendments and supplements to the Resale Registration Statement and the
Prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to comply with the
provisions of the 1933 Act with respect to the disposition of all Registrable
Shares and take all other actions as may be reasonably necessary to ensure to
the holders of Registrable Shares the ability to effect the public resale of
their Registrable Shares continuously throughout the Registration Period;

 

(ii) furnish to the holders of Registrable Shares without charge such number
of copies of a Prospectus, including a preliminary prospectus, in conformity
with the requirements of the 1933 Act, and such other documents (including,
without limitation, prospectus amendments and supplements as are prepared by
Parent in accordance with this _Section 7.1(a)_) as each holder of
Registrable Shares may reasonably request in order to facilitate the
disposition of such holders Registrable Shares; Parent consents (except
during the continuance of any event described in _Section 7.1(e)_) to the use
of the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto by the holders of
Registrable Shares in connection with the offering and sale of the Registrable
Shares covered by the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto;

 

(iii) register or qualify the Registrable Shares under the securities Laws of
each state of the United States; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent shall
not be required in connection with this subclause (iii) to qualify as a
foreign corporation, to subject itself to taxation in any jurisdiction, or to
execute a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction; and

(iv) except under the circumstances set forth in _Section 7.1(e)_, notify
each holder of Registrable Shares promptly: (A) at any time prior to the end
of the Registration Period, upon discovery that, or upon the happening of any
event as a result of which, the Prospectus includes an untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state any material

 



61  fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing, and
thereafter Parent will promptly prepare, file with the SEC and furnish to
each such holder of Registrable Shares a supplement to or an amendment of such
Prospectus as may be necessary so that such Prospectus shall not include an
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading in light of the circumstances then existing; (B) when the
Prospectus or any supplement thereto or post-effective amendment or Free
Writing Prospectus has been filed, and, with respect to the Resale
Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto or if the SEC
or any other Governmental Authority requests any amendments or supplements to
the Resale Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any Prospectus
supplement or Free Writing Prospectus, or for additional information, when the
same has become effective; and (C) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop
order or other order suspending the effectiveness of the Resale Registration
Statement, or any order issued by any state securities commission or other
Governmental Authority suspending the qualification or exemption from
qualification of such Registrable Shares under state securities or "blue sky"
Laws. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the issuance
of such orders, or, if, at any time, Parent shall receive any such stop order
suspending the effectiveness of the Resale Registration Statement, or any
such order from a state securities commission or other regulatory authority,
Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain the withdrawal or lifting
of such order at the earliest possible time.

 

(b) Parent shall pay the reasonable costs and expenses incurred in complying
with its obligations under this _Section 7.1_ including all legal,
accounting and printing fees and expenses, all registration and filing fees
and exchange listing fees (but excluding the fees of legal counsel for any
holder of Registrable Shares). All selling commissions applicable to the sale
of Registrable Shares and all fees and expenses of legal counsel for any
holder of Registrable Shares related to the registration and sale of the
Registrable Shares shall be borne by the holder of Registrable Shares
incurring such commissions, fees or expenses.

(c) The holders of Registrable Shares shall furnish to Parent in writing such
information regarding the holders of Registrable Shares and the proposed sale
of Registrable Shares by the holders of Registrable Shares as Parent may
reasonably request in writing in connection with the Resale Registration
Statement or as shall be required in connection therewith by the SEC or any
state securities Law authorities.

(d) (i) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless each holder of Registrable
Shares, its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, members, managers and
agents of each such holder of Registrable Shares and each such person who
controls any such holder of Registrable Shares, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, from and against any Losses to which such Person
may become subject under the 1933 Act or otherwise, insofar as such Losses
arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement
of a material fact contained in, or incorporated by reference in, the
Registration Statement or any final or free writing prospectus contained or
incorporated by reference therein or furnished by Parent to any such Person or
any amendment or supplement thereto or arise out of or based upon any omission
or alleged 

 



62  omission to state therein a fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such Losses
arise out of or are based upon information furnished to Parent by or on
behalf of the holder of Registrable Shares for use in the Resale Registration
Statement, or, in connection with any such Resale Registration Statement, any
violation by Parent of the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act, any state securities or
"blue sky" Law or any rule or regulation under any of the foregoing, and will
reimburse such Person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by
them in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim
as such expenses are incurred. Each holder of Registrable Shares shall
severally (and not jointly and severally) indemnify and hold harmless Parent
against any Losses to which Parent may become subject by reason of any untrue
statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any
omission to state therein a fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but
only to the extent, that such untrue statement or omission was made in the
Registration Statement in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished to Parent by or on behalf of such holder of Registrable
Shares expressly for use therein; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such
Person shall have any liability to Parent in excess of the amount of proceeds
(less any commissions or brokerage fees incurred by such Person) actually
received by such Person from the sale of such Persons Registrable Shares
pursuant to such Resale Registration Statement.

(ii) In the event that the indemnity provided in  _Section 7.1(d)(i)_ is
held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable solely as a matter
of limitation under Law to hold harmless an indemnified party with respect to
any Losses to which such indemnifying party may be subject in such proportion
as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received from the sale of
the shares of Parent Common Stock, as applicable, and relative fault of the
indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other
in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses
(or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative benefit received by Parent shall be deemed to be
equal to the total value received or proposed to be received (after deducting
expenses) by Parent pursuant to the sale of the shares of the Parent Common
Stock. The relative benefit received by the holders of Registrable Shares
shall be deemed to be equal to the value of having the Registrable Shares
registered under the 1933 Act. The relative fault shall be determined by
reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state
a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party on
the one hand or the indemnified party on the other and the parties relative
intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent
such statement or omission. The parties agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contribution pursuant to this _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ were
determined by pro rata allocation (even if the holders of Registrable Shares
or any agents or all of them were treated as one entity for such purpose) or
by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable
considerations referred to above in this _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_. The amount
paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in
this _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ shall be deemed to include any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in

 



63  connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_, no person guilty
of fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f)
of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not
guilty of such fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this
_Section 7.1(d)_, each person who controls any holder of Registrable Shares
or agent within the meaning of either the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act and each
director, officer, employee and agent of any such Person or agent shall have
the same rights to contribution as such Person or agent, and each person who
controls Parent within the meaning of either the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act and
each officer and director of Parent shall have the same rights to contribution
as Parent, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of
this _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_.

(iii) The provisions of this _Section 7.1(d)_ will remain in full force and
effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any holder of
Registrable Shares or Parent or any of the officers, directors or controlling
persons referred to in this _Section 7.1(d)_, and will survive the transfer
of Registrable Shares.

(e) Parent may delay the filing of the Resale Registration Statement or the
disclosure of material non-public information concerning Parent by suspending
the use of any Prospectus contemplated by this _Section 7.1_ containing such
information, for one or more periods (each such period, a " _Suspension_ ") to
the extent that the chief executive officer or the chief financial officer of
Parent concludes in good faith that it is in possession of material, non-
public information that it deems detrimental to Parent or its shareholders to
disclose, or that the filing of such Resale Registration Statement or the
disclosure of material nonpublic information would materially interfere with a
material transaction or financing involving Parent or would render Parent
unable to comply with the requirements under the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act. No
Suspension shall be for a period of longer than ninety (90) consecutive days,
and no Suspensions, together, shall be for a period of an aggregate of longer
than ninety (90) days during the Registration Period. Parent shall promptly
(i) notify the holders of Registrable Shares in writing of the existence of
(but in no event, without the prior written consent of the Stockholders
Representative, shall Parent disclose to the holders of Registrable
Shares any of the material non-public facts or circumstances regarding)
material non-public information giving rise to a Suspension, and (ii) advise
the holders of Registrable Shares in writing to cease all sales under the
Resale Registration Statement until the end of the Suspension.

(f) The rights of the holders of Registrable Shares under this _Section 7.1_
may be transferred or assigned by such Persons to any Qualifying Holder who
agrees to become bound by all of the terms and conditions of this _Section
7.1_ by executing and delivering to Parent an instrument of adherence in the
form prescribed by Parent. For purposes of this _Section 7.1_, the term "
_Qualifying Holder_ " shall mean (i) in the case of an individual, such
Persons spouse or any of his children or a trust solely for the benefit of
such Person, such Persons spouse or any of his children and (ii) in the case
of an entity, such Persons controlled Affiliate.

(g) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate
resales of Registrable Shares by the holders of Registrable Shares pursuant to
the Resale Registration Statement and this _Section 7.1_ by way of removing
the restrictive legends set forth on such Registrable Shares when
appropriate.

 



64 (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Stockholders Representative will have standing to enforce the terms of this
_Section 7.1_ (on behalf of one or more holders of Registrable Shares).

 

7.2 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and
indemnification for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time
(including any matters arising in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), now existing in favor of (A) any individual
who, on or prior to the Effective Time, served as a director or officer of
the Company or its Subsidiaries and who is made or threatened to be made a
party to the proceeding by reason of his or her service in that capacity, or
(B) any individual who, while a director or officer of the Company or its
Subsidiaries and at the request of the Company or its Subsidiaries, on or
prior to the Effective Time served as a director, officer, partner, member,
manager, trustee, employee or agent of another corporation, real estate
investment trust, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise and who is made or threatened
to be made a party to the proceeding, by reason of his or her service in that
capacity (each of such individuals in such capacities set forth in clause (A)
and (B), an " _Indemnitee_ "), as the case may be, as provided in the
governing documents of the Company or each of its respective Subsidiaries
or in any agreement between or among the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and any Indemnitee (as defined below) set forth on _Schedule 7.2(a)_ shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms. Parent and the Surviving Entity shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Entity to) (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and
advance expenses (subject to an undertaking by such person to reimburse Parent
if ultimately determined not to be entitled to indemnification) to, any
Indemnitee with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their capacities
as such at any time at or prior to the Effective Time, to the fullest extent
required by: (x) the governing documents of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, in each case, as in effect on the date of this Agreement; (y)
any indemnification agreement or other contract between the Company or its
Subsidiaries set forth on _Schedule 7.2(a)_ and as in effect on the date of
this Agreement; or (z) applicable Law, and (ii) not amend, repeal or otherwise
modify any such provisions referenced in subsections (i)(x) and (y) above in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any
Indemnitee with respect to any acts or omissions arising prior to the date of
such amendment.

(b) Without limiting the provisions of  _Section 7.2(a)_, during the period
commencing as of the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary
of the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Entity shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to):
(i) indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnitee against and from any costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to any action or
omission or alleged action or omission at or prior to the Effective Time in
such Indemnitees capacity as a director, officer, partner, member, trustee or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including any matters
arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement);
and (ii) pay in advance of the final disposition of any such claim, action,
suit,

 



65  proceeding or investigation the expenses (including attorneys fees) of any
Indemnitee upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnitee
to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such
Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this _Section 7.2(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement,
neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Entity not to) settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation for which indemnification may be
sought under this _Section 7.2(b)_ unless such settlement, compromise,
consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all Indemnitees
from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, and does not include an admission of fault or wrongdoing by
any Indemnitee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, Parent or the Surviving Entity (i) shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without their prior written consent (which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and (ii) shall not have
any obligation hereunder to any Indemnitee to the extent that a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine in a final and non-appealable order
that such indemnification is prohibited by applicable Law, in which case the
Indemnitee shall promptly refund to Parent or the Surviving Entity the amount
of all such expenses theretofore advanced pursuant hereto.

 

(c) The Indemnitees to whom this _Section 7.2_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 7.2_. The provisions of this _Section 7.2_
are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee and his or her
successors, heirs, executors, trustees, fiduciaries, administrators or
representatives. Parent shall pay all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses,
including attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnitee in
successfully enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this
_Section 7.2_.

 

(d) The rights of each Indemnitee under this _Section 7.2_ shall be in
addition to any rights such Person or any employee of the Company or the
Surviving Entity or any Subsidiary thereof may have under the governing
documents of such Persons, or the Surviving Entity or any of its Subsidiaries,
or under any applicable Law or under any agreement of any Indemnitee or
any employee with the Company or the Surviving Entity or any of their
respective Subsidiaries.

(e) This _Section 7.2_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger for a
period of six (6) years and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all
successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries,
and shall be enforceable by the Indemnitees and their successors, heirs or
representatives. In the event that Parent or the Surviving Entity or any of
its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger, or transfers or conveys all or a majority of
its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Entity, as applicable, shall succeed to the obligations set forth
in this _Section 7.2_. The parties acknowledge and agree that Parent
guarantees the payment and performance of the Surviving Entitys obligations
pursuant to this  _Section 7.2_.

7.3 _Regulatory Approval; Consents_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the Company and Parent shall (and shall cause the their respective
Subsidiaries to) use its

 



66  reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to
do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or
pursuant to any contract or agreement to consummate and make effective, as
promptly as practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including (i) the taking of all actions necessary to cause
the conditions to Closing set forth in _Articles VIII_ and _IX_ to be
satisfied, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers,
consents and approvals from Governmental Authorities or other Persons
necessary in connection with the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the making of all necessary
registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Authorities, if
any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an
approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any
Governmental Authority or other Persons necessary in connection with the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings,
whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order
entered by any court or other Governmental Authority vacated or reversed, the
avoidance of each and every impediment under any antitrust, merger
control, competition or trade regulation Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing
to occur as soon as reasonably possible, and (iv) the execution and delivery
of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to fully carry out the
purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, "reasonable best efforts" shall not require Parent or any of its
Affiliates to divest, sell, dispose of, hold separate, or otherwise take or
commit to take any actions that would limit Parents or its Affiliates
freedom of action with respect to, or its or their ability to acquire and
retain, one or more of the businesses, product lines or assets of the Company,
the Parent and their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates.

 

(b) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent and
the Company shall give (or shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to give)
any notices to third parties, and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts, and the Parent shall cooperate with the Company in its efforts, to
obtain any third party consents not covered by _Section 7.3(a)_ that are
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Merger. Each of the parties
hereto will furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other may request in connection with the preparation of any
required governmental filings or submissions and will cooperate in responding
to any inquiry from a Governmental Authority, including immediately informing
the other party of such inquiry, consulting in advance before making any
presentations or submissions to a Governmental Authority, and supplying each
other with copies of all material correspondence, filings or communications
between either party and any Governmental Authority with respect to this
Agreement. To the extent practicable, and permitted by a Governmental
Authority, each party hereto shall permit representatives of the other party
to participate in meetings (whether by telephone or in person) with such
Governmental Authority.

 

7.4 _Sales and Transfer Taxes_ _; Title Insurance_. The parties acknowledge
and agree that no party hereto expects any Transfer Taxes will be incurred or
required to be paid in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall
cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of any 

 



67  returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents with respect to
Transfer Taxes, including promptly supplying any information in its possession
that is reasonably necessary to complete such returns, questionnaires,
applications or other documents with respect to Transfer Taxes, and shall
reasonably cooperate in attempting to minimize the amount of Transfer Taxes.

 

7.5 _Personnel Matters_.

 

(a) For purposes of eligibility and vesting and benefit accruals under any
employee compensation, incentive, and benefit (including vacation) plans,
programs, policies and arrangements maintained by Parent, the Surviving
Entity, their respective Subsidiaries, or their respective Affiliates for the
benefit of employees rendering services to the Company or the Surviving Entity
and their respective Subsidiaries as of and after the Closing Date (each, a "
_Parent Plan_ "), Parent shall give, or shall cause the Applicable Employing
Entity (as defined below) to give, each employee who is employed as of the
Closing Date by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Patrick
Whelan) and who accepts employment with Parent, the Surviving Entity, its
Subsidiaries, or their Affiliates (each employee, an " _Applicable Employee_ "
and each employer, the " _Applicable Employing Entity_ "), full credit for
the service of such employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
same extent recognized by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior
to the Closing Date, except to the extent such credit would result in the
duplication of benefits for the same period of service. With respect to each
Parent Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan (as defined in Section
3(1) of ERISA) and in which Applicable Employees are eligible to participate
following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Applicable
Employing Entity to, (i) cause to be waived any pre-existing condition or
eligibility limitations and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible
and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by,
and amounts reimbursed to, employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries under
similar plans maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Closing Date.

(b) At or promptly following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Applicable Employing Entity to, offer each Applicable Employee employment
with an Applicable Employing Entity, in accordance with _Schedule 7.5(b)_.

(c) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, with respect to
each Applicable Employee who accepts the offer of employment referenced in
_Schedule 7.5(b)_ , Parent shall, or shall cause the Applicable Employing
Entity to, honor, pay, perform and satisfy any and all liabilities,
obligations and responsibilities to, or in respect of, each such Applicable
Employee, arising under the terms of any employment, consulting, retention,
severance, change-of-control or similar agreement (excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Employment Agreement), in accordance with the terms
thereof in effect on the Closing Date and disclosed on _Schedule 7.5(c)_.

 

(d) The Company shall take all actions necessary to cease contributions to,
spin-off, and terminate the Companys plan (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ")
within the multiple employer plan sponsored by Beazer and qualified under
Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code, and shall, or shall cause Beazer to,
adopt written resolutions, the form and substance of which shall be
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to spin-off and terminate such Company
401(k) Plan and to one hundred percent (100%) vest all participants under such
Company 401(k) Plan, such spin-off, 

 



68  termination, and vesting to be effective no later than the Business Day
preceding the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Company 401(k)
Plan spin-off and termination may be made contingent upon the consummation of
the transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) The Company and Parent agree that all obligations to provide COBRA
continuation coverage with respect to any "qualified beneficiary" who is
covered by an Employee Plan that is a "group health plan" (as defined under
COBRA) and who experiences or experienced a qualifying event on or prior to
the Closing Date, including any "MandA qualified beneficiary" (as such term is
defined in Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9), are being allocated
hereunder to the Surviving Entity and Parent, subject to any such "qualified
beneficiary" paying all applicable premiums in respect of such continuation
coverage.

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.5_ shall obligate Parent or any of
its Affiliates to continue the employment of any employee of Parent, the
Company, the Surviving Entity or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates for
any period of time after the Closing, and this _Section 7.5_ shall not be
construed to limit the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates to terminate
the employment of any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
following the Closing in accordance with applicable Law and any pre-existing
contractual relationship. Further, this _Section 7.5_ shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing
in this _Section 7.5_, express or implied, shall confer upon any other
Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this _Section 7.5_ or be construed as an amendment, waiver, or creation of
any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement, contract, policy, or
arrangement; provided that the Stockholders Representative (on behalf of one
or more Applicable Employees) will have standing to enforce the terms of this
_Section 7.5_.

 

7.6 _Public Announcements_. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall consult
with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any
public statements or filings with respect to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and none of the parties shall issue any such
press release or make any such public filing prior to obtaining the
other parties consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _however_ , that a party may, without
obtaining the other parties consent, issue such press release or make such
public statement or filing as may be required by Law or the applicable rules
of any stock exchange or the applicable provisions of any listing agreement of
any party hereto, in which case the party required to issue the press release
or make the public statement shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
allow the other parties reasonable time to comment on such press release or
public statement in advance of such issuance. Notwithstanding anything herein
or in the Confidentiality Agreement, if a party issues any press release or
public statement in accordance with the proviso set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence, each other party may issue such press release or make such
other public statement regarding the fact that the Merger occurred (though in
no event disclosing the Merger Consideration or other material terms) and so
long as each such press release or public statement is not inconsistent in
scope or content with the applicable press release or public statement
made by the party that issued such press release or public statement in
accordance with the proviso set forth in the immediately preceding sentence.
The provisions of this _Section 7.6_ shall not be interpreted to prohibit the
sharing by any party of information related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby in the ordinary course of business with such
partys (or such

 



69  partys Affiliates) advisors, employees, officers, directors, limited
partners, equity owners, financing sources and similar Persons related to such
party or such Affiliate so long as such Persons need to know the disclosed
information and are apprised of the confidential nature thereof and the party
hereto that is disclosing such information shall be responsible for any breach
by its or its Affiliates advisors, employees, officers, directors, limited
partners, equity owners, financing sources and similar Persons. The parties
have agreed upon the form of joint press release announcing the execution of
this Agreement.

 

7.7 _WARN Act Notice_. Parent shall be solely responsible for providing any
notice required under the WARN Act in respect of the termination after the
Closing of the employment of any employee of the Surviving Entity or any of
its Subsidiaries located in the United States, and shall indemnify and hold
the Company harmless from any liability arising from any failure of Parent to
comply fully with the foregoing covenant.

7.8 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code, including by executing and delivering the officers
certificates referred to herein. None of Parent or the Company shall take any
action, or fail to take any action, that could reasonably be expected to
cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code.

(b) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain a parachute
payment waiver (" _Parachute Payment Waiver_ "), from each Person who the
Company reasonably believes is, with respect to the Company, a "disqualified
individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder), as determined immediately prior to the
initiation of the requisite stockholder approval procedure under, and who
might otherwise have, receive or have the right or entitlement to receive a
parachute payment under Section 280G of the Code, pursuant to which each such
Person shall agree to waive any and all right or entitlement to the
accelerated vesting, payments, benefits, options and stock to the extent the
value thereof exceeds 2.99 times such Persons base amount determined in
accordance with Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder, unless the requisite stockholder approval of such
accelerated vesting, payments, benefits, options and stock is obtained. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain approval from the
stockholders of the Company in a manner which satisfies all applicable
requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder (" _Section 280G Approval_ "). Copies of the Parachute
Payment Waivers and the materials and information required for the Section
280G Approval shall have been provided to Parent in advance of distribution
to the "disqualified individual" or the Companys stockholders, as applicable,
and Parent shall be provided with a reasonable opportunity to comment thereon
(which comments shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(c) [Reserved.]

 

(d) Subject to and in accordance with _Article X_ , each of the
Securityholders shall, severally and not jointly, on a pro rata basis based
on the percentage of the Merger

 



70  Consideration received by such Securityholder pursuant to this Agreement,
indemnify and defend the Parent Indemnified Persons and hold them harmless
from and against (without duplication) (A) fifty percent (50%) of any
Transfer Taxes, if any, which are incurred or required to be paid in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and
(B) any Losses attributable to (i) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for all Taxable periods ending on or
before the Closing Date and the portion through the Tax Effective Time of any
Taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (" _Pre-
Closing Tax Period_ "), (ii) all Taxes of any member of an Affiliated Group of
which any of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any predecessor of any
of the foregoing) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date,
including pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or
similar state, local, or non-United States law or regulation, (iii) any and
all Taxes of any Person (other than the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to any law, rule or
regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring before the
Closing, and (iv) all Taxes attributable to the liquidation of Beazer Realty
Services Corp., a Delaware corporation (" _BRSC_ "), after the Closing Date
(provided that such liquidation is effectuated pursuant to Section 332 of the
Code as a complete liquidation of BRSC into Parent or Taxable REIT Subsidiary
of Parent, and Parent or such Taxable REIT Subsidiary, as applicable, reports
such liquidation as a "section 332 liquidation"); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, in the case of Taxes described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), the
Securityholders shall be liable only to the extent that such Taxes exceed the
amount, if any, reserved for such Taxes and actually taken into account as a
reduction in determining the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section
2.6_, and provided further that the Securityholders shall not be liable for
any Taxes described in clause (i) to the extent attributable to any
transaction occurring on the Closing Date after the Closing other than in the
ordinary course of business. Except as provided in _Section 7.8(f)_ (with
respect to Taxes shown to be due on certain Tax Returns), the Securityholders
shall reimburse the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any Taxes that are
the responsibility of the Securityholders pursuant to this _Section 7.8(d)_
within ten (10) Business Days after (x) payment of such Taxes by Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (y) presentation by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the Stockholders Representative of
a written request for such reimbursement, which request includes evidence of
such Tax payment.

 

(e) The Securityholders and Parent shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, elect with the relevant Governmental Authorities to close the
Taxable period of the Company and its Subsidiaries at 11:59 p.m. on the
Closing Date. In the case of any Taxable period that includes (but does not
end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the amount of any Taxes
based on or measured by income or receipts of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and the amount of any sales, use, employment or withholding Taxes
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be determined based on an
interim closing of the books as of 11:59 p.m. on the Closing Date (the " _Tax
Effective Time_ ") (and for such purpose, the Taxable period of any
partnership or other pass-through entity in which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such
time) and the amount of other Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
for a Straddle Period that relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Taxable period multiplied
by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Taxable
period ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which
is

 



71  the number of days in such Straddle Period. Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, the Securityholders shall have no liability or
obligation to indemnify or hold harmless the Company for any Loss with
respect to Taxes to the extent such Loss results from a breach of a
representation, warranty or obligation of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in
this Agreement including, for the avoidance of doubt, the last sentence of
_Section 7.8(f)_.

(f) The Stockholders Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared and
file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns of the Company that are due after
the Closing Date, but that relate exclusively to Taxable periods ending on or
before the Closing Date. Each such Tax Return shall (i) be delivered to Parent
no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to filing or the due date of such
Tax Return, whichever is sooner, and (ii) not be filed unless it is approved
by Parent prior to filing, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Parent shall prepare or caused to be prepared and
file or cause to be filed all Straddle Period Tax Returns of the Company. Each
such Tax Return shall (i) be delivered to the Stockholders Representative no
later than ten (10) Business Days prior to filing or the due date of such Tax
Return, whichever is sooner, and (ii) not filed unless, to the extent it
relates to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or portion thereof, it is approved by
the Stockholders Representative prior to filing, such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Parent and the Stockholders
Representative shall consult and cooperate as to any elections to be made on
Tax Returns of the Company for periods ending on or before 11:59 p.m. on the
Closing Date. Parent shall not cause or permit the Company to file any amended
Tax Return relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period that could have an adverse
effect on the Securityholders without the prior written consent of the
Stockholders Representative, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

(g) (i) The Parent and the Company, on one hand, and the Securityholders, on
the other hand, shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by any other party to this Agreement, in connection with the filing
of any Tax Return pursuant to this _Section 7.8_ and in any audit, claim,
dispute or controversy relating to Taxes, including any proceeding, assessment
or adjustment (" _Tax Contest_ "). Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax Contest
and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any materials provided hereunder.
The Company and each Securityholder agree (A) to retain all books and records
with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and its Subsidiaries and
which relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Period until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (and, if notified in
writing by another party, any extensions thereof), and (B) to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Authority. The
Parties agree to give each other party reasonable written notice prior to
transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records, and if
another party so requests, to give such other party possession of such books
and records.

(ii) Parent and each Securityholder further agree, upon request, to use
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited
to, with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

 



72 (iii) Parent and each Securityholder further agree, upon request, to provide
the other party with all information that either party may be required to
report pursuant to Section 6043 of the Code and all Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder.

 

(h) (i) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 7.8(h)_, the party
responsible for the Taxes under  _Section 7.8(d)_ (taking into account the
effect of _Section 7.8(e)_) that is the subject of a Tax Contest shall
control and bear the cost of the conduct of such Tax Contest, including
determining actions taken to pay, dispute, compromise or settle such Taxes;
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Securityholders, on the one hand,
nor Parent and the Company, on the other hand, may compromise or settle any
such Tax Contest in a manner that would reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the other party or parties with respect to any Taxable period for which
such other party or parties are responsible pursuant to this _Section 7.8_,
without the prior written consent of such other party or parties (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In the
event a Tax Contest involves multiple Taxable periods, with respect to one or
more of which Parent is responsible for the Taxes and one or more of which
the Securityholders are responsible for the Taxes, then, except as otherwise
provided in this _Section 7.8(h)_, the control and the cost of the conduct of
the Tax Contest shall be shared accordingly and each party shall cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in the
conduct of such Tax Contest.

(ii) In the case of any Straddle Period, Parent shall control the conduct of
such Tax Contest, and the Stockholders Representative (on behalf of the
Securityholders) shall have the right to participate in such Tax Contest to
the extent the proceedings relate to any matter which may give rise to an
indemnification payment by the Securityholders under this _Section 7.8_, or
to the extent the proceedings may adversely affect the Securityholders
liability for Taxes relating to the Company. The party receiving the notice
of such Tax Contest will provide the other party with notice in writing of
such Tax Contest involving the Company within thirty (30) days (unless action
is required sooner, then as soon as possible) of receiving such notice from
the Governmental Authority. If the non-notifying party does not respond
within thirty (30) days (unless action is required sooner, then as soon as
possible) of any such notice, such party will be deemed to have elected not to
participate in such Tax Contest. Parent shall not settle any such Tax Contest
in a manner that would be reasonably expected to adversely affect the
Securityholders, or any of them, without the prior written consent of the
Securityholders (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Any consent required to be given by the
Securityholders may be given by the Stockholders Representative and if given,
shall be binding on all the Securityholders. In any Tax Contest involving
a Straddle Period where the Stockholders Representative (on behalf of the
Securityholders) elects to participate, each party shall bear its own costs
for participating in such Tax Contest, and both Parties shall cooperate in
good faith before any final resolution is reached. Notwithstanding anything
else set forth herein to the contrary, the Stockholders Representative, on
behalf of and at the Securityholders expense (including, without limitation,
reimbursement by Securityholders of Parents and the Companys out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with such contest), shall have the right to
require the Company to contest any asserted Straddle Period Tax deficiencies
for which Securityholders would have liability under this _Section 7.8_.

 



73 (i) All Tax-sharing agreements or similar agreements with respect to or
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be terminated as of
the day before the Closing Date and, from and after the Closing Date, the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be bound thereby or have any liability
thereunder.

 

(j) The foregoing agreements of the Securityholders shall be incorporated by
reference in the Written Consents and the Equity Award Acknowledgment,
Release and Indemnity Agreements, as the case may be.

7.9 _Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all actions necessary to (a) cause Merger
Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and (b) ensure
that, prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not conduct any business
or make any investments other than as specifically contemplated by this
Agreement, or incur or guarantee any Indebtedness.

7.10  _Distributions_. The Company shall be permitted to make (i) regular
distributions on the Accommodation Shares, paid semi-annually in accordance
with past practice at an annualized rate not to exceed $125.00 per
Accommodation Share, and (ii) distributions, including under Section 860 of
the Code, reasonably necessary for the Company to maintain its status as a
REIT under the Code and avoid or reduce the imposition of any corporate level
tax or excise Tax under the Code; provided that the Company shall consult
with Parent prior to making any such distributions, and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to pay consent dividends (as defined in Section 565 of the
Code) instead of cash dividends. For the avoidance of doubt, any such consent
dividends shall not be included in the calculation of Cash and Cash
Equivalents for purposes of _Section 2.6_ or _2.11_.

 

7.11 _Approval of Stockholders_. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts and take all actions necessary to solicit and obtain Written Consents
from all holders of Company Common Stock who have not executed and delivered
Written Consent on the date of this Agreement.

Company Material Adverse Effect; 

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of the Company in this Agreement
to be performed at or prior to the Closing, or any breach of any covenant or

 



80  agreement of the Securityholders in this Agreement (including the

Parent Material Adverse Effect; or

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement made by the Parent or Merger Sub
in this Agreement to be performed at or prior to Closing.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Stockholders

directors, agents, representatives, attorneys and employees, and each person,
if any, who controls or may control any of the Securityholders within the
meaning of the 1933 Act).

(d)  _Limitations of Liability_. Other than Losses resulting from any claim
based on fraud or intentional misrepresentation: (i) no Indemnifying Person
(as defined below) shall be liable for Losses or other indemnification
obligations pursuant to this Agreement unless and until the applicable
Indemnified Person (as defined below) has incurred actual Losses in an
aggregate amount greater than $100,000 (the " _Threshold_ "), in which case
such Indemnified Person shall be entitled, subject to the Escrow Limitation
(as defined below), to indemnification under this Agreement from the
applicable Indemnifying Person for all actual Losses suffered by such
Indemnified Person regardless of the Threshold; (ii) except as set forth in
the next succeeding sentence, the aggregate indemnification obligations of the
Seller Indemnifying Parties pursuant to this _Article X _shall not exceed the
Escrow Amount (the " _Escrow Limitation_ "); and (iii) Parent shall not be
liable for Losses or other indemnification obligations pursuant to this
Agreement in excess of an amount equal to the Escrow Amount (the " _Cap_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Threshold, the Escrow Limitation
or the Cap shall apply to any Losses resulting from any matters set forth in
_Section 10.1(b)(ii)-(xi)_, any breach of an Essential Company
Representation, any matters set forth in _Section 10.1(c)(ii)_ or any breach
of an Essential Parent Representation; _provided_ , _however_ , (x) with
respect to any Losses resulting from any matters set forth in _Section
10.1(b)(ii)-(xi)_ or any breach of an Essential Company Representation, no
Seller Indemnifying Party shall be liable for Losses or other indemnification
obligations pursuant to this Agreement (other than any covenant to be
performed after the Closing) in excess of an amount equal to the portion of
the Merger Consideration (based on the Parent Per Share Value) actually
received by such Seller Indemnifying Party, and (y) with respect to any
matters set forth in _Section 10.1(c)(ii)_ or any breach of an Essential
Parent Representation, Parent shall not be liable for Losses or other
indemnification obligations pursuant to this Agreement in excess of an amount
equal to the Merger Consideration. The amount of Losses that are subject to
indemnification under this  _Article X_ shall be calculated net of (x) the
amount of any insurance proceeds actually received by the Indemnified Person
and any indemnity, contribution or other

 



82  similar payment actually recovered from any third party with respect
thereto, less the cost of any increase in insurance premiums resulting from
such Losses and the cost of recovering or enforcing such indemnity,
contribution or other similar payment from such third party and (y) any actual
reduction in current Tax paid by such Indemnified Person or any Affiliate
thereof with respect to the Losses or items giving rise to such claim for
indemnification in the year of such Losses.

(e) _Sole Recourse_. Except with respect to claims based on fraud
or intentional misrepresentation, the indemnification provided in this
_Article X_ shall be the sole and exclusive post-Closing remedy available to
the Parent Indemnified Persons and the Securityholders, respectively, for any
Losses resulting from any matters set forth in _Section 10.1(b)_ and
_Section 10.1(c)_, respectively (whether in contract or tort); _provided_ ,
that nothing herein is intended to waive or bar any equitable remedies of a
party. Except with respect to any Losses resulting from any matters set forth
in _Section 10.1(b)(ii)-(xi)_ or based on fraud or intentional
misrepresentation or any breach of an Essential Company Representation (which
shall be satisfied first from the Escrow Amount and, subject to the Survival
Date, thereafter by the Seller Indemnifying Parties, severally and not
jointly, on a pro rata basis based on the amount of Merger Consideration
received by such Seller Indemnifying Parties), all
indemnification obligations of the Seller Indemnifying Parties hereunder,
including with respect to any Third Party Claim, shall be satisfied from the
Escrow Amount and subject to the Escrow Limitation.

 

(f) _Third Party Claims_. A Person that may be entitled to be indemnified
under this Agreement (the " _Indemnified Person_ "), shall promptly notify
the party or parties liable for such indemnification (the " _Indemnifying
Person_ ") in writing of any pending or threatened claim or demand asserted by
a third party that the Indemnified Person has determined has given or could
reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of indemnification under such
agreement (such claim being a " _Third Party Claim_ "), (i) describing in
reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject
matter of such claim or demand, and (ii) specifying in reasonable detail
(based upon information then possessed by the Indemnified Person) the
individual items of such Losses included in the amount so stated and
the provision(s) of this Agreement upon which such claim is based; _provided_
, _however_ , that the failure to provide such notice shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Person from any of its obligations under this _Article X_ except
to the extent the Indemnifying Person is prejudiced by such failure. The
Indemnifying Person (in the case of the Seller Indemnifying Parties, as
represented by the Stockholders Representative) shall forthwith have the
right to assume the Good Faith Defense of such Third Party Claim at its own
expense, provided, that an Indemnified Person shall have the right to employ
its own counsel in any case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall
be at the expense of the Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying
Person shall not have assumed the defense, or shall be barred from assuming
the defense, of such action or claim pursuant to this _Section 10.1(f)_, or
(ii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded based on advice
of outside counsel that there are defenses available to it which are contrary
to, or inconsistent with those available to the Indemnifying Person. For
purposes hereof, " _Good Faith Defense_ " means legal defense conducted by
reputable counsel of good standing. Each of the Indemnified Persons and the
Indemnifying Persons:

(i) shall make available to each other any documents and materials in their
possession or control that may be reasonably necessary to the defense of such
claim or

 



83  proceeding that are not subject to attorney-client privilege or third party
confidentiality obligations; and

 

(ii) shall keep the other party informed of all material developments and
events relating to such claim or proceeding.

 

The Indemnifying Persons shall have the right to settle, adjust or compromise
such claim or proceeding; _provided_ , that an Indemnifying Person shall
not settle or compromise any such claim if such settlement or compromise
would result in an order, injunction or other equitable remedy in respect of
the Indemnified Person, or would otherwise have a direct non- _de minimis_
effect upon Indemnified Persons continuing operations, or would result in
liabilities which, taken together with other existing claims under this
_Section 10_, would not be fully indemnified hereunder; in each case, without
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

With regard to Third Party Claims for which indemnification is payable
hereunder, such indemnification shall be paid by the Indemnifying Person upon
the earliest to occur of: (i) if no appeal is made, the entry of a judgment
against the Indemnified Person and the expiration of any applicable
appeal period, or if earlier, twenty (20) days prior to the date that the
judgment creditor has the right to execute the judgment unless an appropriate
bond is posted by the indemnitor; (ii) the entry of a nonappealable judgment
against the Indemnified Person; or (iii) as required by a settlement of the
Third Party Claim.

(g) _Adjustment to Initial Purchase Price_. For all Tax purposes, the parties
agree to treat indemnity payments made pursuant to this Agreement as an
adjustment to the Merger Consideration.

 

(h) _Limitation on Contribution and Certain Other Rights_. Each Seller
Indemnifying Party hereby agrees that, if following the Closing, any claim
for Losses is made by any Parent Indemnified Person or otherwise becomes due
from such Seller Indemnifying Party pursuant to and in accordance with this
_Article X_ in respect of any Losses, such Seller Indemnifying Party shall
not have any rights against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect
of such claim, in any such case to the extent of such Seller Indemnifying
Partys indemnification obligations pursuant to this _Article X_ in respect of
such Losses, whether by reason of contribution, indemnification, subrogation
or otherwise, with respect thereto, notwithstanding the terms of the Companys
or its Subsidiaries charter, bylaws, other organizational documents or any
other agreement between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and such
Seller Indemnifying Party.

10.2 _Release From Escrow_.

 

(a) _Termination of Escrow; Release_. The Escrow Amount (less any amounts that
have previously been used to satisfy any claim or claims for Losses) shall be
distributed in accordance with the Escrow Agreement upon the Escrow Release
Date (as defined in the Escrow Agreement); _provided_ , that a portion of the
Escrow Amount that, as provided in the Escrow Agreement, is necessary to
satisfy any pending, or resolved but not yet paid claims shall remain in the
Escrow Account as set forth in the Escrow Agreement. Once released from the
Escrow Account, such funds shall be free from all claims hereunder. Any
portion of the Escrow Amount

 



84  held as a result of the immediately preceding proviso shall be released to
the Stockholders Representative or released to the relevant Indemnified
Person (as appropriate) promptly upon resolution of each specific
indemnification claim involved in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the Escrow Agreement. Any portion of the Escrow Amount released to the
Stockholders Representative shall be distributed to the Securityholders in
the same order and priority as the distribution of the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 3.2_ and _3.3_ , in each case taking into account all
prior distributions of the Merger Consideration.

 

10.3 _Stockholders  Representative_

 

(a) KKR Fund Holdings L.P. (or its designee) shall be the agent and attorney-
in-fact for each of the Securityholders to act as Stockholders
Representative under this Agreement in accordance with the terms of this
_Section 10.3_. Parent may rely upon any decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Stockholders Representative as being the decision,
act, consent or instruction of each Stockholder, without inquiry,
investigation or other obligation of Parent. In the event of the resignation,
death or incapacity of the Stockholders Representative, a successor
Stockholders Representative reasonably satisfactory to Parent shall
thereafter be appointed by Securityholders representing a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock as of immediately prior to the
Closing. As of the date hereof, the Stockholders Representative has
designated Peter Glaser to act on behalf of the Stockholders Representative
in its capacity as such.

(b) The Stockholders Representative is hereby authorized and empowered to
act for, and on behalf of, any or all of the Securityholders (with full power
of substitution in the premises) in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (i) to review and authorize all claims and
disputes or question the accuracy thereof, (ii) to negotiate, settle and
compromise on their behalf with Parent any claims asserted thereunder and to
authorize payments to be made with respect thereto, including distributions
from the Escrow Account, and (iii) to take such further actions as are
authorized in this Agreement or the other agreements contemplated hereby to be
taken by the Stockholders Representative. Parent and Merger Sub shall be
entitled to rely on such appointment and to treat the Stockholders
Representative as the duly appointed attorney-in-fact of each Securityholder
for purposes of taking such actions. Notices given to the
Stockholders Representative in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement shall constitute notice to Securityholders for all purposes under
this Agreement.

 

(c) The appointment of the Stockholders Representative is an agency coupled
with an interest and is irrevocable and any action taken by the Stockholders
Representative pursuant to the authority granted in this _Section 10.3_ shall
be effective and absolutely binding on each Securityholder that executes the
Written Consent notwithstanding any contrary action of or direction from such
Securityholder, except for actions or omissions of the Stockholders
Representative constituting willful misconduct or gross negligence. The death
or incapacity, or dissolution or other termination of existence, of
any Securityholder shall not terminate the authority and agency of the
Stockholders Representative. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Stockholders Representative, including an amendment, extension or waiver of
this Agreement pursuant to _Article XII_ hereof, shall constitute a decision
of all Securityholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the
Securityholders. Parent is entitled to rely upon any such decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Stockholders Representative as being the

 



85  decision, act, consent or instruction of all Securityholders. Neither Parent
nor the Escrow Agent shall have any liability to any Securityholder based on
any action taken by such Person in accordance with such decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Stockholders Representative.

(d) The Stockholders Representative shall not be liable to Parent, the
Company, the Surviving Entity, the Securityholders or to any other Person with
respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Stockholders
Representative in its role as Stockholders Representative under or in
connection with this Agreement, unless such action or omission results from or
arises out of willful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of the
Stockholders Representative. The Securityholders shall jointly and severally
indemnify the Stockholders Representative and hold the Stockholders
Representative harmless against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense
incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on the
part of the Stockholders Representative and arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of its duties hereunder, including any
out-of-pocket costs and expenses and legal fees and other legal costs fees
and costs of other skilled professionals, and in connection with seeking
recovery from insurers, judgments, fines, amounts paid in settlement and
Stockholders Representative fees (collectively the "
_Representative Expenses_ ") reasonably incurred by the Stockholders
Representative pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any
engagement letter entered into between the Securityholders and the
Stockholders Representative with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The Representative Expenses may be recovered (i) first, from
the Expense Fund Amount and (ii) second, directly from the Seller Indemnifying
Parties pro rata based on the amount of the Merger Consideration received at
the Closing pursuant to _Sections 3.2_ and _3.3_.

(e) The Expense Fund Amount shall be held by the Escrow Agent as agent and
for the benefit of the Seller Indemnifying Parties in a segregated client
account and shall be used for the purposes of (i) paying any fees and expenses
of the Accounting Firm allocated to the Seller Indemnifying Parties pursuant
to _Section 2.11(e)_ and (ii) paying directly, or reimbursing the
Stockholders Representative for, any Representative Expenses reasonably
incurred by the Stockholders Representative pursuant to this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement or any engagement letter entered into between the
Securityholders and the Stockholders Representative with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Promptly following the Survival
Date or, if sooner, as reasonably determined by Stockholders Representative
that any remaining portion of the Expense Fund Amount is no longer required to
be withheld, the Stockholders Representative shall distribute the remaining
portion of the Expense Fund Amount (if any) to the Escrow Agent for further
distribution to the Seller Indemnifying Parties in accordance with the terms
of the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement.

(i) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

 



86 (ii) by the written consent of either Parent or the Company if there has been
a material breach or failure to perform on the part of Parent or Merger Sub,
on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, which breach or

pursuant to this _Section 11.1(a)(ii)_ if such breach or failure is cured
within such thirty (30)-day period); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 11.1(a)(ii)_ shall
not be available to any party if such party shall have materially breached or
failed to perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement which breach or failure to perform results in the
conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ or _Article IX_ being incapable of
being satisfied by the Outside Date (as defined below);

 

(iii) by the written consent of either Parent or the Company if a court of

enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (provided that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 11.1(a)(iii)_ shall have complied with its

"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate pursuant to this
_Section 11.1(a)(iv)_ shall not be available to any party whose action or
failure to act has been a principal cause of or resulted in the failure of
the Effective Time to occur on or prior to such date and such action or
failure constitutes a breach of this Agreement.

 

(b) The termination of this Agreement shall be effectuated by the delivery by
the party terminating this Agreement to each other party of a written notice
of such termination. If this Agreement so terminates, it shall become null and
void and have no further force or effect, except as provided in _Section
11.2_.

and _7.6_ , this _Section 11.2_ and _Article XII_ shall survive the
termination of this Agreement. None of the parties hereto shall have any
liability or obligation in respect of a termination of this Agreement, except
with respect to _Sections 6.2(b)_ and _7.6_ and this  _Section 11.2_;

material breach by a party of any of its representations, warranties covenants
or agreements set forth herein, the Company or Parent, as the case may be,
shall be fully liable for any and all Losses incurred by the other party as a
result of such breach, failure or termination.

12.13 _Attorney-Client Privilege and Conflict Waiver_.

 

(a) In any dispute or proceeding arising after the Effective Time under or in
connection with this Agreement or any the other agreement contemplated
hereby, the parties agree that any of the stockholders or the optionholders of
the Company shall have the right, at their election to retain the firm of King
and Spalding LLP (" _King and Spalding_") to represent them in such matter, and
Parent and the Surviving Entity (on behalf of themselves, their respective
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees and representatives and their
respective successors and assigns) hereby irrevocably waive and consent to
any such representation in any such mater.

(b) Each of the parties further agrees that, as to all communications
among King and Spalding, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries and any
stockholder and any Optionholder of the Company, but only to the extent
relating to this Agreement, any other agreement contemplated hereby and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, the attorney-client privilege,
the expectation of client confidence and all other rights to any evidentiary
privilege belong to the stockholders and Optionholders of the Company, as
applicable, and shall not pass to or be claimed by the Surviving Entity or
any of its Affiliates.

(c) If the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
agreements contemplated hereby are consummated, (i) the Surviving Entity and
its Subsidiaries shall have no right of access to or control over any of King
and Spaldings records related to such transactions, which shall become the
property of (and be controlled by) the stockholders and Optionholders of the
Company, as applicable; and (ii) it would be impracticable to remove from the
records (including emails and other electronic files) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries any privileged communications with King and Spalding. The Company
and its Subsidiaries, Parent and Merger Sub agree to use their respective
reasonable best efforts not to access, review or otherwise use, examine or
rely upon such privileged communications that may remain in the records of
the Company or its Subsidiaries, and the parties agree that no attorney-client
privilege, attorney work product or other privilege or protection is waived or
intended to be waived by allowing such material to remain in the files of the
Company or its Subsidiaries.

(d) Furthermore, in the event of a dispute between any stockholders or
Optionholders of the Company, on the one hand, and the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, relating to this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, where King and Spalding acted for them both,
none of the attorney-client privilege, the expectation of client confidence or
any other rights to any evidentiary privilege will protect from disclosure to
Parent, the Surviving Entity or the stockholders or optionholders of the
Company, as applicable, any information or documents

 



91  developed or shared during the course of King and Spaldings joint
representation of the stockholders and Optionholders of the Company and the
Company and its Subsidiaries.
