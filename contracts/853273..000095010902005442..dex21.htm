Compliance Procedures for Disclosure of Material Information, which have been
previously provided to the Company, with respect to any public statement
regarding this Agreement, the Mergers or any of the other transactions

shall terminate any plan, program, policy, practice, contract, agreement or
other material arrangement providing for the payment of any bonus or similar
payment to any employees of any of the Acquired Corporations, and shall ensure
that no Employee or former employee of any of the Acquired Corporations has
any rights under any of such plans or other arrangements and that
any Liabilities of any of the Acquired Corporations under such plans or other
arrangements (including any such Liabilities relating to services performed
prior to the Closing) are fully extinguished at no cost to any of the Acquired

(b) Effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the
Company shall terminate any and all Company Employee Plans intended to include
a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Code Section 401(k)
(the "401(k) Plans"), unless Parent provides written notice to the Company
that such 401(k) Plans shall not be terminated. Unless Parent provides such
written notice to the Company, no later than five (5) business days prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such
401(k) Plan(s) will be terminated (effective no later than the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date), pursuant to resolutions of the applicable board
of directors. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to
reasonable review and approval of Parent.



(c) Parent agrees that all employees of the Acquired Corporations who continue
employment with Parent or the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time

this Agreement shall limit the right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
to amend or terminate any such health, vacation or other employee benefit
plan at any time and (b) if Parent or the Surviving Corporation terminates any
such health, vacation or other employee benefit plan, then, (i) subject to any
necessary transition period (during which period Parent will self-insure or
provide other similar coverage for such employees), each Continuing Employee
(as defined below) who immediately prior to the termination of such plan
participated in such plan shall be eligible to participate in Parents
health, vacation and other employee benefit plans, to the same extent as
employees of Parent in similar positions and at similar grade levels and (ii)
Parent shall credit on a year-for-year (or applicable portion thereof) basis
each such Continuing Employees service with the Company, for purposes of
determining eligibility to participate in and vesting under (except for equity

such employee benefit plan of Parent. Parent shall cause any and all pre-
existing condition (or actively-at-work or similar) limitations, eligibility
waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements under any group
health plans to be waived with respect to such employees and their eligible
dependents and shall provide them with credit for any co-payments,
deductibles, and offsets (or similar payments) prior to the Effective Time of
Merger I for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket,
or similar requirements under any Parent plans set forth above in which they
are eligible to participate after the Effective Time of the Mergers. For
purposes of this _Section 6.8_ , "Continuing Employees" shall mean employees
of any of the Acquired Corporations who are employed by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation for any period of employment after the Effective Time of
the Mergers. Nothing in this _Section 6.8_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall be construed to create a right in any employee to employment with Parent
or the Surviving Corporation and, subject to any other binding agreement
between an employee and Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the employment
with each Continuing Employee shall be "at will" employment.



(d) The Company shall terminate any and all group severance, separation,
deferred compensation or salary continuation plans, programs or arrangements
maintained by any of the Acquired Corporations, effective in each case as of
the day immediately preceding the Effective Time of Merger I. The Company

resolutions of the applicable board of directors of the Acquired Corporations
(the form and substance of which resolutions shall be subject to review and
approval of Parent).

Company Stockholder Vote):



(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;



(b) by either Parent or the Company if Merger I shall not have been
consummated by February 28, 2003 (the "Termination Date") (unless the failure
to consummate Merger I is primarily caused by a failure on the part of the
party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform any material obligation
required to be performed by such party at or prior to the Effective Time
of Merger I);



(c) by either Parent or the Company if a court of competent jurisdiction
or other Governmental Body shall have issued a final and nonappealable order,

Merger I;



(e) by Parent (at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the
Required Company Stockholder Vote) if a Triggering Event shall have occurred;

not be satisfied or (ii) any of the Companys covenants contained in this
Agreement shall have been breached such that the condition set forth in
_Section 7.2_ would not be satisfied;  _provided, however_ , that if such
inaccuracy in the Companys representations and warranties or a breach of a
covenant by the Company is curable by the Company through the exercise of
commercially reasonable efforts to cure such inaccuracy or breach, then
Parent may not terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.1(f)_ on account
of such inaccuracy or breach until the earlier of (A) the expiration of a
fourteen (14) day period commencing upon delivery of written notice

of this Agreement (as if made on such subsequent date) except for those
representations and warranties that address matters only as of a particular
date (which representations and warranties shall have been accurate as of such
date), such that the condition set forth in Section 8.1 would not be satisfied
or (ii) if any of Parents covenants contained in this Agreement shall have
been breached such that the condition set forth in _Section 8.2_ would not be
satisfied; _provided, however,_ that if such inaccuracy in Parents
representations and warranties as of or a breach of a covenant by Parent is
curable by Parent through the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts to
cure such inaccuracy or breach, then the Company may not terminate this
Agreement under this _Section 9.1(g)_ on account of such inaccuracy or breach
until the earlier of (A) the expiration of a fourteen (14) day period

that he, she or it shall not have and shall not exercise or assert (or attempt
to exercise or assert), any right of contribution, right of indemnity or
other right or remedy against the Surviving Corporation in connection with any
indemnification obligation or any other liability to which he, she or it may
become subject under or in connection with this Agreement or the Company

which such Indemnitee first suffered Damages and ending on the date on which
the liability of such Indemnitor to such Indemnitee is fully satisfied by
such Indemnitor) at a floating rate equal to the rate of interest publicly
announced by Bank of America, N.T. and S.A. from time to time as its prime, base
or reference rate.

Proceeding shall be borne and paid exclusively by the Indemnitors (exclusively

related to _Section 10.2(b)_ );

of any such Legal Proceeding against Parent or the Surviving Corporation;
_provided, however,_ that any failure on the part of Parent to so notify the
Stockholders Agents shall not limit any of the obligations of the Indemnitors
under this _Section 10_ (except to the extent such failure materially
prejudices the defense of such Legal Proceeding). Any and all expenses
relating to the defense of any claim or Legal Proceeding related to _Section
10.2(a)_ and any payments made to settle, adjust or compromise any such claim
or Legal Proceeding shall be paid exclusively from the General Escrow Fund.
Any and all expenses relating to the defense of any claim or Legal Proceeding

or the exercise of such other remedy.

 SECTION 11. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS



 11.1 Stockholders Agents. The Indemnitors hereby appoint Peter Coad as
their agent for purposes of this Agreement (the "Primary Stockholders
Agent"), and Mr. Coad hereby accepts his appointment as the Primary
Stockholders Agent. The Indemnitors hereby appoint Kurt A. Jaggers as their
secondary agent for purposes of this Agreement (the "Secondary Stockholders
Agent," and together with the Primary Stockholders Agent, the "Stockholders
Agents"), and Mr. Jaggers hereby accepts his appointment as the Secondary
Stockholders Agent. Parent shall be entitled to deal exclusively with the
Primary Stockholders Agent on all matters relating to this Agreement, and
shall be entitled to rely conclusively (without further evidence of any kind
whatsoever) on any document executed or purported to be executed on behalf of
any Indemnitor by the Primary Stockholders Agent, and on any other action
taken or purported to be taken on behalf of any Indemnitor by the Primary
Stockholders Agent, as fully binding upon such Indemnitor. Notwithstanding
anything to the foregoing, the Primary Stockholders Agent shall not take any
action binding the Indemnitors without the consent of the Secondary
Stockholders Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If the
Primary Stockholders Agent shall die, become disabled or otherwise be unable
or unwilling to fulfill his responsibilities as agent of the Indemnitors, then
the Indemnitors constituting the recipients of a majority in interest of the
Merger Consideration shall, within twenty (20) days after such death,
disability or resignation, appoint a successor agent and, promptly thereafter,
shall notify Parent of the identity of such successor. If the successor is
appointed as described herein, no notice to any other Indemnitor shall be
required. Any such successor shall become the "Primary Stockholders Agent"
for purposes of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. If for any reason
there is no Primary Stockholders Agent at any time, all references herein to
the Stockholders Agent shall be deemed to refer to the Indemnitors. If the
Secondary Stockholders Agent shall die, become disabled or otherwise be
unable or unwilling to fulfill his responsibilities, then T.A. Associates
shall, within twenty (20) days after such death, disability or resignation,
appoint a successor agent and, within five (5) business days thereafter, shall

omitted thereunder as a Stockholders Agent while acting in good faith and in
the exercise of reasonable judgment. The Indemnitors shall jointly and
severally indemnify the Primary Stockholders Agent and hold the Primary
Stockholders Agent harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred
without recklessness, bad faith or intentional misconduct on the part of the
Primary Stockholders Agent and arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of the Primary Stockholders

 Agents duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any
legal counsel or other professional retained by the Stockholders Agent. By
virtue of their adoption of this Agreement, the Indemnitors hereby agree to
pay the costs and expenses of the Primary Stockholders Agent in connection
with the acceptance and administration of the Primary Stockholders Agents
duties hereunder. The Primary Stockholders Agent shall be reimbursed for
such costs and expenses by making a claim against an Escrow Fund, to the
extent that such Escrow Fund on its Release Date contains sufficient funds
after resolution of all claims made against such Escrow Fund by any
Indemnitees. The Secondary Stockholders Agent will bear all of his own fees
and costs.

delivered to each other party hereto such instruments and other documents, and
shall take such other actions, as such other party may reasonably request
