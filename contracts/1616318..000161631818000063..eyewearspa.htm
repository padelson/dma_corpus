the carrying on of the Target Business, does not infringe, misappropriate or
otherwise violate any Intellectual Property rights of any third party and does

Agreement or any of the Buyer's other obligations under this Agreement that
the Buyer continue to have access to the Equity Financing or any other
materials delivered to the Sellers evidencing the Buyer's possession of
sufficient funds for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on or

upon the availability of the Equity Financing).

6.8 Solvency. Immediately after giving effect to the transactions contemplated

Subsidiaries) and the Buyer Affiliates shall be solvent and shall (a) be able
to pay its debts and obligations as they become due, (b) own property that has
a fair saleable value greater than the amounts required to pay its debts
(including a reasonable estimate of the amount of all contingent liabilities),
and (c) have adequate capital to carry on their respective businesses. No

by this Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present

incurred, nor plans to incur, debts which following Closing will be beyond its
ability to pay as they become absolute and matured.

unrestricted cash on hand or other sources of immediately available funds to

purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection
with, the distribution thereof in violation of applicable federal, state or
provincial securities Laws. The Buyer acknowledges that the sale of the Target
Shares hereunder has not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the
"Securities Act") or any state securities Laws, and that the Target Shares may
not be sold, transferred, offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated, or
otherwise disposed of without registration under the Securities Act, pursuant
to an exemption from the Securities Act or in a transaction not subject
thereto. The Buyer represents that it is an "Accredited Investor" as that term
is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D of the Securities Act.

6.11 Buyer's Reliance. The Buyer acknowledges that none of the Sellers, the
Target Entities or any other Person have made or is making any representation
or warranty, expressed or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any
information regarding the Target Shares, the Company, or any Company
Subsidiary furnished or made available to the Buyer and its Representatives,
except as expressly set forth in Articles 4 and 5 of this Agreement, and
except as set forth in this Agreement, none of the Sellers, the Target
Entities or any other Person (including any Representative of either of the
Sellers and/or the Target Entities) shall have or be subject to any liability
to the Buyer, or any other Person, resulting from the Buyer's use of any
information, documents or material made available to the Buyer in any "data
rooms," management presentations, due diligence or in any other form in
expectation of the transactions contemplated hereby. The Buyer acknowledges
that the Buyer is acquiring the Target Entities and the Company Subsidiaries
without any representation or warranty as to merchantability or fitness for
any particular purpose of their respective assets, in an "as is" condition and
on a "where is" basis, except as otherwise expressly represented or warranted
in Articles 4 and 5 of this Agreement. The Buyer acknowledges that, except for
the representations and warranties contained in Articles 4 and 5, the Buyer
has not relied on any other express or implied representation or warranty or
other statement by or on behalf of the Target Entities, or the Sellers or any
of their respective Affiliates, including with respect to any pro-forma
financial information, financial projections or other forward-looking
statements of the Sellers, the Target Entities, or any Company Subsidiary, and
the Buyer will make no claim with respect thereto (other than with respect to
any breach of a warranty or representation expressly set forth in Articles 4
and 5).

to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all other authorizations, approvals,
consents and waivers from all Persons and Governmental Authorities necessary
to be obtained by it, or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, in order for it to

to the Closing.

(c) The parties hereto shall coordinate and cooperate with one another in
exchanging and providing such information to each other and in making the
filings and requests referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) above. The parties
hereto shall supply such reasonable assistance as may be reasonably requested
by any other party hereto in connection with the foregoing; provided, however,
that the parties hereby agree that any commercially sensitive information may
be shared on a counsel to counsel basis only.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if any Order
is made or any Action is threatened or instituted challenging any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as violating any Antitrust Law,
Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take any and all such action
(including: (i) proposing, negotiating, offering to commit and effect (and if
such offer is accepted, committing to and effecting), by Order, consent
decree, hold separate order, trust, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture,
license, disposition or hold separate of such assets or businesses of Buyer or
its Affiliates, or otherwise offering to take or offering to commit to take
any action (including any action that limits its freedom of action, ownership
or control with respect to, or its ability to retain or hold, any of the
businesses, assets, product lines, properties or services of Buyer or its
Affiliates or of the Target Entities, any Company Subsidiary or their
respective affiliates) to the extent legally permissible, and if the offer is

by any Governmental Authority or private party, challenging the transactions
contemplated hereby) as may be required (x) by the applicable Governmental
Authority (including the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of
Justice or the Federal Trade Commission) in order to resolve such objections
as such Governmental Authority may have to such transactions under such
Antitrust Law or (y) by any domestic or foreign court or similar tribunal, in
any action brought by any Person or Governmental Authority challenging the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as violating any Antitrust Law, in
order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction,
temporary restraining order or other Order that has the effect of delaying or
preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. It shall not be deemed a failure to satisfy the conditions
specified in Section 8.1(c) or Section 8.2(c), if in any suit brought by any
Person or Governmental Authority challenging the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as violating any Antitrust Law, a court enters or the
applicable Governmental Authority makes an Order permitting the transactions
contemplated by 

this Agreement, but requiring that any of the businesses, product lines or
assets of any of Buyer or its Affiliates or of the Target Entities, the
Company Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates be divested or held
separate by Buyer, or that would otherwise limit Buyer's freedom of action
with respect to, or its ability to retain, the Target Entities and the Company
Subsidiaries or any portion thereof or any of Buyer's or its Affiliates' other
assets or businesses.

(e) Each party hereto shall promptly inform the other parties of any material
communication from the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or
any other Governmental Authority regarding any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, to the extent informing the other party is
consistent with applicable Law and would not result in a waiver of any
applicable privilege. If any party hereto or any Affiliate thereof receives a
request for additional information or documentary material from any such
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, then such party will endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be
made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other
party, an appropriate response in compliance with such request, to the extent
such response is consistent with applicable Law and would not result in a
waiver of any applicable privilege. Buyer will advise the Target Entities
promptly in respect of any understandings, undertakings or agreements (oral or
written) which Buyer proposes to make or enter into with the Federal Trade
Commission, the Department of Justice or any other Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and give the
Target Entities the opportunity to attend and participate at any meetings with
respect thereto.

7.4 Efforts to Close. Subject to Section 7.3, each of the parties hereto shall
use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate
actions, to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and to satisfy the conditions set forth in Article 8 as promptly as
practicable and in no event later than the Termination Date.

respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (a) (i) initiate,
solicit or encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public information or
assistance) the submission of any proposals or offers with respect to, (ii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding or relating to, or
(iii) enter into any confidentiality agreement, letter of intent or any other
agreement with any third party relating to, any direct or indirect acquisition
of all or substantially all of the assets of the Target Entities or the
Company Subsidiaries or any Equity Interests, or an acquisition of the Target
Entities or any Company Subsidiary by merger, amalgamation, consolidation,
business combination, liquidation, other extraordinary transaction or
otherwise (each of the foregoing transactions, an "Acquisition Transaction"),
or (b) assist any third party in preparing or soliciting an offer relating in
any way to an Acquisition Transaction (in each case other than with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

7.6 Public Announcements. No party to this Agreement will issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to
this Agreement or 

the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto; provided, however, that nothing herein will prohibit any
party from (a) issuing or causing publication of any such press release or
public announcement to the extent that such disclosure is required by
applicable Law or stock exchange requirements, or (b) disclosing any
information that is reasonably required to be disclosed in confidence to a
party's and its Affiliates' respective directors, officers, employees,
professional advisers, current and potential investors and other
Representatives; provided, further, however, that such party shall be
responsible for any breach of the terms hereof by any such Persons. Further,
the Sellers shall procure that Bushnell Outdoor Products SAS shall notify the
representatives of the Works Council about the date hereof and the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the identity of the Buyer and the
private equity owner of the Buyer) prior to issuing or causing the publication
of any press release or other public announcement with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

7.7 Bonds; Letters of Credit. The Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to, or cause the Buyer Affiliates to, replace with effect from (and
conditional upon) the Closing the (a) bonds and other forms of credit support,
including any letters of credits and guarantees, and (b) deposits, in each
case for the benefit of the Target Entities or the Company Subsidiaries, that
are set forth on Schedule 7.7 and, if so requested, the Buyer shall post such
credit support as is reasonably satisfactory to the beneficiary thereof. If
the Buyer does not replace any such bond or other form of credit support or
deposit at or prior to the Closing, then the Buyer shall, as soon as
reasonably practicable replace such bonds, credit support or deposits after
the Closing (together with any additional bonds, credit support or deposits
identified by the Sellers for which notice is provided to the Buyer following
the Closing) and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers and/or its
Affiliates who are identified in Schedule 7.7, from any and all Losses
incurred by such Person under such instruments following the Closing;
provided, however, that no such indemnification shall be available for any
Losses caused by the acts or omissions of any member of the Seller Group.

7.8 Retention of Books and Records. For seven (7) years following the Closing
Date, unless acting with the prior written consent of the Sellers, the Buyer
shall not, and shall cause the Target Entities, the Company Subsidiaries and
the Buyer Affiliates not to, destroy or otherwise dispose of its books,
records, files, designs, specifications, customer lists, supplier lists,
information, reports, correspondence, literature and other sales material,
computer software, and other data and similar materials relating to the
operation of the Target Entities, and/or the Company Subsidiaries prior to the
Closing (all such materials, the "Books and Records") without first offering a
right of access to the Books and Records which are intended to be destroyed or
disposed of to the Sellers. During the period prior to destruction or
disposal, the Buyer shall allow the counsel, accountants, and other
Representatives of the Sellers and the Sellers' Affiliates access to such
Books and Records (with the related right of examination and duplication) for
the purposes of preparing tax returns and complying with law upon reasonable
request by the Sellers and during normal business hours; provided, however,
that (A) any such access shall be conducted in a manner not to unreasonably
interfere with the businesses or operations of the Target Entities or any
Company Subsidiary, and (B) neither any Target Entity, nor any Company
Subsidiary shall be required to provide any (1) access or information that
would result in the violation of any applicable Laws, (2) information the
disclosure of which would jeopardize an applicable privilege (including
attorney-client privilege) applicable to the any of the Target Entities or any
Company Subsidiary or any Buyer Affiliate or 

(3) information the disclosure of which would, or would reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Target Entities or, any Company
Subsidiary or their respective businesses.

7.9 Employee Matters. At least three (3) days prior to the Closing Date, the
Sellers shall provide Buyer with a list of all employees of the Target
Entities or the Company Subsidiaries terminated by the Target Entities or the
Company Subsidiaries within the ninety (90) days preceding the Closing Date.

7.10 Tax Matters.

(a) Preparation and Filing of Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns of the Target
Entities and Company Subsidiaries.

(i) The Buyer shall prepare (or cause to be prepared), at the Buyer's sole
cost and expense (except that the Sellers shall be responsible for reasonable
out-of-pocket third-party costs for Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns), all Pre-
Closing Period Tax Returns (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, amendments
or amended Tax Returns) required to be filed by each of the Target Entities
and the Company Subsidiaries with an initial Due Date after the Closing Date.
All such Tax Returns shall be prepared by the Buyer in a manner consistent
with the prior practice of the applicable Target Entity or Company Subsidiary
(as the case may be), except as required by applicable Law. The Buyer shall
deliver (or cause to be delivered) drafts of all such Pre-Closing Period Tax
Returns (save that there shall be no requirement for the Buyer to deliver any
such returns which relate to property Taxes, employment Taxes or sales and use
Taxes), to the Sellers for Sellers' review at least thirty (30) days prior to
the Due Date of any such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return, provided, however,
that no failure or delay of the Buyer in providing any Pre-Closing Period Tax
Returns for the Sellers to review shall reduce or otherwise affect the
obligations or liabilities of Sellers pursuant to this Agreement except to the
extent the Sellers are actually prejudiced by such delay or failure; provided,
further that such Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns (excluding any such returns
which relate to property Taxes, employment Taxes or sales and use Taxes) shall
be subject to the Sellers' review and approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, all Tax Returns shall be prepared in such a manner
so that any Tax deductions or other Tax benefits attributable to any
compensation or similar payments associated with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or other fees, costs and expenses incurred by, paid by, to
be incurred by or to be paid by the Target Entities or Company Subsidiaries in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are reflected
in the Pre-Closing Period Tax Return to the extent consistent with applicable
Law. If the Sellers dispute any item on such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return,
Sellers shall notify the Buyer (by written notice within fifteen (15) days of
receipt of such draft of such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return) of such disputed
item (or items) and the basis for its objection. The Buyer and the Sellers
shall act in good faith to resolve any dispute prior to the Due Date of any
such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return, and if the parties agree on such Pre-
Closing Period Tax Return, then the parties shall file or cause to be filed
the applicable Tax Return in such agreed-upon manner. If the Buyer and the
Sellers cannot resolve any 

disputed item, the item in question shall be resolved by the Accounting Firm
as promptly as practicable, whose determination shall be final and conclusive
for purposes of this Section 7.10(a). The fees and expenses of the Accounting
Firm shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by the Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by
the Sellers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Accounting
Firm has not resolved the dispute by an applicable Due Date, the parties shall
file or cause to be filed, the applicable Tax Return in such manner as the
Sellers reasonably determine under applicable Law, and the parties shall amend
such Tax Returns to the extent necessary to conform to the Accounting Firm's
final determination.

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers shall be responsible for preparing
and filing any Tax Returns required to be filed by the parent of any Seller
Affiliated Group.

(b) Preparation and Filing of Straddle Period Tax Returns of the Target
Entities and Company Subsidiaries. The Buyer shall prepare, (or cause to be
prepared,) at the Buyer's sole cost and expense, all Straddle Period Tax
Returns (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, amendments or amended Tax
Returns) required to be filed by each of the Target Entities and the Company
Subsidiaries. All such Straddle Period Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed
in a manner that is consistent with the prior practice of the applicable
Target Entity or Company Subsidiary (as the case may be), except as required
by applicable Law. The Buyer shall deliver or cause to be delivered drafts of
each Straddle Period Tax Return to the Sellers for review at least thirty (30)
days prior to the Due Date of such Straddle Period Tax Return and shall notify
the Sellers in writing of Buyer's calculation of the Sellers' share of the
Taxes of such Target Entity or Company Subsidiary relating to such Straddle
Period (determined in accordance with Section 7.10(c)); provided, however,
that no failure or delay of the Buyer in providing any Straddle Period Tax
Returns for the Sellers to review shall reduce or otherwise affect the
obligations or liabilities of Sellers pursuant to this Agreement except to the
extent the Sellers are actually prejudiced by such delay or failure; provided,
further that such draft of such Straddle Period Tax Return and the calculation
of the Sellers' share of the Tax liability for such Straddle Period
(determined in accordance with Section 7.10(c)) shall be subject to the
Sellers' review and approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the Sellers dispute any item on such
Straddle Period Tax Return and/or the calculation of Sellers' share of the
liability for Taxes for such Straddle Period, it shall notify the Buyer (by
written notice within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the later of Sellers'
receipt of such draft of such Straddle Period Tax Return or written notice
relating to Buyer's calculation of Sellers' share of the Taxes of the
applicable Target Entity or Company Subsidiary relating to such Straddle
Period) of such disputed item (or items) and the basis for its objection. If
the Sellers do not object by written notice within such period, the amount of
Taxes shown to be due and payable on such Straddle Period Tax Return and the
Buyer's calculation of the Sellers' share of the Taxes of the Target Entities
or the Company Subsidiaries, as the case may be, relating to such Straddle
Period (determined in accordance with Section 7.10(c)) shall be deemed to be
accepted and agreed upon, and final and conclusive, for purposes of this
Section 7.10(b). The Buyer and the Sellers shall act in good faith to resolve
any dispute prior to the Due Date of any such Straddle Period Tax Return. If
the Buyer and the Sellers cannot resolve any disputed item, the item in
question shall be resolved by the Accounting Firm as promptly as practicable,
whose determination shall be final and conclusive for purposes of this Section
7.10(b). The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall 

be paid fifty percent (50%) by the Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by the
Sellers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Accounting Firm
has not resolved the dispute by an applicable Due Date, the parties shall file
or cause to be filed, the applicable Tax Return in such manner as the Sellers
reasonably determine under applicable Law, and the parties shall amend such
Tax Returns to the extent necessary to conform to the Accounting Firm's final
determination.

(c) Allocation of Taxes relating to Straddle Periods. For purposes of Section
7.10(b) or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement, whenever it is necessary to
determine the Liability for Taxes for a Straddle Period relating to:

(i) Taxes (A) based on the income or receipts of any Target Entity or Company
Subsidiary for a Straddle Period, (B) imposed in connection with any sale or
other transfer or assignment of property (including sales, use and transfer
Taxes), other than Transfer Taxes described in Section 7.10(d), for a Straddle
Period, or (C) withholding and employment Taxes, the determination of the
Taxes of the Target Entity or Company Subsidiary for the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on and including, and the portion of the Straddle
Period beginning and ending after, the Closing Date shall be calculated by
assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two taxable periods, one which
ended at the close of the Closing Date and the other which began at the
beginning of the day following the Closing Date and items of income, gain,
deduction, loss or credit of the Target Entities and Company Subsidiaries for
the Straddle Period shall be allocated between such two taxable years or
periods based on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books of
the Target Entities and the Company Subsidiaries were closed at the close of
the Closing Date, provided, however, that exemptions, allowances or deductions
that are calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for amortization
and depreciation, shall be apportioned between such two taxable years or
periods on a daily basis (notwithstanding that such exemptions, allowances or
deductions may under applicable Law be determined solely at the end of the
taxable period);

(ii) Interest or penalties included in Taxes shall be treated as attributable
to a Pre-Closing Period (or the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date) to the extent relating to a Tax for a Pre-Closing Period (or
portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date) whether such items
are incurred, accrued, assessed or similarly charged on, before or after the
Closing Date;

(iii) Taxes imposed on any Target Entity or Company Subsidiary or any other
Buyer Indemnitees as a result of income of any Flow-Thru Entity realized prior
to the Closing Date (such income being computed assuming the Flow-Thru Entity
had a year that ends on the Closing Date and closed its books) shall be
treated as Taxes of the Target Entity or Company Subsidiary for a Pre-Closing
Period; and

(iv) Taxes of the Target Entities and Company Subsidiaries not described in
Section 7.10(c)(i) for a Straddle Period (e.g., such as real property or other
ad valorem Taxes), the determination of the Taxes of the Target Entities and
Company Subsidiaries for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and
including, and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning and ending after,
the Closing Date shall be calculated by allocating to the 

periods before and after the Closing Date pro rata, based on the number of
days of the Straddle Period before and ending on (and including) the Closing
Date, on the one hand, and the number of days in the Straddle Period beginning
and ending after the Closing Date, on the other hand.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (x) all
transactions that occur on the Closing Date but after the Closing and that are
not in the ordinary course of business of the Target Entities or Company
Subsidiaries shall be considered to be attributable to the period that
commences on the day following the Closing Date, and (y) all Tax Returns shall
be prepared in such a manner so that any Tax deductions or other Tax benefits
attributable to any compensation or similar payments associated with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or other fees, costs and expenses
incurred by, paid by, to be incurred by or to be paid by the Target Entities
or Company Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are reflected in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on
the close of the Closing Date to the extent consistent with applicable Law.

(d) Transfer Taxes. The Sellers, on one hand, and the Buyer, on the other
hand, shall be responsible for, and shall pay when due, fifty percent (50%) of
any and all sales, use, transfer, real property transfer or gains tax, stamp
tax, stock transfer tax, or other similar Tax imposed on any of the Target
Entities or Company Subsidiaries or the Sellers or the Buyer as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any penalties or interest
(or addition to Tax) with respect to such Taxes (collectively, "Transfer
Taxes"), regardless of the Person liable for such Transfer Taxes under
applicable Law. The Buyer shall file (or cause to be filed) all Tax Returns
with respect to Transfer Taxes and the Sellers agree to cooperate with the
Buyer, the Target Entities, Company Subsidiaries and their respective
Affiliates in the filing of any such Tax Returns, including promptly supplying
any information in their possession that is reasonably necessary to complete
such Tax Returns or applying for or providing information relating to any
applicable exemption under local Law. For the avoidance of doubt, Transfer
Taxes shall not include any Taxes relating to the Restructuring.

(e) Tax Refunds.

(i) Subject to Section 7.10(e)(iv), Any refunds of Taxes, plus any interest
attributable thereto, that are received by the Buyer (or its Affiliates) or
any of the Target Entities or Company Subsidiaries that are related to
Pre‑Closing Periods or Straddle Periods of the Target Entities or the Company
Subsidiaries (such refund for a Straddle Period to be allocated in accordance
with the principles of Section 7.10(c)), shall be for the sole account of the
Sellers. For purposes of this Section 7.10(e), each of the Target Entities and
Company Subsidiaries shall be deemed to have received a refund of Taxes to the
extent that such Target Entity or Company Subsidiary elects to apply such
refund, which it would otherwise have been entitled to receive, to offset or
reduce Taxes relating to any Post-Closing Period or with respect to any
Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period beginning after the
Closing Date (determined in accordance with the principles of Section
7.10(c)). The Buyer shall, and shall cause each of the Target Entities and
Company Subsidiaries, to cooperate with the Sellers in obtaining refunds of
the Target Entities and the Company Subsidiaries 

relating to Pre-Closing Periods and Straddle Periods (including through
amendment of Tax Returns) for which Sellers will reimburse Buyer for any
reasonable out-of-pocket third party costs.

(ii) To the extent that the Buyer (or its Affiliates) or any of the Target
Entities or Company Subsidiaries receives (or is deemed to receive pursuant to
this Section 10.7(e)) a refund that is for the benefit of the Sellers, the
Buyer shall pay to the Sellers the amount of such refund (without interest
other than interest received from the Governmental Authority), net of (x) any
Taxes related to the receipt of such refund (including any Taxes that would be
imposed on a distribution of any portion of such refund to the Buyer); and (y)
any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that the Buyer or any Target Entity or
Company Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates incur (or has or will incur)
with respect to such refund (and related interest). The net amount due to the
Sellers shall be payable ten (10) days after receipt of the refund from the
applicable Governmental Authority (or, if the refund is in the form of direct
credit, ten (10) days after filing the Tax Return claiming such credit).

(iii) With respect to any Straddle Period Tax Return (and without duplication
of any refunds to be paid pursuant to Section 10.7(e)), the Buyer shall
promptly notify Seller of, and the Buyer shall pay (or cause to be paid) to
the Seller promptly after such Straddle Period Tax Return is filed, an amount
equal to the excess, if any, of (x) the aggregate amount of cash deposited
with (or prepaid to) a Tax authority by a Target Entity or Company Subsidiary
(as the case may be) on or prior to the Closing Date with respect to such
Straddle Period Tax Return over (y) such Target Entity's or Company
Subsidiary's share of the Taxes of such Target Entity or Company Subsidiary
for such Straddle Period (ignoring the amount of such cash deposits and
prepayments that have been made on or prior to the Closing Date) (as
determined pursuant to Section 7.10(c)), provided, however, that the Buyer
will not have any obligation to Seller pursuant to this Section 7.10(c) to the
extent such excess was included in the computation of Final Working Capital or
Final Closing Indebtedness, each as finally determined.

(iv) Nothing in this Section 7.10(e) shall require that the Buyer make any
payment with respect to any refund for a Tax (and such refunds shall be for
the benefit of the Buyer, the Target Entities and the Company Subsidiaries)
that is with respect to (A) any refund of Tax that is the result of the
carrying back of any net operating loss or other Tax attribute or Tax credit
incurred in a Post-Closing Period (or portion of any Straddle Period beginning
after the Closing Date); (B) any refund for Tax to the extent the reflected as
a current asset (or offset to a current liability) on the Final Working
Capital, as finally determined; (C) any refund of Tax for a Pre-Closing Period
or Straddle Period of the Target Entities or Company Subsidiaries which Tax is
paid after the Closing Date by any of the Buyer, the Target Entities or the
Company Subsidiaries, to the extent Sellers did not previously indemnify Buyer
for such Tax pursuant to Section 10.2; (D) any refund for Tax that gives rise
to a payment obligation by any Target Entity or Company Subsidiary to any
Person under applicable Law or pursuant to a provision of a contract or other
agreement entered (or assumed) by the Target Entity or Company Subsidiary on
or prior to the Closing 

Date; or (E) any refund for Tax to the extent Buyer has made a payment to
Sellers with respect to such Tax under Section 7.10(j).

(f) Cooperation.

(i) The Sellers and the Buyer shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to (including with respect to the Buyer after the Closing, the
Target Entities and the Company Subsidiaries) reasonably cooperate, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and
Representatives to reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax
Returns, including maintaining and making available to each other all records
necessary, in connection with all Pre-Closing Periods and Straddle Periods and
in resolving in good faith all disputes and audits with respect to all such
taxable periods relating to Taxes. Buyer recognizes that the Sellers may need
access, from time to time, after the Closing Date, to certain accounting and
Tax records and information held by the Target Entities and the Company
Subsidiaries to the extent such records and information pertain to events
relating to Pre-Closing Periods or Straddle Periods; therefore,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement (but
subject to Section 7.10(f)(ii))), the Buyer agrees that from and after the
Closing Date, the Buyer and its Affiliates shall, and shall cause each of the
Target Entities and Company Subsidiaries, their Affiliates and successors to
retain and maintain such records and information until the later of (i) seven
(7) years following the Closing Date and (ii) the applicable statute of
limitations with respect to the Tax for which such records or information
relate; and allow the Sellers (and the agents and Representatives of the
Sellers) to inspect, review and make copies of such records and information as
the Sellers or Sellers' agents and Representatives of the Sellers may deem
necessary or appropriate from time to time. The Sellers recognize that the
Buyer may need access, from time to time, after the Closing Date, to certain
accounting and Tax records and information held by the Seller Group to the
extent such records and information relate to the Target Entities and/or any
Company Subsidiaries and pertain to events relating to Pre-Closing Periods or
Straddle Periods; therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Sellers agree that from and after the Closing
Date, the Sellers and their Affiliates shall retain and maintain such records
and information until the later of (i) seven (7) years following the Closing
Date and (ii) the applicable statute of limitations with respect to the Tax
for which such records or information relate; and allow the Buyer (and the
agents and Representatives of the Buyer) to inspect, review and make copies of
such records and information as the Buyer or Buyer's agents and
Representatives of the Buyer may deem necessary or appropriate from time to
time.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
none of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including after the Closing any of
the Target Entities or Company Subsidiaries) shall have the right to receive
or obtain any information relating to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Sellers or
any of their Affiliates (or any of its predecessors) other than information
relating solely to the Target Entities and Company Subsidiaries. For the
avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement: (i) Section 7.10(a) and Section 7.10(b) shall not apply to any
Tax Returns required to be filed by any Person other than a Target Entity or
Company 

Subsidiary (including any affiliated, combined, unitary or similar group of
which Vista Outdoor, Inc. or any of its Affiliates (other than a Target Entity
or Company Subsidiary)) is the common parent and (ii) Section 7.10(g) shall
not apply to any demand, claim, or notice of commencement of a claim, proposed
adjustment, assessment, examination or other administrative or court
proceeding with respect to Taxes of any Person other than a Target Entity or
Company Subsidiary (including any affiliated, combined, unitary or similar
group of which Vista Outdoor, Inc. or any of its Affiliates (other than a
Target Entity or Company Subsidiary)) is the common parent.

(iii) Tax Package. With respect to any income Tax Return required to be filed
by an affiliated or similar group of which Sellers (or its Affiliates other
than a Target Entity or Company Subsidiary) is the common parent and any
Target Entity or Company Subsidiary was a member, Buyer, if so requested by
the Sellers, shall (for which Buyer shall be reimbursed by Sellers for
reasonable out-of-pocket third party costs) promptly (but in no event later
than 120 following the Closing Date) cause the Target Entities and Company
Subsidiaries to prepare and provide to the Sellers a package of Tax
information materials, which shall be completed in accordance with the past
practice of the Target Entities and Company Subsidiaries as to providing the
information, schedules and work papers and as to the method of computation of
separate taxable income or other relevant measure of income of the Target
Entities and Company Subsidiaries.

(g) Tax Contests.

(i) Buyer shall deliver a written notice to the Sellers promptly following any
audit, demand, claim, or notice of commencement of a claim, proposed
adjustment, assessment, examination or other administrative or court
proceeding with respect to Taxes of any Target Entity or Company Subsidiary
for which the Sellers may be liable pursuant to this Agreement ("Tax Contest")
and shall describe in reasonable detail (to the extent known by the Buyer or
its Affiliates, any Target Entity or Company Subsidiary) the facts
constituting the basis for such Tax Contest, the nature of the relief sought,
and the amount of the claimed Losses, if any (the "Tax Claim Notice"). No
failure or delay of the Buyer in the performance of the foregoing shall reduce
or otherwise affect the obligations or liabilities of Sellers pursuant to this
Agreement except to the extent the Sellers are prejudiced or damaged by any
such failure or delay.

(ii) With respect to any and all Tax Contests relating solely to a Pre-Closing
Period, the Sellers may elect to assume and control the defense of such Tax
Contest by written notice to the Buyer within sixty (60) days after delivery
by the Buyer to the Sellers of the Tax Claim Notice. If the Sellers elect to
assume and control the defense of such Tax Contest, the Sellers shall (A) bear
their own costs and expenses, (B) be entitled to engage their own counsel, (C)
control such Tax Contest in any permissible manner and in good faith, and the
Buyer shall (and shall cause its Affiliates including any Target Entity or
Company Subsidiary) to cooperate with the Sellers in pursuing such Tax Contest
(including by providing appropriate powers of attorney and executing any and
all agreements, instruments and other documents that are necessary or
appropriate in connection with the 

settlement or compromise of any such Tax Contest). If the Sellers elect to
assume the defense of any Tax Contest, the Sellers shall (x) keep the Buyer
reasonably informed of all material developments and events relating to such
Tax Contest (including promptly forwarding copies to the Buyer of any related
correspondence and shall provide the Buyer with an opportunity to review and
comment on any material correspondence before the Sellers send such
correspondence to any Taxing Authority), (y) consult with the Buyer in
connection with the defense and prosecution of such Tax Contest, and (z)
provide such cooperation and information as the Buyer shall reasonably request
to such Tax Contest, and the Buyer shall have the right to participate in (but
not control) the defense of such Tax Contest at its own cost and expense
(including participating in any material discussions with the applicable
Taxing Authorities relating to such Tax Contest). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Sellers shall not settle or compromise any Tax Contest without
the consent of the Buyer which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

(iii) In connection with any Tax Contest relating to a Pre-Closing Period that
the Sellers do not elect to control pursuant to Section 7.10(g)(ii), or with
respect to any Straddle Period, such Tax Contest shall be controlled by the
Buyer, at its own cost and expense, provided, however, that Sellers shall be
responsible for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Buyer
relating to any Tax Contest for a Pre-Closing Period that is controlled by
Buyer pursuant to this Section 7.10(g)(iii) and fifty (50) percent of all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Buyer relating to any Tax
Contest for a Straddle Period, and the Sellers agree to cooperate with Buyer
in pursuing such Tax Contest, provided, however, that none of Buyer or its
Affiliates (including any Target Entity or Company Subsidiary) shall enter
into any settlement or compromise with respect to any such Tax Contest without
the prior written consent of the Sellers, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In connection with any Tax
Contest that is described in this Section 7.10(g)(iii) and controlled by the
Buyer, the Buyer shall (x) keep the Sellers reasonably informed of all
material developments and events relating to such Tax Contest (including
promptly forwarding copies to the Sellers of any related correspondence and
shall provide the Sellers with an opportunity to review and comment on any
material correspondence before the Buyer sends such correspondence to any
Taxing Authority), (y) consult with the Sellers in connection with the defense
and prosecution of such Tax Contest, and (z) provide such cooperation and
information as the Sellers shall reasonably request to such Tax Contest and,
at its own cost and expense, the Sellers shall have the right to participate
in (but not control) the defense of such Tax Contest (including participating
in any material discussions with the applicable Taxing Authorities relating to
such Tax Contest).

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
procedures for all Tax Contests shall be governed exclusively by this Section
7.10(g) (and not Section 10.5).

(v) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers shall control any claim, suit,
action, litigation, or proceeding (including any Tax audit) of any Tax or Tax
Return of any Seller Affiliated Group. 

(h) Limitation on Actions. Except to the extent Buyer is expressly entitled to
do so pursuant to any other applicable subsection of this Section 7.10 or to
the extent otherwise required by applicable Law, the Buyer shall not (and
shall not permit its Affiliates, including the Target Entities and Company
Subsidiaries to), in respect of any Pre-Closing Period of the Target Entities
and Company Subsidiaries (or in respect of any Straddle Period of the Target
Entities and Company Subsidiaries, subject to the consent of Sellers, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, in respect of such Straddle
Periods): (i) make, revoke or amend any election relating to Taxes, including

respect to Taxes that shifts taxable income from a taxable period (or portion

to a taxable period (or portion of any taxable period) beginning (or deemed to
begin) before the Closing Date or shifts deductions or Losses from a taxable
period (or portion of any taxable period) that begins (or is deemed to begin)
before the Closing Date to a taxable period beginning (or deemed to begin)
after the Closing Date, (vii) surrender any right to claim a refund of Taxes,
(viii) unilaterally initiate discussions or examinations with any Taxing

Subsidiary (or the Sellers or their Affiliates), (ix) make any voluntary
disclosure involving Taxes, (x) amend, modify, otherwise refile, or cause to
be amended, modified or otherwise refiled, any Tax Returns, or (xi) take any
action after the Closing (other than any action after the Closing on the
Closing Date that is in the ordinary course of business) that would reasonably
be expected to result in any increase in Tax liability (or a reduction in a
Tax refund) in respect of any Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period of any
Target Entity or Company Subsidiary (or the Sellers or their Affiliates).

(i) Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements. Effective as of the Closing, any
and all Tax Sharing Agreements between any of the Sellers and/or any of its
Affiliates (other than any of the Target Entities or Company Subsidiaries), on
the one hand, and any of the Target Entities or Company Subsidiaries, on the
other hand, shall be terminated and shall have no further effect, and
thereafter each of the Target Entities and Company Subsidiaries shall not be
bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

(j) Over Accrual of Taxes.

(i) General. As promptly as is practicable after the final resolution of the
adjustments provided pursuant to Section 2.3, the Buyer and the Sellers shall

cases to the greatest extent that such Persons are indemnified or have the
right to advancement of expenses immediately prior to the date hereof by the

to whom this Section 7.11 applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this
Section 7.11, and this Section 7.11 shall be enforceable by such DandO
Indemnified Parties and their respective successors, heirs and legal
Representatives and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the

their respective Affiliates, are requested or required (by oral question or
request for information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory,
subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any such
information, the Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly 

notify the Buyer of the request or requirement so that Buyer may seek, at its
sole cost and expense, an appropriate protective order or waive compliance
with the provisions of this Section 7.13(a). If, in the absence of a
protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, the Sellers are, on the
advice of counsel, legally required to disclose any such information, the
Sellers may disclose such information to the requesting authority; provided,
however, that the Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain,

or other assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such
portion of the information required to be disclosed as the Buyer shall
designate in good faith.

(b) For a period of five (5) years following the Closing Date, the Buyer shall
not, and shall cause its respective Affiliates not to, use or disclose to any
Person any documents and information concerning the Sellers, or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Target Entities or any Company Subsidiary),
furnished to it by the Sellers or their respective Representatives in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, in
each case other than the Company Confidential Information. In the event that
the Buyer or any of its Affiliates, is requested or required (by oral question
or request for information or documents in any legal proceeding,
interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to
disclose any such information, the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to promptly notify the Sellers of the request or requirement so that
Sellers may seek, at their sole cost and expense, an appropriate protective
order or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section 7.13(b). If, in
the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, the
Buyer is, on the advice of counsel, legally required to disclose any such
information, the Buyer may disclose such information to the requesting
authority; provided, however, that the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain, at the reasonable request of the Sellers and at the
Sellers' sole cost, an order or other assurance that confidential treatment
will be accorded to such portion of the information required to be disclosed
as the Sellers shall designate in good faith.

admiralty, for, upon or by reason of any matter, thing or cause whatsoever,
from the beginning of the world to the Closing Date, including, in connection
with the Affiliated Agreements (other than this Agreement, the Transaction
Documents and as set forth on Schedule 7.14).

(c) The Sellers represent and warrant to the Released Persons that the Sellers
have not assigned any such claim set forth in Section 7.14(b). or right or
interest in any Affiliate Agreement, and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless

Section 10.4 or Section 10.5 within the applicable survival period provided
above, the claims set forth in such notice shall survive until such time as
such claims are finally resolved in accordance with this Article 10.

10.2 Indemnification

(a) Indemnification by the Sellers. From and after the Closing (but subject to
the limitations and other provisions of this Article 10) the Sellers will
jointly and severally defend, indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its
Affiliates (including, after Closing the Target Entities and the Company
Subsidiaries) and their respective officers, directors, managers, employees,
successors and assigns (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnitees") from and
against, and pay or reimburse Buyer Indemnitees for, all Losses arising from,
in connection with, or as a result of: (i) any inaccuracy or breach of any of
the Sellers Representations, (ii) the breach of any agreement or covenant of
the Sellers or the Target Entities contained in this Agreement (in the case of
the Target Entities, to the extent such agreement or covenant contemplates
performance on or before the Closing Date), (iii) any and all Indebtedness and
Transaction Expenses, in each case, to the extent not actually paid at or
prior to the Closing, (iv) the Excluded Business, (v) any fees, expenses or
other payments incurred or owned by any Target Entity or Company Subsidiary to
any brokers, financial advisors or comparable other Persons retained or
employed by any Seller, Target Entity or Company Subsidiary in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (vi) any Indemnified Taxes,
(vii) the Vista Outdoor Inc. Pension and Retirement Plan and any retiree
medical plan of the Sellers and its Affiliates, (viii) any failure to consult
with the Works Council or any other similar employee representative body of
the Target Employees in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (whether such Losses arise before or after the Closing),
(ix) the performance or non-performance by the Sellers of any of their
obligations under Section 7.21, and (x) the termination of any employee of any
Target Entity or Company Subsidiary. 

(b) Indemnification by the Buyer. From and after the Closing (but subject to
the limitations and other provisions of this Article 10) the Buyer will
defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers, their respective Affiliates
and their respective officers, directors, managers, employees, successors and
assigns (collectively, the "Seller Indemnitees") from and against, and pay or
reimburse Seller Indemnitees for all Losses arising from, in connection with,
or as a result of: (i) any inaccuracy or breach of any Buyer Representations,
(ii) the breach of any agreement or covenant of the Buyer contained in this
Agreement or any Transaction Document, (iii) any fees, expenses or other
payments incurred or owned by the Buyer to any brokers, financial advisors or
comparable other Persons retained or employed by the Buyer in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv) the operation of the
Target Business following the Closing solely with respect to any Losses first
arising following the Closing Date, including any Actions brought by or on
behalf of any Post-Closing Employees related to any action of the Buyer, the
Target Entities, or the Company Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates,
following the Closing.

10.3 Limitations on Indemnity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the Buyer (for itself and on behalf of the Buyer Indemnitees)
and the Sellers (for themselves and on behalf of the Seller Indemnitees) agree
as follows:

(a) The Buyer Indemnitees shall not have the right to be indemnified pursuant
to Section 10.2(a)(i) unless and until the Buyer Indemnitees shall have
incurred on a cumulative basis aggregate Losses in an amount exceeding
$800,000 (the "Deductible"), in which case, the Buyer Indemnitees shall only
be entitled to receive Losses in excess of such amount, and the aggregate
amount of Losses for which Buyer Indemnitees will be entitled to recover
pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(i) will not exceed $800,000 (the "Cap"); provided,
however, that the Deductible and the Cap shall not apply to the rights of the
Buyer Indemnitees to be indemnified pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(i) with
respect to the Fundamental Representations or in the event of Fraud.

(b) The Seller Indemnitees shall not have the right to be indemnified pursuant
to Section 10.2(b)(i) unless and until the Seller Indemnitees shall have
incurred on a cumulative basis aggregate Losses in an amount exceeding the
Deductible, and the aggregate amount of Losses for which Seller Indemnitees
will be entitled to recover pursuant to Section 10.2(b)(i) will not exceed the
Cap; provided, however, that the Deductible and the Cap shall not apply to the
rights of the Seller Indemnitees to be indemnified pursuant to Section
10.2(b)(i) with respect to the Buyer Fundamental Representations or in the
event of Fraud.

(c) In no event shall the aggregate indemnification obligations of the Sellers
under Section 10.2(a) exceed the Purchase Price. In no event shall the
aggregate indemnification obligations of the Buyer under Section 10.2(b)
exceed the Purchase Price.

(d) Each Indemnified Person shall take, and cause its Affiliates to take, all
commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any
event or circumstance that would be reasonably expected to, or does, give rise
thereto, including, but not limited to, incurring costs only to the minimum
extent necessary to remedy the breach that gives rise to such Loss or, except
with respect to breaches of Section 5.19(b), recovering any Loss from
applicable insurance policies or third parties (including, in the case of the
Buyer Indemnitees, the RandW Insurance Policy). If any Indemnified Person
recovers any amounts in respect of Losses from 

any third party at any time after any Indemnifying Person has paid all or a
portion of such Losses to the Indemnified Person pursuant to the provisions of
this Article 10, and such Indemnified Person has therefore recovered from the
Indemnifying Person and any relevant third party an amount which, after
subtracting any Taxes attributable thereto and any expenses incurred in making
such recovery, is greater than the loss suffered by the Indemnifying Person
(such amount being an "Excess Recovery"), then the Indemnified Person shall
repay to the Indemnifying Person an amount (in aggregate) equal to the lesser
of (i) the Excess Recovery; and (ii) the amount the Indemnifying Person has
paid to the Indemnified Person in respect of the relevant Loss.

(e) The parties further acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of this
Section 10.3 shall apply regardless of whether (i) the Buyer obtains at or
following Closing or maintains following Closing the RandW Insurance Policy,
(ii) the RandW Insurance Policy is revoked, cancelled or modified in any manner
after issuance, or (iii) any Buyer Indemnitee makes a claim under the RandW
Insurance Policy and such claim is denied by the insurer.

(f) In no event shall any Indemnifying Person be required to indemnify any
Indemnified Person pursuant to this Article 10 for any Loss to the extent such
Loss was included in the calculations of Final Closing Cash, Final Closing
Indebtedness, Final Transaction Expenses or Final Working Capital other than
where such Loss is in respect of Taxes, to the extent such Taxes have been
paid to the Sellers pursuant to Section 7.10(e) or (j).

(g) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this
Article 10 shall be reduced by any Tax Benefit Amount Realized by such
Indemnified Person, or any of the Target Entities, Company Subsidiaries or any
of their respective Affiliates (including any group of corporations filing a
Tax Return) for the taxable year the loss or deduction was incurred giving
rise to such indemnification for Losses or for the subsequent two (2) taxable
years (the "Tax Benefit Period"). To the extent any Tax Benefit Amount
Realized is realized following the date that an indemnity payment is made by
Sellers to the Buyer hereunder, then no later than ten (10) days after the
applicable Tax Return of the Buyer, the Target Entity or any Company
Subsidiary (or their respective Affiliates including any group of corporations
filing a Tax Return) has been filed that takes into account the deduction,
loss or other Tax attribute generated as a result of the Losses (including
Taxes) that first gave rise to the indemnification by the Sellers or any
subsequent applicable Tax Return filed for the Tax Benefit Period (or ten (10)
days after the receipt of the Tax Benefit Amount Realized from the relevant
Taxing Authority if such benefit is in the form of a refund), the Buyer shall
pay to the Sellers in immediately available funds an amount equal to the Tax
Benefit Amount Realized. The Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
(including each Target Entity and Company Subsidiary) to, provide the Sellers
with all information reasonably requested by the Sellers to allow the Sellers
to calculate any applicable Tax Benefit Amount Realized (including any
determination by the Buyer that no Tax Benefit Amount Realized was realized in
an applicable year); provided that Buyer shall not be required to provide the
Sellers with any right to access or review any Tax Return or Tax work papers
of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Target Entities and the
Company Subsidiaries for any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date);
provided further that the amount of any Tax Benefit Amount Realized (including
if there is no Tax Benefit Amount Realized) shall be certified in writing by
the auditors of the Buyer and its Affiliates (at the sole cost and expense of
the Sellers), if requested by the Sellers. The parties shall cooperate 

and provide all information reasonably available to a party and reasonably
requested by the other party in connection with the calculation of the Tax
Benefit Amount Realized. The Buyer and the Sellers shall act in good faith to
resolve any disputed item as promptly as practicable. The Sellers shall hold
the Buyer harmless for any subsequent disallowance or loss of a Tax Benefit
Amount Realized that has resulted in a reduction in any Loss or resulted in a
payment to the Sellers under this Section 10.3(g).

(h) In no event shall the Sellers be required to indemnify any Buyer
Indemnitee pursuant to Section 10.2(a) for any Loss relating or attributable
to: (i) the existence, amount, expiration date or limitations on (or
availability of) in a taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the
Closing Date of any Tax attribute (including net operating loss, capital loss
or Tax credit carryover or other Tax asset) of any Target Entity or Company
Subsidiary generated or arising in or in respect of a taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date, (ii) any Tax position
that the Buyer or its Affiliates (including any Target Entity or Company
Subsidiary) may take in respect on any taxable period (or portion thereof)
beginning after the Closing Date, or (iii) Taxes of any Target Entity or
Company Subsidiary for any taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after
the Closing Date (except for Taxes resulting from the breach of a
representation set forth in Sections 5.12(k), 5.12(l), 5.12(m), 5.12(n),
5.12(o), 5.12(p), 5.12(q), 5.12(s) and 5.12(u).

10.4 Assertion of Claims; Payment of Claims.

(a) Any claim to be brought under Section 10.2 not involving a Third Party
Claim shall be made in writing by the Buyer Indemnitees (or any of them), or
Seller Indemnitees (or any of them), as applicable (each an "Indemnified
Person"), at any time prior to the expiration of the applicable survival
period, by giving the Sellers or the Buyer, as applicable, (each an
"Indemnifying Person") written notice of the existence of any such claim,
specifying, to the extent known and practical, the nature and basis of such
claim and the amount thereof. If the Indemnifying Person rejects such claim by
providing written notice of such rejection or fails to respond during the
thirty (30) day period following delivery of such notice (in which case the
Indemnifying Person shall be deemed to have rejected such claim) the parties
shall negotiate in good faith for a period of thirty (30) days to resolve such
matter. If the parties cannot resolve the dispute during such thirty (30) day
period they shall have all rights and remedies available to them under
applicable Law, including the right to commence an Action after the applicable
survival period for the enforcement of their rights hereunder.

(b) Any payments required to be made with respect to any claims subject to
this Section 10.4 shall be made by the Indemnifying Person by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by the applicable Seller
Indemnitee or Buyer Indemnitee within five (5) days of the date such claims
are mutually resolved by the parties or the date on which the parties receive
a final non-appealable Order requiring such payment.

10.5 Notice and Defense of Third Party Claims. The obligations and liabilities
of the Indemnifying Persons with respect to Losses resulting from the
assertion of liability by third parties (each, a "Third Party Claim") shall be
subject to the terms and conditions set forth below. 

(a) The relevant Indemnified Person shall give prompt written notice to the
relevant Indemnifying Person of any Third Party Claim which might give rise to
any Loss by the Indemnified Persons, stating the nature and basis of such
Third Party Claim, and the amount thereof to the extent known and practical;
provided, however, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Persons in
notifying the Indemnifying Person shall relieve the Indemnifying Person from
any liability hereunder, unless (and then solely to the extent) the
Indemnifying Person is prejudiced or damaged in any manner by such delay. Such
notice shall be accompanied by copies of all relevant documentation with
respect to such Third Party Claim, including, any summons, complaint or other
pleading which may have been served, any written demand or any other document
or instrument directly relating thereto.

(b) The Indemnifying Person shall have the right to assume the defense of such
Third Party Claim at its own expense and by its own counsel; which counsel
shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Persons (provided that
subject to the ethical rules governing attorneys, Reed Smith, Winston Strawn
LLP and Dickson Minto W.S. shall all be deemed pre-approved for purposes
hereof); provided, however, that the Indemnifying Person shall not have the
right to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, if (i) the claim seeks
only an injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Persons;
(ii) the relevant Indemnified Persons shall have been advised by counsel that
there are one or more legal or equitable defenses available to them which are
different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person
and, in the reasonable opinion of the Indemnified Person, counsel for the
Indemnifying Person could not adequately represent the interests of the
Indemnified Person because such interests could be in conflict with those of
the Indemnifying Persons, (iii) such Third Party Claim involves Losses which
the parties reasonably believe in good faith will be in excess of the
limitations set forth herein to which the related indemnification claim is
subject and/or the carrier under the RandW Insurance Policy requires the
Indemnified Person to control such Third Party Claims, or (iv) the
Indemnifying Person shall not have assumed the defense of such Third Party
Claim in a timely fashion.

(c) If the Indemnifying Person elects to assume the defense of any such Third
Party Claim (under circumstances in which the proviso in Section 10.5(b) is
not applicable), the Indemnified Person may participate in such defense, but
in such case the expenses of the Indemnified Person shall be paid by the
Indemnified Person. If the Indemnifying Person fails to defend a Third Party
Claim, is otherwise restricted from so defending, or if, after commencing or
undertaking any such defense, the Indemnifying Person fails to prosecute or
withdraws from such defense, the Indemnified Person shall have the right to
undertake the defense or settlement thereof, and, if ultimately determined
that the Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification hereunder, at the
Indemnifying Person's expense, including reasonable attorneys' fees. If the
Indemnified Person assumes the defense of any such Third Party Claim in
accordance with the terms hereof and proposes to settle such Third Party Claim
prior to a final judgment thereon, then the Indemnified Person shall give the
Indemnifying Person prompt written notice thereof, and the Indemnified Person
may not settle such Third Party Claim without the written consent of the
Indemnifying Person, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.

(d) If the Indemnifying Person exercises its right to assume the defense of a
Third Party Claim, it shall not make any settlement of any claims without the
written consent of 

the Indemnified Person, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed; provided, that such consent will not be required if such settlement
includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified Person and provides
solely for payment of monetary damages for which the Indemnified Person will
be indemnified in full.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement
(including this Article 10), Section 7.10(g) shall exclusively govern any and
all Tax Contests (and not this Section 10.5).

10.6 Exclusive Remedy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, except (a) as set forth in Section 11.15 and Section 11.18 (b) for
the purchase price adjustment procedures set forth in Section 2.3, (c) for
amounts recoverable under the RandW Insurance Policy or (d) in the case of
Fraud, the rights of the parties to indemnification pursuant to the provisions
of this Article 10 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for the parties
hereto against the Indemnifying Persons, their respective Affiliates and any
of their respective Representatives with respect to any matter in any way
arising from or relating to this Agreement, regardless of the legal theory
under which such liability or obligation may be sought to be imposed, whether
sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law or in equity, including with
respect to any Third Party Claims made under any Environmental Laws and the
parties hereby agree that except as specifically set forth by this Section
10.6, the Indemnified Persons shall have no remedy or recourse with respect to
any of the foregoing other than pursuant to, and subject to the terms and
conditions of, this Article 10.

10.7 Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. To the extent permitted under
applicable Tax Laws, the parties agree to treat any indemnity payment made
under this Article 10 as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all Tax
purposes, and the parties agree to, and will cause their respective Affiliates
to, file their Tax Returns accordingly.

10.8 Amount of Losses. In determining the existence of a breach of any
representation or warranty and the amount of any Losses suffered by an
Indemnified Person related to such breach, all qualifications or exceptions in
such representation or warranty relating to or referring to "materiality" or
"Material Adverse Effect" or any similar term or phrase shall be disregarded.

10.9 No Contribution. The obligations of the Sellers to indemnify the Buyer
Indemnitees pursuant to the terms of this Agreement are the primary
obligations of the Sellers, subject to the limitations set forth herein. The
Sellers hereby waive any right to seek or obtain indemnification or
contribution from the any Target Entity or any of the Company Subsidiaries for
Losses arising from this Agreement.

(a) Any matter, information or item set out in the Schedules delivered under
any specific representation, warranty or covenant hereof, shall be deemed to
have been disclosed for all purposes of this Agreement in response to every
representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement in respect of which
such disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face notwithstanding the
omission of an appropriate cross-reference. Any item of information, matter or

shall not (i) be used as a basis for interpreting the terms "material",
"Material Adverse Effect" or other similar terms in this Agreement or to

any such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred.

(b) The Schedules and Exhibits hereto are hereby incorporated into this
Agreement and are hereby made a part hereof as if set out in full in this
Agreement. 

11.8 Waiver. A waiver of any term or condition of this Agreement by any party
shall only be effective if in writing and shall not be construed as a waiver
of any subsequent breach or failure of the same term or condition, or a waiver
of any other term or condition of this Agreement. Neither the waiver by any of
the parties hereto of a breach of or a default under any of the provisions of
this Agreement, nor the failure by any of the parties, on one or more
occasions, to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise
any right or privilege hereunder, will be construed as a waiver of any other
breach or default of a similar nature, or as a waiver of any of such
provisions, rights or privileges hereunder.

11.9 Binding Effect; Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted
successors and assigns. No party to this Agreement may assign or delegate, by
operation of law or otherwise, all or any portion of its rights, obligations
or liabilities under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
other parties to this Agreement, which any such party may withhold in its
absolute discretion. Any purported assignment without such prior written
consents shall be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may without the
consent of the other parties assign in security or grant a charge over its
rights under this Agreement to any provider of finance to Buyer (or to any
facility or security agent or security trustee, receiver or person fulfilling
a similar or related role) provided that (a) the liability of the other
parties shall be no greater than it would have been had no such assignment
taken place and (b) unless and until the other parties are notified of any
enforcement of such security, they shall be entitled to continue to deal with
Buyer in relation to all matters arising from this Agreement.

11.10 No Third Party Beneficiary. Nothing in this Agreement shall confer any
rights, remedies or claims upon any Person or entity not a party or a
permitted assignee of a party to this Agreement, except for the Persons set
forth in Section 7.11, who are intended third party beneficiaries of such
provisions.

11.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts
with the same effect as if the signatures to each counterpart were upon a
single instrument, and all such counterparts together shall be deemed an
original of this Agreement.

11.12 Governing Law and Jurisdiction. This Agreement and any claim or
controversy hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the Laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to the principles of
conflict of laws thereof.

11.13 Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process. Any Action arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may
only be instituted in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware, and any
state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the
Chancery Court of the state of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware),
and each party waives any objection which such party may now or hereafter have
to the laying of the venue of any such Action and irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any such court in any such Action.

11.14 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY ACTION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR 

RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED (WHETHER BASED ON
CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

11.15 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
shall occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed by them in accordance with the terms hereof or were otherwise
breached and that each party hereto shall be entitled to seek an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions hereof and to specific
performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or
equity.

11.16 Severability. It is the desire and intent of the parties that the
provisions of this Agreement be enforced to the fullest extent permissible
under the Laws and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which
enforcement is sought. Accordingly, if any term, provision, agreement,
covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, prohibited, void or unenforceable, for any reason,
the remainder of the terms, provisions, agreements, covenants and restrictions
of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such a determination, the parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a reasonably
acceptable manner so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

11.17 Legal Representation.

(a) The Buyer, on behalf of itself and the Buyer Affiliates (including, after
the Closing, the Target Entities and the Company Subsidiaries), acknowledges
and agrees that Reed Smith LLP ("Reed Smith") has acted as counsel for the
Sellers, the Target Entities and the Company Subsidiaries in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Acquisition
Engagement"), and in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, Reed Smith has not acted as counsel for any other Person,
including the Buyer.

(b) Only the Sellers, the Target Entities and their respective Affiliates
shall be considered clients of Reed Smith in the Acquisition Engagement. The
Buyer, on behalf of itself and the Buyer Affiliates (including after the
Closing, the Target Entities and the Company Subsidiaries), acknowledges and
agrees that all confidential communications between the Sellers, the Target
Entities and their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and Reed Smith, on
the other hand, that relate exclusively to the negotiation, documentation and
consummation of the Acquisition Engagement or any dispute arising under
thereunder ("Privileged Communications") shall be deemed attorney-client
privileged, and shall be deemed to belong solely to the Sellers and their
respective Affiliates (other than the Target Entities and the Company
Subsidiaries), and not the 

Target Entities or the Company Subsidiaries, and shall not pass to or be
claimed, held, or used by the Buyer or any of the Buyer Affiliates upon or
after the Closing. Accordingly, the Buyer and the Buyer Affiliates shall not
have access to any such Privileged Communications, or to the files of Reed
Smith relating to the Acquisition Engagement, whether or not the Closing
occurs. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and after the
Closing, (i) to the extent that Privileged Communications in respect of the
Acquisition Engagement constitute property of the client, except as otherwise
provided herein, only the Sellers and their respective Affiliates shall hold
such property rights and (ii) Reed Smith shall have no duty whatsoever to
reveal or disclose any such Privileged Communications to the Buyer or any of
the Buyer Affiliates by reason of any attorney-client relationship between
Reed Smith and the Target Entities, the Company Subsidiaries or otherwise;
provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, Reed Smith shall not
disclose any Privileged Communications to any third parties (other than
Representatives, accountants and advisors of the Sellers and their respective
Affiliates; provided that such Representatives, accountants and advisors are
instructed to maintain the confidence of such Privileged Communications). The
Buyer, on behalf of itself and the Buyer Affiliates (including after the
Closing, the Target Entities and the Company Subsidiaries), irrevocably waives
any right it may have to discover or obtain any such Privileged
Communications. If and to the extent that, at any time subsequent to Closing,
the Buyer or any of the Buyer Affiliates (including after the Closing, the
Target Entities and the Company Subsidiaries) shall have the right to assert
or waive any attorney-client privilege with respect to any such Privileged
Communications between the Target Entities or its Affiliates and any Person
representing them that occurred at any time prior to the Closing, the Buyer,
on behalf of itself and the Buyer Affiliates (including after the Closing, the
Target Entities and the Company Subsidiaries), shall be entitled to waive such
privilege only with the prior written consent of the Sellers (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld).

(c) The Buyer, on behalf of itself and the Buyer Affiliates (including after
the Closing, the Target Entities and the Company Subsidiaries), acknowledges
and agrees that Reed Smith is acting as counsel for the Sellers, the Target
Entities and their respective Affiliates and that the Sellers reasonably
anticipate that Reed Smith will continue to represent the Sellers and/or their
respective Affiliates in future matters. Accordingly, the Buyer, on behalf of
itself and the Buyer Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Target
Entities and the Company Subsidiaries), expressly (i) consents to Reed Smith's
representation of the Sellers and/or their respective Affiliates in any
matter, including any post-Closing matter in which the interests of the Buyer
and the Target Entities, on the one hand, and the Sellers or their respective
Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse, including any matter relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any dispute or disagreement
relating thereto, and whether or not such matter is one in which Reed Smith
may have previously advised the Sellers, the Target Entities or their
respective Affiliates and (ii) consents to the disclosure by Reed Smith to the
Sellers or their respective Affiliates of any information learned by Reed
Smith in the course of its representation of the Sellers, the Target Entities
or their respective Affiliates, whether or not such information is subject to
attorney-client privilege, attorney work product protection, or Reed Smith's
duty of confidentiality.

(d) Upon and after the Closing, the Target Entities and the Company
Subsidiaries shall cease to have any attorney-client relationship with Reed
Smith, unless and to the extent Reed Smith is expressly engaged in writing by
the Target Entities and/or the Company Subsidiaries to 

represent the Target Entities or the Company Subsidiaries after the Closing
and either (i) such engagement involves no conflict of interest with respect
to the Sellers and/or any of their respective Affiliates or (ii) the Sellers
and/or any of their respective Affiliates, as applicable, consent in writing
to such engagement. Any such representation of the Target Entities by Reed
Smith after the Closing shall not affect the foregoing provisions hereof.

(e) The Target Entities and the Buyer consent to the arrangements in this
Section 11.17 and waive any actual or potential conflict of interest that may
be involved in connection with any representation by Reed Smith permitted
hereunder.

11.18 Limited Guarantee. The Seller Guarantor hereby absolutely,
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Buyer the payment and
performance of all of the payment or other obligations of the Sellers to the
Buyer in this Agreement (the "Obligations"), in each case, when and to the
extent that, any such obligations shall become due and payable; provided,
however, that the Seller Guarantor shall be subject to the limitations set
forth herein and shall succeed to all rights of the Sellers hereunder. The
Seller Guarantor agrees that the guaranty set forth in this Section 11.18 is a
present and continuing guaranty of payment and not of collectability, and that
the Buyer shall not be required to prosecute collection, enforcement or other
remedies against any Seller or any other Person, or to enforce or resort to
any other rights or remedies hereunder, before calling on the Seller Guarantor
for payment or performance. The Seller Guarantor agrees that if, for any
reason, any Seller shall fail or be unable to pay or perform, punctually and
fully, any of the Obligations, the Seller Guarantor shall pay or perform such
Obligations to the Buyer in full immediately upon demand. The Seller Guarantor
agrees that the obligations of the Seller Guarantor pursuant to this Section
11.18 shall be primary obligations, shall not be subject to any counterclaim,
set-off, abatement, deferment or defense based upon any claim that the Seller
Guarantor may have against the Buyer or any other Person, and shall remain in
full force and effect without regard to, and shall not be released, discharged
or affected in any way by any circumstance or condition (whether or not the
Seller Guarantor shall have any knowledge thereof).
