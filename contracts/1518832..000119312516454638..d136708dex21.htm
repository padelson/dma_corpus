ARTICLE 2

PURCHASE AND SALE

Section 2.1 _Purchase and Sale_. At the Closing, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement, Seller agrees to sell, transfer, assign,
convey and deliver to Purchaser the Membership Interests, free and clear of
any Encumbrances, and Purchaser agrees to purchase, acquire and accept the
Membership Interests.

 

Section 2.2 _Procedures_.

 

(a) For purposes of allocating production (and accounts receivable with
respect thereto) under _Section 3.2_, (i) liquid Hydrocarbons shall be
deemed to be "from or attributable to" the Leases and Wells when they pass
through the inlet flange of the pipeline connecting into the storage
facilities into which they are run or, if there are no such
storage facilities, when they pass through the lease automatic custody
transfer meters or similar meters at the point of entry into the pipelines
through which they are transported from the field and (ii) gaseous
Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or attributable to" the Leases and
Wells when they pass through the delivery point sales meters on the pipelines
through which they are transported. Seller shall cause the Company to utilize
reasonable interpolative procedures consistent with industry practice to
arrive at an allocation of production when exact meter readings or gauging and
strapping data is not available. Seller shall provide to Purchaser evidence of
all meter readings and all gauging and strapping procedures conducted on or
about the Effective Time in connection with the Assets, together with all data
necessary to support any estimated allocation, for purposes of establishing
the adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to  _Section 3.2_.
The terms "earned" and "incurred" shall be interpreted in accordance with GAAP
and Council of Petroleum Accountants Society (" _COPAS_ ") standards, and
expenditures that are incurred pursuant to an operating agreement, unit
agreement or similar agreement shall be deemed incurred when expended by the
operator of the applicable Lease or Well in accordance with the Companys
current practice.

 

(b) After Closing, Seller shall handle all joint interest audits and other
audits of Property Costs covering only the period prior to the Effective Time
and Purchaser shall cause the Company to handle all joint interest audits and
other audits of Property Costs covering any other period; _provided_ , that
Purchaser shall not agree to any adjustments to previously assessed
costs that would result in an adjustment under _Section 3.2_, or any
compromise of any audit claims to which Seller would be entitled, without the
prior written consent of Seller (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed). Upon any final determination by Seller that an adjustment to
accounting or payments for the period prior to the Effective Time should be
made as a result of the preceding sentence, Seller shall provide to the
Company related accounting data 

 



-2-  (including information regarding any adjustments to suspense accounts) and
any funds required for the Company to make any such payments. Following the
Companys receipt of such data and funds, Purchaser shall cause the Company
to promptly make adjustments and updates to its suspense accounts or other
related accounting data and to promptly remit or pay such funds to the
applicable Third Parties in accordance with such data. Purchaser shall
provide Seller with written notice within 10 Business Days of becoming aware
of any joint interest audit or other audit of Property Costs for any periods
prior to the Effective Time or that may result in an adjustment under 
_Section 3.2_, and Purchaser shall provide Seller with a copy of all
applicable audit reports and written audit agreements received by Purchaser or
its Affiliates that relate to an adjustment under _Section 3.2_.

 

(c) For purposes of _Section 3.2_, right-of-way fees, insurance premiums and
other costs that are included in Property Costs (other than Taxes which are
to be allocated pursuant to _Section 13.1_ and _Section 13.2_) that are paid
periodically shall be prorated based on the number of days in the applicable
period falling before and the number of days in the applicable period falling
at or after the Effective Time.

(d) If, after Closing and prior to the final determination of the Post-
Closing Statement pursuant to _Section 10.4(b)_, Purchaser or the Company
receives any proceeds or other income, receipts or credits with respect to the
Assets attributable to the period prior to the Effective Time that would
result in an adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to _Section
3.2(a)(ii)_ if such amounts were not remitted or paid to Seller, Purchaser
shall (or shall cause the Company to) fully disclose, account for and remit
such proceeds or other income, receipts or credits to Seller. If, after
Closing, Seller or any of its Affiliates receives any proceeds or other
income, receipts or credits with respect to the Assets attributable to the
period at and after the Effective Time that would result in an adjustment to
the Unadjusted Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 3.2(b)(ii)_ if such
amounts were not remitted or paid to Purchaser, Seller shall fully disclose,
account for and remit such proceeds or other income, receipts or credits to
Purchaser. If, after Closing, Purchaser or the Company receives proceeds from
the sale of natural gas produced from and attributable to Companys interest
in the Leases and Wells for the period at and after the Effective Time to
the Closing in excess of the product of (A) the volume of such natural gas
sales _multiplied_ by (B) the Platts Inside FERC CIG Monthly Index _plus_
$0.03 per MMBtu for the applicable month during which such natural gas
volumes were sold, then Purchaser shall fully disclose, account for and remit
such excess amount to Seller.

ARTICLE 3

Section 3.1 _Purchase Price_.

 

(a) The purchase price for the Membership Interests shall be equal to Nine
Hundred Ten Million dollars ($910,000,000) (the " _Unadjusted Purchase Price_

3.2_ (as adjusted, the " _Adjusted Purchase Price_ ").

 

(b) Within one (1) Business Day after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Purchaser shall deliver to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association

equal to ten percent (10%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price (the " _Deposit_

applied against, and is not in addition to, the Adjusted Purchase Price if
the Closing occurs or shall be otherwise distributed in accordance with the
terms of _Section 11.3_.

 

Section 3.2 _Adjustments to Purchase Price_. All adjustments to the Unadjusted
Purchase Price shall be made (x) in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and, to the extent consistent with this Agreement, in accordance
with GAAP as consistently applied in the oil and gas industry, (y) without
duplication (in this Agreement or otherwise) and (z) only with respect to
matters (A) in the case of _Section 3.2(b)(iv)(A)_, for which notice is given
on or before the Claim Date, and (B) except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, in all of the other cases set forth in _Section 3.2_, identified
on or before the final determination of the Post-Closing Statement pursuant to
_Section 10.4(b)_. Each adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price described
in _Section 3.2(a)_ and _Section 3.2(b)_ shall be allocated among the
Assets in accordance with _Section 3.3_.

Without limiting the foregoing, the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be
adjusted as follows (without duplication):

(a) The Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward by the following
amounts (without duplication):

(i) an amount equal to all Property Costs attributable to periods after the
Effective Time but paid by Seller or paid by the Company prior to the
Closing;

(ii) an amount equal to, to the extent that such amounts have been received
by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, or the Company after the Closing, and
not remitted or paid to Seller, (A) all proceeds from the production of
Hydrocarbons from or attributable to the Leases and Wells for the period prior
to the Effective Time, and (B) all other income, proceeds, receipts and
credits attributable to the ownership or operation of the Assets for the
period prior to the Effective Time (including proceeds from cash calls and
billings and other funds received for the account of such third Persons with
respect to any of the Assets operated by the Company, but only to the extent
that such proceeds and other funds are for amounts that were expended by
Seller or the Company prior to the Closing for the account of such third
Persons with respect to costs or expenses attributable to the ownership or
operation of the Assets for the period prior to the Effective Time);

 

(iii) the amount of all prepaid expenses (including insurance, cash calls and
advances to third Person operators for expenses not yet incurred, prepaid
production Taxes, severance Taxes and other Taxes (excluding Income Taxes) and
scheduled payments) paid by Seller or the Company prior to the Closing
attributable to the ownership or operation of the Assets for the period after
the Effective Time (but excluding any lease bonus, delay rentals and similar
leasehold rental payments, lease option payments, lease extension payments,
and other lease renewal and acquisition expenses or any cost excluded from
Property Costs under Clause (g) of the definition thereof);

 



-4- (iv) to the extent that such amounts have been received by the Company after
the Closing and not remitted or paid to Seller, an amount equal to the
aggregated volumes of merchantable Hydrocarbons stored in stock tanks or other
storage as of the Effective Time that are attributable to the ownership or
operation of the Assets,  _multiplied_ by the contract price therefor on the
date of sale thereof or, in the absence of an applicable contract price,
_multiplied_ by the applicable price received by the Company therefor;

 

(v) to the extent that there are any pipeline imbalances attributable to the
ownership or operation of the Assets at the Effective Time, if the net of
such imbalances is an overdelivery imbalance (that is, at the Effective Time,
the Company has delivered more Hydrocarbons to the pipeline than the pipeline
has purchased or redelivered for the Company), the Companys applicable
average price per unit for sales of production during the month in which the
Effective Time occurs, _multiplied_ by such net overdelivery imbalance in the
appropriate units of measure consistent with such applicable average sales
price;

(vi) to the extent that such amounts have been received by the Company after
the Closing and not remitted or paid to Seller, the amount of ad valorem,
property, severance, production, sales, use and similar Taxes imposed on the
ownership of the Assets or the production of Hydrocarbons produced from such
Assets for all Tax periods or portions thereof ending on or before the
Closing Date that Seller or its Affiliates have paid or pay on behalf of other
working interest owners, royalty interest owners, overriding royalty interest
owners and other interests owners in such Assets and that have not been
recouped by Seller before the Closing Date from such other working interest
owners, royalty interest owners, overriding royalty interest owners and other
interest owners in such Assets; and

 

(vii) any other amount provided for elsewhere in this Agreement or otherwise
agreed upon in writing by the Parties as an upward adjustment to the
Unadjusted Purchase Price.

(b) The Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by the following
amounts (without duplication):

(i) an amount equal to all Property Costs attributable to the period prior to
the Effective Time but paid by Purchaser or the Company after the Closing;

(ii) an amount equal to, to the extent that such amounts have been received
by Seller or any of its Affiliates, or the Company prior to the Closing, and
not remitted or paid to Purchaser, (A) all proceeds from the production of
Hydrocarbons (other than natural gas) from or attributable to the Leases
and Wells for the period at and after the Effective Time, and (B) all other
income, proceeds, receipts and credits attributable to the ownership or
operation of the Assets for the period at or after the 

 



-5-  Effective Time (including all proceeds of cash calls and billings and other
funds received for the account of third Persons with respect to any of the
Assets operated by the Company, except to the extent such proceeds and other
funds are for amounts that were expended by Seller or the Company prior to the
Closing for the account of such third Persons with respect to costs or
expenses attributable to the ownership or operation of the Assets for the
period prior to the Effective Time); _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller may
retain, and the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall not be adjusted downward for,
the COPAS fees received by the Company from Third Parties under the EandP
Contracts that are attributable to the operation of the Properties between the
Effective Time and the Closing.

 

(iii) an amount equal to, to the extent such proceeds have been received by
Seller or any of its Affiliates, or received by the Company prior to the
Closing, the product of (A) the volume of natural gas sales from and
attributable to the Companys interest in the Leases and Wells for the period
at and after the Effective Time _multiplied_ by (B) the Platts Inside FERC
CIG Monthly Index _plus_ $0.03 per MMBtu for the applicable month during which
such natural gas volumes were sold;

 

(iv) as provided in (A) _Section 4.2_, or (B) _Section 4.6_ or _Section
4.7_;

 

(v) to the extent that there are any pipeline imbalances attributable to the
ownership or operation of the Assets at the Effective Time, if the net of
such imbalances is an underdelivery imbalance (that is, at the Effective Time,
the Company has delivered less Hydrocarbons to the pipeline than the pipeline
has purchased or redelivered for the Company), the Companys applicable
average price per unit for sales of production during the month in which the
Effective Time occurs, _multiplied_ by such net underdelivery imbalance in the
appropriate units of measure consistent with such applicable average sales
price;

(vi) revenue held in suspense by Seller or the Company for royalties,
overriding royalties and other leasehold interests set forth on _Schedule
6.18_ and handled in accordance with _Section 8.13_;

(vii) any other amount provided for elsewhere in this Agreement or otherwise
agreed upon in writing by the Parties as a downward adjustment to the
Unadjusted Purchase Price; and

 

(viii) (A) any Liability of the Company as of the Closing in connection with
any asset or interest (other than any Asset) or to the extent that such
Liability is not with respect to the ownership or operation of any Asset;
_provided_ , that such Liability (1) is required to be reflected on a balance
sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP as of the Closing or (2) has accrued,
matured or become due, and been agreed to in writing by the Company, as of the
Closing, and (B) any indebtedness of the Company for borrowed money as of the
Closing (and any related fees then accrued thereon).

 

(c) _Well Imbalance Adjustments_. Seller and Purchaser agree that the
Unadjusted Purchase Price will be adjusted downward or upward,
as appropriate, by an amount

 



-6-  equal to the Well imbalances existing as of the Effective Time, _multiplied_
by Two Dollars and Fifty Cents ($2.50) per Mcf; _provided, however,_ that such
amount shall be reduced if Seller or the Company is obligated or required to
cash out any imbalances to Third Parties in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

Section 3.3 _Allocated Values_. Solely for the purposes of _Article 4_ ,
Purchaser and Seller have agreed to the allocation of the Unadjusted Purchase
Price among the Wells and Leases (the " _Allocated Values_ "), and such
allocation of value is set forth on _Schedule 3.3_. The Allocated Value for an
Asset is equal to the portion of the Unadjusted Purchase Price that is
allocated to such Asset on _Schedule 3.3_ , increased or decreased by a share
of each adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price in accordance with
_Section 3.2_. Except with respect to _Section 3.2(a)(v)_ and  _Section
3.2(b)(v)_, the share of each adjustment allocated to a particular Asset shall
be allocated to the particular Asset to which such adjustment relates to the
extent such adjustment relates to such Asset. Adjustments made pursuant to 
_Section 3.2(a)(v)_ and _Section 3.2(b)(v)_ and any adjustment not allocated
to a specific Asset pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall be
allocated among the various Assets on a pro-rata basis in proportion to
the Unadjusted Purchase Price allocated to such Asset on _Schedule 3.3_. Each
Party has accepted such Allocated Values for purposes of _Article 4_ , but
makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy of such values.

 

Section 3.4 _Purchase Price Allocation_. Each Party agrees that the Unadjusted
Purchase Price shall be allocated among the Assets in accordance with the
principles of Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder
and such allocations shall be appropriately adjusted, consistent with Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1060-1(e)(1), to reflect the Purchase Price following
adjustments under _Section 10.4_. Purchaser shall provide Seller with a
proposed allocation of the Purchase Price consistent with the immediately
preceding sentence within 30 days after the final determination of the Post-
Closing Statement pursuant to _Section 10.4(b)_. If Seller disagrees with
such proposed allocation, Seller shall, within 20 days after Sellers receipt
of such proposed allocation, notify Purchaser in writing of
such disagreements (the " _Allocation Objection Notice_ "). If the Allocation
Objection Notice is not delivered by Seller to Purchaser within such 20-day
period, such proposed allocation by Purchaser shall be final and binding on
the Parties. If the Allocation Objection Notice is timely delivered to
Purchaser by Seller, the Parties will work in good faith to agree on such
proposed allocation. The final allocation of the Purchase Price determined in
accordance with this  _Section 3.4_ shall be the " _Allocation Schedule_ ".
Each Party shall prepare and file, and cause its Affiliates to prepare and
file, its Tax Returns on a basis consistent with the Allocation Schedule and
take no position, and cause its Affiliates to take no position, inconsistent
with the Allocation Schedule on any applicable Tax Return, in any audit or
proceeding regarding any Taxes or in any report to a Governmental Body for
Taxes; _provided_ , _however_ , that it is not inconsistent with the
Allocation Schedule for (a) Purchasers cost for the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement to differ from the total amount allocated pursuant to this
_Section 3.4_ to reflect capitalized transaction costs not included in the
total amount allocated pursuant to this _Section 3.4_ and (b) the amount
realized by Seller to differ from the total amount allocated pursuant to this
_Section 3.4_ to reflect transaction costs that reduce the amount realized
for United States Federal income tax purposes.

the Claim Date is Defensible Title.

(b) Except as provided in _Schedule 4.1(b)_ , Seller represents and
warrants to Purchaser that the Properties have been operated in compliance

respective Affiliates, but not otherwise, subject, however to the Permitted
Encumbrances (the " _Special Warranty_ ").

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the contrary but except as
otherwise provided in _Section 4.1(f)_, if a Defect under this _Article 4_
results from any matter that could also result in the breach of any
representation or warranty of Seller set forth in _Article 5_ or _Article 6_ ,
then Purchaser shall only be entitled to assert such matter before the Claim
Date as a Defect, to the extent permitted by this _Article 4_ , and shall be
precluded from also asserting such matter as the basis of the breach of any
such representation or warranty.

 

(e) EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN _SECTION 4.1(F)_ , PURCHASER HEREBY WAIVES
AND RELEASES ANY REMEDIES OR CLAIMS (WHETHER AT LAW OR IN EQUITY) THAT IT MAY

-8- Section 4.2 _Defects_.

 

(a) To assert a claim arising out of a breach of _Section 4.1(a)_ or _Section
4.1(b)_, Purchaser must deliver a claim notice to Seller (either a " _Title
Defect Notice_ " or an " _Environmental Defect Notice_ "), as applicable, on
or before March 24, 2016 (such date, the " _Claim Date_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Claim Date shall be May 9, 2016 for any claim regarding
the Gathering Rights-of-Way set forth in a Title Defect Notice. To give Seller
an opportunity to commence reviewing and curing or remedying any Defects,
Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts to give Seller, on or before the end
of each calendar week prior to the Claim Date, written notice of all potential
Defects discovered by Purchaser during the preceding calendar week, which
notice may be preliminary in nature and supplemented by a Title Defect Notice
or Environmental Defect Notice, as applicable, on or prior to the Claim Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such notice shall not waive or
diminish Purchasers rights hereunder.

 

(b) A Title Defect Notice shall be in writing and shall include (i) a specific
description of the claimed Title Defect(s) that is reasonably sufficient for
Seller to determine the basis of the claimed Title Defect, (ii) the Leases,
Wells and Gathering Rights-of-Way affected by the Title Defect (each a "
_Title Defect Property_ "), (iii) the Allocated Values of each claimed Title
Defect Property, if any, (iv) the documents in the possession of Purchaser
upon which Purchaser relies for its assertion of a Title Defect, including, at
a minimum, supporting documents reasonably necessary for Seller (as well as
any title attorney or examiner hired by Seller) to verify the existence of the
claimed Title Defect and (v) the dollar amount by which Purchaser reasonably
believes the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property is reduced by the
claimed Title Defect, if applicable, and the computations and information upon
which Purchasers belief is based. Except to the extent provided in _Section
4.1(c)_ and _Article 12_ for a breach of the Special Warranty and as
otherwise provided in _Section 4.1(f)_, Purchaser shall be deemed to have
waived Title Defects for which Seller has not been given a Title Defect Notice
on or before the Claim Date.

 

(c) An Environmental Defect Notice shall be in writing and shall (i) identify
the affected Asset to the extent reasonably ascertainable by Purchaser (each
an " _Environmental Defect Property_ "), (ii) reasonably describe the
condition in, on, under or relating to the Asset that causes the Environmental
Defect to the extent known to Purchaser and (iii) set forth the estimated
cost to Remediate the Environmental Defect. Except to the extent otherwise
provided in _Section 4.1(f)_, Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived
Environmental Defects for which Seller has not been given an Environmental
Defect Notice on or before the Claim Date.

(d) In the event Seller receives a Title Defect Notice from Purchaser on
or prior to the Claim Date, the following shall apply:

(i) Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its
sole cost, to cure or remove or take any action to cure or remove ( _provided_
, that such action does not decrease the Companys Net Revenue Interest or
increase the Companys

 



-9-  Working Interest without a proportionate increase in the Companys Net
Revenue Interest in any Property or adversely affect the ownership or
operation of any Asset) at Sellers sole cost on or before sixty (60) days
after the Closing Date (the " _Cure Period_ ") any such Title Defects for
which Seller has provided notice to Purchaser at least three (3) days prior to
the Closing Date that Seller intends to attempt to cure such Title Defect
during the Cure Period (a " _Remedy Notice_ ") or of which Seller disputes the
existence or the Title Defect Amount therefor by delivery of written notice
thereof to Purchaser (a " _Disputed Title Defect_ ") at least three (3) days
prior to the Closing Date.

(ii) If any Title Defect is not cured prior to the Closing and no Remedy
Notice or notice of Disputed Title Defect is timely delivered to Purchaser for
such Title Defect, the Title Defect Property shall remain an Asset, and a
downward adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be made at the
Closing by the Title Defect Amount set forth in the Title Defect Notice for
such Title Defect and calculated pursuant to _Section 4.2(g)_.

 

(iii) If any Title Defect is not cured by Seller prior to the Closing and a
Remedy Notice or notice of Disputed Title Defect is timely delivered to
Purchaser for such Title Defect, the Title Defect Property shall remain an
Asset, the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced by (x) Purchasers good
faith estimate of the Title Defect Amount for such Title Defect if a Remedy
Notice is timely delivered to Purchaser for such Title Defect or (y) Sellers
good faith estimate of the Title Defect Amount for such Title Defect if a
notice of Disputed Title Defect is timely delivered to Purchaser for
such Title Defect, such estimate of the Title Defect Amount shall be paid by
Purchaser at Closing to the Escrow Agent, and any such amount (and any
interest earned thereon) shall be paid to Seller or Purchaser, as applicable,
as agreed by Seller and Purchaser or determined in accordance with _Section
4.2(d)(iv)_ or _(v)_.

(iv) If any Title Defect under  _Section 4.2(d)(iii)(x)_ is not cured by
Seller within the Cure Period, then the Title Defect Property shall remain an
Asset, and a downward adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be
made pursuant to _Section 4.2(f)_;  _provided_ , that if, prior to the
expiration of the Cure Period, Seller and Purchaser cannot agree on (i) the
proper and adequate cure for any such Title Defect, (ii) the Title Defect
Amount or (iii) whether the alleged Title Defect constitutes a Title Defect
for which a Title Dispute Notice was timely delivered, such dispute(s) shall
be finally and exclusively resolved in accordance with the provisions of
_Section 4.5_. An election by Seller to attempt to cure a Title Defect shall
be without prejudice to its rights under _Section 4.5_ and shall not
constitute an admission against interest or a waiver of Sellers right to
dispute the existence, nature or value of, or cost to cure, the alleged Title
Defect.

(v) Any Disputed Title Defects that have not been cured, waived or otherwise
resolved by the Parties prior to the Closing shall be exclusively and finally
resolved in accordance with the provisions of _Section 4.5_.

 

(vi) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article 4_ , if there
is a Title Defect regarding a Gathering Right-of-Way, the Unadjusted Purchase
Price

 



-10-  shall not be adjusted therefor, such Gathering Right-of-Way shall remain an
Asset and Seller shall promptly cure such Title Defect (but, in any case,
within the Cure Period); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if the Expert
determines there is no such Title Defect, Seller shall not be required to cure
such Title Defect. If the Parties are unable to agree upon any such Title
Defect prior to the expiration of the Cure Period, such Title Defect shall be
resolved pursuant to _Section 4.5_ as a Title Defect described in _Section
4.5(a)(ii)_. For the avoidance of doubt, _Sections 4.2(d)(i)-(v)_ , _4.2(f)_
and _(g)_ shall not apply to this  _Section 4.2(d)(vi)_.

(e) In the event Seller receives an Environmental Defect Notice from Purchaser
on or prior to the Claim Date, the following shall apply:

(i) Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its
sole cost, to Remediate, at any time prior to Closing, any Environmental
Defect.

(ii) If any Environmental Defect is not Remediated prior to the Closing and
Seller has not delivered to Purchaser written notice that Seller disputes the
existence of such Environmental Defect or the Environmental Defect Amount for
such Environmental Defect (a " _Disputed Environmental Defect_ ") at least
three (3) days prior to the Closing Date, the Environmental Defect Property
shall remain an Asset and a downward adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase
Price shall be made at the Closing by the Environmental Defect Amount set
forth in the Environmental Defect Notice for such Environmental Defect and
calculated pursuant to _Section 4.2(g)_.

 

(iii) If any Environmental Defect is not Remediated by Seller prior to the
Closing and a notice of Disputed Environmental Defect is timely delivered to
Purchaser for such Environmental Defect, the Environmental Defect Property
shall remain an Asset, the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced by
Sellers good faith estimate of the Environmental Defect Amount, such
estimate of the Environmental Defect Amount shall be paid by Purchaser to the
Escrow Agent at Closing, and such amount (and any interest earned thereon)
shall be paid to Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, as agreed by Seller and
Purchaser or determined in accordance with _Section 4.5_.

(f) With respect to each Defect Property affected by Defects claimed under 
_Section 4.2(a)_, _Section 4.2(b)_ or _Section 4.2(c)_, as applicable, and
not cured with respect to Title Defects or Remediated with respect to
Environmental Defects during the period permitted under  _Section 4.2(d)_ or
_Section 4.2(e)_, the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall, subject to the
Individual Title Defect Threshold and Individual Environmental Defect
Threshold, as applicable, and the Aggregate Title Defect Deductible and
Aggregate Environmental Defect Deductible, as applicable, be reduced by an
amount determined pursuant to _Section 4.2(g)_, as applicable, as being the
value of such Defect (the " _Title Defect Amount_ " or " _Environmental
Defect Amount_ "). Any downward adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price
pursuant to this _Section 4.2_ shall be made (and accounted for) at the times
set forth in _Section 4.2(d)_,  _Section 4.2(e)_, or _Section 10.4_, as
applicable.

 



-11- (g) The Defect Amount resulting from a Defect shall be determined as follows:

 

(i) if Purchaser and Seller agree on the Defect Amount, that amount shall be
the Defect Amount;

 

(ii) if a Title Defect is a lien, encumbrance or other charge that is
undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be
the amount necessary to be paid to remove the Title Defect from the Companys
interest in the affected Title Defect Property;

 

(iii) if a Title Defect represents solely a discrepancy between (A) the actual
Net Revenue Interest for the affected Title Defect Property and (B) the Net
Revenue Interest stated on _Exhibit A-1_ or _Exhibit A-2_ for such Title
Defect Property, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the product of the
Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property  _multiplied_ by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest decrease and the
denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest stated on _Exhibit A-1_ or
_Exhibit A-2_ , as applicable; _provided_ , that if the Title Defect is not
effective for the entire term of a Lease or does not affect a Well throughout
its entire productive life, the Title Defect Amount determined under this
_Section 4.2(g)(iii)_ shall be reduced accordingly;

 

(iv) if a Title Defect results in the Company owning less than the Company Net
Acreage set forth on _Exhibit A-1_ for any Lease, the Title Defect Amount
shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Lease, _multiplied_ by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the Company Net Acreage affected by such
Title Defect and the denominator of which is the Company Net Acreage for the
applicable depths, interval or formation set forth on _Exhibit A-1_ (but
clause (iii) shall apply to the extent that such Title Defect affects the Net
Revenue Interest for such Lease);

 

(v) if a Title Defect represents an encumbrance or burden upon or other defect
in title to the Title Defect Property of a type not described in subsections
(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above, the Title Defect Amount shall be determined by
taking into account the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property, the
portion of the Title Defect Property adversely affected by the Title Defect,
the legal effect of the Title Defect, the potential economic effect of the
Title Defect over the life of the Title Defect Property, the values placed
upon the Title Defect by Purchaser and Seller and such other factors as
are necessary to make a proper evaluation;

(vi) if the Defect is an Environmental Defect, the Environmental Defect
Amount shall be the amount of the estimated costs and expenses to Remediate
such Environmental Defect (as of the Closing Date);

 

(vii) the Defect Amount with respect to a Defect shall be determined without
duplication of any costs or losses included in any other Defect Amount
hereunder, or to the extent that Purchaser otherwise receives credit in the
calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price (other than under _Section
3.2(b)(iv)_); and

 



-12- (viii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article 4_
but subject to _Section 4.2(d)(vi)_, the aggregate Title Defect Amounts
attributable to the effect of all Title Defects for any Title Defect Property
shall not exceed the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property.

 

Section 4.3 _Title Benefits_.

 

(a) Should Purchaser discover any Title Benefit on or before the Claim Date,
Purchaser shall as soon as practicable, but in any case by the Claim Date,
deliver to Seller a notice including (i) a description of the Title Benefit
reasonably sufficient to determine the basis of the alleged Title Benefit,
(ii) the Wells or Leases affected by the Title Benefit (each a " _Title
Benefit Property_ "), (iii) the Allocated Values of each alleged Title Benefit
Property and (iv) the dollar amount by which Purchaser reasonably believes the
Allocated Value of each Title Benefit Property is increased by the Title
Benefit and the computations and information upon which Purchasers belief is
based (a " _Title Benefit Notice_ "). Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to deliver to Purchaser a similar Title Benefit Notice on or
before the Claim Date with respect to each Title Benefit discovered by Seller.
Seller shall be deemed to have waived all Title Benefits of which neither
Party has given a Title Benefit Notice on or before the Claim Date, except to
the extent Purchaser has failed to give a Title Benefit Notice which it was
obligated to give under this _Section 4.3(a)_.

(b) Any Title Benefit may only be used to offset Title Defect Amounts in
accordance with _Section 4.4_.

(c) The value resulting from a Title Benefit (" _Title Benefit Amount_ ")
shall be determined as follows:

(i) if Purchaser and Seller agree on the Title Benefit Amount, that amount
shall be the Title Benefit Amount;

(ii) if the Title Benefit reflects a difference (without any change in the
Working Interest for the affected Title Defect Property) between (A) the Net
Revenue Interest for the affected Title Benefit Property and (B) the Net
Revenue Interest stated in _Exhibit A-1_ or  _Exhibit A-2_ , as applicable,
then the Title Benefit Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of
such Title Benefit Property, _multiplied_ by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the amount of the Net Revenue Interest increase and the denominator
of which is the Net Revenue Interest stated in _Exhibit A-1_ or _Exhibit A-2_
, as applicable; _provided_ , that, if a Title Benefit is not effective for
the entire term of a Lease or does not affect a Well throughout its entire
productive life, the Title Benefit Amount determined under this _Section
4.3(c)(ii)_ shall be reduced accordingly; and

 

(iii) if the Title Benefit represents a benefit in the ownership or title to
the Title Benefit Property of a type not described in clauses (i) or (ii)
above, the Title Benefit Amount shall be determined by taking into account the
Allocated Value of the Title Benefit Property, the portion of the Title
Benefit Property benefitted by the Title Benefit, the legal effect of the
Title Benefit, the potential economic effect of the Title Benefit over the
life of the Title Benefit Property, the values placed upon the Title Benefit
by Purchaser and Seller and such other factors as are necessary to make
a proper evaluation.

 



-13- Section 4.4 _Limitations on Applicability_.

 

(a) Except to the extent provided in _Article 12_ for a breach of the Special
Warranty and as otherwise provided in  _Section 4.1(f)_, this _Article 4_
shall be the exclusive right and remedy of Purchaser with respect to Defects.
The right of Purchaser or Seller to assert a Defect or Title Benefit,
respectively, under this _Article 4_ shall terminate on the Claim Date;
_provided, however_ , that until the claimed Defect or Title Benefit or Title
Defect Amount, Title Benefit Amount or Environmental Defect Amount, as
applicable, is resolved in accordance with this Agreement, there shall be no
termination of Purchasers or Sellers rights under this _Article 4_ with
respect to any claimed Defect or Title Benefit or Title Defect Amount, Title
Benefit Amount or Environmental Defect Amount properly claimed on or before
the Claim Date.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement but subject to
this _Section 4.4(b)_, (i) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the
Unadjusted Purchase Price for individual Title Defects or individual Title
Benefits that do not exceed $50,000 (the " _Individual Title Defect Threshold_
"); (ii) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Unadjusted
Purchase Price for individual Environmental Defects that do not exceed
$100,000 (the " _Individual Environmental Defect Threshold_ "); (iii) in no
event shall there be any adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price for
Title Defects unless the amount of all such Title Defects (assuming that each
such Title Defect Amount therefor exceeds the Individual Title Defect
Threshold), in the aggregate (excluding any Title Defects cured by Seller),
exceeds 2.5% of the Unadjusted Purchase Price (the " _Aggregate Title Defect
Deductible_ "), after which point, subject to the Individual Title Defect
Threshold, Purchaser shall be entitled to adjustments to the Unadjusted
Purchase Price only with respect to Title Defects in excess of the Aggregate
Title Defect Deductible; _provided_ , _however_ , that if all Title Benefits
that each exceeds the Individual Title Defect Threshold collectively exceed
2.5% of the Unadjusted Purchase Price, any adjustment to the Unadjusted
Purchase Price under this _Section 4.4(b)(iii)_ shall be reduced by those
Title Benefits (that each exceeds the Individual Title Defect Threshold) in
excess of 2.5% of the Unadjusted Purchase Price; and (iv) in no event shall
there be any adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price for Environmental
Defects unless the amount of all such Environmental Defects (assuming that
each such Environmental Defect Amount therefor exceeds the Individual
Environmental Defect Threshold), in the aggregate (excluding any Environmental
Defects Remediated by Seller), exceeds 2.5% of the Unadjusted Purchase Price
(the " _Aggregate Environmental Defect Deductible_ "), after which point,
subject to the Individual Environmental Defect Threshold, Purchaser shall be
entitled to adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price only with respect to
Environmental Defects in excess of the Aggregate Environmental Defect
Deductible. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 4.4(b)_ only applies to
_Section 3.2(b)(iv)(A)_.

 

(c) Without prejudice to any of the other dates by which performance or the
exercise of rights is due hereunder, or the Parties rights or obligations in
respect thereof, and except with respect to the obligations in the second
sentence of _Section 4.2(a)_, the Parties hereby acknowledge that, as set
forth more fully in _Section 14.13_, time is of the essence in performing
their obligations and exercising their rights under this _Article 4_ , and, as
such, that each and every date and time by which such performance or exercise
is due shall be the firm and final date and time.

 



-14- Section 4.5 _Disputed Defects_.

 

(a) Seller and Purchaser shall attempt to agree on all Defects, Title
Benefits, Title Defect Amounts, Title Benefit Amounts and
Environmental Defect Amounts by three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date. Subject to _Section 4.2(d)_ and _(e)_ , if the Parties are unable to
agree upon (i) any Title Defect for which Seller did not timely deliver a
Remedy Notice, Title Defect Amount therefor, Title Benefit, Title Benefit
Amount, Environmental Defect or Environmental Defect Amount prior to the
Closing or (ii) any Title Defect for which Seller timely delivered a Remedy
Notice or the Title Defect Amount therefor prior to the expiration of the
Cure Period (the " _Disputed Defect Matters_ "), such disagreement shall be
exclusively and finally resolved in accordance with the provisions of this
_Section 4.5_. Purchaser shall provide to Seller by not later than the tenth
(10th) Business Day following the Closing Date (in the case of clause (i)) or
the Cure Period (in the case of clause (ii)) a written description meeting the
requirements of  _Section 4.2(b)_, _Section 4.2(c)_ or _Section 4.3(a)_,
as applicable, together with all supporting documentation, of the Disputed
Defect Matters. By not later than ten (10) Business Days after
Sellers receipt of Purchasers written description of the Disputed Defect
Matters, Seller shall provide to Purchaser a written response setting forth
Sellers position with respect to the Disputed Defect Matters, together with
all supporting documentation.

(b) By not later than the earlier of (i) ten (10) Business Days after
Purchasers receipt of Sellers written response to Purchasers written
description of any Disputed Defect Matter or (ii) twenty (20) Business Days
after Sellers receipt of Purchasers written description of such Disputed
Defect Matter, if such Disputed Defect Matter has not otherwise been resolved
between the Parties, such Disputed Defect Matter shall be exclusively and
finally resolved pursuant to this _Section 4.5_ by expert determination.

 

(i) _Title Expert_. The determination of Disputed Defect Matters related to
Title Defects, Title Defect Amounts, Title Benefits and Title Benefit Amounts
shall be made by a single title expert (the " _Title Expert_ "). The Title
Expert shall be neutral, not an affiliate, employee or consultant of either
Party and shall be a title attorney with at least ten (10) years of title
experience who practices oil and gas law in Colorado.

(ii) _Environmental Expert_. The determination of Disputed Defect Matters
related to Environmental Defects and Environmental Defect Amounts shall be
made by a single environmental expert (the " _Environmental Expert_ "). The
Environmental Expert shall be neutral, not an affiliate, employee or
consultant of either Party and shall be an attorney with at least ten (10)
years of experience who practices environmental law as it relates to oil and
gas matters in Colorado.

 

(iii) _Selection of Expert by Agreement of the Parties_. The Parties shall
attempt to mutually agree on the Expert;  _provided_ , that if the Parties
are not able to mutually agree on the Expert within five (5) Business Days
after receipt of a Partys election to submit a matter to expert
determination, then, within five (5) Business Days after the end of such five
(5) Business Day period, each Party shall submit to the other

 



-15-  Party the name(s) of at least one, but not more than three, potential
Experts having the qualifications outlined in this _Section 4.5(b)_. If there
is one common name on the Parties lists, that Person shall be the Expert,
but if there is more than one common name on the Parties lists, the Expert
shall be selected from the common names on the Parties lists by the mutual
agreement of the Parties, or, in absence of such agreement, as provided in
_Section 4.5(b)(iv)_.

(iv) _Selection of Expert if Parties Do Not Agree_. In the event there are no
common names on the Parties lists provided under _Section 4.5(b)(iii)_ or an
Expert is not selected within ten (10) Business Days after receipt by a Party
of the other Partys election to submit a matter to expert determination,
either Party may require that each list of potential Experts submitted by
either Party to the other Party be submitted to The International Institute
for Conflict Prevention and Resolution (the " _CPR_ "), and the CPR shall
select the Expert from any such list. The Expert need not be on the CPRs
panel of neutrals.

 

(v) _Information_. Within ten (10) Business Days after the selection of the
Expert, the Parties shall provide to the Expert the applicable Title Defect
Notices, Title Benefit Notices, or Environmental Defect Notices and all
documentation provided therewith or referred to therein, and each Party shall
provide such other information as it deems appropriate for the Expert or as
may be reasonably requested by the Expert, to determine the existence and
effect of the Disputed Defect Matters. The Expert shall also be provided with
_Article 4_ of this Agreement and the Allocated Values of the affected
Assets together with any definitions of terms used in such Article, but no
other provisions of this Agreement. A Party shall not be allowed to conduct
discovery, written or otherwise, on the other Party. Information provided to
the Expert need not be in an admissible form and the Expert shall not take
testimony.

(vi) _No Ex-Parte Communications_. The Expert, once appointed, shall have no
ex-parte communications with any Party concerning the determination required
hereunder. All communications between any Party and the Expert shall be
conducted in writing, with copies sent simultaneously to the other Party
in the same manner, or by conference call with the Expert and with at least
one representative for each Party participating in such call.

 

(vii) _Determination_. The Expert shall make his or her determination and
provide to the Parties written findings within thirty (30) Business Days
after he or she has been selected under this _Section 4.5(b)_. The decision
of the Expert shall be final, binding on the Parties and non-appealable. The
Expert shall make a separate determination with respect to each Title Defect,
Title Benefit or Environmental Defect submitted.

(viii) _Fees and Costs_. Each Party shall be responsible for paying its own
costs, including its attorneys and experts fees. The costs of the Expert
shall be paid one-half by Seller and one-half by Purchaser.

 



-16- (ix) _Findings_. The written finding of the Expert need only set forth
the Experts finding as to whether the subject Defect exists or has been
cured and the Defect Amount, or the existence and value of the asserted Title
Benefit, and not the Experts rationale for the award.

 

(x) _Not Arbitration_. The Expert shall act as an expert for the limited
purpose of determining the specific matters disputed and shall not act as an
arbitrator, and may not award damages, interest or penalties to either Party
with respect to any matter. The Parties intend that the procedures set forth
in this _Section 4.5_ shall not constitute or be handled as arbitration
proceedings under the Federal Arbitration Act or any applicable state
arbitration act, and that the provisions of this _Section 4.5_ shall be
specifically enforceable.

 

(xi) _Execution of Documents_. The Parties agree to execute such agreements as
may be reasonably required by the Expert, including such engagement letters,
releases and indemnities as reasonably requested by the Expert.

(xii) _Adjustment to Purchase Price_. Any amounts determined to be owed by
either Party under this _Section 4.5_ shall be accounted for in the
determination of the Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 10.4(b)_.
Any claimed Title Defects, Title Benefits or Environmental Defects determined
not to be Title Defects, Title Benefits or Environmental Defects under the
decision of the Expert shall be final and binding as not being Title Defects,
Title Benefits or Environmental Defects, as applicable.

(c) Any dispute over the interpretation or application of this _Section 4.5_
shall be decided by the applicable Expert with reference to the Laws of the
State of Colorado.

Section 4.6 _Casualty or Condemnation Loss_. If, after the Execution Date but
prior to the Closing Date, any portion of the Assets is destroyed by fire or
other casualty or is taken in condemnation or under right of eminent domain
(each, a " _Casualty Loss_ "), subject to _Section 9.2_ and  _Section
11.1_, Purchaser shall nevertheless be required to close and Seller shall
elect by written notice to Purchaser prior to Closing either (i) to cause the
Assets affected by any Casualty Loss to be repaired or restored, to at least
their condition prior to such Casualty Loss, at Sellers sole cost, as
promptly as reasonably practicable (which work may extend after the Closing
Date), or (ii) the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
Parties agreed-upon estimated cost to repair or restore such Asset. In each
case, Seller shall retain all rights to insurance, condemnation proceeds and
other claims against third parties with respect to the Casualty Loss except to
the extent the Parties otherwise agree in writing. If Seller has not elected
clause (i) or clause (ii) in accordance with this _Section 4.6_ with respect
to any such Asset prior to the Closing, Seller shall be deemed to have elected
clause (ii) with respect to such Asset. If Seller has not elected clause (i)
with respect to any such Asset prior to the Closing and the Parties have not
agreed upon the estimated cost to repair or restore such Asset as contemplated
by clause (ii) prior to the Closing, the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be
reduced by Sellers good faith estimate of such cost for the Closing and
either Party may refer the determination of such cost to an independent expert
that has not worked for either Party or any of its Affiliates during the
three-year period prior to the Closing (the " _Casualty Expert_ ") for review
and final determination by binding expert resolution by the Casualty Expert.
The Casualty Experts 

 



-17-  determination shall (1) be made within thirty (30) days after its selection,
(2) (A) with respect to any Asset that has an Allocated Value, not exceed the
Allocated Value of such Asset and (B) with respect to any Asset that does not
have an Allocated Value, not exceed the lesser of (I) the Allocated Value of
the Property or relevant portion thereof upon which such Asset is located at
the time of the applicable Casualty Loss or (II) the economic value to the
Company of the Asset to be repaired or replaced by the Company, and (3) be
final and binding on the Parties, without right of appeal. Such determination
shall be the agreed upon estimated cost to repair or restore such Asset for
purposes of clause (ii). Seller shall bear one-half and Purchaser shall bear
one-half of the costs and expenses of the Casualty Expert. Any amounts
determined by a Casualty Expert to be owed by either Party under this
_Section 4.6_ shall be accounted for in the determination of the Adjusted
Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 10.4(b)_.

 

Section 4.7 _Required Consents and Preferential Purchase Rights_.

 

(a) Seller shall use reasonable efforts to obtain all Required Consents and
promptly (but, in any event, within five (5) Business Days after the
Execution Date) deliver any notice required in connection with any
preferential purchase rights and any request required to obtain any Required
Consent. Seller shall provide Purchaser copies of all letters providing such
notices or requesting such Required Consents. On or prior to five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing, Seller shall give Purchaser written notice
of the Required Consents that have been obtained and the preferential purchase
rights that have been waived or exercised or for which the time period to
exercise will not expire prior to Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, this
_Section 4.7_ shall not apply to any Required Consent with respect to the HSR
Act.

 

(b) If, prior to Closing, Seller fails to obtain a Required Consent, then each
Asset affected by the Required Consent shall be an Excluded Asset, the
Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such
Asset, and Seller, with Purchasers reasonable assistance, shall use its
reasonable efforts to obtain such Required Consent as promptly as possible
following Closing. If such Required Consent has been obtained as of the date
that the Post-Closing Statement is otherwise final, Seller shall cause the
affected Asset to be transferred or conveyed to Purchaser effective as of the
Effective Time pursuant to an assignment and assumption agreement in a form
reasonably acceptable to the Parties and Purchaser shall pay Seller the
Allocated Value of the affected Asset, less any proceeds from the affected
Asset attributable to the period of time after the Effective Time received
and retained by Seller or any Affiliate thereof (net of any Property Costs
paid by Seller or any of its Affiliates attributable to such period) and
subject to any other applicable adjustments pursuant to  _Section 3.2_. If
such Required Consent has not been obtained as of the date that the Post-
Closing Statement is otherwise final, the affected Asset shall remain an
Excluded Asset. If the affected Asset is a Well, Purchaser shall
provide access rights and gathering services as are reasonably required for
Seller to operate and market Hydrocarbons from any such Well upon terms and
conditions reasonably agreed by the Parties. Purchaser shall reasonably
cooperate with Seller in obtaining any Required Consent including providing
assurances of reasonable financial conditions.

(c) If any preferential right to purchase any portion of the Assets
(excluding any rights to purchase Hydrocarbons) is exercised and the purchase
is consummated prior to the Closing Date, then that portion of the Assets
affected by such preferential purchase right shall be 

 



-18-  Excluded Assets and the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward
by an amount equal to the Allocated Values of such affected Assets. If by
Closing, either (i) the time frame for the exercise of a preferential
purchase right has not expired and Seller has not received notice of an intent
not to exercise or a waiver of the preferential purchase right, or (ii) a
third party exercises its preferential right to purchase, but fails to
consummate the purchase prior to the Closing, then each affected Asset shall
be an Excluded Asset and the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be adjusted
downward by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such affected Asset. As
to any Assets not included in the transaction contemplated by this Agreement
under this _Section 4.7(c)_, if, following Closing, a preferential right to
purchase is not consummated within the time frame specified in the
preferential purchase right or the time frame for exercise of the
preferential purchase right expires without exercise after the Closing, in
each case, but prior the date that the Post-Closing Statement is otherwise
final, Seller shall promptly cause the transfer or conveyance of the affected
Asset to Purchaser effective as of the Effective Time pursuant to an
assignment and assumption agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Parties, and Purchaser shall pay the Allocated Value thereof to Seller
subject to any applicable adjustments pursuant to _Section 3.2_.

such additional testing and sampling upon Purchasers written notice to
Seller not less than three (3) days prior to such additional testing or

examination done by Purchaser shall result from Purchasers own independent
review and judgment.

be considered granted within five (5) Business Days (unless a shorter time is
reasonably required by the circumstances and such shorter time is specified in
the Companys notice) after the Companys notice to Purchaser in accordance
with this  _Section 8.4(b)_ requesting such consent unless Purchaser
notifies the Company to the contrary during such five (5)-Business Day period
or such shorter time, as applicable. In the event of an emergency with respect
to injury to life, property or the environment, the Company may take such
action in violation of this _Section 8.4(b)_ as a prudent operator would take

disposition of any Equity Security in the Company (including any Membership
Interest) or all or substantially all of the Assets, and Seller shall, and

Section 8.5 _Employee Covenant_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement, Purchaser may, on or after the Execution Date, interview any
employee of Seller or its Affiliates set forth on _Schedule 8.5_ (each, a "
_Permitted Employee_ ") and conduct any such standard employee screening and
eligibility procedures with regard to any Permitted Employee as Purchaser
conducts with respect to candidates for employment in Purchasers ordinary
course of business. Seller may supplement _Schedule 8.5_ at any time prior to
the Closing in order to add additional employees to _Schedule 8.5_. Purchaser
may conduct interviews and screening of the Permitted Employees from the
Execution Date until 30 days before the Transition Expiration Date; _provided_
, that such interviewing and screening shall not unreasonably interfere with
the business of Seller or its Affiliates. Seller shall exercise commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with Purchaser and to facilitate Purchasers
completion of its interview and screening procedures hereunder.

 

(b) After the Execution Date, Purchaser shall be authorized to communicate
with any Permitted Employee regarding such Permitted Employees potential
employment with Purchaser and Purchaser shall be authorized to communicate any
offer of employment to any Permitted Employees, with such employment offers to
be conditioned upon and effective as of the Transition Expiration Date. For
the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser will not enter into any contract
negotiations with any non-essential Permitted Employee until after the
expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act. Purchaser shall, not later
than 30 days before the Transition Expiration Date, deliver to Seller a final
written list containing the name of each Permitted Employee to whom Purchaser
has made an employment offer. Purchaser shall provide to Seller, not later
than 20 days prior to the Transition Expiration Date, the names of each
Permitted Employee who has then accepted an employment offer from Purchaser
(each Permitted Employee who accepts such an offer being a " _Continuing
Employee_ ") and the names of the Permitted Employees who have then declined
an employment offer from Purchaser, along with the terms of such offer,
including the location of where the applicable job was to be primarily located
and the compensation and benefits offered. Each Continuing Employee shall, as
of the Transition Expiration Date, be terminated by Seller and become an
employee of Purchaser. Between the Execution Date and 20 days prior to the
Transition Expiration Date, Seller shall not 

 



-40-  (and shall cause its Affiliates to not) terminate any Permitted Employee
(other than for cause or with Purchasers prior written consent, not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _however_ , that
prior to the Transition Expiration Date, Seller shall not (and shall cause its
Affiliates to not) terminate any Permitted Employee who has received an
employment offer from Purchaser and accepted such offer (other than for cause
or with Purchasers prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

(c) Seller shall be responsible for all compensation and benefits owing to
Continuing Employees arising on or prior to the Transition Expiration Date and
for all compensation and benefits owing to Permitted Employees not hired by
Purchaser. Purchaser shall be responsible for all compensation and benefits
owing to Continuing Employees arising after the Transition Expiration Date
under Purchasers compensation and benefits programs (on and subject to the
terms of employment agreed upon between Purchaser and such Continuing
Employees). Purchaser shall have no obligations with respect to any Permitted
Employee that is not hired by Purchaser, and Seller shall be responsible and
pay for any Liability in connection with any Continuing Employee arising on
or prior to the Transition Expiration Date. Seller shall be responsible and
pay for any obligation arising out of the WARN Act or laws governing mass
layoffs with respect to any employee of Seller or any of its Affiliates
(including any Permitted Employees laid off on or prior to the termination of
the Transition Services Agreement); _provided_ , that Purchaser shall be
responsible and pay for any obligation arising out of the WARN Act or
laws governing mass layoffs with respect to any Continuing Employees laid off
after the Transition Expiration Date.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in
this Agreement shall create any obligation on the part of Purchaser to
continue the employment of any employee for any definite period following the
Transition Expiration Date.

 

(e) Without limiting the generality of _Section 14.9_, no provision in this
Agreement shall create any third-party beneficiary or other right in any
Person (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) for any reason in
respect of continued employment or new employment with Seller, the Company or
Purchaser or in respect of any benefits that may be provided, directly
or indirectly, under any plan or arrangement maintained by Seller, the
Company or Purchaser.

Section 8.6 _Replacement of Support Obligations_. Seller shall cause the
Company to be released from the Support Obligations described on _Schedule
8.6(a)_ by the holders thereof on or before the Closing Date and shall deliver
to Purchaser at Closing evidence of the release or replacement of such
Support Obligations on the Closing Date. Seller shall cause the Support
Obligations described on _Schedule 8.6(b)_ to remain in place until August 31,
2016. Purchaser shall execute and deliver similar documents to the Support
Obligations described on _Schedule 8.6(c)_ as required by the agreements
pursuant to which such respective Support Obligations relate (but such
documents shall only secure the Companys obligations related to the Assets)
and shall deliver to Seller evidence thereof at the Closing. Purchaser shall
execute and deliver (or cause to be executed and delivered) similar documents
to the Support Obligations described on _Schedule 8.6(d)_ or execute
and deliver documents to replace Seller or its Affiliates as the surety to
the bond provider therefor, and shall deliver to Seller evidence thereof
within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date. Seller shall reasonably
cooperate with Purchaser and the Company

 



-41-  to (a) effect a release of the Company from the obligations arising in
connection with the Surety Bond No. K04991187 in favor of the United States
Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management and (b) with respect to
any guaranty on _Schedule 8.6(c)_ that is in favor of the Company and an
Affiliate of Seller, cause the guarantor thereunder to execute and deliver a
separate guaranty only for the benefit of the Company. 

Section 8.7 _Notification of Breaches_. Between the Execution Date and the
Closing Date:

 

(a) Purchaser shall notify Seller promptly after Purchaser obtains actual
knowledge that any representation or warranty of Purchaser contained in this
Agreement is untrue in any material respect or will be untrue in any material
respect as of the Closing Date or that any covenant or agreement to be
performed or observed by Purchaser prior to or on the Closing Date has not
been so performed or observed in any material respect.

(b) Seller shall notify Purchaser promptly after Seller obtains actual
knowledge that any representation or warranty of Seller contained in this
Agreement is untrue in any material respect or will be untrue in any material
respect as of the Closing Date or that any covenant or agreement to be
performed or observed by Seller prior to or on the Closing Date has not been
so performed or observed in any material respect.

(c) If any of Purchasers or Sellers representations or warranties is untrue
or shall become untrue in any material respect based on any matter occurring
between the Execution Date and the Closing Date, or if any of Purchasers or
Sellers covenants or agreements to be performed or observed prior to or on
the Closing Date shall not have been so performed or observed in any material
respect, but if such breach of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
shall (if curable) be cured by the Closing (or, if the Closing does not
occur, by the Scheduled Closing Date) and such breach has not resulted in the
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the other
Party hereunder, then such breach shall be considered not to have occurred
for all purposes of _Sections 9.1(a)_ and _(b)_ and _Sections 9.2(a)_ and
_(b)_.

Section 8.8 _Further Assurances_. After Closing, Seller and Purchaser agree
to, and Purchaser shall cause the Company to, take such further actions and
execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further documents as are reasonably
requested by the other Party for carrying out the purposes of this Agreement
(including with respect to any curative documents in connection with _Article
4_ or the provision of information for any audits or adjustments in
Purchasers or the Companys possession based on a reasonable written request
from Seller pursuant to a contract or Tax Law regarding any period prior to
the Closing, or any reasonably requested information in Purchasers or the
Companys possession for any purposes under  _Exhibit O_ ) or of any
Transaction Document delivered pursuant to this Agreement. Prior to the
Closing, Seller shall provide to Purchaser any information and documentation
reasonably requested by Purchaser that is necessary for the Company
to execute, deliver and record a mortgage on at least 50% of the PV-9 value
of the Properties (and on any additional Properties as reasonably requested by

Sources.

 



-42- Section 8.9 _Transition Services Agreement_. Seller shall execute and deliver
(and cause the Company to execute and deliver) the Transition Services

director, officer, manager or management committee member of the Company to,
upon the written request of Purchaser, resign his or her position with the
Company effective at Closing.

Section 8.11  _Pre-Closing Conveyances_. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall
cause the Company to transfer and convey the Excluded Assets to Seller or one
or more of its Affiliates and for such Affiliate(s) to assume any Liabilities
arising in connection with the Excluded Assets pursuant to an assignment and
assumption agreement reasonably acceptable to Purchaser. Prior to the Closing,
Seller shall (a) transfer and convey (and cause each Affiliate of Seller to
transfer and convey) any Asset transferred or conveyed by the Company to
Seller or such Affiliate between the Effective Time and the Closing or (b)
cause any Asset transferred or conveyed to any Third Party, or subjected to an
Encumbrance, in each case for this clause (b), in violation of _Section 8.4_
to be transferred or conveyed to the Company (without any change to such
Asset) and such Lien to be discharged, as applicable. Prior to the Closing,
Seller shall cause the Additional Piceance Assets to be transferred and
conveyed to the Company or otherwise cause the Company to own the Additional
Piceance Assets pursuant to an assignment and assumption agreement or other
agreement, in each case, reasonably acceptable to Purchaser.

shall cause the Company to cease using the name "WPX" or any names, logos or
marks that include, or could reasonably be expected to be confused with, any
trademarks, service marks, trade dress, logos or trade names of Seller or any
of its Affiliates containing such name, or any mark similar thereto
(collectively, the " _Seller Marks_ "). From and after the expiration of 150
days after the Closing Date, Purchaser agrees (a) to cease using and to cause
the Company to cease using, the Seller Marks in any manner, directly or

Marks from the assets of the Company and from all assets and all other
materials owned, possessed or used by the Company (other than the Records),

the organizational documents of the Company to reflect such name change and
(d) to file such documents, reports and affidavits required by the State of
Delaware to evidence the change of name of the Company. The Parties agree,
because damages would be an inadequate remedy, that a Party seeking to enforce
this _Section 8.12_ shall be entitled to seek specific performance and
injunctive relief as remedies for any breach thereof in addition to other
remedies available at law or in equity.

Section 8.13 _Suspense Accounts and Division of Interest_. At the Closing,
Seller will supplement _Schedule 6.18_ with (a) information regarding the
Companys accounts holding funds in suspense and (b) the Companys division of
interest, and provide to Purchaser all supporting documentation regarding
those interest owners in the Leases and/or Wells for whom the Company
disburses proceeds of production. Purchaser agrees to cause the Company to
take and apply such funds in a manner consistent with prudent oil and gas
business practices and the information supplied by Seller and to indemnify,
defend and hold Seller harmless against any claim arising from Purchasers or
the Companys failure to pay such funds in such manner after the Closing.

 



-43- Section 8.14 _Payouts_. Promptly following the Execution Date, Seller will use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain payout balance statements for each
Property operated by a Third Party that is subject to a reversion or other

Property. Seller will promptly provide any such payout statements to
Purchaser.

 

Section 8.15 _Records_. Except as otherwise provided for in the Transition
Services Agreement, Seller shall provide to Purchaser electronic Records, if
any, within fifteen (15) Business Days after Closing, or shall make the
Records or copies of such Records available for pick-up by Purchaser within
thirty (30) Business Days after Closing. Seller may retain copies of the
Records and Seller shall have the right to review and copy any Records
delivered by Seller to Purchaser under this _Section 8.15_ during standard
business hours upon reasonable notice for so long as Purchaser or the Company
retains such Records. Purchaser agrees that such Records will be maintained
for a period of six (6) years following the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if Seller provides written notice to Purchaser or the Company
regarding any ongoing audits or other proceedings, then Purchaser shall cause
the Company to retain Records related thereto for such period as Seller shall
reasonably request.

 

Section 8.16 _Financing and Financial Information Cooperation_. Seller shall
comply with and perform, and cause WPX and its other Affiliates to comply
with and perform, the covenants and agreements set forth on _Exhibit N_.

Closing, upon receipt of written instructions from Purchaser, Seller shall
promptly cause the Company to execute and deliver one or more agreements for
any hedging transaction in connection with the Properties in accordance with
the terms and conditions, and with any counterparty that has an ISDA agreement
in effect or executes an ISDA agreement with the Company, set forth in such
written instructions (a " _Hedging Agreement_ ");  _provided_ , that (a) the
Hedging Agreements are consistent with _Schedule 8.17_ and on market terms,
(b) Seller shall not be required to pay to any counterparty any fee to execute
and deliver any Hedging Agreement (unless Purchaser agrees to reimburse
Seller for such fee); _provided_ , _however_ , that this Clause (b) shall not
apply to any cost imbedded in the strike price of any Hedging Agreement, and
(c) Purchaser has delivered such instructions on or before March 4, 2016. If
Seller has executed and delivered any Hedging Agreement in accordance with
this _Section 8.17_ and the proposed counterparty thereto fails to execute
and deliver such Hedging Agreement, Seller shall not be in breach of this
_Section 8.17_ for such counterpartys failure to execute and deliver such
Hedging Agreement. Prior to the earlier of Closing or termination of this
Agreement, Seller shall cause the Company (a) to comply with each Hedging
Agreement and (b) not to (i) execute or deliver any hedge, swap or other
derivative contract except as expressly provided in this _Section 8.17_ or
(ii) execute or deliver any amendment for, or waiver of any right under, any
Hedging Agreement, transfer any right or obligation under any Hedging
Agreement or voluntarily terminate or close out any Hedging Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall cause the Company to execute
and deliver any such amendment or waiver or effect any such transfer or
termination or close-out in accordance with any written request delivered by
Purchaser to Seller and consistent with _Schedule 8.17_. Without limiting the
generality of  _Section 14.1_, the Company shall own any revenues or gains,
and be responsible for any losses, costs or expenses, relating to the Hedging
Agreements (but, for the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall be responsible for
any breach by Seller of  _Section 8.4_ or this _Section 8.17_).

 



-44- Section 8.18 _Cooperation_. Each Party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to satisfy the condition in _Section 9.2(f)_. Purchaser shall pay to
Seller any fees paid by Seller to a trade counterparty that was necessary to
effect any novation contemplated by _Section 9.2(f)_. Seller shall consult
with Purchaser regarding any such fee prior to agreeing to pay such fee.

Section 8.19 _External Leased Assets_. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate the transfer of
equipment and vehicles leased by an Affiliate of the Company and used in
connection with the operation of the Assets as identified by Purchaser, and
Purchaser shall provide, at its sole cost and expense, any financial
assurance as required by the respective leasing company in connection with
such transfer.

 

Section 8.20 _Licensed Seismic Data_. Within 30 days after the Execution Date,
Purchaser will provide Seller a list of the licensed seismic data described
on _Schedule 8.20_ (the " _Licensed Seismic Data_ ") that Purchaser desires to
acquire. If Purchaser acquires a new license with respect to any Licensed
Seismic Data or a license with respect to any other geological, geophysical
or geochemical license for third party geological, geophysical or geochemical
data, if any, on or before Closing, Seller shall transfer the applicable
Licensed Seismic Data or geological, geophysical or geochemical data and any
interpretations related thereto held by Seller or the Company to Purchaser at
Closing. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Seller cannot transfer any
Licensed Seismic Data or provide interpretations of such data unless Purchaser
has a valid seismic license from the third-party seismic owner, and the
Companys rights to use the Licensed Seismic Data will otherwise terminate at
Closing.

 

Section 8.21 _Transportation Releases_.

 

(a) On the last day of a month which occurs after the latest of the following
has occurred: (i) the Closing Date, (ii) the grant of the FERC Waiver and
(iii) the termination date of the Gas Purchase Agreement (the " _Release Date_
"), Seller agrees to, or to cause its Affiliates to, (a) assign or permanently
release WPX Energy Marketing, LLCs (" _WPX Marketing_ ") natural gas
transportation capacity rights on the White River Hub, LLC transmission system
under transportation contract number 4083 (such contract, the " _White River
Contract_ " and, such capacity, the " _White River Transportation Obligation_
") for the full contract quantity at the maximum tariff rate and (b) assign or
temporarily release for the full remaining term at the maximum tariff rate
100,000 Dth/d of WPXs natural gas transportation capacity rights on
Northwest Pipeline LLCs transmission system under transportation contract
number 138172 (such contract, the " _Northwest Contract_ " and, together with
the White River Contract, the " _Transportation Contracts_ " and, such
capacity, the " _Northwest Pipeline Transportation Obligation_ " and, together
with the White River Transportation Obligation, the " _Transportation
Obligations_ "), to the Company. The Parties acknowledge that assignment of
the Transportation Obligations will be subject to the policies of the FERC and
applicable provisions of the FERC Gas Tariffs of White River Hub, LLC and
Northwest Pipeline LLC. The Parties further acknowledge that, in order to
effectuate the transfer of the Transportation Obligations, a FERC order
granting a waiver of certain FERC capacity release regulations and policies
and the related White River Hub, LLC and Northwest Pipeline LLC tariff
provisions must be obtained as described in _Section 8.2(c)_.

 



-45- (b) From and after the Release Date, Purchaser hereby agrees it will cause the
Company to fulfill the requirements of the White River Hub, LLC and Northwest
Pipeline LLC FERC Gas Tariffs with respect to the Transportation Obligations
pertaining to qualifications for entering into service agreements or
participating in White River Hubs and Northwest Pipelines capacity release
program, which will include satisfaction of creditworthiness and related
collateral requirements found in Section 8 of the White River Hub, LLC Tariff
and Section 5.10 of the Northwest Pipeline LLC Tariff. If the transfer of
either or both of the Transportation Obligations must be done via permanent
capacity release (in the case of the White River Transportation Obligations)
and temporary release (in the case of the Northwest Pipeline Transportation
Obligations), Seller agrees to cause its Affiliate to name the Company as the
prearranged shipper for a prearranged non-biddable permanent release or
temporary release, as applicable, of such Transportation Obligation under
the capacity release provision of such Tariff, and Purchaser agrees to cause
the Company to confirm and accept such release for (i) in the case of the
White River Transportation Obligation, the full contract quantity and the
remaining term of the White River Contract at the maximum tariff rate and
(ii) in the case of the Northwest Pipeline Transportation Obligation, 100,000
Dth/d of capacity for the remaining term of the Northwest Contract at the
maximum tariff rate. If either White River Hub, LLC or Northwest Pipeline LLC
determines to effectuate the release through a direct assignment of the
capacity, then Purchaser agrees to cause the Company to execute an appropriate
agreement representing an assumption of (A) in the case of the White River
Transportation Obligation, the full contract quantity and the remaining term
of the White River Contract at the maximum tariff rate and/or (B) in the case
of the Northwest Pipeline Transportation Obligation, 100,000 Dth/d of
capacity for the remaining term of the Northwest Contract at the maximum
tariff rate.

Section 8.22 _Marketing_. The Parties shall negotiate in good faith a gas
purchase and sale agreement and transaction confirmation and marketing
agreement that would be executed by the Company and WPX Marketing on the
Closing Date (the " _Gas Purchase Agreement_ "). Such Gas Purchase Agreement
would provide that WPX Marketing purchase gas from the Company from the
Closing until June 30, 2016. The purchase price for the first 100,000 Dth/d of
gas purchased each day would be Platts Inside FERC Monthly Index Northwest
Pipeline, Rockies, plus $0.03 per MMBtu, less applicable demand, fuel and
commodity charges under Northwest Pipeline LLC transportation contract number
138172. The purchase price for the remaining gas produced by the Company
would Platts Inside FERC CIG Monthly Index, _plus_ $0.03 per MMBtu.

CLOSING

Section 10.1  _Time and Place of Closing_. Consummation of the purchase and
sale of the Membership Interests as contemplated by this Agreement (the "
_Closing_ "), shall, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Purchaser and
Seller, take place at the offices of Seller, located at One Williams Center,
Tulsa, Oklahoma 74103, at 10:00 a.m., Central Time, on the Scheduled Closing
Date, or if all conditions in _Article 9_ to be satisfied prior to Closing
have not been satisfied or waived on the Scheduled Closing Date, within five
(5) Business Days after such conditions having been satisfied (other than any
such condition that by its nature is to be satisfied at the Closing) or
waived, subject to the rights of the Parties under  _Article 11_. The date on
which the Closing occurs is herein referred to as the " _Closing Date_." "
_Scheduled Closing Date_ " means the day that is the later of (a) April 8,
2016 and (b) the day that occurs 35 days following the later of

 



-48-  (i) the delivery by Seller of all Required Information to Purchaser and (ii)
the entry into the Hedging Agreements contemplated by _Schedule 8.17_ in
accordance with  _Section 8.17_ that have been requested by written
instructions in accordance with _Section 8.17_ on or before March 4, 2016
(the " _Marketing Period_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if such day is
not a Business Day, the Scheduled Closing Date shall be the immediately
following Business Day. If at any time Seller shall in good faith believe that
Seller has delivered all Required Information to Purchaser and the Company has
entered into such Hedging Agreements, Seller may deliver to Purchaser written
notice to that effect (stating when Seller believes that Seller has satisfied
such requirements), in which case, Seller shall be deemed to have delivered
all Required Information to Purchaser and delivered evidence that the Company
has entered into such Hedging Agreements on the date of such notice and the
Marketing Period shall be deemed to have commenced on the date of such notice,
unless Purchaser, in good faith, believes or the Financing Sources have
otherwise delivered notice to Purchaser that Seller has not completed the
delivery of all Required Information to Purchaser or the Company has not
entered into such Hedging Agreements and, within five (5) Business Days after
delivery of such notice by Seller, Purchaser delivers a written notice to
Seller to that effect (stating with specificity which Required Information
Seller has not delivered or such Hedging Agreements that have not been entered
for purposes of compliance with this condition only) ( _provided_ , that it
is understood that the delivery of such written notice from Purchaser to
Seller will not prejudice Sellers right to assert that all Required
Information has in fact been delivered to Purchaser). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (y) the Marketing Period shall end on any earlier date on which
Purchaser provides written notice to Seller that the Financing is ready to
close and (z) the Marketing Period shall not commence and shall be deemed not
to have commenced if, on or prior to the completion of such 35-day period,
WPX, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates shall have publicly
announced any intention to restate any material financial or other
information regarding the Company, Seller or any of its Affiliates included in
the Required Information or that any such restatement is under consideration,
in which case, the Marketing Period shall be deemed not to commence unless and
until such restatement has been completed and the applicable Required
Information has been amended or WPX has announced that it has concluded that
no restatement shall be required, and Seller shall have delivered the Required
Information on the first day, throughout and on the last day of during such
new 35-day period. For the avoidance of doubt, each reference in this _Section
10.1_ to a 35-day period means 35 consecutive days.

shall, in good faith, prepare and deliver to Purchaser, using and based upon

statement (" _Purchaser s Response to Post-Closing Statement_"). The Parties
shall undertake to agree on the final statement of the Adjusted Purchase Price
no later than 30 days after the delivery of Purchasers Response to Post-
Closing Statement. In the event that the Parties cannot reach agreement within
such period of time, either Party may refer the remaining matters in dispute
(the " _Final Disputed Purchase Price Matters_ ") to Deloitte LLP or
if Deloitte LLP is unable or unwilling to serve, another independent
accounting firm that is reasonably acceptable to Seller and Purchaser (the "

Independent Accountant shall resolve the Final Disputed Purchase Price Matters
based only on the foregoing submissions. The Independent Accountants
determination shall be made

 



-52-  within thirty (30) days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall
be final and binding on all Parties, without right of appeal. In determining
the proper amount of any adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price, the
Independent Accountant shall not increase the Unadjusted Purchase Price more
than the increase proposed by Seller nor decrease the Unadjusted Purchase
Price more than the decrease proposed by Purchaser. Seller shall bear one-
half and Purchaser shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the
Independent Accountant. Within ten (10) days after the earlier of (i) the
expiration of Purchasers 30-day review period without delivery of
any Purchasers Response to Post-Closing Statement or (ii) the date on which
the Parties finally determine the Adjusted Purchase Price or the Independent
Accountant finally determines the Final Disputed Purchase Price Matters (the
earlier thereof being the final determination of the Post-Closing Statement
for purposes of this Agreement), (A) Purchaser shall pay to Seller the amount
by which the (1) Adjusted Purchase Price _less_ the Deposit (and any interest
earned thereon) exceeds (2) the Closing Payment or (B) Seller shall pay to
Purchaser the amount by which (1) the Closing Payment exceeds (2) the Adjusted
Purchase Price _less_ the Deposit (and any interest earned thereon); 
_provided_ , _however_ , that, if any (x) Title Defect for which a Remedy
Notice has been timely submitted in accordance with this Agreement is not
cured prior to the final determination of the Post-Closing Statement or (y)
dispute submitted to an Expert or a Casualty Expert has not been resolved
prior to, or the resolution thereof is not otherwise included in the
calculation of, the final determination of the Post-Closing Statement, the
Adjusted Purchase Price shall be recalculated upon, and the 30-day period in
_Section 3.4 _shall be extended until, the expiration of the Cure Period (if
clause (x) is applicable) and such determination of all such disputes (if
clause (y) is applicable), and, within five (5) Business Days after such
recalculation, (I) if such recalculation increases the Adjusted Purchase Price
above the Adjusted Purchase Price utilized in clause (A) or (B), Purchaser
shall pay the amount of such increase to Seller and (II) if such
recalculation deceases the Adjusted Purchase Price below the Adjusted Purchase
Price utilized in clause (A) or (B), Seller shall pay the amount of such
decrease to Purchaser.

 

(c) Purchaser shall assist Seller in the preparation of the final statement of
the Adjusted Purchase Price under _Section 10.4(b)_ by furnishing invoices,
receipts, reasonable access to personnel, and such other reasonable assistance
as may be requested by Seller to facilitate such process post-Closing.

 

(d) All payments made or to be made under this Agreement to Seller shall be
made by electronic transfer of immediately available funds to the account
designated by Seller in writing to Purchaser. All payments made or to be made
hereunder to Purchaser shall be by electronic transfer of immediately
available funds to the account specified by Purchaser in writing to Seller.

 

(e) The Parties shall instruct the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement to pay the applicable amount, if any, in accordance with _Section
10.4(b)_.

TERMINATION

Section 11.1  _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to Closing:

(a) by the mutual written consent of Seller and Purchaser;

(b) by Seller, if Sellers conditions set forth in _Section 9.1(a)_ or _(b)_
are not satisfied (other than any such condition that by its nature is to be
satisfied at the Closing that Purchaser is ready, willing and able to satisfy
if the Closing were to then occur) and are not waived by Seller as of the
Scheduled Closing Date; _provided, however_ , that Purchaser shall have
received written notice of any alleged breach of this Agreement, if any, from
Seller that resulted therein. For the avoidance of doubt, any failure of
Purchaser to obtain the Financing that is necessary for Purchaser to pay the
Closing Payment as of the Scheduled Closing Date shall result in the failure
of Sellers condition set forth in _Section 9.1(a)_ to be satisfied;
_provided_ , _however_ , that this sentence shall not waive any right of
Purchaser with respect to any condition in _Section 9.2_ that is not
satisfied or any breach by Seller of _Section 8.8_ or _8.16_.

 

(c) by Purchaser, if Purchasers conditions set forth in _Section 9.2(a)_ or
_(b)_ are not satisfied (other than any such condition that by its nature is
to be satisfied at the Closing that Seller is ready, willing and able to
satisfy if the Closing were to then occur) and are not waived by Purchaser as
of the Scheduled Closing Date; _provided, however_ , that Seller shall have
received written notice of any alleged breach of this Agreement, if any, from
Purchaser that resulted therein;

(d) by Seller, if the Closing does not occur on or before June 30, 2016;

(e) by Purchaser, if the Closing does not occur on or before June 30, 2016;
or

(f) by Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, in the event that the
aggregate reduction to the Unadjusted Purchase Price under _Section 4.2_,
_4.6_ or _4.7_ exceeds fifteen percent (15%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, in the case of Seller, any reduction to the
Unadjusted Purchase Price under _Section 4.7(c)_ for any preferential right
that is exercised and consummated prior to the Closing shall be disregarded
for this _Section 11.1(f)_;

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Party may terminate this Agreement
under _Section 11.1(b)_, _(c)_ ,  _(d)_ or _(e)_ , as applicable, if the
Closing has not occurred due to a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement herein of or by such Party.

 

Section 11.2 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to _Section 11.1_, this Agreement shall become void and of no further force
or effect (except for the Confidentiality Agreement and the provisions of
_Article 1_ , _Section 5.5_, _Section 6.12_, _Section 7.5_, _Section
8.1(d)_, _Section 8.3_,  _Article 11_ , _Article 14_ and _Appendix A_ ,
which shall continue in full force and effect) and Seller shall be free
immediately to sell, transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of the Membership
Interests and the Company shall be free immediately to sell, transfer,
encumber or otherwise dispose of the Assets to any Person without any
restriction under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this _Section 11.2_, if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
11.1_ and neither Party has a remedy under _Section 11.3(a)_ or _(b)_ for
such termination, the termination of this Agreement under _Section 11.1_
shall not relieve either Party, subject to _Section 14.11_, from Liability
for any failure to perform or observe in any material respect any of its
agreements or covenants contained herein which are to be performed or observed
at or prior to Closing or any material breach of any representation or
warranty of

 



-54-  such Party contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Party
shall be entitled to recover any amount in connection therewith, individually
or in the aggregate, that is in excess of the amount such Party would have
recovered under _Section 11.3(a)_ or _(b)_ if such Section had applied.

(a) If (i) Seller terminates this Agreement under _Section 11.1(b)_ or
_Section 11.1(d)_, (ii) the conditions in  _Section 9.2_ are satisfied
(other than any such condition that by its nature is to be satisfied at the

to then occur) or waived by Purchaser and Purchaser fails to consummate the
Closing in accordance with _Section 10.1_ and (iii) Seller has performed or,
absent such termination, is ready, willing and able to perform all of its
agreements and covenants contained herein which are to be performed or
observed at or prior to Closing, as Sellers sole and exclusive remedy at law

within five Business Days after such termination, the Parties shall
instruct the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow Agreement to pay the
Deposit (and any interest thereon) to Seller, free of any claims by Purchaser
or any other Person. The Parties agree that the damages that would be suffered
by Seller as a result of Purchasers breach would be difficult to estimate
and that the liquidated damages described herein represent a reasonable
estimation of such damages and do not constitute a penalty. WITHOUT LIMITING
THE GENERALITY OF _SECTIONS 12.1(C)_  AND _12.4_ , THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREE
THAT, UNLESS AND UNTIL THE CLOSING OCCURS, THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF
SELLER AND ITS AFFILIATES AGAINST PURCHASER, THE FINANCING SOURCES, AND ANY OF
THEIR RESPECTIVE PARTNERS, EQUITYHOLDERS, CONTROLLING PERSONS, MANAGEMENT
COMPANIES, REPRESENTATIVES, ASSIGNEES OR AFFILIATES AND ANY AND ALL FORMER,
CURRENT OR FUTURE HEIRS, EXECUTORS, ADMINISTRATORS, TRUSTEES, SUCCESSORS OR

REMEDIES AGAINST PURCHASER DESCRIBED IN THIS _SECTION 11.3(A)_ AND _SECTION
8.1(D)_. EXCEPT FOR THE RIGHTS AND REMEDIES AGAINST PURCHASER DESCRIBED IN
THIS _SECTION 11.3(A)_ AND _SECTION 8.1(D)_, IN FURTHERANCE OF THE
FOREGOING, IF AND ONLY IF THE CLOSING DOES NOT OCCUR, (A) SELLER RELEASES THE
PURCHASER RELATED PARTIES, WAIVES ANY RIGHT OF RECOVERY FOR AND AGREES NOT TO
SEEK ANY RECOVERY FOR ANY DAMAGES SUFFERED AS A RESULT OF ANY BREACH OF ANY
COVENANT, AGREEMENT, REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY IN THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
FAILURE OF THE CLOSING TO BE CONSUMMATED, OR IN RESPECT OF ANY ORAL
REPRESENTATION MADE OR ALLEGED TO HAVE BEEN MADE IN CONNECTION HEREWITH AND
(B) THE MAXIMUM AGGREGATE MONETARY LIABILITY THAT THE PURCHASER RELATED
PARTIES SHALL HAVE IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH DAMAGES SHALL BE THE

 



-55-  FORFEITURE OF THE DEPOSIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS _SECTION 11.3(A)_. FOR
THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, IF SELLER MATERIALLY BREACHES ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER
_SECTION 8.4_ , _8.8_ OR  _8.16_ AND SUCH BREACH CAUSES THE FINANCING NOT TO
CLOSE, PURCHASER SHALL NOT BE IN BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT FOR PURPOSES OF
_SECTION 11.1_ AS A RESULT THEREOF AND THE DEPOSIT (AND ANY INTEREST THEREON)
SHALL BE RETURNED TO PURCHASER, FREE OF ANY CLAIMS BY SELLER OR ANY OTHER
PERSON.

(b) If (i) Purchaser terminates this Agreement under _Section 11.1(c)_ or 
_Section 11.1(e)_, (ii) the conditions in _Section 9.1_ are satisfied (other
than any such condition that by its nature is to be satisfied at the Closing
that Purchaser is ready, willing and able to satisfy if the Closing were to
then occur or that Purchaser cannot satisfy as a result of a breach by Seller
hereunder) or waived by Seller and Seller fails to consummate the Closing in
accordance with _Section 10.1_ and (iii) Purchaser has performed or, absent
such termination, is ready, willing and able to perform all of its agreements
and covenants contained herein which are to be performed or observed at or
prior to Closing, (A) within five days after such termination, the Parties
shall instruct the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow Agreement to
pay the Deposit (and any interest thereon) to Purchaser, free of any claims by
Seller or any other Person and (B) Purchaser shall be entitled to pursue all
rights and remedies available at law or equity for any such failure of Seller
to perform at Closing or other uncured breach of this Agreement by Seller,
including the right to specific performance and injunctive relief.

 

(c) If this Agreement is terminated for any reason other than the reason set
forth in the first sentence of _Section 11.3(a)_, within five days after
such termination, the Parties shall instruct the Escrow Agent in accordance

Purchaser, free of any claims by Seller or any other Person.

 

(d) If (i) Seller is in breach of (or threatens to be in breach of) _Section
8.3(b)_ or (ii) an event has occurred that would give rise to Purchasers
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1(c)_ or _(e)_ , in
lieu of terminating this Agreement, Purchaser shall be entitled to specific
performance of this Agreement (without any requirement to post a bond or
other security), it being specifically agreed that monetary damages may not be
sufficient to compensate Purchaser (as determined by Purchaser in its sole
discretion), and Seller shall not object to the availability of specific
performance to specifically enforce this Agreement. Purchaser shall not in any
respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available
to it in accordance with this Agreement if the remedies provided for in this 
_Section 11.3(d)_ are not granted; _provided_ , _however_ , that this
_Section 11.3(d)_ shall not waive any other right of Seller under this

Purchaser notifies Seller on or before the Claim Date that Purchaser believes
in good faith that the 

 



-57-  continuing cost to Remediate such matters would exceed the Individual
Environmental Defect Threshold for periods after the Effective Time, in which
case, the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced by the cost to Remediate
such matters in excess of the Individual Environmental Defect Threshold;
_provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that any dispute with respect to such
cost shall be handled in accordance with  _Section 4.5 _as if such matter is

and marketed with respect to any Asset after the Effective Time.

WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THIS _SECTION 12.1(B)_, THIS  _SECTION

GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WILLFUL OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT OR INTENTIONAL FRAUD

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement and
except with respect to any willful or intentional misconduct or Intentional
Fraud, following the Closing, this _Section 12.1_, _Exhibit O_ and _Section

(d) The indemnity of each Party provided in this _Section 12.1_ shall be for
the benefit of and extend to each Person included in the Seller Group and the
Purchaser Group, as applicable; _provided_ , _however,_ that any claim for
indemnity under this _Section 12.1_ by any such Person must be brought and
administered by a Party to this Agreement. No Indemnified Person (including
any Person within the Seller Group and the Purchaser Group) other than Seller
and Purchaser shall have any rights against either Seller or Purchaser under
the terms of this _Section 12.1_ except as may be exercised on its behalf by
Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, pursuant to this _Section 12.1(d)_.
Seller and Purchaser may elect to exercise or not exercise indemnification
rights under this Section on behalf of the other Indemnified Persons
affiliated with it in its sole discretion and shall have no liability to any
such other Indemnified Person for any action or inaction under this Section.

 

Section 12.2 _Indemnification Actions_. All claims for indemnification under
_Section 12.1_ shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

(a) For purposes hereof, (i) the term " _Indemnifying Person_ " when used in
connection with particular Damages shall mean the Person or Persons having an
obligation to

 



-59-  indemnify another Person or Persons with respect to such Damages pursuant to
this _Article 12_ and (ii) the term " _Indemnified Person_ " when used in
connection with particular Damages shall mean the Person or Persons having
the right to be indemnified with respect to such Damages by another Person or
Persons pursuant to this _Article 12_. The terms indemnify, indemnification
and indemnified shall include defense and hold harmless for purposes of this
_Section 12.2_.

(b) To make a claim for indemnification under  _Section 12.1_, an
Indemnified Person shall notify the Indemnifying Person of its claim under
this _Section 12.2_, including the specific details of and specific basis
under this Agreement for its claim (the " _Claim Notice_ "). In the event
that the claim for indemnification is based upon a claim by a third Person
against the Indemnified Person (a " _Third Person Claim_ "), the Indemnified
Person shall provide its Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Person
has actual knowledge of the Third Person Claim and shall enclose a copy of all
papers (if any) served with respect to the Third Person Claim; _provided_ ,
that the failure of any Indemnified Person to give notice of a Third Person
Claim as provided in this _Section 12.2_ shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Person of its obligations under _Section 12.1_ except to the extent such
failure results in insufficient time being available to permit
the Indemnifying Person to effectively defend against the Third Person Claim
and prejudices the Indemnifying Persons ability to defend against the Third
Person Claim. In the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon an
inaccuracy or breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement,
the Claim Notice shall specify the representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement which was inaccurate or breached.

 

(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Third Person
Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt
of the Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Person whether it admits or
denies its obligation to defend the Indemnified Person against such Third
Person Claim under this _Article 12_. If the Indemnifying Person does not
notify the Indemnified Person within such 30-day period whether the
Indemnifying Person admits or denies its obligation to defend the Indemnified
Person, it shall be conclusively deemed to have denied such indemnification
obligation hereunder. The Indemnified Person is authorized, prior to and
during such 30-day period, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that
it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of
the Indemnifying Person and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying
Person.

(d) If the Indemnifying Person timely admits its obligation in accordance with
_Section 12.2(c)_, it shall have the right and obligation to diligently
defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Third Person Claim. Subject to
_Section 12.2(d)_ and _(e)_ , the Indemnifying Person shall have full control
of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement
thereof. If requested by the Indemnifying Person, the Indemnified Person
agrees to reasonably cooperate in contesting any Third Person Claim at the
Indemnifying Persons expense which the Indemnifying Person elects to contest
( _provided, however_ , that the Indemnified Person shall not be required to
bring any counterclaim or cross-complaint against any Person). Except as
provided in _Exhibit O_ , the Indemnified Person may at its own expense
participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any Third Person
Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Person pursuant to this _Section
12.2(d)_. Except as provided in _Exhibit O_ , an Indemnifying Person
shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, settle any
Third Person Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect
thereto which (i) does not result in a final resolution and release of the
Indemnified Persons liability with respect to the Third Person

 



-60-  Claim (including, in the case of a settlement, an unconditional written
release of the Indemnified Person), (ii) requires a non-monetary commitment by
the Indemnified Person, (iii) includes any monetary relief not paid in full
by the Indemnifying Person, (iv) includes any admission of guilt or
culpability (v) may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Person
(other than as a result of money damages covered by the indemnity of the
Indemnifying Party under _Section 12.1_) or (vi) relates to the payment or
calculation of royalties or overriding royalties (but this clause (vi) shall
not apply to such settlement or consent if such settlement or consent (A) is
only for money that is paid in full by Seller or any of its Affiliates, (B) is
only for royalties or overriding royalties, as applicable, attributable to the
period prior to the Effective Time and (C) could not set a legal precedent
for, or otherwise prejudice Purchasers or the Companys ability to legally
defend, any calculation or payment of any royalties or overriding royalties
attributable to the period after the Effective Time (including any deduction
in connection therewith).

(e) If the Indemnifying Person does not timely admit its obligation
in accordance with _Section 12.2(c)_ or so admits its obligation but fails
to diligently defend or settle the Third Person Claim, then the Indemnified
Person shall have the right to defend against the Third Person Claim (at the
sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Person, if the Indemnified Person
is entitled to indemnification hereunder), with counsel of the Indemnified
Persons choosing. If the Indemnifying Person has not yet admitted its
obligation to provide indemnification with respect to a Third Person Claim,
the Indemnified Person shall send written notice to the Indemnifying Person of
any proposed settlement and the Indemnifying Person shall have the option for
ten (10) days following receipt of such notice to (i) admit in writing its
obligation to provide indemnification with respect to the Third Person Claim
and (ii) if its obligation is so admitted, reject, in its reasonable judgment,
the proposed settlement. If the Indemnified Person settles any Third Person
Claim over the objection of the Indemnifying Person after the Indemnifying
Person has timely admitted its obligation in writing and assumed the defense
of a Third Person Claim, the Indemnified Person shall be deemed to have
waived any right to indemnity therefor. Such Indemnifying Person shall not
unreasonably reject such settlement.

(f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Third Person
Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of
the Claim Notice to (i) cure the Damages complained of, (ii) admit its
obligation to provide indemnification with respect to such Damages or (iii)
dispute the claim for such indemnification. If the Indemnifying Person does
not notify the Indemnified Person within such 30-day period that it has cured
the Damages or that it disputes the claim for such indemnification, the
Indemnifying Person shall be conclusively deemed obligated to provide such
indemnification hereunder.

(a) Subject to _Section 12.3(i)_, (i) the representations and warranties of
the Parties in _Article 5_ , _Article 6_  and _Article 7_ and the

pursuant to this Agreement by the delivery of written notice to the other
Party with respect to such a representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement prior to its expiration date in this _Section 12.3(a)_.

(b) The indemnities in _Section 12.1(a)_ and  _Section 12.1(b)_ shall
terminate as of the termination date, if any, of each respective
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that is subject to
indemnification thereunder, except (i) there shall be no such termination
of any bona fide claim asserted by an Indemnified Person to the Indemnifying
Person in accordance with this Agreement by the delivery of written notice to
the other Party with respect to such a representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement prior to its expiration date in _Section 12.3(a)_ and (ii) if a
Party delivers written notice to the other Party of a bona fide claim for
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement prior to its
expiration date in  _Section 12.3(a)_, _Sections 12.1(a)_ and _(b)_ shall
survive with respect to such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

(when added to any other claim arising from the same or a related set of facts
or circumstances) that does not exceed $250,000 in Damages and (B) until and
unless the aggregate amount of the liability for all Damages for which Claim
Notices are delivered by Purchaser exceeds 1.5% of the Unadjusted Purchase
Price, and then only to the extent such Damages exceed 1.5% of the Unadjusted
Purchase Price, and (ii) subject to _Section 12.3(g)_, with respect to any
breach of the Special Warranty with respect to any Well or Lease, in an amount
in excess of the Allocated Values of the Wells and Leases as applicable, with
respect to which such breach occurs.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this
Agreement but subject to _Section 12.3(g)_ and  _Section 12.3(i)_, Seller
shall not be required to indemnify the Purchaser Group under _Section
12.1(b)(ii)_ for aggregate Damages in excess of ten percent (10%) of the

proceeds of any insurance policy issued or underwritten by 

 



-62-  the Indemnified Person or its Affiliates) and (ii) an amount equal to the
amount of any Tax benefit reasonably expected to be received by the

Damages from a Third Party after the Indemnifying Person has paid the
Indemnified Person under any indemnification provision of this _Article 12_
in respect of such Damages, the Indemnified Person must notify the
Indemnifying Person and pay to the Indemnifying Person such payment (but only
to the extent that such payment is for the same Damages that have been paid to

received by such Indemnified Person, and such Damages shall not apply to the
limitation in  _Section 12.3(c)(ii)_ or _12.3(d)_ , as applicable.

TRANSACTION DOCUMENT OR (B) ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM ANY WILLFUL MISCONDUCT,
INTENTIONAL BREACH OR INTENTIONAL FRAUD, NONE OF PURCHASER, SELLER OR ANY OF
THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES SHALL BE ENTITLED TO CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL,
PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND THE

REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW TO BE EFFECTIVE, THE PROVISIONS IN THIS AGREEMENT
IN BOLD-TYPE FONT ARE "CONSPICUOUS" FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANY APPLICABLE LAW.

 

Section 14.13 _Time of Essence_. This Agreement contains a number of dates and
times by which performance or the exercise of rights is due, and the Parties
intend that each and every such date and time be the firm and final date and
time, as agreed. For this reason, each Party hereby waives and relinquishes
any right it might otherwise have to challenge its failure to meet
any performance or rights election date applicable to it on the basis that
its late action constitutes substantial performance, to require the other
Party to show prejudice, or on any equitable grounds. Without limiting the
foregoing, time is of the essence in this Agreement. The foregoing in this
_Section 14.13_ shall not apply to the obligations in the second sentence of
_Section 4.2(a)_. If the date specified in this Agreement for giving any
notice or as a deadline for taking any action is not a Business Day

day that is a Business Day.

Section 14.14 _Severability_. The invalidity or unenforceability of any term
or provision of this Agreement in any situation or jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other terms or provisions hereof
or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any
other situation or in any other jurisdiction and the remaining terms and
provisions shall remain in full force and effect, unless doing so would result
in an interpretation of this Agreement that is manifestly unjust.

contingent upon WPXs execution and delivery of this Agreement solely for

deliver this Agreement solely for purposes of this _Section 14.15_ and to

its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws relating to or
affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally, (iv) none of the
execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by WPX violates any Law,
governing document of WPX or material contract of WPX or requires any Required
Consent that has not been obtained by WPX, and (v) no pending or, to the
knowledge of WPX, threatened action, suit or proceeding against WPX exists
that, if determined adversely to WPX, would materially adversely affect WPXs
ability to perform under this _Section 14.15_;

 

(d) no obligation of WPX under, or enforceability of, this _Section 14.15_
shall be affected by, and WPX hereby waives and shall not assert any defense
based upon, any of the following: (i) any compromise, settlement, release,
amendment, termination or enforcement of any Obligation, (ii) any extension of
time for, or waiver of, any payment or performance of any Obligation, (iii)
any exercise of, or failure to exercise, any right, power or remedy, (iv) any

being sought by Purchaser does not constitute an Obligation or of the prior
payment or performance by Seller of any Obligation, in each case, in
accordance with this Agreement or any Transaction Document, as applicable

reorganization, administration, dissolution, liquidation, winding up
or similar financial disability of Seller, (B) based on any nonbinding effect
or unenforceability of this Agreement or any Transaction Document, (C) based
on any legal limitation, disability, incapacity, lack of authority or other
similar circumstances relating to Sellers execution, delivery or performance
of this Agreement or any Transaction Document or (D) based on payment or
performance of any Obligation that has been rescinded, restored or returned,
whether upon the bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, dissolution or
liquidation of Seller, WPX or any of their respective Affiliates or
otherwise); and

 

(e) agrees that _Sections 8.8_ , _12.3(a)_ (second sentence only), _14.1-14.7_
