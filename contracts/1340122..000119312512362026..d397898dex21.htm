report (the "Field Inspector Report") to Buyer and Seller within five (5)

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (or if such firm is unwilling or unable to serve,
another nationally recognizable accounting firm mutually agreed upon by the
Parties) (the "Accounting Referee") to resolve the dispute in accordance with
the procedures set forth in Section 2.8.

discuss the same with the Accounting Referee, (iii) the Accounting Referees
determination or computation of the applicable final amount or value shall be
binding and conclusive on the Parties and will be deemed to be final
(provided that with respect to each item in dispute, the Accounting Referees
determination or computation of the applicable final amount or value shall be
within the bounds of the applicable amount or value submitted by Buyer, on
the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, with respect to such item) and
judgment thereupon may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the
Party against which the same is sought to be enforced, (iv) the Parties
shall instruct the Accounting Referee to render its determination or
computation within thirty (30) Business Days of the submission of such dispute
to the Accounting Referee, and (v) the fees and expenses of the Accounting
Referee for such determination will be borne by Buyer, on the one hand, and
Seller, on the other hand, in the same proportion that the dollar amount of
disputed items lost by Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand,
bears to the total dollar amount in dispute that is resolved by the
Accounting Referee.

---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) | any Person regarding the occurrence or non-occurrence of any

provisions of this Article 12, Seller hereby indemnifies Buyer and its
Affiliates, and its and their respective successors and assigns, and each of
their respective directors, officers and attorneys (or Persons in a similar
capacity) and employees (each, a "Buyer Indemnified Party") against, and
agrees to defend and hold each of them harmless from, any and all damages,
penalties, fines, costs, losses and expenses (including reasonable legal fees
and expenses in connection with any action, suit or proceeding, including
amounts paid in settlement) ("Damages") imposed upon or actually incurred or
suffered by any Buyer Indemnified Party to the extent such Damages are in

capacity) and employees (each, a "Seller Indemnified Party") against, and
agrees to defend and hold each of them harmless from, any and all Damages
imposed upon or actually incurred or suffered by any Seller Indemnified Party
to the extent such Damages are in connection with, resulting from or arising
out of: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | any Warranty Breach by Buyer or a breach by Buyer of the
covenants contained in Sections 8.1, 8.2 or 8.5 of this Agreement; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | the Assets, the Real Property or the Business; or

---|---|--- 
 



44 ---|--- 



     | (a) | The Party seeking indemnification under this Article 12 (or
any other provision of this Agreement that expressly provides for
indemnification) (the "Indemnified Party") agrees to give prompt notice in
writing to the Party against whom indemnity is to be sought (the "Indemnifying
Party") of the assertion of any claim or the commencement of any suit, action
or proceeding by any third party ("Third Party Claim") in respect of which
indemnity may be sought under this Article or such other provision of this
Agreement. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such Third Party
Claim, including the amount thereof (estimated, if necessary, and if then
estimable), and the basis for indemnification (taking into account the
information then available to the Indemnified Party). The failure to so notify
the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have actually
prejudiced the Indemnifying Party. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in
the defense of any Third Party Claim and, subject to the limitations set forth
in this Section 12.3, shall be entitled to control and appoint lead counsel

defense of any Third Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 12.3, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld)
before entering into any settlement of such Third Party Claim, if the
settlement does not expressly unconditionally release the Indemnified Party
and its Affiliates from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such
Third Party Claim or the settlement imposes injunctive or other equitable
relief against the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (ii)
the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any
Third Party Claim and to employ separate counsel of its choice for such
purpose and (iii) the Indemnified Party shall not enter into any settlement of

Party. The fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the
Indemnified Party. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | In connection with the defense or prosecution of any Third
Party Claim, each Party shall (i) cooperate, and cause its respective

therewith, and (iii) take all reasonable steps to make available to the other
Party, upon written request, its former and current employees, other
personnel and agents (whether as witnesses or otherwise) to the extent that
such persons may reasonably be required in connection therewith. Neither
Seller nor Buyer will (and each of Seller and Buyer shall cause its respective
Affiliates not to) destroy or dispose of any documents, records or
information related to the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim
without first using its reasonable best efforts to notify the other Party of
the proposed destruction or disposition and giving the other Party the
opportunity to take possession of or copy such documents, records or
information prior to such destruction or disposition. 
---|---|--- 
 



45 ---|--- 



     | (a) | Effective at and after the Closing and subject to the other
provisions of this Article 12, (except Section 12.3), Seller hereby
indemnifies Buyer and its Affiliates, and their respective successors and
assigns, against, and agrees to defend and hold each of them harmless for any
and all damages, penalties, fines, costs, losses and expenses (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses in connection with any action, suit or
proceeding, including amounts paid in settlement) imposed upon or actually
incurred or suffered by Buyer or its Affiliates, including the Combined
Companies, to the extent such amounts are in connection with, resulting
from or arising out of any: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | income Taxes imposed exclusively on Seller (including Taxes
imposed on the sale of Shares pursuant to this Agreement); 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | liability of any of the Combined Companies for unpaid Taxes
of any Person under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local, or foreign law) for any Tax Period ending on or
before the Closing Date; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period to the extent that
Taxes for such Pre-Closing Tax Period have not been paid by such Combined

provisions of this Article 12, Buyer hereby indemnifies Seller and its
Affiliates, and their respective successors and assigns, against, and agrees
to defend and hold each of them harmless for any and all damages, penalties,
fines, costs, losses and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and
expenses in connection with any action, suit or proceeding, including amounts
paid in settlement) imposed upon or actually incurred or suffered by Seller or
its Affiliates to the extent such amounts are in connection with, resulting
from or arising out of any: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | Taxes not attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | Taxes arising on the Closing Date but after the Closing
that arose as a result of actions of Buyer or its Affiliates, including the
Combined Companies, other than in the Ordinary Course of Business; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | Transfer Taxes exceeding the 50% thereof for which Seller
is responsible pursuant to Section 10.2(d). 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | Buyer and Seller agree that any payments made pursuant to
this Section 12.4 shall be treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price unless otherwise required by Applicable Law. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) |

For purposes of this Section 12.4, the amount of Taxes for a Straddle Period
that are allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period that is included in
a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined as follows: (y) in the case of
real property Taxes, personal property Taxes and similar ad valorem Taxes and
Taxes on capital, the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle
Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number 

---|---|--- 
 



46  of calendar days of such Straddle Period in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and
the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle
Period, and (z) in the case of all other Taxes, determined as though the
taxable year of the relevant Combined Company terminated at the close of
business on the Closing Date except that deductions for depreciation and
comparable Tax items for the Straddle Period shall be allocated to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period on a per diem basis.



   12.5 | Direct Claim Procedures 
---|--- 

In the event an Indemnified Party has a claim for indemnity under this
Article 12 (or any other provision of this Agreement that expressly provides
for indemnification) against an Indemnifying Party that does not involve a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party agrees to give prompt notice in
writing of such claim to the Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall set forth
in reasonable detail such claim, including the amount thereof (estimated, if
necessary, and if then estimable), and the basis for indemnification (taking
into account the information then available to the Indemnified Party). The
failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall
have actually prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.



   12.6 | Calculation of Damages 
---|--- 



     | (a) | The amount of any Damages payable under this Article 12 (or
any other provision of this Agreement that expressly provides for
indemnification) by the Indemnifying Party shall be net of any amounts
recovered or recoverable by the Indemnified Party under applicable insurance
policies, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible therefor and the
present value of any Tax benefit realized by the Indemnified Party arising
from the incurrence or payment of any such Damages. The present value of any
such Tax benefit shall be computed (x) using a discount rate equal to the mid-
term applicable federal rate in effect at the time the relevant payment is
made, (y) assuming that the Tax benefit will be used at the earliest date or
dates allowable by Applicable Law and (z) using the maximum federal or state,
as the case may be, corporate Tax rate in effect at the time the relevant
payment is made. If the Indemnified Party receives any amounts under
applicable insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged to be
responsible for any Damages, subsequent to an indemnification payment by the
Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the
Indemnifying Party for any payment made or expense incurred by such
Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such indemnification payment
up to the amount received by the Indemnified Party.  
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under this Agreement for any (i)
Damages relating to any matter to the extent that the Indemnified Party had
been compensated for such matter pursuant to the adjustments under Sections
2.4 or 2.7, (ii) consequential, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary or
punitive Damages or (iii) Damages for lost profits or opportunities. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Each Indemnified Party must use its respective commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate any loss for which such Indemnified Party seeks
indemnification under this Agreement. If such Indemnified Party mitigates its
loss after the Indemnifying Party has paid the Indemnified Party under any
indemnification provision of this Agreement in respect of that loss, the
Indemnified Party must notify the Indemnifying Party and pay to the
Indemnifying Party the extent of the value of the benefit to the Indemnified
Party of that mitigation within five (5) Business Days after the benefit is
received. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) | Each Indemnified Party shall use its respective commercially
reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available under insurance coverage,
or from any other Person potentially responsible, for any Damages payable
under this Article 12 (or any other provision of this Agreement that expressly
provides for indemnification). 
---|---|--- 
 



47 ---|--- 

If the Indemnified Party receives any payment from an Indemnifying Party in
respect of any Damages pursuant to Section 12.2 and the Indemnified Party
potentially could have recovered all or a part of such Damages from a third
party (a "Potential Contributor"), the Indemnified Party shall assign such of
its rights to proceed against the Potential Contributor as are necessary to
permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from the Potential Contributor the
amount of such payment. 



   12.8 | Exclusivity 
---|--- 

Except as specifically set forth in this Agreement, effective as of the
Closing, Buyer (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) waives any rights and
claims Buyer and its Affiliates may have against Seller or any of its
Affiliates or their respective officers, directors or employees, whether in
law or in equity, relating to the Business, the Shares, the Assets or the
transactions contemplated hereby. The rights and claims waived by Buyer
include claims for contribution or other rights of recovery arising out of
or relating to any Environmental Law (whether now or hereinafter in effect),
claims for breach of contract, breach of representation or warranty, negligent
misrepresentation and all other claims for breach of duty. After the Closing,
this Article 12 will provide the exclusive remedy for any misrepresentation
or breach of warranty or any breach of any covenant contained in Sections 7.1
or 7.2. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, nothing in
this Agreement or any documents or certificates delivered in connection with
this Agreement shall limit any liability for Fraud and the limitations on
liability set forth in Section 12.1 and Section 12.2 shall not apply to
liabilities for Fraud.

 

ARTICLE 13

     | (a) | by mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer; 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | by either Seller or Buyer if the Closing shall not have been
consummated on or before the six month anniversary of the date of this
Agreement; _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 13.1(b) shall not be available to any Party whose breach of any
provision of this Agreement results in the failure of the Closing to be
consummated by such date;  
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | by either Seller or Buyer if consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby would violate any non-appealable final order,
decree or judgment of any Governmental Authority having competent
jurisdiction; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | by either Party if (i) there has been a violation or breach
by the other Party of any covenant, representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement (which has not been waived in writing by the non-breaching
Party), (ii) such violation or breach is not capable of being cured by the
date set forth in Section 13.1(b) or, after receipt by the breaching Party of
a written notice of such violation or breach by the non-breaching Party, the
breaching Party does not use commercially reasonable efforts to cure such
violation or breach as promptly as reasonably practicable and (iii) such
violation or breach would result in a failure of the conditions set forth in
Article 11 being satisfied (other than conditions that by their nature are to
be (and will be) satisfied or waived at Closing). 
---|---|--- 

The Party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 13.1(b) or
Section 13.1(c) shall give written notice of such termination to the other
Party.

 



48 ---|--- 

If this Agreement is terminated as permitted by Section 13.1, such
termination shall be without liability of either Party (or any shareholder,
director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or representative of such
Party) to the other Party to this Agreement;  _provided_ that if such
termination shall result from the willful and knowing (i) failure of either
Party to fulfill a condition to the performance of the obligations of the
other Party, (ii) failure to perform a covenant of this Agreement or (iii)
breach by either Party hereto of any representation or warranty or agreement
contained herein, such Party shall be fully liable for any and all Damages
incurred or suffered by the other Party as a result of such failure
or breach. The provisions of Sections 14.2, 14.3, 14.4, 14.5, 14.6, 14.7 and
14.9 shall survive any termination hereof pursuant to Section 13.1.

arisen from a transaction of business in the State of Delaware, and each of
the Parties hereby irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit,
action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the
venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any
such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in
an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any Party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party

   14.10 | Severability 
---|---

a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority to be
invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such a
determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated

misrepresentation or breach of warranty for purposes of this Agreement,
including for purposes of determining whether the conditions set forth in
Article 11 have been satisfied at Closing or for purposes of Buyers right to
indemnification as provided in Article 12 and (ii) to the extent relating
to any matter of which Seller has become aware after the Effective Date,
