(c) If (i) Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(i) or
Section 9.1(c)(ii), (ii) Buyer has knowingly taken any action or knowingly

which are to be performed or observed at or prior to the Closing (including
Buyers failure to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2) and (iii) as of

(a) No later than three (3) days prior to the Closing, Seller shall prepare
and deliver to Buyer a preliminary settlement statement prepared by Seller in

(GAAP) (the " _Preliminary Settlement Statement_ "), which sets forth Sellers
good faith estimate of the Operating Balance and Sellers good faith
calculation of the Closing Payment.

(b) As soon as practicable but no later than the date that is the later of
(i) 90 days after the Closing or (ii) two business days after the final
resolution of all disputed Defects and Title Benefits in accordance with

the same form of and on the same basis as the Preliminary Settlement

payment that was not finally determined on the Preliminary Settlement
Statement. Each Party shall, during normal business hours, grant and provide
the other Party access to the Purchased Records in the possession or control
of such Party for the purposes of conducting an audit of the information set
forth in the Proposed Final Settlement Statement.

(c) Within 30 days following receipt by Buyer of the Proposed Final
Settlement Statement, Buyer shall, if applicable, provide Seller with a
written objection (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") detailing Buyers
objections, if any, to Sellers calculation of the final Purchase Price. To
the extent such written notice is not delivered by Buyer within such time
period, Sellers calculation of the final Purchase Price, and each component
thereof, shall become final and binding upon the Parties. 

(d) Any disagreement between Buyer and Seller regarding Sellers calculation
of the final Purchase Price that cannot be resolved within 30 days after the
date of the Notice of Disagreement shall be resolved by the Audit Firm, who
shall calculate the final Purchase Price in a manner consistent with the
Preliminary Settlement Statement and this Agreement in all respects. Seller
and Buyer shall each have an opportunity to present its position to the Audit
Firm and shall cooperate with the Audit Firm in making available to it any
records or work papers requested by the Audit Firm. The determination of
the Audit Firm shall be expressly limited to the determination of the final
Purchase Price, and the Audit Firm will not render any decision or have any
authority to render a decision with respect to any other matter relating to
this Agreement, including with respect to any alleged breach of a
representation, warranty or covenant by any Party. In making such
determination, the Audit Firm shall consider only those items and amounts in
the Proposed Final Settlement Statement with which Buyer has disagreed

 



12  and which are set forth in the Notice of Disagreement. In no event shall the
final Purchase Price as determined by the Audit Firm be more favorable to
Seller than reflected on the Proposed Final Settlement Statement by Seller
nor more favorable to Buyer than shown in the proposed changes set forth in
the Notice of Disagreement. Subject to the provisions set forth in this
Section 3.4(d), the decision of the Audit Firm shall be set forth in writing
and shall be conclusive and binding on the Parties and subject to judicial
enforcement. The fees charged by the Audit Firm shall be borne 50% by Buyer
and 50% by Seller, and each Party shall bear all of its own costs and
expenses associated with the submission of any disputed matters to the Audit
Firm.

(e) If the final Purchase Price, as determined pursuant to this Section 3.4,
exceeds the sum of (i) the Closing Payment plus (ii) the Deposit, then Buyer
shall pay to Seller the amount of such excess. If the final Purchase Price, as
determined pursuant to this Section 3.4, is less than the sum of (A) the
Closing Payment plus (B) the Deposit, then Seller shall pay to Buyer the
amount of such deficiency. Any payment shall be made within three days after
the date the final Purchase Price is deemed to be finally determined pursuant
to this Section 3.4 via wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account(s) designated in writing by the Party entitled to such payment.

3.5 _Closing Payment_. At the Closing, Buyer shall pay to Seller the Closing
Payment by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account set
forth on _Schedule 3.5_.

 

3.6 _Proceeds Received Post-Closing_.

(a) After the Closing, if Buyer or any of its Affiliates receives any proceeds
(including any Tax refunds) attributable to the ownership, use or operation of
the Purchased Assets for periods prior to the Effective Time, then Seller
shall be entitled to all such proceeds, and Buyer shall promptly remit to
Seller all such proceeds.

 

(b) After the Closing, if Seller or any of its Affiliates receives any
proceeds attributable to the ownership, use or operation of the Purchased
Assets for periods on or after the Effective Time, then Buyer shall be

have a Material Adverse Effect on Buyer.

(d) _Approvals and Consents_. No notice to, consent, approval, order or
authorization of, registration, declaration or filing with, or permit from,
any Governmental Authority or other Third Party is required by or with respect
to Buyer in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement
by Buyer or the consummation by Buyer of the transactions contemplated
hereby, except for the Customary Post-Closing Consents.

 

(e) _Proceedings; Orders_. There are no Proceedings pending or, to Buyers
Knowledge, threatened against Buyer that would prohibit, restrict or delay in

transactions contemplated hereby.

 



18 (f) _Brokerage_. Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates has made any
agreement or taken any other action which might cause any Person to become

of Sellers Affiliates shall directly or indirectly have any responsibility,
liability or expense as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(g) _Funding_. Buyer has available adequate funds or the means to obtain

ARTICLE 5

 

TITLE AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

5.1 _Title and Environmental Adjustments_.

(a) Buyer shall notify Seller in writing (each a " _Defect Notice_ ") of any
claimed Title Defect or Adverse Environmental Condition promptly upon Buyers
discovery thereof and in no event later than 5:00 p.m., Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania time, on July 27, 2012 (the " _Notice Deadline_ "). The Defect
Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail (i) the Purchased Asset with
respect to which a claimed Defect is made, (ii) the nature of such claimed
Defect and (iii) Buyers good faith calculation of the Defect Value thereof
in accordance with the guidelines set forth in Section 5.3. Each Defect Notice
shall be accompanied by supporting documents reasonably necessary for Seller
(or any title attorney or examiner hired by Seller) to verify or investigate
the existence of the alleged Defect(s). Any Defect that is not identified in a
Defect Notice by the Notice Deadline shall thereafter be forever waived and
expressly assumed by Buyer and shall be deemed to have become a Permitted
Lien and an Assumed Liability.

(b) As soon as practicable after Buyer has knowledge thereof, Buyer shall
notify Seller in writing of any Title Benefit. Seller may request an increase
of the Base Purchase Price by notifying Buyer of such Title Benefit on or
before the Notice Deadline (a " _Title Benefit Notice_ "). The Title
Benefit Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail (i) the Purchased Asset
with respect to which a claimed Title Benefit is made, (ii) the nature of such
claimed Title

 



19  Benefit and (iii) Buyers good faith calculation of the Benefit Value
thereof in accordance with the guidelines set forth in Section 5.3. Each Title
Benefit Notice shall be accompanied by supporting documents reasonably
necessary for Seller (or any title attorney or examiner hired by Seller) to
verify or investigate the existence of the alleged Title Benefit(s). Any Title
Benefit that is not identified in a Title Benefit Notice by the Notice
Deadline shall thereafter be forever waived.

5.2 _Determination of Defects, Benefits and Values_. Within three days after
a Partys receipt of any Defect Notice or Title Benefit Notice, such Party
shall notify the delivering Party whether such receiving Party agrees with any
claimed Defects or Title Benefits contained therein and the proposed Defect
Values or Benefit Values therefor, as applicable. If the receiving Party does
not agree with any claimed Defect or Title Benefit or the proposed Defect
Value or Benefit Value therefor, as applicable, then the Parties shall enter
into good faith negotiations and shall attempt to agree on such matters. If
the Parties cannot reach agreement prior to the Closing concerning either the
existence of a Defect or Title Benefit or a Defect Value or Benefit Value
regarding any Purchased Asset, then, upon any Partys written request, the
Parties shall retain the applicable Consultant to resolve all points of
disagreement relating to Defects, Title Benefits, Defect Values and Benefit
Values. If necessary, the Closing shall be deferred only as to those
Purchased Assets (or interests therein) with respect to which the existence or
value of a Defect (but not a Title Benefit) is an issue until the Consultant
has made a determination of the disputed issues with respect thereto. All
Purchased Assets (or interests therein) as to which no such dispute(s) exist
at the Closing shall be conveyed to Buyer subject to the terms of this
Agreement at the Closing. The Consultants determination shall be made within
30 days after submission of the matters in dispute and such determination by
the Consultant shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties and shall
be enforceable against any Party in any court of competent jurisdiction. Once
the Consultants determination has been expressed to the Parties, (i) with
respect to Defects and Defect Values for Adverse Environmental Conditions,
Seller shall have five days in which to advise Buyer in writing which of the
options available to Seller under Section 5.4(c) Seller elects regarding each
of the Purchased Assets as to which the Consultant has made a determination,
(ii) to the extent that Seller has not elected to exclude such Purchased
Assets (or interests therein) under Section 5.4(c)(ii), Seller and Buyer
shall effect a Closing pursuant to Article 7 (and the other terms and
conditions herein) with respect to, and Seller shall transfer to Buyer, the
Purchased Assets (or interests therein) subject to such Defects, and (A)
Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the aggregate Allocated Values of
such Purchased Assets (minus any Defect Values attributable thereto) or (B) to
the extent that any such Defect Values with respect to Adverse Environmental
Conditions exceed the Allocated Values of the applicable Purchased Assets
burdened thereby, Seller shall promptly pay to Buyer an amount equal to such
excess and (iii) with respect to Title Benefits and Benefit Values, Buyer
shall promptly pay to Seller the aggregate Benefit Values determined by the
Consultant, if any. In making its determination, the Consultant shall be bound
by the rules set forth in this Article 5\. The Consultant shall act as an
expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed Defect,
Title Benefit, Defect Value or Benefit Value submitted by any Party and may
not award damages, interest or penalties to any Party with respect to any
matter. The fees charged by the Consultant shall be borne 50% by Buyer and
50% by Seller, and each Party shall bear all of its own costs and expenses
associated with the submission of any disputed matters to the Consultant.

 



20 5.3 _Calculation of Defect Value_.

 

(a) _Different Interests_. If a Title Defect or Title Benefit represents a
discrepancy between (i) the Net Revenue Interest or Working Interest for any
Purchased Well and (ii) the Net Revenue Interest or Working Interest set forth
in _Exhibit A-2_ for such Purchased Well, then the Defect Value or the
Benefit Value thereof shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such
Purchased Well, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net
Revenue Interest or Working Interest decrease or increase, as applicable, and
the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest or Working Interest
set forth in _Exhibit A-2_ for such Purchased Well; _provided, however,_
that if the Title Defect or Title Benefit does not affect the Purchased Well
throughout its entire productive life, the Defect Value or the Benefit Value
determined pursuant to this Section 5.3(a) shall be reduced to take into
account such applicable time period only.

(b)  _Liens_. If a Title Defect is a Lien upon a Purchased Asset which is
liquidated in amount, then the Defect Value thereof shall be the sum necessary
to be paid to the obligee to remove the Lien from such Purchased Asset. If a
Title Defect is a Lien upon a Purchased Asset which is not liquidated in
amount but can be estimated with reasonable certainty, then the Defect Value
thereof shall be the sum necessary to compensate Buyer for the adverse
economic effect on such Purchased Asset. 

(c) _Adverse Environmental Conditions_. If a Defect is an Adverse
Environmental Condition, then the Defect Value thereof shall be the costs and
expenses reasonably necessary to remediate such Adverse Environmental
Condition.

(d) _Other Defects_. If the Defect is of a type not described in Sections
5.3(a) through (c), then the Defect Value thereof shall be determined by
taking into account the Allocated Value of the Purchased Asset so affected,
the portion of Sellers interest in the Purchased Asset affected by the
Defect, the legal effect of the Defect, the potential economic effect of the
Defect over the life of the affected Purchased Asset, the values placed upon
the Defect by Seller and Buyer and such other factors as are necessary to
make a proper evaluation.

(e) _No Duplication_. The Defect Value with respect to any Defect shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Defect Value hereunder, or for which Buyer otherwise receives credit in the
calculation of any Defect Value with respect to any Defect.

 

5.4 _Remedies for Defects_.

(a) _Seller s Right to Cure or Remediate_. Seller shall have the right, but
not the obligation, to cure or remediate at or prior to the Closing any Defect
accepted by Seller or determined to be a Defect pursuant to Section 5.2. If a
Defect to be cured or remediated is not cured or remediated prior to the
originally scheduled Closing Date, then Seller may elect to extend the Closing
Date for the Purchased Assets (or interests therein) affected by such Defect
up to 60 days and complete the cure or remediation. If Seller elects to extend
the Closing Date for the Purchased Assets (or interests therein) affected by a
Defect, it shall give Buyer written notice of such election at least two days
prior to the originally scheduled Closing Date and

 



21  provide a new date for the Closing Date for such Purchased Assets (or
interests therein), in which event (i) the Base Purchase Price for the
originally scheduled Closing shall be reduced by the aggregate Allocated
Values of all such Purchased Assets for which a new Closing Date has been
established and (ii) the Base Purchase Price for the new Closing shall be the
aggregate Allocated Values of all such Purchased Assets. All Purchased Assets
(or interests therein) as to which no such election has been made shall be
conveyed to Buyer subject to the terms of this Agreement on the originally
scheduled Closing Date. With respect to any Defect that Seller elects not to
cure or remediate or that Seller fails to cure or remediate at or prior to
the Closing, the provisions of Section 5.4(b) or Section 5.4(c) shall apply.

(b) _Title Defects_. In the event of a Title Defect, Seller shall include the
Purchased Asset (or interest therein) affected by such Title Defect in this
Agreement and not cure such Title Defect, in which event (i) the Base
Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Defect Value related to such Title
Defect and (ii) Seller shall have no other or further obligation or liability
in respect of such Title Defect.

 

(c) _Adverse Environmental Conditions_. In the event of an Adverse
Environmental Condition, Seller shall have the option, exercisable in writing
delivered to Buyer, to:

(i) include the Purchased Asset (or interest therein) affected by
such Adverse Environmental Condition in this Agreement and not remediate such
Adverse Environmental Condition, in which event (A) the Base Purchase Price
shall be reduced by the Defect Value related to such Adverse Environmental
Condition and (B) subject to Section 5.2(ii)(B), Seller shall have no other
or further obligation or liability in respect of such Adverse Environmental
Condition; or

(ii) upon obtaining Buyers written consent, exclude from this Agreement the
Purchased Asset (or interest therein) affected by such Adverse Environmental
Condition and all other Purchased Assets as may be reasonably necessary to
effect the exclusion of the affected Purchased Asset due to any uniformity of
interest provisions, unit agreements or other contractual or operational
restrictions on the transfer of such affected Purchased Asset, in which event
the Base Purchase Price shall be reduced by the aggregate Allocated Values of
all such excluded Purchased Assets.

Each election under this Section 5.4(c) shall be made by Seller no later than
the Closing Date (either the originally scheduled Closing Date or the new
Closing Date elected pursuant to Section 5.4(a)). Any failure by Seller to
validly make such election shall be deemed hereunder to be an election by
Seller of the option set forth in Section 5.4(c)(i) above.

(d) _Effect of Remedies_. (i) Any adjustments to the Base Purchase Price
pursuant to Section 5.4(b) or Section 5.4(c) shall be taken into account in
determining the Closing Payment and (ii) any Purchased Assets (or interests
therein) excluded from this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Section
5.4(b)(ii) or Section 5.4(c)(ii) shall be excluded from the Closing and deemed
deleted from the exhibits and schedules hereto.

 



22 (e) _Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: (i) Buyer
may not assert any Defect after the Notice Deadline; (ii) in no event shall
the Defect Value for any Title Defect exceed the Allocated Value of the
affected Purchased Asset (it being understood by the Parties that the Defect
Value of any Adverse Environmental Condition shall not be limited under this
Section 5.4(e)(ii) unless Buyer has not consented to Sellers exclusion of the
affected Purchased Asset pursuant to Section 5.4(c)(ii), in which event the
Defect Value of such Adverse Environmental Conditions shall not exceed the
Allocated Value of the affected Purchased Asset); (iii) no reduction of the
Base Purchase Price shall be made for Defects unless and until the aggregate
uncured Defect Values exceed the Defect Threshold, and only then to the
extent of the excess over the Defect Threshold; (iv) no increase of the Base
Purchase Price shall be made for Title Benefits unless and until the aggregate
Benefit Values exceed the Defect Threshold, and only then to the extent of
the excess over the Defect Threshold; and (iv) this Article 5 sets forth
Buyers sole remedies for all Defects (other than any claim or liability
arising out of or attributable to any breach or failure of Sellers special
warranty of title set forth in any Deed or Assignment).

5.5 _Consents_.

 

(a) After the date hereof and prior to the Closing, Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the written consent from any Third
Party with respect to any Transferred Contract that is required to permit the
sale, transfer and assignment of such Transferred Contract pursuant to the
terms and conditions thereof (collectively, the " _Required Consents_
"). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither Party
shall be obligated to make any payments to any Third Party holder of any
Required Consent or incur any other material burden in order to comply with
the requirements set forth in this Section 5.5 and the failure to obtain any
such Required Consent shall not be deemed a breach of any covenant or
condition of any Party hereunder.

(b) If there are any Required Consents that have not been obtained as of the
Closing, then the provisions of Section 5.5(b)(i) and Section 5.5(b)(ii) shall
apply.

 

(i) The Transferred Contracts as to which any Required Consents were not
obtained shall be referred to herein, collectively, as the " _Restricted
Contracts_ " and all other Purchased Assets reasonably related to the
Restricted Contracts due to any uniformity of interest provisions, unit
agreements or other contractual or operational restrictions on the transfer
of the Restricted Contracts shall be referred to herein, collectively with
the Restricted Contracts, as the " _Restricted Assets_ ".

(ii) Each Restricted Asset (or interest therein) shall be excluded from the
Closing and (A) the Parties shall proceed to close the transaction in
accordance with Article 7 with a reduction of the Base Purchase Price by an
amount equal to the Allocated Value for such Restricted Asset and (B) Seller
shall retain such Restricted Asset. During the period from the Closing until
the day prior to final settlement required in accordance with Section 3.4
(the " _Post-Closing Period_ "), Seller and Buyer shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts (but without any obligation to pay any amounts to any Third
Party), and cooperate with each other, to obtain the Required Consent
relating to each Restricted Contract as quickly as practicable. In the event
that Seller obtains a Required Consent for a Restricted Contract prior to the
expiration of the Post-Closing Period, (A) Seller and Buyer shall effect a
Closing pursuant to Article 7 (and

 



23  the other terms and conditions herein) with respect to such Restricted
Contract, (B) Seller shall assign, transfer, convey and deliver to Buyer such
Restricted Contract (or interest therein) and all other Restricted Assets (or
interests therein) related to such Restricted Contract, and Buyer shall
expressly assume the obligations under such Restricted Contract and Restricted
Assets from and after the date of assignment to Buyer pursuant to an
assignment in substantially the form of the Assignments (which assignment the
Parties shall prepare, execute and deliver in good faith at the time of such
transfer) and (C) Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the
aggregate Allocated Values of such Restricted Contract and such other
Restricted Assets.

5.6 _Preferential Rights_.

 

(a) After the date hereof, Seller shall promptly notify all holders of
preferential rights to purchase all or any portion of the Purchased Assets ("
_Preferential Rights_ ") of their rights as result of this Agreement.

(b) In the event that any holder of Preferential Right exercises such
Preferential Right prior to the Closing, the Purchased Assets subject to such
Preferential Right (as well as all other Purchased Assets as may be reasonably
necessary to effect the exclusion of the affected Purchased Asset due to any
uniformity of interest provisions, unit agreements or other contractual or
operational restrictions on the transfer of such affected Purchased Asset)
shall be excluded and deleted from this Agreement, the Base Purchase Price
shall be reduced by an amount equal to the aggregate Allocated Values of such
affected Purchased Assets and, subject to Sections 7.2 and 7.3, the Closing
shall occur as to the remainder of the Purchased Assets (or
interests therein), if any.

(c) In the event that any holder of Preferential Right fails to exercise such
Preferential Right prior to the Closing and the time period for exercise or
waiver of such Preferential Right has not yet expired, the Purchased Assets
subject to such Preferential Right and all other Purchased Assets as may be
reasonably necessary to effect the exclusion of the affected Purchased Asset
due to any uniformity of interest provisions, unit agreements or other
contractual or operational restrictions on the transfer of such affected
Purchased Asset shall be retained by Seller and the Base Purchase Price shall
be reduced by an amount equal to the aggregate Allocated Values of such
Purchased Assets, and, subject to Sections 7.2 and 7.3, the Closing shall
occur as to the remainder of the Purchased Assets (or interests therein), if
any. 

(d) If, subsequent to the Closing, any Preferential Right is waived, or if the
time period otherwise set forth for exercising such Preferential Right
expires, in either case prior to the expiration of the Post-Closing Period,
Seller and Buyer shall effect a Closing pursuant to Article 7 (and the other
terms and conditions herein) with respect to, and Seller shall transfer to
Buyer, the Purchased Assets (or interests therein) subject to such
Preferential Right, and Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the
aggregate Allocated Values of such Purchased Assets.

 

5.7 _Casualty and Condemnation_. If, after the date of this Agreement but
prior to the Closing Date, any portion of the Purchased Assets is destroyed
by fire or other casualty or is expropriated or taken in condemnation or under
right of eminent domain (each a " _Casualty Event_ "), the Parties shall
nevertheless be required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In the event that the aggregate amount of costs and expenses
associated with

 



24  repairing, restoring or replacing all Purchased Assets affected by Casualty
Events exceeds $50,000, Seller must elect, by written notice to Buyer prior to
the Closing Date, either to (i) cause the Purchased Assets affected by the
Casualty Events to be repaired, restored or replaced, at Sellers sole cost,
as promptly as reasonably practicable (which work may extend after the Closing
Date upon Buyers approval of the method Seller intends to employ to repair,
restore or replace such Purchased Assets), (ii) indemnify Buyer, pursuant to
an agreement to be executed at the Closing reasonably acceptable to the
Parties, against any costs or expenses that Buyer reasonably incurs to
repair, restore or replace the Purchased Assets or (iii) treat the costs and
expenses associated with repairing, restoring or replacing the affected
Purchased Assets as Defects under this Article 5\. In each case, Seller shall
retain all rights to insurance and other claims against Third Parties with
respect to the Casualty Events, except to the extent the Parties otherwise
agree in writing.

 

5.8 _Termination as a Remedy_. In the event that the aggregate sum of (i) the
Defect Values attributable to uncured Defects related to the Purchased Assets
which were the subject of a Defect Notice delivered no later than the Notice
Deadline, _plus_ (ii) the Allocated Values of all Restricted Contracts as to
which any Required Consents are not obtained by the Closing and all other
Restricted Assets reasonably related to such Restricted Contracts, _plus_
(iii) the Allocated Values of all Purchased Assets for which applicable
Preferential Rights have been validly exercised on or before the Closing Date
_plus_ (iv) the aggregate amount of costs and expenses associated with
repairing, restoring or replacing the Purchased Assets affected by Casualty
Events, exceeds $15,000,000, then either Buyer or Seller may elect to
terminate this Agreement and upon such election, notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, no Party shall have any further liability or
obligation to the other hereunder, except that (A) Buyer and Seller will
jointly instruct the Bank to release the Deposit (plus any accrued interest)
to Buyer and (B) the indemnification obligations set forth in Section 6.2
shall survive such termination and be enforceable in accordance with the terms
hereof.

 

ARTICLE 6

 

COVENANTS

 

6.1 _General_. Each of Buyer and Seller shall use its reasonable efforts in
good faith to take all actions and to do all things necessary or advisable in
order to consummate and make effective the purchase and sale of the Purchased
Assets contemplated by this Agreement, including satisfaction of the closing
conditions set forth in Article 7\.

 

6.2 _Access_. From and after the date of this Agreement and until the Closing
Date, Seller shall permit Buyers officers, employees, agents and advisors,
at Buyers sole risk and expense, to (i) have reasonable access to the
Purchased Assets (so long as such access occurs during normal business hours
or at mutually agreeable times and does not unreasonably interfere with the
operation of the Purchased Assets) to observe the condition, use and operation
of the Purchased Assets and to facilitate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (ii) otherwise perform due diligence activities, including
title searches and physical and environmental investigations and inspections
of the Purchased Assets to the extent reasonably necessary to conduct and
prepare a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment in accordance with the
American Society for Testing and Materials (A.S.T.M.) Standard Practice
Environmental Site Assessments: Phase I Environmental Site Assessment Process
(Publication Designation:

 



25  E1527-05) covering such Purchased Assets (" _Phase I_"); _provided,
however,_ that Buyer shall not conduct any other physical environmental
examination (including, but not limited to a Phase II Environmental Site
Assessment in accordance with the American Society for Testing and Materials
(A.S.T.M.) Standard Practice Environmental Site Assessments: Phase II
Environmental Site Assessment Process (Publication Designation: E1903-97) ("
_Phase II_")) or any other soil or water tests or borings or other invasive
tests or examinations with respect to the Purchased Assets without the prior
written consent of Seller. In the event that Seller withholds consent for
Buyer to conduct any requested Phase II or additional environmental
investigation of any Purchased Asset that a Phase I indicates the need
thereof, such Purchased Asset (or interest therein) shall be excluded from
the transactions contemplated under this Agreement and (i) the Base Purchase
Price shall be adjusted downward by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of
such excluded Purchased Asset in accordance with the terms of Section
5.4(c)(ii), and (ii) such excluded Purchased Asset (or interest therein)
shall be deemed to be deleted from the exhibits and schedules hereto. Buyer
agrees to maintain the confidentiality of all information acquired by Buyer
pursuant to this Section 6.2 in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement. Buyer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Damages arising
out of or relating to access to the Purchased Assets prior to the Closing by
Buyer, even if caused in whole or in part by the negligence (whether sole,
joint or concurrent), strict liability or other legal fault of any Seller
Indemnified Parties (but excluding gross negligence or willful misconduct on
the part of any Seller Indemnified Parties).

6.3 _Conduct of Seller s Business_. From and after the date of
this Agreement and until the Closing Date, Seller agrees that:

(a) Seller shall maintain, operate and administer the Purchased Assets
utilizing prudent oilfield practices, in the ordinary course of business and
consistent with past practice and in compliance with all applicable Laws and
Regulations;

(b) Seller shall:

(i) not, except as set forth on _Schedule 4.1(m)_, agree to, approve or
incur any authorizations for expenditure, cost or other obligation for
commitments with respect to any individual Purchased Well or Purchased Lease
in excess of $25,000.

 

(ii) not sell, assign, transfer or lease or agree to sell, assign, transfer,

(vii) use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain in full force and effect
all Purchased Leases associated with Purchased Wells that are capable of
producing in paying quantities; and

(viii) maintain all Purchased Permits.

Buyers approval of any action restricted by this Section 6.3 shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed and shall be considered granted 10 days
(unless a shorter time is reasonably required by the circumstances and such
shorter time is specified in Sellers notice) of Sellers notice to Buyer
requesting such consent unless Buyer notifies Seller to the contrary during
that period. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.3, in
the event of an emergency, Seller may take such action as reasonably necessary
and shall notify Buyer of such action promptly thereafter.

 

6.4 _Taxes_. Buyer shall pay all sales, use, gross receipts, transfer, real
property transfer, documentary stamp, recording and other similar Taxes
arising from and with respect to the purchase and sale of the Purchased
Assets. All ad valorem real property Taxes, personal property Taxes, fees or
assessments attributable to the Purchased Assets shall be included
and apportioned as provided in the definition of "Operating Balance." Each
Party shall be responsible for its own income Taxes, if any, which may result
from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

6.5 _Transaction Expenses_. Except as expressly provided otherwise herein,
each Party shall pay its own expenses and the fees and expenses of its
counsel, accountants, consultants and other experts and representatives
incurred in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

6.6 _Maintenance of Books and Records_.

 

(a) At the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer the Purchased Records.

 

(b) Buyer and Seller shall cooperate fully with one another after the Closing
so that (subject to any limitations that are reasonably required to preserve
any applicable attorney-client or other legal privilege) each Party has access
to the business records, contracts and other information existing at the
Closing Date and relating in any manner to the Purchased Assets (whether
in the possession of Seller or Buyer). No files, books or records existing at
the Closing Date and relating in any manner to the Purchased Assets shall be
destroyed by any Party for a period of two years after the Closing Date (or
such longer period as is required by applicable Laws and Regulations or any
applicable joint operating agreement) without giving the other Party at least
30 days prior written notice, during which time such other Party shall have
the right (subject to the provisions hereof) to examine and to remove any
such files, books and records prior to their destruction. The access to files,
books and records contemplated by this Section 6.6 shall be during normal
business hours and upon not less than two days prior written request, shall
be subject to such reasonable limitations as the Party having custody or
control

 



27  thereof may impose to preserve the confidentiality of information contained
therein, and shall not extend to material subject to a claim of privilege
unless expressly waived by the Party entitled to claim the same.

6.7 _Confidentiality_. The respective obligations of the Parties with regard
to the use and disclosure of information provided to one Party by the other
are set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in
the Confidentiality Agreement or this Agreement to the contrary, Seller and
Buyer shall consult with each other with regard to all publicity and other
public releases concerning this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby; _provided, however,_ that nothing contained in this Agreement or the
Confidentiality Agreement shall restrict either Party or any Affiliate of
either Party from making any disclosure required by applicable Laws and
Regulations or the applicable rules of any stock exchange.

6.8 _Names_. As soon as reasonably possible after the Closing, but in no event
later than 60 days after the Closing, Buyer shall remove the names of Seller,
including "Penn Virginia," "Penn Virginia Oil and Gas" and all variations
thereof, from all of the Purchased Assets and make the requisite filings with,
and provide the requisite notices to, the appropriate Governmental Authorities
to place the title or other indicia of ownership, including operation of the
Purchased Assets, in a name other than any name of Seller or any variations
thereof.

6.9 _Further Assurances_. At or after the Closing, either Party, at the
request of the other Party and without additional consideration, shall execute
and deliver to the requesting Party all such further assignments, deeds,
agreements, contracts, instruments and other documents as the requesting Party
may reasonably request in order to perform, accomplish, perfect or record, if
reasonably necessary, the sale, assignment, transfer and delivery to Buyer of
the Purchased Assets acquired by Buyer hereunder as contemplated by this
Agreement, to obtain the Customary Post-Closing Consents and to otherwise
carry out the intention of this Agreement.

 

6.10 _Revised Schedules_. On one or more occasions but not later than three
(3) days prior to the Closing Date, Seller may prepare and deliver to Buyer
revised Schedules to this Agreement relating to the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 4.1, which revised Schedules may include new
Schedules to the extent that any of the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 4.1 do not provide for Schedules, reflecting events or
changes in circumstances occurring after the date of this Agreement;
_provided, however,_ that Seller shall notify Buyer as soon as
reasonably practicable of any such events or changes in circumstances
requiring such revisions. In the event that Seller revises or supplements the
Schedules prior to the Closing, any such revised or supplemental Schedules
shall be for informational purposes only and of no force or effect in
connection with determining whether the condition to Buyers obligation to
consummate the Closing set forth in Section 7.2(a) has been satisfied. In the
event that the Closing occurs, then for the sole purposes of the
indemnification provisions set forth in Article 8, any representations and
warranties of Seller as set forth in Section 4.1 shall be subject to, and
modified by, any such timely delivered revisions or supplements to
the Schedules to this Agreement to the extent any such events or changes in
circumstances arose or occurred solely after the date of this Agreement.

6.11 _Bonds_. The Parties understand that no bonds, letters of credit and
guarantees relating to the Purchased Assets are to be transferred to Buyer. On
or before Closing, Buyer shall obtain, or cause to be obtained in the name of
Buyer, replacements for the bonds, letters of credit and guarantees set forth
on _Schedule 6.11_ (but only to the extent such replacements are necessary or
required under the Purchased Contracts or by applicable Laws and
Regulations).

 



28 6.12 _Selection of Operator_. If requested by Buyer, Seller will poll the
parties to applicable joint operating agreements or plans of unitization
before the Closing to select a successor Operator and will recommend that
Buyer be selected as successor Operator. The form of such poll must be
approved by Buyer. The poll may stipulate that Seller will not resign as
Operator unless and until the Closing occurs. Regardless of whether a
successor Operator has been selected, at the Closing, Seller may resign as
Operator under all applicable joint operating or similar agreements. Buyers
selection as Operator, whether under a joint operating or similar agreement or
pursuant to applicable Laws and Regulations, is not a condition of Buyers
performance under this Agreement.

 

6.13 _Office Furniture_. Following the Closing, Buyer shall have the option to
acquire any or all of the office furniture located at Sellers office in
Canonsburg, Pennsylvania for no further consideration. Seller shall make such
office furniture available for pickup by Buyer at as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Closing, but in no event later than October 1,
2012.

8.1 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. The
representations, warranties and covenants of the Parties in this Agreement or
any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive and
continue in full force and effect as follows (each applicable period, the "
_Survival Period_ "):

(a) All of the representations, warranties and covenants of Seller contained
in Sections 4.1 (other than the Fundamental Representations) and 6.3 and all
of the representations and warranties of Buyer contained in Section 4.2
(other than the Fundamental Representations) shall survive the Closing and
continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) months after the
Closing;

 

(b) All of the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Sections
4.1(a), (b), (c)(i) and (f) and of Buyer set forth in Sections 4.2(a), (b),
(c)(1) and (f) (collectively, the " _Fundamental Representations_ ") shall
continue in full force and effect indefinitely; and

 

(c) All of the covenants set forth herein (other than those set forth in
Section 6.3) shall continue in full force and effect indefinitely.

After the expiration of the applicable Survival Period for a particular
representation, warranty or covenant, such representation, warranty or
covenant shall automatically expire and terminate. Any claim for
indemnification with respect to any breach of any representation, warranty or
covenant which is not asserted within the applicable Survival Period by
a written notice given as herein provided that identifies the breach
underlying such claim may not be pursued and shall be thereafter forever
barred.

 



32 8.2 _Indemnification By Seller_. In the event that the Closing occurs, then
Seller hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Buyer and its Affiliates,
each of its and their respective shareholders, members, partners, directors,
officers, employees and agents and each of their respective successors and

harmless from and against any and all Damages directly or indirectly arising
out of, resulting from or in connection with any of the following:

 

(a) the breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by
Seller in this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant to this
Agreement;

(b) the breach of or default in the performance by Seller of any covenant,
agreement or obligation in this Agreement; and

(c) the Retained Obligations; _provided, however,_ that any claim for
indemnification pursuant to this Section 8.2(c) must be asserted by a notice
given as herein provided by not later than the first anniversary of the
Closing and any claim not asserted within such time period may not be pursued
and shall be thereafter forever barred. 

8.3 _Indemnification By Buyer_. In the event that the Closing occurs, Buyer
agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Seller and its Affiliates, each of its
and their respective shareholders, members, partners, directors, officers,
employees and agents and each of their respective successors and permitted
assigns (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") harmless from
and against any and all Damages directly or indirectly arising out of,
resulting from or in connection with any of the following:

(a) the breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by
Buyer in this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant to this
Agreement;

 

(b) the breach of or default in performance by Buyer of any covenant,
agreement or obligation in this Agreement; and

 

(c) the Assumed Liabilities.

8.4 _Indemnification Procedures_. All claims for indemnification under this
Agreement related to Third Party Claims shall be asserted and resolved
pursuant to this Section 8.4.

 

(a) Promptly after the receipt by any Person seeking indemnification hereunder
(an " _Indemnified Party_ ") of a notice of any Proceeding by any Third Party
that may be subject to indemnification hereunder (a " _Third Party Claim_ "),
such Indemnified Party shall give written notice of such Third Party Claim to
the indemnifying Party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") stating the nature and
basis of the Third Party Claim and the amount thereof, to the extent known,
along with copies of the relevant documents evidencing the Third Party Claim
and the basis for indemnification sought. Failure of the Indemnified Party to
give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability on
account of this indemnification, except if and to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby. 

(b) The Indemnifying Party, at its own expense, shall have the right,
exercisable within 30 days of receipt of notice of the Third Party Claim, to
assume the defense of

 



33  the Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim so long as (i) the
Indemnifying Party proceeds in good faith and in a timely manner and (ii) such
Third Party Claim involves (and continues to involve) solely monetary
damages.

(c) So long as the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of the
Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 8.4(b), (i) the Indemnified
Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and
participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim, it being understood that
the Indemnifying Party shall pay all costs and expenses of counsel for the
Indemnified Party (A) for all periods prior to such time as the Indemnifying
Party has notified the Indemnified Party that it has assumed the defense of
such Third Party Claim and (B) if there is a conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, (ii) the Indemnified Party shall
not file any papers or consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), and (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall not consent to
the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

(d) The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize Damages
from Third Party Claims and shall act in good faith and in a timely manner in
responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise dealing with Third
Party Claims. The Parties shall also cooperate in any such defense and give
each other reasonable access to all information relevant thereto. Whether or
not the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to indemnify the
Indemnified Party hereunder for any settlement entered into without the
Indemnifying Partys prior written consent, which consent shall not
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnified Party shall have the sole and exclusive right to settle any Third
Party Claim, on such terms and conditions as it deems reasonably appropriate,
to the extent such claim involves equitable or other non-monetary relief.

8.5 _Other Limitations on Indemnification_.

 

(a) Seller shall not have any liability to the Buyer Indemnified Parties
pursuant to Section 8.2(a) with respect to any breach of any representation
or warranty set forth in Section 4.1 (other than any Fundamental
Representation) unless and until the aggregate amount of all of the Damages to
the Buyer Indemnified Parties exceeds the Indemnification Threshold, in
which case the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification
only to the extent of the excess over the Indemnification Threshold. Buyer
shall not have any liability to the Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant to
Section 8.3(a) with respect to any breach of any representation or warranty
set forth in Section 4.2 (other than any Fundamental Representation) unless
and until the aggregate amount of all of the Damages to the Seller Indemnified
Parties exceeds the Indemnification Threshold, in which case the Seller
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification only to the extent of
the excess over the Indemnification Threshold. There shall be no threshold or
deductible with respect to (i) Sellers obligations to Buyer pursuant to
Section 8.2(a) with respect to any breach of any Fundamental Representation or
pursuant to Sections 8.2(b) or 8.2(c) or (ii) Buyers obligations to Seller
pursuant to Section 8.3(a) with respect to any breach of any Fundamental
Representation pursuant to Sections 8.3(b) or 8.3(c).

 



34 (b) The aggregate liability of Seller pursuant to this Article 8 shall in no
event exceed, individually or in the aggregate, $10,000,000. Subject to
Section 8.5(c), Buyers liability pursuant to Section 8.3 shall, in each case,
be without limit.

 

(c) Under no circumstances shall any Party be liable to the other Party for
any indirect, contingent, consequential, unforeseen, exemplary or punitive,
special Damages of any nature (including lost profits); _provided, however,_
that any such Damages recovered by any Third Party for which a Party owes
another Party an indemnity under this Agreement shall not be waived. 

(d) The Parties will make appropriate adjustments for any insurance proceeds
actually received by the Indemnified Party in determining Damages for
purposes of this Article 8\. All indemnification payments under this Article 8
will be deemed to be adjustments to the amounts paid to Seller pursuant to
Article 2\. Any liability for indemnification under this Agreement shall be
determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts
giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

 

(e) Each Indemnified Party seeking indemnification hereunder shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Damages that it asserts under
this Article 8, but any reasonable costs and expenses (other than internal
costs and expenses) incurred in connection therewith shall constitute Damages.

(f) For purposes of the indemnifications given under this Sections 8.2(a) and
8.3(a) for breaches of the representations and warranties made by Seller and
Buyer in Article 4, such representations and warranties qualified by
materiality or Material Adverse Effect shall be deemed to have been made
without the materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifications and shall be
true and correct in all respects.

 

8.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. IN THE ABSENCE OF FRAUD, AFTER THE CLOSING THE RIGHT
OF THE PARTIES TO ASSERT INDEMNIFICATION CLAIMS AND RECEIVE INDEMNITY
PAYMENTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE RIGHT AND REMEDY
EXERCISABLE BY THE PARTIES WITH RESPECT TO ANY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF ANY
BREACH BY ANY PARTY OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, COVENANT OR AGREEMENT OF
SUCH PARTY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE RELATING TO THE
CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS. NO PARTY WILL HAVE ANY OTHER REMEDY (STATUTORY,
EQUITABLE, COMMON LAW OR OTHERWISE) AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY WITH RESPECT TO
SUCH MATTERS, AND ALL SUCH OTHER REMEDIES ARE HEREBY WAIVED. WITHOUT LIMITING
THE FOREGOING, IN THE ABSENCE OF FRAUD, EACH OF THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT SUCH PARTY WILL NOT HAVE ANY REMEDY AFTER THE CLOSING FOR ANY
BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, COVENANT OR AGREEMENT SET FORTH IN
THIS AGREEMENT, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS ARTICLE 8\.
