Benefit Values, Buyer shall promptly pay to Seller the aggregate Benefit Values determined by the Consultant, if any. In making its determination, the Consultant shall be bound by the rules set forth in this Article&nbsp;5. The Consultant shall act
as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed Defect, Title Benefit, Defect Value or Benefit Value submitted by any Party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to any Party with respect to any matter. The fees
charged by the Consultant shall be borne 50% by Buyer and 50% by Seller, and each Party shall bear all of its own costs and expenses associated with the submission of any disputed matters to the Consultant. </FONT></P>
