II  PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES   SECTION 2.01 The Transactions. Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, the
Purchaser shall purchase from the Seller, and the Seller shall sell, convey,
assign, transfer and deliver to the Purchaser, the Shares free and clear of
any Liens against the payment by Purchaser to the Seller of an amount in cash
equal to the Purchase Price.   SECTION 2.02 Purchase Price. The "BASE
CONSIDERATION" for the Shares under this Agreement shall be the amount equal
to Four Hundred Seventy Million Dollars ($470,000,000). The Base
Consideration as it may be adjusted pursuant to Section 2.03, shall be the
"PURCHASE PRICE" under this Agreement.   SECTION 2.03 Purchase Price
Adjustments    -9-     (a) Net Working Capital Closing Adjustment.  
(i) The Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser before the Closing Date, and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to make such delivery not
less than three (3) Business Days before the scheduled Closing Date, (A) an
unaudited estimated consolidated Balance Sheet of the Company and the
Subsidiaries as of the Closing, which Balance Sheet shall be prepared by the
Seller in accordance with GAAP consistently applied using the same accounting
principles, procedures, policies and methods that were used to prepare the
Balance Sheet (including the exclusion of footnotes), except as described on
SCHEDULE 1.01(A)-2 (the "ESTIMATED CLOSING DATE BALANCE SHEET"), and (B) a
written statement setting forth the Seller\'s estimate of the Net Working
Capital immediately prior to the Closing, which statement shall be prepared
in accordance with GAAP consistently applied using the same accounting
principles, procedures, policies, and methods that were used to prepare the
Balance Sheet (including the exclusion of footnotes), except as described on
SCHEDULE 1.01(A)-2 (the "ESTIMATED CLOSING DATE NET WORKING CAPITAL
STATEMENT"); provided, however, that if there is any discrepancy between the
accounting principles, procedures, policies, and methods that were used to
prepare the Balance Sheet and the accounting principles, procedures,
policies, and methods that were used to prepare the Restatement Adjustment
Certificate, the accounting principles, procedures, policies, and methods
that were used to prepare the Restatement Adjustment Certificate shall be
used to prepare the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet and the
Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement with respect to such
discrepancy, except that for purposes of calculating Net Working Capital
immediately prior to the Closing under this Section 2.03(a)(i), deferred
revenue and accrued liabilities with respect to existing lease obligations
shall be accounted for consistent with the accounting principles, procedures,
policies and methods that were used to prepare the Balance Sheet. If the
Purchaser has any disagreement with the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet
or Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement, the Purchaser shall
promptly notify the Seller of any such disagreement and the Seller and the
Purchaser shall use good faith efforts to resolve any such disagreement
within three Business Days of the Purchaser so notifying the Seller. The
estimated Net Working Capital set forth in the Estimated Closing Date Net
Working Capital Statement shall be the "ESTIMATED CLOSING DATE NET WORKING
CAPITAL."   (ii) If the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital is:  
(A) greater than the Balance Sheet Net Working Capital, the Base 
Consideration shall be increased by a dollar amount equal to  the difference
between the Estimated Closing Date Net  Working Capital and the Balance Sheet
Net Working Capital;  or   (B) less than the Balance Sheet Net Working
Capital, the Base  Consideration shall be decreased by a dollar amount equal
to  the difference between the Balance Sheet Net Working Capital  and the
Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital; or   (C) equal to the Balance
Sheet Net Working Capital, the Base  Consideration shall not be
adjusted.    -10-     (b) Restatement Adjustment. The parties hereto
acknowledge that the Seller Parent has publicly announced that it shall
restate certain of its historical consolidated financial statements (the
"RESTATEMENT"). The parties hereto further acknowledge that the Restatement
is expected to affect the historical results of operations of the
"Information Services Segment" of the Seller Parent, which is solely
comprised of the Seller, the Company and the Subsidiaries, and is further
expected to affect the results of operations of the Company and the
Subsidiaries for fiscal years ending after the Closing Date. Within ten (10)
days after the public announcement by the Seller Parent of the completion of
the Restatement, but in no event later than fifteen (15) days prior to the
Closing Date, the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser a certificate (the
"RESTATEMENT ADJUSTMENT CERTIFICATE") signed by the Chief Financial Officer
of the Seller Parent, setting forth in reasonable detail (i) a calculation of
the amount of (x) the actual average change, if any, in the consolidated
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of the Company
and the Subsidiaries ("EBITDA") over the twelve-month periods ending June 30,
2003, June 30, 2004 and June 30, 2005 (collectively, the "THREE YEAR PERIOD")
and (y) the projected average change, if any, in EBITDA over the twelve-month
periods ending June 30, 2006 and June 30, 2007 (collectively and together
with the Three Year Period, the "FIVE YEAR PERIOD") which shall result from
the Restatement based solely on facts and circumstances known to
Seller Parent as of the date of the Restatement. The Restatement Adjustment
Certificate shall be prepared in good faith by the Seller and shall be in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser, and if the
Purchaser has any disagreement with the Restatement Adjustment Certificate,
the Purchaser shall notify the Seller in writing of any such disagreement and
the Seller and the Purchaser shall use good faith efforts to resolve any such
disagreement within three (3) Business Days of the Purchaser so notifying the
Seller. During the period preceding and following the delivery of the
Restatement Adjustment Certificate, to the extent reasonably necessary, the
Seller Parent and the Seller shall, and shall cause the Company, the
Subsidiaries and any other Affiliates of the Seller Parent to, (A) provide
the Purchaser Parent and the Purchaser and the Purchaser Parent\'s and the
Purchaser\'s authorized representatives with reasonable access to the
financial books and records of the Company and the Subsidiaries, (B) provide
the Purchaser Parent and the Purchaser as promptly as practicable with
financial information for the Company and the Subsidiaries for the Five Year
Period, and (C) cooperate fully with the Purchaser Parent and the Purchaser
and the Purchaser Parent\'s and the Purchaser\'s authorized representatives
in connection with their review of such information. Such actual and
projected average change in EBITDA over the Five Year Period and the
adjustment to the Base Consideration related thereto shall be calculated as
follows:   (i) the actual and projected increase or decrease in EBITDA for
each of the years in the Five Year Period shall be added, and adjusted to
exclude any increase or decrease in EBITDA for the twelve (12) month period
ended June 30, 2005 not related to any changes in the timing of deferred
revenue and accrued liabilities with respect to existing lease obligations.
The sum of such addition and adjustment shall be the "AGGREGATE CHANGE IN
EBITDA";   (ii) the Aggregate Change in EBITDA shall be divided by a factor
of 5, and the quotient of such division plus the effect, if any, of any
increase or decrease in EBITDA for the twelve (12) month period ended June
30, 2005 not related to any changes in the timing of deferred revenue and
accrued liabilities with respect to existing lease obligations shall be the
"AVERAGE CHANGE IN EBITDA";    -11-     (iii) if the Average Change in
EBITDA is 0 or a positive number or a negative number not greater than
($500,000), there shall be no adjustment to the Base Consideration; and  
(iv) if the Average Change in EBITDA is a negative number greater
than ($500,000), the amount of the Average Change in EBITDA, expressed as a
positive number, shall be multiplied by a factor of 8. The product of such
multiplication shall constitute the "RESTATEMENT ADJUSTMENT", and the Base
Consideration shall be reduced by the amount of the Restatement Adjustment;
provided, however, that the amount of the Restatement Adjustment shall not be
greater than $15,000,000.  For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
Section 2.03(b) shall effect the Balance Sheet in any manner.   (c)
Adjustment to Estimated Purchase Price. The Base Consideration, as it may be
adjusted pursuant to Section 2.03(a) and Section 2.03(b) shall be
the "ESTIMATED PURCHASE PRICE," which Estimated Purchase Price shall be
payable to the Seller at the Closing in accordance with Section 2.04.   (d)
Post-Closing Adjustment.   (i) As promptly as reasonably practicable, but in
any event not later than 60 days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall
deliver to the Seller (A) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and the Subsidiaries as of the Closing, which balance sheet shall be
prepared in accordance with GAAP from the books and records of the Company
and the Subsidiaries using the same accounting principles, procedures,
policies, and methods that were used to prepare the Balance Sheet (including
the exclusion of footnotes), except as described on SCHEDULE 1.01(A)-2 (the
"CLOSING DATE BALANCE SHEET") and (B) a written statement of the Net Working
Capital (the "CLOSING DATE NET WORKING CAPITAL STATEMENT"); provided,
however, that if there is any discrepancy between the accounting principles,
procedures, policies, and methods that were used to prepare the Balance Sheet
and the accounting principles, procedures, policies, and methods that were
used to prepare the Restatement Adjustment Certificate, the accounting
principles, procedures, policies, and methods that were used to prepare the
Restatement Adjustment Certificate shall be used to prepare the Closing Date
Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement with respect
to such discrepancy, except that for purposes of calculating Net Working
Capital immediately prior to the Closing under this Section 2.03(d), deferred
revenue and accrued liabilities with respect to existing lease obligations
shall be accounted for consistent with the accounting principles, procedures,
policies and methods that were used to prepare the Balance Sheet.   (ii) The
Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement
(and the Closing Date Net Working Capital set forth therein) shall be final
and binding on the parties unless, within 15 days after delivery thereof to
the Seller, written notice is given by the Seller to the Purchaser of its
objection, setting forth in reasonable detail the Seller\'s basis
for objection (the "OBJECTION NOTICE"). If the Objection Notice is given,
the Purchaser and the Seller shall consult with each other in good faith
with respect to the objection. If the Purchaser and the Seller are unable to
reach agreement within 30 days after the Objection Notice has been given, the
dispute shall be submitted, as promptly as reasonably practicable, for   
-12-    resolution to Deloitte and Touche LLP, or such other nationally-
recognized accounting firm that is acceptable to the Purchaser and the Seller
(the "NEUTRAL ACCOUNTANT"). The Purchaser and the Seller agree to execute, if
requested by the Neutral Accountant, a reasonable engagement letter with the
Neutral Accountant. The Neutral Accountant shall make a determination, based
solely on presentations by the Seller and the Purchaser and not by
independent review, as to (and only as to) each of the items in dispute, and
shall be instructed that, in resolving such items in dispute, it must select
a position with respect to the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing
Date Net Working Capital Statement that is either exactly the Purchaser\'s
position with respect to the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Date
Net Working Capital Statement or exactly the Seller\'s position with respect
to the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Net Working Capital
Statement, or that is between such position of the Purchaser and such
position of the Seller. The Neutral Accountant shall furnish
its determination as to the items in dispute (which determination shall have
been made in accordance with this Agreement) to the Seller and to the
Purchaser in writing together with a revised version of the Closing Date Net
Working Capital Statement, which shall have been revised by the Neutral
Accountant to reflect its determination. The determination of the Neutral
Accountant and the revised version of the Closing Date Net Working Capital
Statement reflecting the Neutral Accountant\'s determination shall be final,
conclusive and binding upon, and non-appealable by, the Purchaser and the
Seller. In connection with its determination of the disputed items, the
Neutral Accountant shall be entitled to rely upon the accounting records and
similar materials prepared in connection with the Estimated Closing Date
Balance Sheet, the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement, the
Closing Date Balance Sheet, and the Closing Date Net Working Capital
Statement. All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be
performed by the Neutral Accountant will be allocated between the Purchaser
and the Seller in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of
the disputed items so submitted to the Neutral Accountant that is
unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as finally determined by the
Neutral Accountant) bears to the total amount of such disputed items so
submitted. The Purchaser and the Seller shall each use reasonable efforts to
cause the Neutral Accountant to render its decision as soon as reasonably
practicable (but in no event later than thirty (30) days following the
expiration of the 30-day period provided above for the Purchaser and the
Seller to resolve disputes before submission to the Neutral Accountant),
including by promptly complying with all reasonable requests by the Neutral
Accountant for information, books, records, and similar items. The Closing
Date Net Working Capital Statement as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 2.03(d) shall be referred to as the "FINAL CLOSING DATE NET WORKING
CAPITAL STATEMENT," and the Closing Date Net Working Capital as set forth in
the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement shall be the "FINAL
CLOSING DATE NET WORKING CAPITAL."   (iii) During the period following the
delivery of the Closing Date Balance Sheet until the Final Closing Date Net
Working Capital Statement is finally determined, to the extent reasonably
necessary, the Purchaser shall and shall cause the Company and any other
Affiliates of the Purchaser to (A) provide the Seller and the Seller\'s
authorized representatives with reasonable access to the financial books and
records of the Company and the Subsidiaries, (B) provide the Seller as
promptly as practicable after the delivery of the Closing Date Balance Sheet
with financial information for the Company for the period ending on the
Closing Date, and (C) cooperate fully with the Seller and the
Seller\'s authorized representatives.   (iv) If the Final Closing Date Net
Working Capital is:    -13-     (A) greater than the Estimated Closing
Date Net Working Capital,  the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller a dollar
amount equal  to the difference between the Final Closing Date Net Working 
Capital and the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital,  plus interest on
such amount at the Federal Funds Rate from  the Closing Date through the date
of payment; or   (B) less than the Estimated Closing Date Net Working
Capital,  the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser a dollar amount equal  to
the difference between the Estimated Closing Date Net  Working Capital and
the Final Closing Date Net Working  Capital, plus interest on such amount at
the Federal Funds  Rate from the Closing Date through the date of payment;
or   (C) equal to the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital, no 
payment shall be required to be made pursuant to this  Section
2.03(d)(iv).   (e) Any amounts (i) required to be paid pursuant to Section
2.03(d) by the Purchaser shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account or accounts specified by the Seller in
writing, or (ii) required to be paid by the Seller pursuant to Section
2.03(d) shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated by the Purchaser in writing, in each case
within five (5) Business Days after the Final Closing Date Net Working
Capital is determined in accordance with Section 2.03(d).   SECTION 2.04

thereof or material default thereunder, nor is there any material dispute
between the Company or a Subsidiary and any landlord under any of the
Property Leases and no waiver, indulgence or postponement of the lessee\'s
obligations thereunder has been granted by the lessor. No event has occurred
and no condition exists which, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time
or both, would constitute a default by the Company or a Subsidiary or
termination event under any Property Lease. To the Knowledge of the Seller,

attached hereto as SCHEDULE 5.01(J);   (k) neither the Company nor any of
the Subsidiaries shall write-off as uncollectible any notes or accounts
receivable, except in the ordinary course of the Business consistent
with    -37-    past practice and which (1) would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
with respect to the Company or (2) is required by GAAP;   (l) none of the
Seller Parent, the Seller, or the Company or any of the Subsidiaries shall
knowingly take any action that would cause the Seller Parent\'s or the
Seller\'s representations and warranties to be inaccurate or untrue in any
material respect as of the Closing Date;   (m) neither the Company nor any
of the Subsidiaries shall make any loans, advances or capital contributions
to, or investments in, any other Person other than loans, advances or capital
contributions or investments by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries to or
in any wholly-owned Subsidiary, or tuition advances, draws against sales
commissions, and advances for relocation expenses and business expenses in
the ordinary course of the Business consistent with past practices;   (n)
neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries shall enter into
or consummate any transactions with Affiliates, except in the ordinary course
of the Business consistent with past practices;   (o) neither the Company
nor any of the Subsidiaries shall enter into any hedging or derivative
Contract; and   (p) none of the Seller Parent, the Seller, the Company or
any Subsidiary shall enter into any contract, agreement, or commitment with
respect to any of the matters set forth in this Section 5.01(b)-(e) and

premises and designated officers, employees and agents, properties, books,
records and work papers of the Company and the Subsidiaries (including any
Tax Returns or other Tax-related information pertaining to the Company and
the Subsidiaries), and shall furnish the Purchaser and the Purchaser Parent
such financial, operating and other information and data, as the Purchaser,
through its officers, accountants, attorneys, and other employees or agents,
may reasonably request, all subject to any confidentiality provisions set
forth in any contracts or agreements by which the Company or a Subsidiary is
bound, and pursuant to Section 5.14(a).   (b) No investigation or
communication pursuant to this Section 5.02 shall affect or add to any
representations or warranties of the parties or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties to consummate the Transactions.   (c) Without
limiting the generality of Section 5.02(a), prior to the Closing, each of the
Seller Parent and the Seller shall use, and shall cause the Company and the
Subsidiaries to use, commercially reasonable efforts to cause the senior
management personnel and advisors,    -38-    including legal and
accounting advisors and auditors, of the Seller Parent, Seller and the

management personnel of the Purchaser Parent in connection with the financing
by Purchaser Parent of the transactions provided for in this Agreement and
the due diligence review of the Company and the Subsidiaries by
Purchaser Parent\'s financing sources, including commercially reasonable
efforts to cause senior management personnel of Purchaser Parent, Purchaser
and the Company to be available at reasonable times, at reasonable locations

with prospective lenders in presentations, meetings, and due diligence
sessions with respect to Seller Parent\'s financing of said transactions, the

therewith.   (d) Prior to the Closing, each of the Seller Parent and the
Seller shall provide, and shall cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to,
and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the respective
officers, employees, representatives and advisors of the Seller Parent, the
Seller, the Company and the Subsidiaries to, provide such cooperation as is
reasonably requested by the Company\'s nationally recognized independent
accounting firm in connection with the audit contemplated by Section
7.03(i).   (e) The Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts after
the Closing Date to cause the auditors referred to in Section 7.03(i) to
consent to the inclusion of the audited financial statements referred to in
Section 7.03(i) in any registration statement filed by the Purchaser Parent
or any of its subsidiaries (the "Issuer") with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC"), and the Purchaser Parent shall pay all Seller
Parent\'s reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection therewith.
The Seller Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the

reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection therewith.   (f)
For a period of at least seven (7) years after the Closing Date,
the Purchaser shall either (i) retain the books and records of the Company
and the Subsidiaries and shall provide the Seller and its representatives and

outstanding.   SECTION 5.03 Permitted Actions. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in Section 5.01 or any other provision of this Agreement,

5.04 Consents and Approvals; Assignment; Transfer of Intellectual Property
(a) The Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, or to
cause the Company or a Subsidiary to obtain, the consents or
approvals required under Required Consent Contracts, and the Purchaser shall
cooperate with the Seller and the Company and the Subsidiaries in connection
with obtaining such consents and approvals. If the Seller or the Company or
a Subsidiary is unable to obtain the consent or approval required under
any Required Consent Contract before the Closing, or if any such consent or
approval required under a Required Consent Contract cannot be obtained
without unreasonable effort or expense by the Seller or the Company, the
parties shall: (a) arrange an equitable assignment by the Company or a
Subsidiary to the Purchaser of the rights and interest of the Company or such
Subsidiary in and to, and obligations under, such Required Consent Contract;
(b) cooperate in any reasonable arrangement designed to provide, after the
Closing, the Company or a Subsidiary or the Purchaser the benefits under any
such Required Consent Contract, and the Purchaser shall pay, perform and
discharge fully all of the obligation of the Company or a Subsidiary under
each such Required Consent Contract; and (c) use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate to obtain the consent or approval required under such
Required Consent Contract as promptly as reasonably possible after the
Closing Date, except that the foregoing shall in no event require the Seller,
the Company or a Subsidiary to incur any unreasonable expense to obtain any
such consent or approval. If and when any such consents or approvals shall be
obtained, then the Seller shall promptly assign its rights and obligations,
if any, under the applicable Required Consent Contract to the Purchaser
without payment of consideration and the Purchaser shall, without the payment
of any consideration therefor, assume such rights and obligations. The
parties shall execute such instruments as may be necessary to evidence such
assignment and assumption. Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Seller and its Affiliates from and against any and all liabilities, losses,
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by any of
them from and after the Closing under, with respect to or in connection
with any breach by Purchaser of a Contract (x) assigned to the Purchaser or
(y) the performance of Seller\'s obligations under which the Purchaser has
acquired and assumed control of pursuant to the alternative arrangement
referred to in the second sentence of this subsection (a), and in each case
for which the Seller has not been released of its obligations thereunder by
the counterparty to the Contract, provided, that in all events, Seller shall
remain responsible for any breach or alleged breach of any assignment
provisions of such Contract.   (b) On or prior to the Closing Date, each of
the Seller Parent and the Seller shall take all actions required to assign
each Affiliate Contract set forth on SCHEDULE 5.04(B) to the entity
identified on SCHEDULE 5.04(B) (or such other entity as the Purchaser
reasonably requests). Such assignment shall be by novation (i.e., non-
recourse to the assignor) if and to the extent agreed by the contractual
counterparty. All costs of such transfer shall be borne by the Seller. In the
event that any Affiliate Contract set forth on SCHEDULE 5.04(B) cannot be
assigned on or prior to the Closing Date because such assignment requires the
consent of the counterparty and such consent is not timely received, (i) the
Seller Parent and the Seller shall, to the maximum extent consistent with the
terms of such Affiliate Contract, make available to the Company and the
Subsidiaries the benefits of such Affiliate Contract, (ii) the Company and
the Subsidiaries, to the extent (but only to the extent) of benefits actually
received, shall reimburse the Seller Parent or the Seller, as applicable, for
any payments required to be made thereunder, (iii) each of the Seller Parent,
the Seller and the Purchaser shall continue to cooperate to facilitate the
assignment of such Affiliate Contract as promptly as practicable thereafter,
and (iv) if such Affiliate Contract is a customer    -40-    contract,
each of the Seller Parent and the Seller shall following the Closing continue
to make all commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate the assignment of
such Affiliate Contract to the entity identified on SCHEDULE 5.04(B) (or such
other entity as the Purchaser reasonably requests) and to mitigate any
adverse consequences to the Company and the Subsidiaries that arise as a
result of the delay in such assignment. Purchaser shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Seller and its Affiliates from and against any and all
liabilities, losses, costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees)
incurred by any of them from and after the Closing under, with respect to or
in connection with any breach by Purchaser of an Affiliate Contract (x)
assigned to the Purchaser or (y) the performance of Seller\'s Affiliate\'s
obligations under which the Purchaser has acquired and assumed control of
pursuant to the alternative arrangement referred to in the fourth sentence of
this subsection (b), and in each case for which the Affiliate of Seller party
to such Contract has not been released of its obligations thereunder by the
counterparty to the Contract, provided, that in all events, Seller\'s
Affiliate shall remain responsible for any breach or alleged breach of any
assignment provisions of such Contract.   (c) Prior to the Closing, each of
the Seller Parent and the Seller, as applicable, shall execute or cause to be
executed all instruments necessary to transfer ownership of all Intellectual
Property set forth on SCHEDULE 3.10(A) to the Company, and shall file and
record such instruments, along with all instruments necessary to establish
proper chain of title for such Intellectual Property, with the appropriate
intellectual property offices or Governmental Authorities.   (d) On or
prior to the Closing Date, each of the Seller Parent and the Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of the agreements set forth on
SCHEDULE 5.04(D) to be split into two separate agreements (whether by
entering into two new agreements for each agreement set forth on
SCHEDULE 5.04(D), amending each existing agreement set forth on SCHEDULE
5.04(D) for the benefit of one party and entering into new agreements for the
benefit of the other party, or otherwise), one for the benefit of the Company
and the Subsidiaries and one for the benefit of the Seller Parent and its
other Affiliates, such that the Company and the Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and the Seller Parent and its other Affiliates, on the other hand,
continue to receive services under such agreements in a manner consistent
with the use of services under such agreements for periods prior to the
split. It is the intent of the parties hereto that the fees payable pursuant
to the separate agreements as provided above shall equitably reflect the
split of services and shall be the same in all material respects as the fees
under the existing agreements for the same services, and such fees, the terms
and conditions of the split, and the terms and conditions of such separate
agreements shall in any event be subject to approval by the Purchaser with
respect to its separate agreements and the Seller Parent with respect to its
separate agreements, which approvals will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. Any credits available under the existing agreements set forth on
SCHEDULE 5.04(D) that pertain to periods after the Closing shall be equitably
split between the separate agreements, on terms and conditions reasonably
acceptable to the Purchaser and the Seller Parent. The parties hereto shall
each bear their own costs and expenses with respect to the foregoing. The
Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each of
the Seller Parent and the Seller to cause each of the agreements set forth on
SCHEDULE 5.04(d) to be split into two separate agreements as described above.
In the event that notwithstanding commercially reasonable efforts, the Seller
Parent and the Seller are unable to obtain two separate agreements for each
agreement as contemplated by this Section 5.04(d) prior to Closing, then the
Seller Parent and    -41-    the Seller shall instead assign each of
the agreements set forth on SCHEDULE 5.04(D) to the Company, and the
Transition Services Agreement shall thereafter apply to the services procured
under each such agreement.   SECTION 5.05 Approvals from Governmental
Authorities. Except as contemplated by Section 5.06, each of the parties
hereto shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (with the reasonable
assistance of the other party to the extent reasonably required) promptly
make all required notifications to, and obtain required approvals of,
Governmental Authorities with respect to the consummation of transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   SECTION 5.06 HSR Act Filing.   (a) As
soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, and in no event later
than ten (10) Business Days following the execution hereof, the Purchaser and
the Seller shall each file a Hart-Scott-Rodino Notification and Report Form
with the United States Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of
the United States Department of Justice under the HSR Act. All filing fees
payable with respect to such filing by the Purchaser and the Seller shall be
paid by the Purchaser. The Purchaser and the Seller agree to keep the other
promptly apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of
the Closing and the pre-acquisition notification review process.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing set forth in this Agreement shall
obligate any party hereto to litigate any action or inaction by any
Governmental Authority under the HSR Act.   (b) The Purchaser and the
Seller shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in Section 5.06(a) to
obtain the requisite Governmental Authorizations for the Closing under the
HSR Act: (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain prompt termination
of any waiting period under the HSR Act (including any extension of the
initial thirty (30) day waiting period with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement); (ii) cooperate in all reasonable respects
with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection
with any investigation or other inquiry; (iii) keep the other parties
promptly informed in all material respects of any material communication
received by such party from, or given by such party to, any Governmental
Authority regarding any of the Transactions; and (iv) permit the other
parties to review any material communication given by it to, and consult with
each other in advance of any meeting or conference with, any
Governmental Authority in connection therewith, and, to the extent permitted
by such Governmental Authority, give the other parties the opportunity to
attend and participate in such meetings and conferences.   (c)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing set forth
in this Agreement shall or shall be deemed to obligate any party hereto
to litigate or challenge any action or inaction by any Governmental Authority
under the HSR Act or any other Laws designed or intended to prohibit,
restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization
or restraint of trade, or to sell or otherwise divest itself of or hold
separate any asset, or enter into any consent decree, as a condition to
obtaining any consent, approval, order or authorization of any Governmental
Authority necessary or appropriate for consummation of the
Transactions.    -42-     SECTION 5.07 Notification of Certain Matters.
The Seller shall give prompt notice to the Purchaser Parent, and the
Purchaser shall give prompt notice to the Seller Parent, of (a) the
occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event that such party reasonably
believes would be likely to cause any of its representations or warranties
contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect at any time from the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date, (b)
any material failure of the Seller Parent, Seller, the Purchaser Parent or
the Purchaser, as the case may be, or any officer, director, employee, or
agent thereof, to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, (c) the failure of any
condition precedent to such party\'s obligations, (d) any notice of, or
other communication relating to, a default or event that, with notice or
lapse of time or both, would become a default under any Company Contract and
(e) any notice or other communication from any Person not a party to this
Agreement alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that failure to give such notice shall not constitute a waiver of
any defense that may be validly asserted.   SECTION 5.08 Business
Employees   (a) The Purchaser shall (i) cause the Company and the
Subsidiaries, as applicable, to continue the employment, effective as of the
Closing Date, of each Business Employee employed by the Company or a
Subsidiary other than the Business Employees identified on SCHEDULE 3.11(A)-2
and SCHEDULE 5.08(A), and (ii) offer employment, effective as of the Closing
Date, to each Business Employee identified on SCHEDULE 1.01(B) other than the
Business Employees identified on SCHEDULE 3.11(A)-2 and SCHEDULE 5.08(A). For
the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser is not hereby obligated to employ any
Transferred Employee for any particular period of time. Any Business Employee
who becomes an employee of the Purchaser, the Company, any of the
Subsidiaries or any other Affiliate of the Purchaser as of the Closing Date
shall be referred to in this Agreement as a "TRANSFERRED EMPLOYEE". Each
Business Employee identified on SCHEDULE 3.11(A)-2 shall become a Transferred
Employee only on the date that he or she returns to active employment by
joining the Purchaser\'s workforce, which shall occur no later than the
expiration of the approved period of leave or the end of their illness or
disability.   (b) The Purchaser shall cause the Company and the
Subsidiaries, as applicable, to recognize, honor, and assume the liability
for each Transferred Employee\'s accrued but unused paid time off for
vacation, sickness and permitted personal days, as accrued as of the
Closing.   (c) Effective as of the Closing Date, the Transferred Employees
shall cease participation in all of the Employee Benefit Plans and, subject
to the Purchaser\'s standard policies, including eligibility requirements,
commence participation in plans sponsored or established by the Purchaser for
similarly situated employees, including health, life insurance, and
disability plans (the "PURCHASER PLANS"). The Purchaser shall recognize and
give credit for all service by each Transferred Employee with the Company or
any predecessor or Affiliate of the Company for purposes of the Purchaser
Plans and the policies of the Purchaser related to flexible time off
including vacation, sick leave, and personal or family leave, to the extent
such credit was recognized and given under the Employee Benefit Plans
immediately prior to the Closing except to the extent such credit would
result in duplication of benefits. The Purchaser shall provide or cause the
Company or a Subsidiary to provide to each Transferred Employee   
-43-    whose employment is involuntarily terminated within thirty (30)
days after the Closing Date severance benefits that are substantially
equivalent to those offered to such Transferred Employees immediately prior
to the Closing, giving effect to each such Transferred Employee\'s past
service with the Company or any predecessor or Affiliate of the Company.
Those of the Purchaser Plans that are health benefit plans shall, with
respect to any Transferred Employee or any dependents of such Transferred
Employee, waive any limitations or restrictions on participation under any
such Purchaser Plan for reason of any pre-existing condition limitation or
waiting period in any such Purchaser Plan, to the extent such limitations or
restrictions were waived under the Employee Benefit Plans immediately prior
to the Closing. The Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to accommodate the direct rollover of eligible rollover distributions made to
any Transferred Employees, from any Employee Benefit Plans to the applicable
Purchaser Plans, subject to administrative feasibility.   The Seller and the
Purchaser acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained herein with
respect to employees are included for the sole benefit of the Seller and the
Purchaser and shall not create any right (i) in any other Person, including,
without limitation, any employees, former employees, any participant in any
Employee Benefit Plans or any beneficiary thereof or (ii) to continued
employment with the Purchaser, the Company or any of the Subsidiaries.  
SECTION 5.09 Non-Solicitation.   (a) For a period of two years after the
Closing Date, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall, directly or
indirectly, on its own behalf or on behalf of any other Person, solicit the
employment of or hire any Transferred Employee, except that nothing in this
Section 5.09 shall prohibit any Seller or any of its Affiliates from hiring
or soliciting the employment of any Person (i) who responds to a general
solicitation not directed solely at Transferred Employees, or (ii) whose
employment is terminated by the Purchaser or an Affiliate of the
Purchaser.   (b) The Seller acknowledges that the remedy at law for breach
of the provisions of this Section 5.09 shall be inadequate and that, in
addition to any other remedy the Purchaser may have, it shall be entitled to
seek an injunction restraining any breach or threatened breach, without any
bond or other security being required and without the necessity of showing
actual damages. If any court construes the covenant in this Section 5.09, or
any part of this Section 5.09, to be unenforceable in any respect, the court
may reduce the duration or area to the extent necessary so that the provision
is enforceable, and the provision, as reduced, shall then be enforced.  
SECTION 5.10 Intercompany Balances; Termination of Affiliate
Agreements. Before the Closing, all of the outstanding Intercompany Balances
shall be repaid, canceled or otherwise settled. At least two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing, the Seller shall prepare and deliver to the
Purchaser a certificate signed by the chief executive officer of the Seller
setting out the calculation of all such Intercompany Balances based upon the
latest available financial information as of such date. All Contracts between
the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Seller or
its other Affiliates, on the other hand, other than agreements contemplated
by this Agreement and agreements set forth on SCHEDULE 5.10, shall be
terminated as of the Closing, and all obligations and liabilities thereunder
shall have been satisfied.    -44-     SECTION 5.11 Release of
Guarantees. Except as provided in Section 7.03(j), the Purchaser shall use
commercially reasonable efforts following the Closing to cause any guarantees
of the Seller or any of its Affiliates of the obligations under any Contracts
and Property Leases to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party or
otherwise relating to the Business to be terminated and released, and the
Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller and its Affiliates
from and against any and all liabilities, losses, costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by any of them from
and after the Closing under, with respect to or in connection with any such
guarantees or the Contracts to which such guarantees relate; provided,
however, that nothing in this Section 5.11 shall require the Purchaser Parent
or the Purchaser to guarantee any Indebtedness or make any payments or amend
any such Contracts or Property Leases in any material respect.   SECTION
5.12 Resignations. The Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser
the resignations, effective as of the Closing Date, of the directors and
officers of the Company, as applicable, at least one day before the Closing
Date.   SECTION 5.13 Schedules   (a) The parties hereto shall promptly
revise or supplement their respective Schedules (other than Schedules in, or
to the extent Schedules are incorporated by reference into, Articles I
(excluding SCHEDULE 1.01(B)), II, V, VI and VII, except in each case (other
than Schedule 7.03(f)) as a result of a revision or supplement to which the
last sentence of this Section 5.13(a) is applicable) upon the occurrence of
any event or change in condition that would render any Schedule incorrect as
of the Closing Date to reflect information learned of or that came into
existence after the date of this Agreement and that would have been required
to be disclosed on one or more Schedules if such information was in existence
or known on the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that, in the event
that a party revises or supplements its Schedules pursuant to this Section
5.13(a) (other than updating Schedule 3.11(a)-2 as required by
Section 3.11(a)) and absent such revision or supplement a condition to the
obligation of the other party to close would not be satisfied and, if the
last sentence of this Section 5.13(a) is not applicable, there would be a
Material Adverse Effect with respect to the non-terminating party, for a
period of fifteen (15) Business Days following such revision, the other party
shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01(g),
and, if such other party does not elect to terminate this Agreement during
such fifteen-Business Day period pursuant to Section 9.01(g), then such
Schedules, as so revised or supplemented, shall be used for purposes of
determining the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.02 and
7.03(a), (b), (c) and (d). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
foregoing, no revision or supplement to any Schedule permitted by this
Section 5.13(a) shall eliminate or decrease the indemnification obligations
of any party hereto with respect thereto pursuant to Article VIII; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, THAT (I) SOLELY TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY REVISION OR SUPPLEMENT TO
SCHEDULE 3.17(A), SCHEDULE 3.17(B) OR SCHEDULE 3.18 DISCLOSES (A) THE NON-
RENEWAL BY THE COUNTERPARTY TO A CONTRACT WITH THE SELLER, THE COMPANY OR ANY
SUBSIDIARY OF SUCH CONTRACT THAT EXPIRED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS TERMS AFTER
THE DATE HEREOF, (B) A TERMINATION BY THE COUNTERPARTY TO A CONTRACT WITH THE
SELLER, THE COMPANY OR ANY SUBSIDIARY OF SUCH CONTRACT AFTER THE DATE HEREOF
IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS TERMS OR (C) THE LOSS OF ANY CUSTOMER OR VENDOR OF THE
BUSINESS AFTER THE DATE HEREOF, IN EACH CASE SOLELY FOR REASONS OTHER THAN
A MATERIAL DEFAULT UNDER OR MATERIAL BREACH OF THE PROVISIONS OF ANY CONTRACT
BY SELLER, THE COMPANY OR ANY    -45-    SUBSIDIARY AND (II) SOLELY TO
THE EXTENT ANY REVISION OR SUPPLEMENT TO SCHEDULE 1.01(B) DISCLOSES THE
TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT WITH THE BUSINESS, WHETHER VOLUNTARY OR
INVOLUNTARY, OF ANY BUSINESS EMPLOYEE AFTER THE DATE HEREOF, SUCH REVISION OR
SUPPLEMENT SHALL BE INCLUDED IN SUCH SCHEDULE (AND NO OTHER) FOR THE PURPOSES
OF SELLER\'S INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATION UNDER ARTICLE VIII.   (b) Matters
reflected on the Schedules are not necessarily limited to matters required by
this Agreement to be reflected on the Schedules and the inclusion of such
matters shall not be deemed an admission that such matters (or additional
matters) were required to be reflected in the applicable Schedules. The
disclosure of any matter, event, condition, or state of facts in any Schedule
delivered on the date hereof shall be deemed to be a disclosure for
all representations, warranties, and Schedules calling for such disclosure
of matters, events, conditions or states of facts if it is reasonably
apparent on the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable
thereto, but shall expressly not be deemed to constitute an admission by any
party, or to otherwise imply, that any such matter is material for the
purposes of this Agreement.   SECTION 5.14 Confidentiality. Each party
agrees that the Confidentiality Agreement is hereby incorporated by reference
in this Agreement and made a part hereof.   SECTION 5.15 Non-Competition;
Non-Interference   (a) For a period of 36 months after the Closing, the
Seller Parent shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates not to (i)
directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate, control, be employed by or
participate in the ownership, management, operation or control of, or be
connected in any manner with, any business of the type and character, or
otherwise compete, with the Business, as conducted by the Company and the
Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date ("COMPETITIVE ACTIVITIES"); (ii) persuade
or attempt to persuade any potential customer or client to which the Company
or any of the Subsidiaries has made a presentation, or with which the Company
or any of the Subsidiaries has had discussions, not to hire the Company or
such Subsidiary, or to hire another company; or (iii) solicit for the Seller
Parent or any Person other than the Company or any of the Subsidiaries the
business of any Person with respect to the Competitive Activities which is a
customer or client of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, or was its
customer or client within two (2) years prior to the date of this Agreement
or take any action to disparage the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or
otherwise seek to interfere with the contractual arrangements and
relationships of the Company and the Subsidiaries with such Person with
respect to the Competitive Activities. Competitive Activities shall not, and
shall not be deemed to, include any activities currently engaged in by the
Seller Parent or any Affiliates of the Seller Parent (other than the
Seller, the Company and the Subsidiaries) in the ordinary course of their
respective businesses (collectively, "PERMITTED GOODS AND SERVICES"), and the
Seller or any Affiliate of the Seller may sell any Permitted Goods and
Services to any Person notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement.   (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section
5.15(a), Section 5.15(a) shall not be, and shall not be deemed to have been,
breached as a result of: (i) the acquisition of the Seller or any of its
Affiliates by a Person that engages in Competitive Activities, so long as the
Competitive Activities do not represent more than 10% of the revenues of such
Person and its Affiliates; (ii) the acquisition by the Seller or any of its
Affiliates of any Person whose business    -46-    includes
Competitive Activities, so long as the Competitive Activities do
not represent a material part of the business of such Person; (iii) the
ownership by Seller or any of its Affiliates of an aggregate of not more than
5% of any class of stock of a Person engaged, directly or indirectly, in
Competitive Activities; provided, that such stock is listed on a national
securities exchange or is quoted on the National Market System of NASDAQ or
(iv) the ownership by Seller or any of its Affiliates of less than 10% in
value of any instrument of Indebtedness of a Person engaged, directly or

and Taxes resulting from the Company and the Subsidiaries ceasing to be a
member of the Affiliated Group of which the Seller is a member) for any
taxable year or period that ends on or before the Closing Date; (ii)
all Taxes imposed on the Seller or the Company and the Subsidiaries, or for
which the Seller or the Company and the Subsidiaries may otherwise be
liable, including any and all liability as a result of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-6 (and any similar provision under state, local or foreign Tax
law) and any payments to be made after the Closing Date under any Tax
sharing, Tax indemnity, Tax allocation or similar contracts (whether or not
written) to which the Company or any of the Subsidiaries was obligated, or
was a party, on or prior to the Closing Date, for any taxable year or period
that ends on or before the Closing Date; (iii) the portion of all Taxes
imposed on the Seller or the Company and the Subsidiaries, or for which the
Seller or the Company or any of the Subsidiaries may otherwise be liable, for
any taxable year or period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date
(the "STRADDLE PERIOD"), to the extent that such    -49-    Taxes are
attributable to the operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries for the
year or period ending on the Closing Date as provided in Section
6.01(d); (iv) any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense attributable to

determining whether or not a breach of representation has occurred or (B) any
covenant set forth in Section 5.01(j); (v) all liability for Taxes arising
(directly or indirectly) as a result of the sale of the Shares or the other
transactions contemplated hereby (including, without limitation, any Taxes
arising as a result of the recognition by Seller, Company or any of the
Subsidiaries of any "deferred intercompany gain" or "excess loss account");
(vi) all liability for Taxes resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Election

incurred by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in connection with any action,
suit, proceeding, demand, assessment or judgment incident to any of the
matters indemnified against in this Section 6.01; provided, however, that the
Seller shall not be responsible or liable for any Taxes which have
been accrued or reserved for on the Closing Date Balance Sheet (excluding any
reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between
book and Tax income) and have been taken into account in determining the
Purchase Price adjustments pursuant to Section 2.03 of this Agreement.  
(b) The Purchaser shall be responsible for (without any right to
be reimbursed by the Seller): (i) all Taxes imposed on the Purchaser or the
Company or the Subsidiaries, or for which the Purchaser or the Company or
the Subsidiaries may otherwise be liable, for any taxable year or period that
begins after the Closing Date; and (ii) the portion of all Taxes imposed on
the Purchaser or the Company or the Subsidiaries, or for which the Purchaser
or the Company or the Subsidiaries may otherwise be liable, for the Straddle
Period, to the extent that such Taxes are attributable to the year or period
beginning after the Closing Date as provided in Section 6.01(d).   (c) Each
of the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Seller and the Company, on the
other hand, shall each be responsible for one-half (i) any and all
stock transfer, stamp, or similar Taxes payable in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions, and (ii) any and all real property
transfer, document, and stamp, bulk sale, or similar Taxes resulting from the
consummation of the Transactions.   (d) For purposes of Section 6.01(a) and
Section 6.01(b), whenever it is necessary to determine the responsibility for
Taxes of the Seller or the Company or any Subsidiary in respect of the
operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries for the Straddle Period, the
determination of the Taxes in respect of the operations of the Company and
the Subsidiaries for the portion of the taxable year or period ending on, and
the portion of the taxable year or period beginning after, the Closing Date
shall be determined: (i) in the case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon
or related to income or receipts, or (y) imposed in connection with any sale
or other transfer or assignment of property, by assuming that the Seller or
the Company and the Subsidiaries had a taxable year or period that ended at
the close of the Closing Date and closing the books of the Seller or the
Company and the Subsidiaries as of such date, except that exemptions,
allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis, such as the
deduction for depreciation, shall be apportioned on a time basis; and, (ii)
in the case of Taxes not described in subparagraph (i) that are imposed on a
periodic basis and measured by the level of any item, deemed to be the   
-50-    amount of such Taxes (including any minimum) for the entire period
(or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of
such Taxes for the immediately preceding period) multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in
the entire period.   (e) The Purchaser, the Seller and the Company shall
each cooperate, as and to the extent reasonably requested by another party in
connection with the preparation and filing of any Tax Returns. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Returns.   (f) If
the Seller is liable pursuant to this Section 6.01 for any Taxes due and to
be paid by the Purchaser, the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser, or if the
Purchaser is liable pursuant to this Section 6.01 for any Taxes due and to be
paid by the Seller or any of its Affiliates, the Purchaser shall pay to
the Seller, as applicable, on or before the date on which such Taxes are due
and payable an amount equal to the Taxes for which the Seller is liable, or
the Taxes for which the Purchaser is liable, as applicable. If the Seller or
any of its Affiliates receive any refund of Taxes to which the Purchaser is
entitled pursuant to Section 6.04, the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser an
amount equal to such refund within 15 days after receipt of such refund by
the Seller or its any of its Affiliates. If the Purchaser receives any refund
of Taxes to which the Seller is entitled pursuant to Section 6.04, the
Purchaser shall pay to the Seller an amount equal to such refund within 15
days after receipt of such refund by the Purchaser.   (g) The participation
of the Company and any Subsidiary in any Tax sharing or allocation agreements
between or among the Seller or any of their Affiliates and the Company and
the Subsidiaries shall be terminated as of the Closing Date, and such
agreements shall have no further effect with respect to the Company and the
Subsidiaries for any taxable year (whether the current year, a future
year, or a past year) and no payments that are owed by or to the Company or
any Subsidiary pursuant to such Tax sharing or allocation agreement shall be
made thereunder.   SECTION 6.02 Tax Returns and Contests   (a) The Tax
Returns of the Seller and of the Company in respect of the operations of the
Company and the Subsidiaries required to be filed separately or as part of a
consolidated Tax Return of an Affiliated Group for all periods ending on or
before the Closing Date (including any Tax Return for the short period ending
on the Closing Date), that are required to be filed after the Closing Date
shall be prepared and filed by the Seller or its Affiliates at the expense of
the Seller and such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
past practice; provided, however, that all such Tax Returns shall be
delivered to Buyer not less than five (5) Business Days before filing thereof
to provide Buyer with an opportunity to review such Tax Returns, and no such
Tax Return shall be filed without the prior written consent of Buyer if such
Tax Return is not consistent with Seller\'s past practices. To the
extent that the operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries reflected on
such Tax Returns are required to be included in the consolidated, unitary or
combined Tax Return of the Seller and its Affiliates, the Seller or its
Affiliates, as the case may be, shall cause the operations of the Company and
the Subsidiaries to be so included. The Seller shall pay all Taxes due with
respect to such Tax Returns.    -51-     (b) The Purchaser shall
prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed at its expense
any Tax Returns of the Purchaser and the Company and the Subsidiaries
required to be filed separately or as part of a consolidated Tax Return of an
Affiliate Group for all periods that end after the Closing Date (including
the Straddle Period), which are filed after the Closing Date. Any such Tax
Returns that relate to the Straddle Period shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with the Tax Returns of the Company referred to in Section 6.02(a)
filed on or before the Closing Date for prior fiscal periods. Any such Tax
Returns that relate to the Straddle Period as are required to be
filed separately or as a part of a unitary or combined Tax Return of the
Purchaser and its Affiliates (but not any consolidated Tax Return) shall be
submitted to the Seller at least 15 days before the first date on which such
Tax Returns are legally required to be filed, including extensions, to enable
the Seller to review, comment on and approve such Tax Returns and no such Tax
Return shall be filed until such Tax Return has been approved by the Seller.
The Purchaser shall cooperate with the Seller in connection with the
Seller\'s review of such Straddle Period Tax Returns and provide to the
Seller such additional information related to the operations of the Company
as the Seller shall reasonably request in connection with such review. The
Purchaser and the Seller shall consult with each other in good faith to
resolve any issues arising as a result of such review and approval. The
Seller shall pay to the Purchaser, at least two Business Days prior to the
filing of the Tax Return, the amount of Taxes properly allocated to the
Seller under Section 6.01(d).   (c) The Purchaser shall promptly notify the
Seller in writing upon receipt by the Purchaser, any of its Affiliates or the
Company or any Subsidiary of notice of any pending or threatened federal,
state, local or foreign income or franchise Tax audits or assessments that
may affect the Tax liabilities of the Seller or Tax liability for which the
Seller may be required to indemnify the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement;
provided, however, the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent that the Seller or
any of its Affiliates has suffered damage or prejudice by reason of such
failure to give, or any delay in giving, such notice.   (d) The Seller
shall have the sole and exclusive right, power and authority, at its expense,
to negotiate, resolve, settle, or contest any notice of audit or assessment
referred to in Section 6.02(c) and to represent and act for and on behalf of
the Seller, the Purchaser and the Company and the Subsidiaries in connection
with any such audit or assessment, including refund claims of any Tax
liability for any period ending on or before the Closing Date. The Seller
shall keep the Purchaser informed of the progress thereof. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Seller shall not resolve, settle, compromise, or abandon
any issue or claim without the prior written consent of the Purchaser if such
action would adversely affect the Tax liabilities of Purchaser or the Company
and the Subsidiaries in any period after the Closing Date and the portion of
the Straddle Period that begins on the Closing Date (including the imposition
of any income Tax deficiencies, the reduction of asset basis on
cost adjustments, the lengthening of any amortization or depreciation
periods, the denial of amortization or depreciation deductions or the
reduction of loss or credit carryforwards). Such consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld and shall not be necessary to the extent that the
Seller has indemnified the Purchaser against the effects of any such
settlement.   (e) The Purchaser shall have the sole and exclusive right,
power and authority, at its expense, to negotiate, resolve, settle, or
contest any such notice of audit or assessment referred to   
-52-    in Section 6.02(c), including refund claims of any Tax liability,
for any period ending after the Closing Date. To the extent that any Seller
has indemnified the Purchaser with respect to any such notice of audit or
assessment, the Purchaser shall keep the Seller informed of the progress
thereof and the Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit the Company or any
Subsidiary to, resolve, settle, compromise, or abandon any issue or claim
without the prior written consent of the Seller if such action would
materially and adversely affect the Tax liabilities of the Seller or any of
its Affiliates for any period (including the imposition of any income Tax
deficiencies, the reduction of asset basis on cost adjustments, the
lengthening of any amortization or depreciation periods, the denial of
amortization or depreciation deductions or the reduction of loss or credit
carryforwards). Such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld and shall not
be necessary to the extent that the Purchaser notifies the Seller in
writing that it shall forego any obligation of the Seller to indemnify the
Purchaser against the effects of any such settlement.   (f) The Purchaser
and the Seller shall, and the Purchaser shall cause the Company and the
Subsidiaries to, cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested
by the other party, in connection with the filing of all Tax Returns and any
audit, litigation, or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such
cooperation shall include prompt notices to each party to this Agreement of
any audit, investigation, or inquiry by any Governmental Authority as to any
such Tax Return reflecting activity of the Company and the Subsidiaries on or
before the date of this Agreement. Such cooperation also shall include the
retention and (upon the request of any other party) the provision of records
and information that are reasonably relevant to any Tax Return of the Company
or any Subsidiary (but not including any information or Tax Returns of the
Seller or any of its Affiliates other than the Company or such Subsidiary),
audit, litigation, or other proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder. The Purchaser agrees (i) to retain all
books and records with respect to Taxes or Tax matters pertinent to the
Company and the Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning
before the date of this Agreement until the expiration of the statute of
limitations (and any extension thereof) of the respective taxable periods,
and (ii) to give the Seller reasonable written notice before transferring,
destroying, or discarding any such books and records and, if the Seller so
requests, the Purchaser shall allow the Seller to take possession of such
books and records. The Purchaser and the Seller further agree, upon request,
to use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or
other document from any Governmental Authority or other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce, or eliminate any Taxes that could be imposed
(including with respect to the consummation of the Transactions).   SECTION
6.03 Section 338(h)(10) Election. The Purchaser and Seller shall join in
timely making an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and
any corresponding elections under state, local, or foreign tax law)
(collectively a "SECTION 338(H)(10) ELECTION") with respect to the purchase
and sale of the stock of the Company and each of the Subsidiaries, and the
Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate in the completion and timely filing of
such elections in accordance with the provisions of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 (or any comparable provisions of state, local or
foreign Tax law) or any successor provision. Seller will pay any Tax
attributable to the making of the Section 338(h)(10) Election and will
indemnify the Purchaser, the Company and the Subsidiaries against any such
Tax. Seller and Buyer shall determine the fair market value of the assets of
the Company and the allocation of Purchase Price (as required pursuant to
Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and regulations promulgated thereunder),   
-53-    together with applicable liabilities, among such assets. The
parties shall agree on a schedule setting forth the allocation as soon as
practicable after the Closing Date. Neither Seller nor the Purchaser shall
take any position on any Tax Return or with any taxing authority that is
inconsistent with such allocation, provided that nothing contained herein
shall require a party to litigate over such allocation against a taxing
authority that challenges such allocation. The Purchaser and the Seller shall
give each other prompt written notice of such any written notice by a taxing
authority asserting any proposed deficiency or adjustment with respect to
such allocation.   SECTION 6.04 Refunds. The amount or economic benefit of
any refunds, credits or offsets of Taxes of the Company, or any of the
Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be for the account of
Seller to the extent such refund is not reflected on the Final Closing Date
Net Working Capital Statement and not taken into account in determining the
Purchase Price adjustments pursuant to Section 2.03 of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such refunds, credits or offsets of Taxes
shall be for the account of Purchaser to the extent such refunds, credits or
offsets of Taxes are attributable (determined on a marginal basis) to the
carryback from a Post-Closing Tax Period of items of loss, deduction or
credit, or other Tax items, of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries (or any
of their respective Affiliates, including Purchaser). The amount or economic
benefit of any refunds, credits or offsets of Taxes of Company or any of the
Subsidiaries for any Post-Closing Tax Period shall be for the account of
Purchaser. The amount or economic benefit of any refunds, credits or offsets
of Taxes of Company or any of the Subsidiaries for any Straddle Period shall
be equitably apportioned between Seller and Purchaser in accordance with
Section 6.01(d); provided, however, that to the extent the refund is
apportioned for the Seller under the preceding clause, the amount of any
refund shall only be for the account of the Seller to the extent such
refund is not reflected on the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital
Statement and not taken into account in determining the Purchase Price
adjustments pursuant to Section 2.03 of this Agreement.   SECTION 6.05
Purchase Price Adjustment. The Purchaser and the Seller agree that any
indemnification payment made pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by applicable law.   SECTION 6.06 Exclusivity. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, except as specifically provided in Section
3.15, Section 5.01(i), Article VI and Section 8.05, any matter related to
Taxes shall be governed solely by this Article VI.   SECTION 6.07 Tax
Sharing Agreements. The Seller shall cause the provisions of any agreement,
arrangement or practice with respect to Taxes (including any Tax sharing
agreements) between Seller, on the one hand, and Company or any of the
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, to be terminated on or before the
Closing Date. After the Closing Date no person shall have any rights or
obligations under any such agreement, arrangement or practice with respect to
Taxes.    -54-     ARTICLE VII   CONDITIONS TO CLOSING   SECTION

Binding Nature), Section 3.05 (Organization, Standing and Qualification),

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement other than as set
forth in the next sentence, neither the Purchaser Parent nor the Purchaser
shall be liable for any breach of any representation or warranty made by it
in this Agreement unless and until the aggregate amount of Damages incurred
by the Seller Indemnified Parties as a result of all breaches
of representations or warranties by the Purchaser Parent or the Purchaser
under this Agreement exceeds an amount equal to the Basket; provided that,
in determining whether the Seller Indemnified Parties are entitled

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Section 8.03 shall

Procedures   (a) Promptly after an Indemnified Party has received notice or
has knowledge of any claim or the commencement of any Action for which such
party may be entitled to indemnification under this Article VIII, the
Indemnified Party shall, if it believes that such claim or Action is
indemnifiable by the Indemnifying Party, give the Indemnifying Party written
notice of such claim or the commencement of such Action and provide the
Indemnifying Party with all relevant information respecting such claim or
Action that is in the possession of the Indemnified Party. Such notice shall
state the nature and basis of such claim or Action and, if ascertainable, the
amount in dispute under such claim or Action. In each such case, the
Indemnified Party agrees to give such notice to the Indemnifying Party
promptly following its receipt of notice or other knowledge of any such claim
or Action; provided, however, that the failure of the Indemnified Party to
give such notice shall not excuse the Indemnifying Party\'s obligation to
indemnify except to the extent the Indemnifying Party has suffered damage or
prejudice by reason of the Indemnified Party\'s failure to give or delay in
giving such notice. If such notice concerns a Third Person Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to elect, at the
Indemnifying Party\'s sole expense, to assume the defense of such Third
Person Claim; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed) before entering into any
settlement, adjustment or compromise of any such Third Person Claim;   
-59-    provided, further, that the Indemnifying Party shall not be
entitled to assume control of such defense and shall pay the fees and
expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party if (i) the claim for
indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any criminal
proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation; (ii) the claim
seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified Party; (iii)
the Indemnified Party has been advised in writing by counsel that a
reasonable likelihood exists of a conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party; (iv) the Indemnified Party
reasonably believes an adverse determination with respect to the action,
lawsuit, investigation, proceeding or other claim giving rise to such claim
for indemnification would be detrimental to or injure the
Indemnified Party\'s reputation or future business prospects; or (vi) the
Indemnifying Party failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend
such claim. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to elect, at such
party\'s sole expense, to participate in (but not control) the defense of
such Third Person Claim, and to employ, at its own expense, counsel in
connection with its participation therein. If the Indemnifying Party has
elected not to assume the control of the defense of such Third Person Claim,
or if the Indemnifying Party shall have failed after the lapse of a
reasonable period of time, which shall in no event be less than 30 calendar
days after receipt by the Indemnifying Party of written notice of such Third
Person Claim, to assume the control of the defense of such Third Person
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to defend against the same and
to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party, at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party; provided, however, in such event, the
Indemnified Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed) before entering into any settlement, adjustment or compromise of any
such Third Person Claim. So long as the Indemnifying Party is reasonably
contesting any such claim in good faith, the Indemnified Party shall not pay,
settle or compromise any such claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Indemnified Party shall have the right to pay, settle or compromise any
such claim, provided that in such event it shall waive any right to
indemnity therefor by the Indemnifying Party for such claim unless the
Indemnifying Party shall have consented to such payment, settlement or
compromise. In connection with any Third Person Claim, the Indemnified Party,
or the Indemnifying Party, if it has assumed the defense of such Third Person
Claim pursuant to this Section 8.04(a), shall vigorously and competently
defend such Third Person Claim in good faith and the parties shall cooperate
with one another in connection with the handling of such Third Person Claim,
shall make available personnel, witnesses, books, and records relevant to
such Third Person Claim and grant such authorizations as are necessary and
reasonable to their respective agents, representatives, and counsel upon
reasonable request.   (b) If the Indemnified Party shall have any claim
against the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 8.04, the Indemnified
Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party a written notice explaining the
nature and amount of such claim promptly after the Indemnified Party shall
know the amount of such claim.   SECTION 8.05 Survival of Representations
and Warranties. The respective representations and warranties of the parties
contained in this Agreement, and the rights and obligations of the parties
under this Article VIII with respect to breaches of such representations and
warranties, shall survive the Closing for a period of two years, except that:
(a) any claims for indemnification with respect to any breaches of
representations and warranties made on or before such expiration date shall
survive the Closing until final resolution thereof; (b) the   
-60-    representations and warranties contained in Section 3.01
(Authority Relative to Agreement), Section 3.04 (Non-Contravention), Section
3.10 (Intellectual Property), Section 3.26 (No Broker), Section 3.27
(Sufficiency of Assets), Section 4.01 (Authority Relative to Agreement),
Section 4.03 (Non-Contravention), and Section 4.09 (No Broker), and the
rights and obligations of the parties under this Article VIII with respect to
any breaches of such representations and warranties, shall survive the
Closing for a period of three years; (c) the representations and warranties
contained in Section 3.12 (Employee Benefit Plans), Section 3.15 (Taxes) and
Section 3.25 (Environmental Matters) shall survive the Closing for a period
ending on the ninetieth (90th) day after the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations, and the rights and obligations of the parties under
this Article VIII with respect to any breaches of such representations and
warranties shall survive the Closing for a period ending at the same time and
(d) the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.02
(Capitalization, Title to Shares), Section 3.03 (Execution and Performance of
Agreement; Validity and Binding Nature), and Section 4.02 (Execution and
Performance of Agreement; Validity and Binding Nature) shall survive the
Closing indefinitely. No claims for indemnification for breaches of
representations and warranties shall be made under Article VI or this Article
VIII after the expiration of the applicable period of survival. The rights
and obligations of the parties under this Article VIII with respect
to breaches of covenants shall survive the Closing indefinitely.   SECTION
8.06 Mitigation of Damages. Each Indemnified Party shall take commercially
reasonable steps to mitigate any Damages in respect of which a claim could be
made under this Article VIII or any other provision of this Agreement,
provided such mitigation does not unreasonably disrupt the ongoing business
operations of the Indemnified Party. Any costs or reasonable out of pocket
expenses incurred by an Indemnified Party in connection with such mitigation
shall constitute "Damages" that may be recovered by the Indemnified Party
under this Article VIII. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that
an Indemnified Party shall not be obliged to make or pursue any claim
or right it may have against an insurer or any other Person for
insurance, indemnity, reimbursement or other payment.   SECTION 8.07
Calculation of Damages. The amount of any Damages for which indemnification
is provided under this Article VIII shall be computed net of (a) in the case
of Section 8.01, any accruals or reserves established on the Closing Date
Balance Sheet with respect to the matters to which those Damages relate
and (b) any third-party insurance proceeds and recoveries in respect of third
party indemnification obligations actually received by the Indemnified Party
in connection with such Damages. If an Indemnified Party receives such
insurance proceeds or indemnification recoveries in connection with Damages
for which it has received indemnification, such party shall refund to the
Indemnifying Party the amount of such insurance proceeds when received, up to
the amount of indemnification received.   SECTION 8.08 Exclusive Remedy.
Except as otherwise provided below, the indemnification provided for in this
Article VIII, subject to the limitations set forth herein or therein, shall
be the exclusive post-Closing remedy available to any Indemnified Party in
connection with any Damages arising out of the matters set forth in this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder; provided, however, that
nothing herein will limit in any way any such party\'s (A) remedies in
respect of fraud, a violation of Rule 10b-5 under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, or an intentional and wrongful breach of a representation, warranty
or covenant or (B) rights hereunder or otherwise to injunctive or other
equitable relief    -61-    to enforce its rights under this Agreement
or otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.  
SECTION 8.09 Limitation of Damages UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL THE
SELLER PARENT OR THE SELLER HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO THE PURCHASER, THE
PURCHASER PARENT OR ANY OF THEIR AFFILIATES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR, AND THE
PURCHASER, THE PURCHASER PARENT AND THEIR AFFILIATES SHALL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT
TO CLAIM OR RECOVER FROM THE SELLER PARENT OR THE SELLER, ANY PUNITIVE
DAMAGES, WHETHER FORESEEABLE OR UNFORESEEABLE, HOWSOEVER CAUSED OR ON ANY
THEORY OF LIABILITY, EVEN IF THE SELLER PARENT OR THE SELLER HAS BEEN ADVISED
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE EXCEPT AND TO THE EXTENT THAT
SUCH DAMAGES ARE AWARDED PURSUANT TO A THIRD PARTY CLAIM.   ARTICLE IX
