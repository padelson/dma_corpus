20% is not attracted is if the Seller furnishes the following alternate documents and particulars: (1)&nbsp;name, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">e-mail</FONT> id, contact number; 2) address in the country of residence; 3) tax residency certificate
(TRC); and 4) tax identification number (TIN) in the country of residence - Where TIN is not available, a unique identification number is required to be furnished through which the taxpayer is identified in the country of residence. Do note that it
is imperative for the Seller to obtain the PAN since the PAN will also be required for the Buyer&#146;s withholding tax return, for claiming credit of taxes withheld by the Buyer, and for filing the Seller&#146;s income tax return in India.
