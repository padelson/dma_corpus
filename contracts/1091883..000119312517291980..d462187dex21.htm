4 Section 2.3 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(a) _Preliminary Purchase Price Adjustment_. No later than three (3) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer
(together with reasonable backup materials) a statement in the form set forth
on _Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_ of the Sellers Disclosure Letter __ (the "
_Estimated Statement_ ") setting forth Sellers good faith estimate of the
Closing Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_ "), as
prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles. For purposes of the
calculation of Net Working Capital of the FH Business, all FH Shares,
Acquired FH Assets and FH Assets shall be deemed to have been conveyed as of
the Effective Time (regardless of any delayed transfer pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 5.16_ or  _Section_ __ _ 5.17_) and shall be included, to the extent
applicable, in the calculation of the Final Net Working Capital.

 

(b) _Post-Closing Purchase Price Determination_.

 

(i) As soon as practicable, but in no event later than forty-five (45) days
after the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer (together with
reasonable backup materials) a statement (the " _Preliminary Net Working
Capital Statement_ "), prepared by Seller in accordance with the Accounting
Principles and in substantially the same format as the Estimated Statement,
containing a reasonably detailed calculation by Seller of the Closing Net
Working Capital.

(ii) If Buyer disagrees with Sellers calculation of the Closing Net Working
Capital as set forth in the Preliminary Net Working Capital Statement, Buyer
shall promptly, but in no event later than forty-five (45) days after
receiving the Preliminary Net Working Capital Statement (the " _Review
Period_ ") deliver to Seller written notice (the " _Dispute Notice_ ")
describing its dispute by specifying those items or amounts as to which Buyer
disagrees, together with Buyers determination of such disputed items and
amounts (the " _Disputed Items_ "). If Buyer either gives notice that it
agrees with Sellers calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital as set
forth in the Preliminary Net Working Capital Statement or fails to deliver a
Dispute Notice within the Review Period, Seller and Buyer agree that the
Preliminary Net Working Capital Statement shall be deemed to set forth the
Closing Net Working Capital with respect to those items that have been agreed
upon or for which Buyer shall have failed to deliver a Dispute Notice (and
shall constitute the Final Net Working Capital). If Buyer delivers a Dispute
Notice to Seller within the Review Period, Buyer and Seller will use good
faith efforts to resolve the dispute during the thirty (30)-day period
commencing on the date Buyer delivers the Dispute Notice to Seller. If Seller
and Buyer are not able to resolve all Disputed Items within such thirty
(30)-day period, then either party shall have the right to submit the Disputed
Items remaining in dispute following the expiration of such thirty (30)-day
period to the New York, New York office of Grant Thornton LLP, or if Grant
Thornton LLP is unwilling to serve, another mutually acceptable
internationally recognized independent accounting firm (the " _Accounting
Firm_ "). Subject to the Accounting Firms execution of a customary
confidentiality agreement, the Accounting Firm shall be given reasonable
access to all relevant records of the FH Business to calculate the Closing Net
Working Capital. If any remaining Disputed Items are submitted to the
Accounting Firm for resolution, each of Buyer and Seller shall submit to the
Accounting Firm (with a copy to the other party) a written memorandum setting
forth such partys positions with respect to such Disputed Items and may

 



5  include with such submission reasonable backup materials. The Accounting
Firm shall calculate, based solely on the written submissions of Seller, on
the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, and not by independent
investigation, the Closing Net Working Capital and shall be instructed that
its calculation (A) must be made in accordance with the Accounting Principles
and _Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_ of the Sellers Disclosure Letter, and (B) with
respect to each item in dispute, must be within the range of values
established for such amount as determined by reference to the value assigned
to such amount by Buyer in the Dispute Notice and by Seller in
the Preliminary Net Working Capital Statement. The Accounting Firm shall
submit such calculation to Seller and Buyer as soon as practicable, but in any
event within thirty (30) days after the remaining issues in dispute are
submitted to the Accounting Firm. The determination by the Accounting Firm of
the Closing Net Working Capital, as set forth in a written notice delivered to
Buyer and Seller by the Accounting Firm in accordance with this Agreement,
will be binding and conclusive on Buyer and Seller, except in cases of fraud
or manifest error. A judgment on the determination made by the Accounting Firm
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)_ may be entered in and enforced by any
court having jurisdiction thereover. The Closing Net Working Capital as
determined after all disputes have been resolved in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)(ii)_ is referred to herein as the " _Final Net Working
Capital_ ".

 

(iii) The costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by Buyer in
the proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of the items that are
successfully disputed by Seller (as finally determined by the Accounting Firm)
bears to the aggregate dollar amount of the items submitted to the Accounting
Firm and by Seller in the proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of
the disputed items that are unsuccessfully disputed by Buyer (as finally
determined by the Accounting Firm) bears to the aggregate dollar amount of the
items submitted to the Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm shall include such
apportionment of its fees and expenses in its determination.

(iv) In connection with Buyers review of the Preliminary Net Working Capital
Statement, Seller shall (i) provide reasonable access, during normal business
hours and upon reasonable notice, to its employees and all work papers,
schedules, memoranda and other documents prepared or reviewed by Seller or any
of its employees and accountants or other representatives which are relevant
to the Preliminary Net Working Capital Statement (which access shall be
provided promptly after request by Buyer and/or its representatives) and (ii)
use its reasonable best efforts to cause Sellers independent accountant to
communicate and cooperate with Buyer and its representatives with respect to
such review. The Review Period shall be extended by one day for each day that
Seller is in breach of its obligations under the preceding sentence.

(v) The process set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)_ shall be the
exclusive remedy of Seller and Buyer for any disputes related to the Closing
Net Working Capital, _provided_ that this clause (v) shall not preclude or
impair the ability of any party to exercise any of its rights or remedies
under  _Section_ __ _ 9.4_ provided that no Person shall be entitled to
indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 9.4_ for any Losses to the extent such
Losses represent amounts taken into account in the determination of the Final
Net Working Capital.

 



6 (c) _Final Purchase Price Determination_.

 

(i) The " _Final Cash Purchase Price_ " shall mean an amount equal to the (1)
Preliminary Cash Purchase Price (2) (x)  _plus_ , if the Final Net Working
Capital as determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)(ii)_ exceeds the
Estimated Net Working Capital, the amount of such excess, (y) _ minus_, if
the Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds the Final Net Working Capital as
determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)(ii)_, the amount of such excess
(the " _Final Closing Adjustment_ "), (3) (x) _plus_ if the Primary U.S. Asset
Transfer Amount exceeds the Estimated U.S. Asset Transfer Amount, the amount
of such excess, (y) _ minus_, if the Estimated U.S. Asset Transfer Amount
exceeds the Primary U.S. Asset Transfer Amount, the amount of such excess (the
" _Final Pension Adjustment_ "). The " _Final Purchase Price_ " shall mean
the Final Cash Purchase Price and the Buyer Stock Consideration, together.

 

(ii) Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, shall, within five (5) Business Days
after the determination of the Final Net Working Capital pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)(ii)_ make payment to the other by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated by the other of
the amount of the Final Closing Adjustment as determined pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.3(c)(i)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller agrees to
make one or more installment payments toward the payment provided for in the
first sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(c)(ii)_ at such times as amounts
reflected in the calculation of the Final Net Working Capital become fixed and
are not Disputed Items and the non-Disputed Items are such that a payment
would be due and owing to Buyer pursuant to the first sentence of this
_Section_ __ _ 2.3(c)(ii)_. Similarly, Buyer agrees to make one or more
installment payments toward the payment provided for in the first sentence of
this  _Section_ __ _ 2.3(c)(ii)_ at such times as amounts reflected in the
calculation of the Final Net Working Capital become fixed and are not Disputed
Items and the non-Disputed Items are such that a payment would be due and
owing to Seller pursuant to the first sentence of this _Section_ __ _
2.3(c)(ii)_. The final installment payment to be made after the determination
of Final Net Working Capital shall take into account all previously-made
installment payments.

(iii) Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, shall within five (5) Business
Days after the U.S. Pension Transfer Date make payment to the other by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated by
the other of the Final Pension Adjustment.

 

Section 2.4 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Within ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall provide to Seller an allocation of the Final
Purchase Price (including an allocation of the Buyer Stock Consideration and
Final Cash Purchase Price) and the Assumed Liabilities, to the extent
relevant, together with any other amounts properly treated as
consideration for U.S. federal income tax purposes (including adjustments to
the Final Purchase Price or the Assumed Liabilities for purposes of this
Agreement) among the Acquired FH Assets and the FH Shares and, to the extent
relevant, the assets of the Transferred FH Companies, in accordance with
Sections 338(b)(5) and 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder and Section 2.4 of the Sellers Disclosure Letter (the " _Purchase
Price Allocation_ "). Prior to and after the Closing Date, Seller shall
cooperate as reasonably requested by Buyer, including providing any
information reasonably requested by Buyer that is reasonably available to
Seller, to enable Buyer and its accountants to prepare timely the Purchase
Price Allocation. Seller shall be permitted to review the Purchase Price
Allocation delivered by Buyer and shall provide any comments thereon to Buyer
within fifteen (15) days of Sellers receipt of the 

 



7  Purchase Price Allocation. Buyer and Seller shall use good faith efforts to
resolve any dispute regarding preparation of the Purchase Price Allocation. If
Buyer and Seller cannot resolve any such dispute within fifteen (15) days of
Buyers receipt of Sellers comments, such dispute shall be taken to the
Independent Accountants. The costs of the Independent Accountants shall be
borne by the party that loses the dispute. The Purchase Price Allocation as
finally agreed between Seller and Buyer or as finally determined by the
Independent Accountants, as the case may be, in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.4_ of the Sellers Disclosure Letter is referred to as the " _Final
Purchase Price Allocation_." Seller and Buyer shall be bound by the Final
Purchase Price Allocation for all Tax purposes, shall prepare and file all Tax
Returns (including Form 8883 and any supplements thereto) on a basis
consistent with the Final Purchase Price Allocation and shall not take any
position inconsistent with the Final Purchase Price Allocation on any Tax
Return or in any proceeding before any Tax Authority, in each case except
as otherwise required by applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, Buyer and Seller agree that for purposes of the Purchase Price
Allocation and the Final Purchase Price Allocation, no amount of the Buyer
Stock Consideration shall be allocated to any FH Share Seller or FH Asset
Seller that is not (a) a member of Sellers U.S. consolidated group or (b) an
entity disregarded as separate from a member of Sellers U.S. consolidated
group, in each case as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Section 2.5 _Adjustments to Buyer Stock Consideration_. If at any time
during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, any
change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of Buyer shall occur as a
result of any reclassification, stock split (including reverse stock split) or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or
stock distribution with a record date during such period, the number of shares
of Buyer Common Stock constituting the Buyer Stock Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted; provided, however, that nothing in this _Section_ __ _
2.5_ shall be deemed to permit or authorize any such change that is not
otherwise authorized or permitted pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 3.11 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) _Section_ __ _ 3.11(a)_ of the Sellers Disclosure Letter contains a list
as of the date hereof of each material Employee Benefit Plan and separately
identifies (x) whether each such material Employee Benefit Plan is a
Transferred Benefit Plan or Seller Benefit Plan and (y) whether each such
Transferred Benefit Plan or Seller Benefit Plan is an International Plan. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Employee Benefit Plan_ " means each (i)
"employee benefit plan" (within the meaning of ERISA, whether or not subject
to ERISA), (ii) stock option, stock 

 



15  appreciation right, phantom stock, restricted stock, consulting, severance,
termination protection, change in control, transaction bonus, retention, or

Employees, or for which any Transferred FH Company or any Closing Subsidiary
has or may have any Liability, other than in each case plans, programs,
arrangements, agreements or other understandings that are mandated by
applicable Law, that do not provide benefits in excess of such mandates, and
that are maintained either solely by a Governmental Authority or on behalf of
a Governmental Authority by a third-party entity other than Seller or one of
its Affiliates (such as Social Security contributions or the foreign
equivalent thereof). References in this  _Section_ __ _ 3.11_ and _Section_
__ _ 3.12_ to Liabilities of Transferred FH Companies and/or the Closing
Subsidiaries include not only those in place before the Closing Date but also
those assumed as a result of any transfer laws applicable to Employees or
Former Employees.

(b) Seller has made available to Buyer, with respect to each
material Transferred Benefit Plan, (i) the plan document, (ii) the most
recent summary plan description, (iii) the most recent annual report on Form
5500, (iv) the most recent IRS opinion or determination letter, as applicable,
with respect to each Transferred Benefit Plan intended to qualify under
Section 401(a) of the Code, and (v) with respect to any International Plan,
materials that are substantially similar (taking into account differences in
applicable Law and practice) to those required by clauses (ii) through (iv).
Seller has made available to Buyer, with respect to each material Seller
Benefit Plan, a copy of the plan document or a summary thereof.

 

(c) Each Transferred Benefit Plan has been operated and maintained in material
compliance with its terms and applicable Law. Each other Employee Benefit
Plan has been maintained in material compliance with its terms and with
applicable Law, except where such failure to comply or administer such plan
would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to result
in Liability for Buyer, the Transferred FH Companies or the Closing
Subsidiaries. Each Employee Benefit Plan intended to be qualified within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination
letter from the IRS or is entitled to rely upon a favorable opinion issued by
the IRS, and nothing has occurred with respect to the operation of such
Employee Benefit Plans that could reasonably be expected to cause the
revocation of any such letter or opinion.

 

(d) No Transferred Benefit Plan is (x) a "multiemployer plan," as such term is
defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, or (y) subject to Section 302 or Title IV
of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. No Liability under Section 302 or Title
IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code has been incurred by a Transferred FH
Company or their Closing Subsidiaries that has not been satisfied in full and
no condition exists that would reasonably be expected to result in any

 



16  such Liability to a Transferred FH Company or their Closing Subsidiaries.
Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to be material to the FH Business, taken as a whole, with respect to each
Employee Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or
Section 412 or 4971 of the Code: (i) there has been no (A) failure by Seller
or its ERISA Affiliates to make by its due date a required installment under
Section 430(j) of the Code or any failure by any such Employee Benefit Plan to
satisfy the minimum funding standards (within the meaning of Section 412 of
the Code or Section 302 of ERISA) applicable to such Employee Benefit Plan,
whether or not waived, for which Buyer, the Transferred FH Company or their
Closing Subsidiaries would have any material Liability; or (B) determination
that any such Employee Benefit Plan is, or is expected to be, in "at risk"
status (within the meaning of Section 430 of the Code or Section 303 of
ERISA); (ii) the fair market value of the assets of such Employee Benefit Plan
equals or exceeds the actuarial present value of all accrued benefits under
such Employee Benefit Plan (whether or not vested) on a termination basis;
(iii) no reportable event within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for
which the 30-day notice requirement has not been waived has occurred, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
result in the occurrence of any such reportable event; (iv) all premiums to
the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the " _PBGC_ ") have been timely
paid in full; (v) no Liability (other than for premiums to the PBGC) under
Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by Seller or its
ERISA Affiliates; and (vi) the PBGC has not instituted proceedings to
terminate any such Employee Benefit Plan and, to the Knowledge of Seller, no
condition exists that reasonably could be expected to present a risk that such
proceedings will be instituted or that would constitute grounds under Section
4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or the appointment of a trustee to
administer, any such Employee Benefit Plan.

 

(e) Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.11(e)_ of the Sellers Disclosure
Letter, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone
or together with any other event) will (i) entitle any Employee or Former
Employee to any payment or employee benefit, including any bonus, retention,
severance, retirement or job security payment or benefit; (ii) accelerate the
time of payment, funding or vesting of any employee benefits or compensation
of, or increase the amount of employee benefits or compensation due to, any
Employee or Former Employee; (iii) give rise to any "excess parachute payment"
as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code; or (iv) limit or restrict the
right, after the Closing, of Buyer, to merge, amend or terminate any
Transferred Benefit Plan.

(f) Each Transferred Benefit Plan that is an International Plan, if intended
to qualify for special Tax treatment, meets all applicable requirements of
Law, and if required to be funded, book-reserved or secured by an insurance
policy, is so funded, book-reserved or secured, based on reasonable actuarial
assumptions.

 

(g) With respect to Employee Benefit Plans, there is no Action pending (other
than routine claims for benefits or, with respect to Employee Benefit Plans
that are not Transferred Benefit Plans, for any Action that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to result in material
Liability for Buyer or any Transferred FH Company or their Closing
Subsidiaries) or, to Knowledge of Seller, threatened with respect to such
plan or against the assets of any Employee Benefit Plan. Except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the
FH Business, taken as a whole, no Transferred Benefit Plan is or since
December 31, 2013 has been the subject of, or has received or provided notice
that it is the subject of, examination by a Governmental Authority or been a
participant in a government sponsored amnesty, voluntary compliance or
similar program.

 



17 (h) Each Employee Benefit Plan covering any Employee or Former Employee
subject to U.S. income Taxes and that is or forms part of a "nonqualified
deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code has
been administered in documentary and operational compliance in all material
respects with Section 409A of the Code. Neither Seller, its Affiliates, nor
any Transferred FH Company or Closing Subsidiary is required to provide any
Employee or Former Employee with a gross-up, make-whole or other additional
payment with respect to Taxes, interests or penalties imposed under any Tax
provisions, including Code Sections 409A or 4999.

 

(i) Neither Seller nor any Affiliate has promised or currently provides any
employer premium subsidies or other coverage with respect to post-employment
health and welfare benefits for any Employee or Former Employee, except as
required by applicable Law.

Section 3.12  _Labor Matters_.

(a) Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.12(a)_ of the Sellers Disclosure
Letter, neither Seller nor any Affiliate has, since December 31, 2014, been
party to, nor bound by, any material CBA, and no Transferred Employee is
represented by any labor union, labor organization, works council or other
similar body other than in connection with an industry agreement or national
labor agreement with respect to their employment with Seller, nor, to the
Knowledge of Seller, are any efforts underway with respect to such
representation. There are no pending (for which Seller or its Affiliates has
received notice) material grievances, labor arbitrations or other labor
disputes relating to Employees. With respect to Employees (or, where Liability
may still apply to the Transferred FH Companies or their Closing
Subsidiaries, Former Employees), Seller and its Affiliates have not engaged
in any material unfair labor practices, as defined in the National Labor
Relations Act, or materially breached the requirements of any similar Laws
applicable to such Employees. Since December 31, 2014, no Employees have
engaged in any material strike, picketing, labor disturbance, slowdown or work
stoppage affecting Seller or its Affiliates. The consent or consultation of,
or the rendering of formal advice by, any labor or trade union, works council
or other employee representative body is not required for Seller and its
Affiliates to enter into this Agreement or to consummate any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) With respect to Employees, Seller Transferred Employees, and where
Liability may still apply to the Transferred FH Companies or their Closing
Subsidiaries, Former Employees, Seller and its Affiliates are, and have been
since December 31, 2014, in material compliance with all applicable Laws
relating to labor and employment, including those relating to labor
management relations, wages, hours, overtime, employee classification (for
purposes of overtime and in determining the status of consultants or
independent contractors), discrimination, sexual harassment, civil rights,
affirmative action, work authorization, immigration, safety and health,
workers compensation, wage payment and the payment and withholding of Taxes
and with the terms of any individual service providing contracts covering
Employees, Seller Transferred Employees, or where Liability may still apply
to the Transferred FH Companies or

 



18  their Closing Subsidiaries, Former Employees. No Employees are covered by
any consent decree with, or citation by, any Governmental Authority relating
to employees or employment practices that would apply to Buyer, the
Transferred FH Companies, or their Closing Subsidiaries, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the
FH Business, taken as a whole. Each U.S. Employees employment may be
terminated with not more than one months advance notice (except as otherwise
required by applicable Law or any CBA). No Actions are open and pending (or
since December 31, 2014 have been settled or otherwise closed) regarding
Employees with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or other
Governmental Authority regulating the employment or compensation of
individuals, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to be material to the FH Business, taken as a whole. Neither
Seller nor any Affiliate has taken any action that would reasonably be
expected to cause Buyer or any of its Affiliates to have any Liability or
other obligation under the WARN Act following the Closing Date.

registrations or other arrangements in place as required by applicable Law in

requisite corporate authority and power to execute and deliver this
Agreement, the Local Purchase Agreements, the Transition Services Agreement
and each of the other Transaction Documents to which it is or will be a party

Transition Services Agreement and each of the other Transaction Documents and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been

Stock pursuant to this Agreement will not obligate Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue shares of Buyer Common Stock or other securities of
Buyer or its Subsidiaries to any Person (other than Seller or its Affiliates)
and will not result in a right of any holder of Buyers securities to adjust
the exercise, conversion, exchange or reset price under any of such
securities. Except for the Stockholder Agreement or as contemplated by this
Agreement, there are no outstanding Contracts or other obligations of Buyer
or any of its Subsidiaries requiring the registration for sale of any shares

representations and warranties set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.25_, the

any material respect the ability of Buyer to perform its obligations under
this Agreement and to consummate the Sale or other material transactions
contemplated hereby, (c) conflict with, result in a violation or breach of, or

respect the ability of Buyer to perform its obligations under this Agreement
and to consummate the Sale or other material transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 4.5 _Brokers and Finders_. None of Buyer or any of its officers,
directors or employees has employed any investment banker, broker or finder
or incurred any Liability for any investment banking fees, brokerage fees,
commissions or finders fees in connection with the transactions contemplated

the event the Closing does not occur, any Transferred FH Company or its
Closing Subsidiaries, has or could have any Liability.

conditions of which (including any "market flex" provisions included in the

amended or modified in any respect. The Debt Commitment Letter, in the form so

the Knowledge of Buyer, the other parties thereto, enforceable in accordance
with its terms, subject to the qualification that such enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other laws of general
application relating to or affecting rights of creditors or by general
principles of equity. Except for the Fee Letter, of which Buyer has delivered
true, accurate and complete redacted copies to Seller (provided that only the
fee amounts, pricing caps and other economic terms, and the rates and amounts
included in the "market flex" provisions (but not covenants), may be redacted,
none of which redacted provisions could adversely affect the conditionality,
enforceability, termination or aggregate principal amount of the Debt
Financing) prior to the date hereof, there are no other agreements, side
letters, or arrangements relating to the Debt Commitment Letter that would
reasonably be expected to affect the amount, availability or conditionality of
the Debt Financing. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default or breach on the part of Buyer under any term or condition of the Debt
Commitment Letter or result in any portion of the Debt Financing not being
available on the Closing Date. As of the date of this Agreement, no lender
party to the Debt Commitment Letter has notified Buyer of its intention to
terminate the Debt Commitment Letter or not to provide the Debt Financing. As
of the date of this Agreement, assuming the accuracy of the representations
and warranties set forth in _Article III_ such that the condition set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 8.3(a)_ is satisfied and the performance by Seller of its
obligations under this Agreement and the

 



33  satisfaction of the other conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ and
_Section_ __ _ 8.3_, Buyer has no reason to believe that it will be unable
to satisfy, on a timely basis, any term or condition of closing to be
satisfied by it contained in the Debt Commitment Letter or that the full
amounts committed pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter will not be available
as of the Closing if the conditions of closing to be satisfied by it
contained in the Debt Commitment Letter are satisfied. Buyer has fully paid
any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Debt Commitment
Letter to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement, and Buyer will pay
when due all other commitment or other fees arising under the Debt Commitment
Letter as and when they become payable. Assuming the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Section 8.1 and Section 8.3 and that the Debt
Financing is funded in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter, the
aggregate proceeds from the Debt Financing constitute all of the financing
required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and are sufficient in amount for Buyer to pay the Preliminary Cash
Purchase Price (as well as the Final Cash Purchase Price) and all associated
fees, costs and expenses in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (the " _Required Amount_ "). The Debt Commitment Letter
contains all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the parties
thereunder to make the Debt Financing available to Buyer on the terms therein,
other than the payment of customary fees. As of the date of this Agreement,
the Debt Commitment Letter has not been withdrawn and Buyer does not know of
any facts or circumstances that may be expected to result in any of the
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter not being satisfied.

regarding Buyers, its Affiliates, or any other Persons ability to obtain
financing for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

Subsidiaries;

(o) merge or consolidate with or into another Person; or

(p) agree to take any of the actions described in this _Section_ __ _ 5.1_.

 

Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, prior to the Closing,

or causing to be made capital contributions or similar transactions to enable
such Transferred FH Company or such Closing Subsidiary to repay or otherwise
extinguish such amounts and (iii) take any action contemplated pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 5.15_, including any action with respect to or implementing
the Pre-Closing Restructuring Transactions.

Relations, Colfax Corporation, or such person or persons as he/she shall
designate; _provided_ , _further_ , that any such access shall be conducted at
a reasonable time, upon reasonable advance notice to Seller, and in such a
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the operation of any business
conducted by any Transferred FH Company or its Closing Subsidiaries;
_provided_ , _further_ , that any such access or information request shall not
involve any Phase 2 environmental assessment or other invasive sampling,
investigation or work of any kind. All such information and access

 



43  shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the confidentiality
agreement dated May 8, 2017 between Buyer and Seller (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller and its Subsidiaries
shall not be required to provide any such information (i) as and to the extent
it relates to the Excluded Businesses, the Excluded Assets or the Retained
Liabilities, (ii) if the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries believes in good
faith that doing so presents a significant risk, based on advice of outside
counsel of resulting in a loss of the ability to successfully assert a claim
of Privilege or (iii) if Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand,
and Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, are adverse parties
in a litigation (other than a litigation with respect to this Agreement) and

that, in the case of clause (ii) above, the parties hereto shall reasonably
cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such information
without resulting in a loss of the ability to successfully assert a claim of
Privilege.

Section 5.3 _Certain Governmental Approvals_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts (subject to, and in
accordance with, Regulatory Law) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Regulatory Laws to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, as promptly as practicable.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 5.3(a)_ above:

(i) Seller and Buyer shall, as promptly as practicable, but in no event later
than (x) ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof, file the notification
and report form pursuant to the HSR Act and (y) fifteen (15) Business Days
after the date hereof, effect all other necessary notifications, or
registrations to obtain the Required Antitrust Approvals, in each case as
required for the transactions contemplated hereby;

 

(ii) Seller and Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each
other in (A) determining whether any filings are required to be made with, or
consents, permits, authorizations, waivers or approvals are required to be
obtained from, any third parties or other Governmental Authorities under any
other applicable Regulatory Law in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (B) timely making all such filings and
timely seeking all such consents, permits, authorizations or approvals;

 

(iii) Seller and Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to make, as promptly

the State Departments Directorate of Defense Trade Controls that are required
under ITAR, including applicable notifications contemplated under 22 C.F.R. §
122.4.

 

(iv) Seller and Buyer shall keep each other apprised of the status of matters
relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and promptly furnish the other with copies of notices or other communications
(or, in the case of

 



44  material oral communications, advise the other orally of such
communications) between Seller or Buyer and their representatives and counsel,
as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, and any
Governmental Authority with respect to such transactions. Seller and Buyer
shall keep each other timely apprised of any inquiries or requests for
additional information from any Governmental Authority pursuant to any
Regulatory Law, and shall comply promptly with any such reasonable inquiry or
request. Seller and Buyer shall permit counsel for the other party reasonable
opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the
other party in connection with, any proposed written communication to any
Governmental Authority. Each of Seller and Buyer agrees not to participate in
any substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone, with
any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to
the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Authority, gives the other
party the opportunity to attend and participate. Neither party shall consent
to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to
any voluntary delay of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or withdraw its notification and report form pursuant to the
HSR Act or any other filing made pursuant to any Regulatory Law unless the
other party has given its prior written consent to such extension or delay;
and

 

(v) without limiting _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)(iv)_ above, each of Seller and
Buyer, in the event that any permanent or preliminary injunction or other
order is entered or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any
proceeding that would make consummation of the acquisition of the FH Shares,
the Acquired FH Assets or the other transactions contemplated hereby in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would prevent or
delay consummation of the acquisition of the FH Shares, the Acquired FH Assets
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall use its
reasonable best efforts necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such
injunction or order so as to permit such consummation on a schedule as close
as possible to that contemplated by this Agreement unless, by mutual
agreement, Seller and Buyer decide that litigation is not in their respective
best interests.

(c) In the event that (i) any Non-Material Antitrust Approval of any
Governmental Authority is not obtained on or prior to the Closing Date or (ii)
there exists, at such time as the conditions to the Closing shall have been
satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that are satisfied by action
taken at the Closing, _provided_ , that such conditions would be so
satisfied), any Regulatory Law (except with respect to the Required Antitrust
Approvals) that makes illegal or enjoins or prevents in any respect
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (each of
clauses (i) and (ii), a " _Delayed Antitrust Approval_ "), then Seller and
Buyer shall effect the Closing (including payment of the entire
Preliminary Purchase Price), subject to the terms of this Agreement
(including, but not limited to, _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)_), with respect to all
FH Shares, the Acquired FH Assets and Assumed Liabilities outside of the
jurisdiction of any such Governmental Authority or such Regulatory Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the obligations of the parties hereto set forth
in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ shall continue with respect to each such Delayed
Antitrust Approval until such Delayed Antitrust Approval is obtained, and
upon receipt of such Delayed Antitrust Approval, the parties hereto shall
effect the transfer of the affected FH Shares, Acquired FH Assets and Assumed
Liabilities in accordance with this Agreement and the applicable Local
Purchase Agreement. Each such transfer, upon occurrence, shall be retroactive
to and be deemed to have occurred on the Closing Date.

 



45  Furthermore, as of the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer shall, subject to
applicable Law, enter into mutually agreeable alternative business
arrangements consistent with the terms of this Agreement or other
arrangements which provide Buyer with the net economic benefit or loss (after
taking into account any adverse Tax consequences to Seller) of, and liability
for, the affected FH Shares, the FH Assets and Assumed Liabilities from and
after the Closing Date and continuing until each Delayed Antitrust Approval
is obtained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any Delayed
Antitrust Approval has not been obtained within twenty-four (24) months of the
Closing Date, Seller shall have the right at any time thereafter, in its sole
discretion, to sell any of the affected FH Shares, the FH Assets or Assumed
Liabilities to a third party at a price determined in good faith by Seller to
be a commercially reasonable price, and upon consummation of any such sale,
(x) Seller shall pay the proceeds of such sale to Buyer ( _provided_ that
Seller may reduce such payment by an amount equal to its fees and expenses (or
an estimate thereof) and any Taxes payable as a result of such sale) and (y)
the obligations of the parties pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(c)_ (other
than pursuant to the preceding clause (x)) with respect to such FH Shares, the
FH Assets or Assumed Liabilities shall cease.

(d) None of Buyer or the Subsidiaries of Buyer shall, and shall not cause any
Person to, without the prior consent of Seller, acquire (whether via merger,
consolidation, stock or asset purchase or otherwise), or enter into any
definitive agreement to so acquire, any assets of or any equity in any other
Person or any business or division thereof (excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, any acquisition of any goods or services in the ordinary course of
business), unless that acquisition or agreement would not reasonably be
expected to, in any material respect, (x) increase the risk of not obtaining
any authorizations, consents, orders, declarations or approvals of any
Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or the expiration or termination of any waiting period under
any Regulatory Law; (y) increase the risk of any Governmental Authority
entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or materially increase the risk of not being
able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise; or (z) delay or prevent
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Buyer
Common Stock constituting the Buyer Stock Consideration to be approved for
listing on the NYSE, with such listing to be effective as of the Closing,
subject only to official notice of issuance. 

Section 5.4 _Further Assurances_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement and subject to  _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, each of the parties hereto
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts before and after the Closing Date to
take or cause to be taken all action, to do or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other party hereto in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective, in
the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including, but not limited to, (i) the satisfaction of the
conditions precedent to the obligations of the other party; (ii) the obtaining
of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from Governmental Authorities
or other third parties required to be obtained by such party, or its
Affiliates, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(other than with respect to Regulatory Laws which are the subject of _Section_
__ _ 5.3_); and (iii) the execution and delivery of such instruments, and
the taking of such other actions, as the other party hereto may reasonably
require in order to carry out the intent of this Agreement.

Letter hereto, all intercompany arrangements and agreements, whether written
or oral, providing, leasing or licensing goods, services, tangible or
intangible properties or joint activities between Seller or any of the
Retained Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of the Transferred FH
Companies or their Closing Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall be
terminated and of no further force and effect effective as of the Closing (or,
to the extent that any equity interests in a Transferred FH Company or Closing
Subsidiary of a Transferred FH Company are not transferred to Buyer at the
Closing pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.16_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.17_, such later

Subsidiaries (and their respective officers, directors and employees, acting
in their capacity as such) from any Liability, obligation or responsibility to
any of them for any and all past actions or failures to take action prior to
the Closing, including any actions which may be deemed to have been negligent
or grossly negligent, relating to or arising out of Contracts with Seller or
a Subsidiary thereof or the operation or conduct of any businesses, Assets
(including activities performed thereat) or operations managed or operated by,
or operationally related to, directly or indirectly, to the FH Business or
the Excluded Businesses, except for any obligation pursuant to the provisions
of the Transaction Documents.

 

(c) Except to the extent provided to the contrary in Section 5.5(a), effective
as of the Closing, Seller, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, including
each of the Retained Subsidiaries, effective as of the Closing, hereby
releases the Transferred FH Companies and their Closing Subsidiaries (and
their respective officers, directors and employees, acting in their capacity
as such) from any Liability, obligation or responsibility to any of them for
any and all past actions or failures to take action prior to the Closing,
including any actions which may be deemed to have been negligent or grossly
negligent, except for any obligation pursuant to the provisions of the
Transaction Documents.

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
Seller its Subsidiaries and the Transferred FH Companies and their Closing
Subsidiaries shall be permitted to maintain through the Closing Date their
respective cash management systems, and periodically settle intercompany
balances with respect to intercompany borrowings consistent with past
practices (including through dividends and capital contributions). Seller and
its Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred FH Companies and their Closing
Subsidiaries) shall have the right to withdraw all Cash Equivalents of the

47 (e) Without limiting anything set forth in this Section 5.5, of Sellers
Disclosure Letter, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to settle
all outstanding intercompany accounts, whether payables or receivables,
between Seller or any of the Retained Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
of the Transferred FH Companies or their Closing Subsidiaries, on the other
hand, with effect as of the Closing Date (it being understood that the
settlement or cancellation of such amounts shall not in any way affect the
Transition Services Agreement or any amounts which may be payable pursuant to
the Transition Services Agreement); provided, however, that if any such
intercompany accounts are not settled or cancelled as of the Closing, Seller
and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate to settle
or cancel such intercompany accounts as promptly as practicable following the
Closing without liability to Buyer (which liability shall be calculated net of
any Cash Equivalents of the Transferred FH Companies and their Closing
Subsidiaries as of the Closing that would otherwise constitute Excluded
Assets, which Cash Equivalents shall not constitute Excluded Assets or
constitute Later Discovered Assets to the extent used by Buyer to satisfy such
intercompany accounts).

 

Section 5.6 _Provision of Corporate Records_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, as permitted by Law, Seller
shall use its reasonable best efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to
Buyer all Transferred FH Books and Records then in the possession of Seller or

deliver or cause to be delivered to Seller all Seller Books and Records then

Subsidiaries. The foregoing shall be limited by the following specific
provisions:

electronic media) shall be so sub-divided, and the original of the portion
such document (other than that stored on electronic media) which constitutes a
Transferred FH Book and Record shall be provided to Buyer (with a copy thereof
provided to Seller) and the original of the portion such document (other than
that stored on electronic media) shall constitute a Seller Book and Record.

records at times and in a manner reasonably acceptable to all parties.

 



48 (c) Each party may refuse to furnish any Information if it believes in good
faith that doing so presents, based on advice of counsel (which can be inside
counsel), a significant risk of loss of the ability to successfully assert a
claim of Privilege; _provided_ , that the parties hereto shall cooperate in
seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such information without
resulting in a loss of the ability to successfully assert a claim of
Privilege.

(d) Neither party shall be required to deliver to the other books and records
or portions thereof (i) if such delivery would violate any applicable Law or

under Seller Guarantees on the Closing Date.

(b) With respect to any Seller Guarantees that remain outstanding after the
Closing Date, (i) Seller and Buyer shall continue to cooperate and use their

commercially reasonable efforts to (x) perform such obligations on behalf of
Seller and the Retained Subsidiaries or (y) otherwise take such action as

not, and shall not permit any of the Transferred FH Companies or any of their

of the other party or its Affiliates solely to the extent relating to (a) in
the case of requests by Buyer, the FH Business, Transferred FH Companies (and
their Closing Subsidiaries), FH Assets, the Acquired FH Assets, Assumed
Liabilities or Transferred Employees and (b) in the case of requests by
Seller, the Excluded Businesses, the Excluded Assets or the Retained
Liabilities, insofar in each case as such access is reasonably required by
Seller or Buyer or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates for legitimate
business reasons and does not violate any applicable Law or any
confidentiality obligations applicable to Seller or Buyer or any of
their Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as the case may be (and shall use
reasonable efforts to cause persons or firms possessing relevant Information
to give similar access) and, to the extent practicable, such Information is
identified by the requesting party with reasonable specificity; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no party shall be required to disclose any Information if (i)
it believes in good faith that doing so presents a significant risk, based on
advice of counsel (which can be inside counsel) of resulting in a loss of the
ability to successfully assert a claim of Privilege or (ii) Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, on
the other hand, are adverse parties in a litigation (other

a claim of Privilege; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that Seller and its
Affiliates shall not be required to provide Buyer or its Representatives with
any information related to the Sale Process or Sellers or its
Representatives evaluation thereof, including projections, financial or

Section 5.12 _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) For a period of five (5) years from the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer
shall hold and shall cause their respective Affiliates (including the
Transferred FH Companies and their Closing Subsidiaries) to hold, and shall
each use their reasonable best efforts to cause their respective
Representatives to hold, in strict confidence and not to disclose or release
without the prior written consent of the other party, any and all
Confidential Information (as defined herein); _provided_ , that the parties
may disclose, or may permit disclosure of, Confidential Information (i) to
their respective Representatives who have a need to know such information and
are informed of their obligation to hold such information confidential to the

 



53  same extent as is applicable to the parties hereto and in respect of whose
failure to comply with such obligations, Seller or Buyer, as the case may be,
will be responsible or (ii) if the parties hereto, their Affiliates or their
Representatives are compelled to disclose any such Confidential Information by
judicial or administrative process or, in the opinion of independent legal
counsel, by other requirements of Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that any demand or request for disclosure of Confidential Information is
made pursuant to clause (ii) above, Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, shall
promptly notify the other of the existence of such request or demand and
shall provide the other a reasonable opportunity to seek an appropriate
protective order or other remedy, which both parties will reasonably cooperate
in obtaining (each at their own expense). In the event that such appropriate
protective order or other remedy is not obtained, the party who is required to
disclose such Confidential Information shall furnish, or cause to be
furnished, only that portion of the Confidential Information that is legally
required to be disclosed. As used in this _Section_ __ _ 5.12_, "
_Confidential Information_ " shall mean all proprietary technical, economic,
environmental, operational, financial and/or other business Information or
material of one party which, prior to or following the Closing Date, has been
disclosed by Seller or its Affiliates, on the one hand, or Buyer or its
Affiliates (including the Transferred FH Companies and their Closing
Subsidiaries), on the other hand, in written, oral (including by recording),
electronic, or visual form to, or otherwise has come into the possession of,
the other, in each case including pursuant to the access provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 5.9_ hereof or any other provision of this Agreement or the
Transition Services Agreement or, (A) in the case of Seller and its Affiliates
and Representatives, to the extent relating to the FH Business or the FH
Assets prior to the Closing or (B) in the case of Buyer and its Affiliates
and Representatives, to the extent relating to the Excluded Assets, the
Retained Liabilities or the Excluded Businesses, including (a) ideas and
concepts for existing products, processes and services; (b) specifications
for products, Equipment and processes; (c) manufacturing and performance
specifications and procedures; (d) engineering drawings and graphs; (e)
technical, research and engineering data; (f) formulations and material
specifications; (g) laboratory studies and benchmark tests; (h) service and
operation manuals; (i) quality assurance policies, procedures and
specifications; (j) evaluation and/or validation studies; (k) pending patent
applications; (l) all other know-how, methodology, procedures, techniques and
trade secrets related to research, engineering, development and manufacturing;
and (m) business information, including marketing and development plans,
forecasts, research and development agreements, and customer and vendor
information (except to the extent that such Information can be shown to have
been (1) in the public domain through no fault of such party or its
Affiliates (including, in the case of Seller, any of the Retained Subsidiaries
or, in the case of Buyer, any of its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred
FH Companies and their Closing Subsidiaries)) or (2) lawfully acquired from
other sources by the party (or its Affiliates (including the Transferred FH
Companies and their Closing Subsidiaries)) to which it was furnished;
_provided_ , _however_ , in the case of (2) that such sources did not provide
such Information in breach of any confidentiality or other legal
obligations). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent
Seller or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or their respective Representatives
from using any Confidential Information used or held for use in any Excluded
Business as of the date of this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, (i) Seller and
its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Buyer and its Affiliates (including the
Transferred FH Companies and their Closing Subsidiaries), on the other hand,
shall be deemed to have satisfied their obligations hereunder with respect to
Confidential Information if they exercise the same

 



54  degree of care (but no less than a reasonable degree of care) as they take
to preserve confidentiality for their own similar Information and (ii)
confidentiality obligations provided for in any agreement between Seller or
any of its Affiliates, or Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the
Transferred FH Companies and their Closing Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and
any employee of Seller or any of its Affiliates (or, prior to the Closing
Date, any of the Transferred FH Companies and their Closing Subsidiaries), or
Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing Date, the
Transferred FH Companies and their Closing Subsidiaries), on the other hand
shall remain in full force and effect. Confidential Information of Seller and
its Affiliates, on the one hand, or the Transferred FH Companies and their
Closing Subsidiaries, on the other hand, in the possession of and used by the
other as of the Closing Date may continue to be used by Seller or its
Affiliates, or Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Transferred FH Companies
and their Closing Subsidiaries), as the case may be, in the operation of their
businesses with the prior written consent of the other party, so long as the
Confidential Information is maintained in confidence and not disclosed in
violation of this Agreement. Such continued right to use may not be
transferred to any third party (other than an Affiliate of a party hereto)
unless the third party purchases all or substantially all of the business and
Assets in one transaction or in a series of related transactions for which or
in which the relevant Confidential Information is used or employed.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.12_, to the extent
that the Transition Services Agreement or another Contract pursuant to which
a party hereto is bound provides that certain Confidential Information shall
be maintained confidential on a basis that is more protective of such
Confidential Information or for a longer period of time than provided for in
this _Section_ __ _ 5.12_, then the applicable provisions contained in the
Transition Services Agreement or other Contract shall control with respect
thereto.

 

Section 5.13 _Non-Competition_ _;  Non-Solicitation_.

(a) Commencing on and for a period of three (3) years following the Closing
Date, Seller shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, directly or
indirectly, develop, manufacture, market or sell Products or perform the

doubt, Prohibited Activities do not include, and Seller and its Subsidiaries
may engage in, the development, manufacture, marketing and sale of components
of Product (but not Product itself) and nothing shall prohibit Howden, a
Subsidiary of Seller, from (x) engaging in the development, manufacturing,
marketing and sale of screw compressors for gas compression applications or
the sale of auxiliary systems which contain the Product or (y) performing the
Services in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the parties agree that nothing herein shall
prohibit Seller and its Subsidiaries from:

 

(i) acquiring or investing in any Person, or the assets thereof, if less than

assets (based on such Persons latest annual audited consolidated financial

55  are related to or were derived from any of the Prohibited Activities;
_provided_ , that within one year of such acquisition, Seller or its
Subsidiaries enter into a definitive agreement to divest themselves of all or
substantially all of the assets or operations so acquired that are engaged in
any of the Prohibited Activities (and use reasonable best efforts to
consummate such transaction as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter); 

(iii) acquiring or investing in securities representing not more than five
percent (5%) of the outstanding voting power of any Person; or 

(iv) acquiring or investing in any equity interest in any Person through any
employee benefit plan of Seller or its Subsidiaries.

 

(b) Commencing on and for a period of two (2) years following the Closing
Date, Seller shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, directly or
indirectly, solicit for employment (whether as an employee, consultant or
otherwise), offer to hire, hire or enter into any employment or consulting
agreement or arrangement with any Transferred Employee or employee,
contractor, subcontractor, consultant or sales representative of the FH
Business; _provided_ , that this prohibition shall not apply to (i)
solicitation of any such individual who has been terminated by Buyer or its
Affiliates more than six (6) months prior to such time, (ii) solicitations
made to the public or the industry generally through advertising or electronic
listing which are not targeted at employees of Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries or (iii) hirings of persons either (A) in connection with
solicitations permitted under clause (i) or (ii) or (B) who independently
approach such party and, in each of subclauses (A) and (B), whom were not
otherwise solicited in breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.13(b)_.

(c) The parties agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 5.13(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 5.13(b)_
shall not prohibit (i) Seller or any of its Subsidiaries from performing under
any Contract or owning or operating any other Asset that constitutes an
FH Asset which is not transferred, conveyed or assigned to Buyer or one of
its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date or (ii) Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries from performing its obligations under this Agreement or the
Transition Services Agreement.

56 Section 5.14 _Mail and Other Communications; Accounts_.

 

(a) After the Closing Date, each of Seller and its Subsidiaries and Buyer and
its Subsidiaries may receive mail, packages and other communications
(including electronic communications) properly belonging to the other (or the
others Subsidiaries). Accordingly, at all times after the Closing Date, each
of Seller and Buyer authorizes the other and their respective Subsidiaries to
receive and open all mail, packages and other communications received by it
and not unambiguously intended for the other party (or its Subsidiaries) or
any of the other partys (or its Subsidiaries) officers or directors, and to
retain the same to the extent that they relate to the FH Business (in the case
of receipt by Buyer and its Subsidiaries) or the Excluded Businesses (in the
case of receipt by Seller and its Subsidiaries), or to the extent that they do
not relate to the FH Business (in the case of receipt by Buyer and its
Subsidiaries) or the Excluded Businesses (in the case of receipt by Seller and
its Subsidiaries), the receiving party shall promptly after becoming aware
thereof refer, forward or otherwise deliver such mail, packages or other
communications (or, in case the same relate to both the FH Business and the
Excluded Businesses, copies thereof) to the other party. The provisions of
this _Section_ __ _ 5.14_ are not intended to, and shall not be deemed to,
constitute an authorization by either Seller or Buyer to permit the other to
accept service of process on its behalf and neither party is or shall be
deemed to be the agent of the other for service of process purposes.

(b) All payments and reimbursements received by Seller or its Subsidiaries in
connection with or arising out of the FH Business, the FH Assets, the
Acquired FH Assets or the Assumed Liabilities after the Closing shall be held
by such Person in trust for the benefit of Buyer and, immediately upon receipt
by such Person of any such payment or reimbursement, such Person shall pay
over to Buyer the amount of such payment or reimbursement, without right of
set off.

(c) All payments and reimbursements received by Buyer or its Subsidiaries in
connection with or arising out of the Excluded Assets, Retained Liabilities or
Excluded Businesses, after the Closing shall be held by such Person in trust
for the benefit of Seller and, immediately upon receipt by such Person of any
such payment or reimbursement such person shall pay over to Seller the amount
of such payment or reimbursement without right of set off.

 

Section 5.15 _Transfer of Excluded Assets; Restructuring_. Seller shall use
reasonable best efforts to effect the restructuring transactions set forth on
_Section_ __ _ 5.15_ of the Sellers Disclosure Letter (as may be amended
pursuant to this sentence, the " _Pre-Closing Restructuring Transactions_")
on or before the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that following the
date hereof, but subject to Sellers indemnification obligations in _Section_
__ _ 9.4_, Seller shall be permitted to amend _Section_ __ _ 5.15_ of the
Sellers Disclosure Letter to the extent the effect of such amendments would
not in any material respect adversely affect the operations of the FH Business
or otherwise adversely affect in any material respect Buyer or its
Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Seller shall take
(or cause one or more of its Affiliates to take) such action as is reasonably
necessary or advisable to transfer effective as of, or prior to, the Closing
Date the Excluded Assets or the Retained Liabilities from the Transferred FH
Companies or any of their Closing Subsidiaries to Seller or one or more of its
Retained Subsidiaries for such consideration or for no consideration, as
may be determined by Seller in its sole discretion. After the Closing Date,
Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred FH

 



57  Companies and their Closing Subsidiaries) shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to take all actions (or shall cause their Affiliates to take all
actions) reasonably requested by Seller to effect the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.15_, including the transfer of any Excluded Assets to Seller
or one or more of its designees for no additional consideration; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Seller shall reimburse Buyer for all reasonable third-party
costs associated with any such actions.

Section 5.16 _Obligations Regarding Non-Assignable Assets_ _and Delayed FH
Assets_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, unless
and until such consent, approval or amendment described below is no longer
required or has been obtained, this Agreement, the Transition Services
Agreement and the Local Purchase Agreements shall not constitute an agreement
to assign, license, sublicense, lease, sublease, convey or transfer at the
Closing any FH Asset (excluding any equity interests in a Delayed Company) or
any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom as
to which consent or approval from any Person (including consents and
approvals of Governmental Authorities) to assignment, license, sublicense,
lease, sublease, conveyance or transfer thereof or amendment thereof is
required but has not been obtained as of the Closing Date (such Asset, a "
_Delayed FH Asset_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that, except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, neither Seller or any of its Affiliates nor Buyer
or any of its Affiliates shall be required to commence any litigation or
offer or pay any money or otherwise grant any accommodation (financial or
otherwise) to any third party. Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __
_ 5.3_ and  _Section_ __ _ 5.4_, Seller and Buyer shall use, and cause each
of their Subsidiaries to use, commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
such consent, approval or amendment, including after the Closing Date;
provided, however, that Buyer acknowledges that Seller has no obligation to
novate Government Contracts prior to the Closing Date. Upon obtaining the
requisite consents or approvals, such Delayed FH Asset shall be transferred
and assigned to Buyer hereunder without additional consideration therefor.

(b) With respect to Government Contracts that are subject to a requirement for
novation, during the pendency of any novation request pursuant to Section
42.1204 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) or other process as may
be specified by the authorized contracting officer(s) of the applicable
Governmental Authority:

 

(i) Buyer shall perform, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law,
all of the obligations of Seller or its applicable Affiliate under such
Government Contracts to the extent such Government Contracts have not yet been
fully performed by Seller or such Affiliate and closed out;

 

(ii) Buyer shall inure to all rights and benefits conferred or accruing under
such Government Contracts, whether such rights and benefits are conferred or
accrue before, on or after the Closing Date, but such inurement shall not
include any payment made to Seller or such Affiliate prior to the Closing
Date;

 

(iii) Each of Buyer and Seller shall, at each partys own expense, use its
commercially reasonable efforts and shall cooperate with one another to
secure novation of the Government Contracts as soon as practicable; and

 



58 (iv) Neither Seller nor any Affiliate thereof shall take any action or fail to
take any action in connection with any such Government Contract that would
frustrate the intent of, or materially impair or diminish the performance of,
or any of Buyers or Sellers (or such Affiliates) rights under, any such
Government Contract. 

(c) Except as otherwise provided in the last sentence of this _Section_ __ _
5.16(c)_ or in cases of Government Contracts that are subject to _Section_ __
_ 5.16(b)_, in the event and to the extent that, prior to the Closing, Seller
or any Retained Subsidiary is unable to obtain a consent, approval or
amendment required to assign, license, sublicense, lease, sublease, convey or
transfer any Delayed FH Asset to Buyer, then following the Closing, Seller
shall, and shall cause the Retained Subsidiaries to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) continue to hold, and to the extent required by the
terms applicable to such Delayed FH Asset, operate such Delayed FH Asset in
all material respects in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice and taking into account the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (ii) cooperate in any arrangement, reasonable and lawful as
to Seller and Buyer, designed to provide to Buyer or its Subsidiaries the
benefits arising under such Delayed FH Asset, including accepting such
reasonable direction as Buyer shall request of Seller and (iii) enforce at
Buyers request, or allow Buyer and its Affiliates to enforce in a
commercially reasonable manner, any rights of the applicable Seller under such
Delayed FH Asset against the other party or parties thereto; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the costs and expenses incurred by Seller or its Affiliates
at Buyers request shall be borne solely by Buyer. Seller shall, and shall
cause the Retained Subsidiaries to, without further consideration therefor,
pay and remit to Buyer promptly all monies, rights and other consideration
received in respect of such performance. Buyer shall pay, perform and
discharge fully, promptly when due, all of the obligations of Seller or
the Retained Subsidiaries in respect of such performance, and Buyer shall be
responsible for all Assumed Liabilities related thereto and indemnify the
Seller Indemnified Parties for all Losses arising out of any actions (or
omissions to act) of Seller or any Retained Subsidiary arising out of such
performance or taken at the direction of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries.
With respect to Government Contracts that are subject to a requirement for
novation and not novated prior to Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause the
Retained Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to novate such
Government Contracts as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything else set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.16_,
neither Seller nor any other of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take
any action that may, in the good faith judgment of Seller or such Subsidiary,
(i) result in a violation of any obligation which Seller or any such
Subsidiary has to any third party or (ii) violate applicable Law. 

(e) Buyer acknowledges that certain consents and approvals to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be required from certain third parties,
and that such consents and approvals have not been and may not be obtained.
Buyer agrees that Seller and its Affiliates shall not have any liability
whatsoever arising out of or relating to, the failure to obtain any
consents or approvals that may have been or may be required in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or because of the default
under or acceleration or termination of any Contracts, FH Business Permits or
Environmental Permits or other right or obligation, as a result thereof.
Buyer further agrees that no representation, warranty, covenant or other
obligation of Seller contained herein shall be breached or deemed breached,
and no condition to Buyers obligations to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed not satisfied, as a result of
the failure to obtain any such consent or approval or as a result of any such
default, acceleration or termination.

 



59 Section 5.17 _Obligations Regarding Delayed Companies_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the equity interests of
any Transferred FH Company or Closing Subsidiary of a Transferred FH Company
for which Seller and its Subsidiaries have not received all necessary consents
and approvals of any Governmental Authority which are required to transfer the
equity interests of any such entity to Buyer or a Subsidiary of Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement or any Local Purchase Agreement at the Closing
(such entity, a " _Delayed Company_ ") shall be treated in the manner set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.17_. Without limiting the generality of 
_Section_ __ _ 5.3_ and _Section_ __ _ 5.4_, Seller shall, and shall cause
the applicable FH Share Sellers to, and Buyer shall, use their commercially
reasonable efforts to take such actions required to obtain any consent,
approval or amendment required to convey, assign, transfer and deliver to
Buyer such FH Share Sellers equity interests in a Delayed Company (the "
_Delayed Company Interests_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that this Agreement,
the Transition Services Agreement and the Local Purchase Agreements shall not
constitute an agreement to convey, assign, transfer or deliver any Delayed
Company Interests as to which consent or approval to conveyance, assignment,
transfer or delivery thereof or amendment thereof has not been obtained as of
the Closing Date unless and until such consent, approval, or amendment is no
longer required or has been obtained; _provided_ , _further_ , that neither
Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to commence any litigation
or offer, pay any money or otherwise grant any accommodation (financial or
otherwise) to any third party in connection with obtaining any such consent,
approval or amendment. Buyer shall indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties
against any Losses arising in connection with the transfer, or attempted
transfer, of the Delayed Company Interests, or the FH Shares of the
Transferred FH Companies and their Closing Subsidiaries holding Delayed
Company Interests, hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Seller
nor any FH Share Seller makes any representation or warranty that any such
consent or approval shall be obtained either prior to, on or after the Closing
Date and neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have any Liability
to Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries for failure to obtain any consent,
approval or amendment required to convey, assign, transfer and deliver to
Buyer the Delayed Company Interests. 

(b) In the event and to the extent that Seller or any FH Share Seller is
unable to obtain any such required consent, approval or amendment required to
convey, assign, transfer and deliver any Delayed Company Interests to Buyer,
Seller shall, and shall cause the Retained Subsidiaries to, continue to retain
title to such Delayed Company Interests; _provided_ , that Seller may
transfer any such interests to any Wholly Owned Subsidiary of Seller, with the
prior written consent of Buyer (not to be unreasonably, withheld) and if not
in violation of the associated organizational and governance documents of the
Delayed Company; _provided_ , _further_ , that if any such Delayed Company
Interests are held by a Transferred FH Company and such Transferred FH Company
is to be conveyed to Buyer or a Subsidiary of Buyer under this Agreement,
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to restructure such company
or its sale to Buyer or its Subsidiaries so that Seller or a Retained
Subsidiary retains the Delayed Company Interests. Buyer agrees to reasonably
cooperate with Seller in effectuating any such restructuring. Until the
transfer to Buyer of such Delayed Company Interests: (i) Buyer shall pay,
perform and

 



60  discharge fully, promptly when due, all the reasonable obligations of Seller
or the applicable FH Share Seller thereunder from and after the Closing Date;
(ii) Buyer shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, be responsible for all
Assumed Liabilities related thereto and indemnify Seller and its Affiliates
and the applicable FH Share Sellers and their Affiliates for all Losses
arising out of such performance (or any failure to perform) by Buyer or any
of its Subsidiaries and any Losses arising out of Sellers entering into such
an arrangement and (iii) Buyer shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
cooperate and provide such support and services to Seller and its Affiliates
as Seller shall reasonably request in connection with such arrangement. Seller
shall, and shall cause the applicable FH Share Sellers to, without further
consideration therefor, pay and remit to Buyer promptly all monies, rights
and other considerations received in respect of such performance; provided,
however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller and its Affiliates may
retain, and shall not be required to remit to Buyer or any of its Affiliates,
any Tax distributions received from any Delayed Company made for the purposes
of paying any Taxes that are Retained Liabilities attributable to the income
of such Delayed Company generated on or after the Closing Date and for which
Seller or any of its Affiliates is liable pursuant to applicable Law. In the
event that (x) Seller or a Retained Subsidiary is required under the
applicable organizational and governance documents of the Delayed Company to
fund or (y) subject to the prior written consent of Buyer (not unreasonably
to be withheld), Seller or a Retained Subsidiary otherwise funds, any capital
call from, or otherwise makes any capital contribution to, any Delayed Company
after the Closing but prior to the transfer to Buyer or one of
its Subsidiaries of Sellers or a Retained Subsidiarys interests in such
Delayed Company, then at the time of such transfer, Buyer shall be obligated
to reimburse Seller for the amount of cash funded into such capital call.

 

(c) The obligations of Buyer to purchase and accept any Delayed Company
Interests, and the obligations of the FH Share Sellers to sell, assign and
transfer any Delayed Company Interests, which was not transferred pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 1.1_ at the Closing, shall be subject to the fulfillment, or
written waiver by Buyer, or by Seller, on behalf of itself and the FH Share
Sellers, as the case may be, at or prior to such transfer, of only the
following conditions: (i) the receipt of each material consent, approval or
amendment required to convey, assign, transfer and deliver to Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries such Delayed Company Interests, and (ii) no statute, rule,
regulation, executive order, decree, preliminary or permanent injunction or
restraining order shall have been enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced by
any Governmental Authority which prohibits or restricts the transfer of such
Delayed Company Interests nor shall any proceeding by any Governmental
Authority seeking the foregoing be pending.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything else set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.17_,
neither Buyer, Seller nor any of the FH Share Sellers shall be required to
take any action that may, in the reasonable judgment of Buyer, Seller or such
FH Share Seller, violate applicable Law. In addition, to the extent that it is
contemplated that any Delayed Company Interests are to be conveyed, assigned,
transferred and delivered to Buyer pursuant to a Local Purchase Agreement,
such Delayed Company Interests shall be conveyed, assigned, transferred and
delivered to Buyer pursuant to such Local Purchase Agreement.

 

(e) For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 5.17_, "commercially reasonable
efforts" shall not require Buyer or Seller or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to take any action which would result in adverse Tax consequences
or costs for Buyer or Seller or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

 



61 Section 5.18 _Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) If the Closing occurs, Buyer shall and shall cause the Transferred FH
Companies and their Closing Subsidiaries to take any necessary actions to
provide, for a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date, that all rights
to indemnification and all limitations on liability existing in favor of any
current or former officers, directors, partners, members, managers
or employees of the Transferred FH Companies or their Closing Subsidiaries
(or their respective predecessors) (collectively, the " _FH Indemnitees_ "),
as provided in (i) the organizational documents of the Transferred FH
Companies and their Closing Subsidiaries in effect on the date of this
Agreement or (ii) any agreement providing for indemnification by the
Transferred FH Companies or their Closing Subsidiaries of any of the FH
Indemnitees in effect on the date of this Agreement to which the FH Share
Sellers or the Transferred FH Companies or their Closing Subsidiaries are a
party, shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
and continue in full force and effect and be honored by the Transferred FH
Companies or their Closing Subsidiaries after the Closing.

(b) In the event that the Transferred FH Companies or their Closing
Subsidiaries or Buyer or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Transferred FH Companies or their
Closing Subsidiaries or Buyer, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.18_.

(c) The obligations of Buyer under this _Section_ __ _ 5.18_ shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee
to whom this _Section_ __ _ 5.18_ applies without the express
written consent of such affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that
the indemnitees to whom this _Section_ __ _ 5.18_ applies shall be third

Section 5.19 _Buyer_ __ _s Financing Activities_.

 

(a) Except as set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.19_ (and without limiting
Sellers other obligations under this Agreement, including to the extent they
relate to the Debt Financing), Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Seller, its
Affiliates and their respective Representatives shall have no responsibility
for any financing that Buyer may raise in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby. Any bank syndication materials and other marketing
materials prepared by or on behalf of or utilized by Buyer, or Buyers
financing sources, in connection with Buyers financing activities
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby which include any
information provided by Seller, its Affiliates or their respective
Representatives shall include a conspicuous disclaimer to the effect that none

62 (b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement (including the rights of Buyer in
this  _Section_ __ _ 5.19(b)_ to obtain Alternative Financing), Buyer shall
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
use its reasonable best efforts to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to arrange the Debt Financing and to
consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing, including using
reasonable best efforts to (i) comply with the terms of, and maintain in
effect, the Debt Commitment Letter; (ii) satisfy (or seek a waiver of) on a
timely basis all of the conditions precedent and covenants set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter and the definitive documentation for the Debt
Financing; (iii) negotiate, execute and deliver definitive documentation for
the Debt Financing (and promptly upon the execution and delivery thereof,
provide true and complete copies of such definitive documentation to Seller)
that reflects the terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter or on other
terms not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Buyer (subject to
any "market flex" provisions included in the Fee Letter or any fee letter
relating to an Alternative Financing) and that would not, if such other
terms constituted an amendment to the Debt Commitment Letter, be prohibited
by clauses (A) through (D) in the proviso below; and (iv) in the event that
the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ and  _Section_ __ _ 8.3_
and the conditions precedent set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter have been
satisfied or, upon funding would be satisfied, cause the financing providers
to fund the Debt Financing in accordance with the terms of the Debt
Commitment Letter including, if necessary, enforcing rights under the Debt
Commitment Letter and the definitive documentation for the Debt Financing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that under no circumstances shall Buyer be required
to commence or sustain any legal proceeding in connection therewith. Buyer
shall have the right from time to time to amend, restate, replace, supplement
or otherwise modify, or waive any of its rights under, the Debt Commitment
Letter and/or substitute other debt or equity financing for all or any
portion of the Debt Financing from the same and/or alternative financing
sources (together with any alternative financing as described in clause (c)
below, each an " _Alternative Financing_ "); _provided_ , that any such
amendment, restatement, supplement, replacement or other modification to or
waiver of any provision of the Debt Commitment Letter that amends the Debt
Financing and/or substitution of all or any portion of the Debt Financing
shall not, without the prior written consent of Seller, (A) except as
otherwise set forth herein, reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing
(including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue
discount) to be funded at or prior to Closing in a manner that would adversely
impact the ability of Buyer to consummate the Sale or that would otherwise be
expected to prevent, delay or impede the Sale, (B) impose new or
additional conditions precedent or contingencies to the Debt Financing as set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or otherwise amend, modify, or expand any
conditions precedent to the funding of the Debt Financing (unless such
conditions precedent or contingencies to the Alternative Financing would not
be reasonably expected to (i) prevent, impede or delay the Closing, (ii) make
the funding of the Debt Financing or a material portion thereof (or the
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing or a material
portion thereof) less likely to occur, (iii) adversely affect the ability of
Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (iv)
adversely impact the ability of Buyer to enforce its rights against the other
parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive documentation with
respect thereto), (C) release or consent to the termination of the obligations
of the lenders under the Debt Commitment Letter (except for assignments and
replacements of an individual lender under the terms of or in connection with
the syndication of the Debt Financing or as otherwise expressly contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter), or (D) otherwise (i) prevent, impede or

 



63  delay the Closing, (ii) adversely affect the ability of Buyer to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (iii) adversely impact the
ability of Buyer to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements with respect thereto;
_provided_ , _further_ , that Buyer may amend, restate, replace, supplement or
otherwise modify the Debt Commitment Letter (or any Alternative Financing) on
one or more occasions to add additional arrangers, bookrunners, agents and
lenders in accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter (but not to
make any other changes other than to the extent otherwise permitted under
this _Section_ __ _ 5.19(b)_). For purposes of this Agreement, the definition
of " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " shall include any amendment, restatement,
supplement or other modification or waiver thereto, or any replacement
thereof, and the definition of " _Debt Financing_ " shall include any
amendment thereof or substitution of any portion thereof with any Alternative
Financing, in each case permitted under this  _Section_ __ _ 5.19(b)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 5.19(c)_ below.

(c) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter (subject to any "market
flex" provisions included in the Fee Letter and other than on account of any
Alternative Financing referred to in clause (b) above having been completed)
other than due to the failure of a condition to the consummation of the Debt
Financing resulting from a material breach of any representation, warranty, or
covenant of Seller set forth in this Agreement or the failure of any
condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, Buyer
shall promptly so notify Seller and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
any such portion from alternative debt or equity sources as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event in an amount that will
still enable Buyer to pay the Required Amount at the Closing (including the
payment of all fees, premiums and expenses associated therewith). 

(d) Buyer shall keep Seller informed on a reasonably current basis in
reasonable detail of the status of Buyers efforts to arrange the Debt
Financing (including any Alternative Financing) and shall provide to Seller
copies of any amendment, restatement, replacement, supplement or modification
of the Debt Commitment Letter (including any new commitment letters relating
to any Alternative Financing and related fee letters, redacted as to the same
scope as the Fee Letter) and all executed final definitive documents relating
to the Debt Financing (excluding any provisions related solely to fees,
economic and "market flex" terms (other than covenants) agreed to by the
parties thereto and any provisions in any fee or engagement letters as
customarily excluded by the Financing Sources). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall give Seller prompt written notice
(in any event within three (3) Business Days), which shall include reasonably
detailed information regarding the applicable circumstances referenced in the
following clauses: (i) if Buyer becomes aware of any breach or default by any
party to the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the
Debt Financing or termination or threatened termination thereof, if such
breach, default or termination would reasonably be expected to affect the
timely availability of, or the amount of, the Debt Financing; (ii) of the
receipt by it of any written notice or other written communication from any
Person with respect to any (A) actual or potential breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or any
definitive document related to the Debt Financing or any provisions of the
Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the Debt
Financing, or (B) material dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to
the Debt Financing

 



64  with respect to the obligation to fund any portion of the Debt Financing or
the amount of the Debt Financing to be funded at Closing; and (iii) if for any
reason Buyer believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or
any portion of the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions, in the manner
or from the sources contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (subject to the
"market flex" provisions included in the Fee Letter or any fee letter
relating to any Alternative Financing) or the definitive documents related to
the Debt Financing. As soon as reasonably practicable, after the date Seller
delivers Buyer a written request, Buyer shall provide any additional
information reasonably requested by Seller relating to any circumstance
referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the immediately preceding
sentence.

 

(e) Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives to, furnish Buyer and its Financing Sources with the (i) the
Required Financial Statements; and (ii) as promptly as practical after
requested by Buyer, all information regarding the FH Business reasonably
requested by Buyer to prepare pro forma financial statements of the type and
form and for periods, in each case, customarily included in information
memoranda and syndication materials used in syndicated bank financings (the
information and documents in clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, the "
_Required Information_ "); _provided_ that such Required Information (A)
shall not include, and Buyer shall be solely responsible for, pro forma
information or projections, including pro forma cost savings, synergies,
capitalization or other pro forma adjustments desired to be incorporated into
any pro forma information and (B) shall not include "segment reporting",
information required by Rules 3-09, 3-10 and 3-16 of Regulation S-X under the
Securities Act or otherwise include separate financial statements of any
Subsidiary or any compensation discussion and analysis required by Item
402(b) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act. From the date hereof until
the earlier of (i) the Closing Date and (ii) termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1_, Seller shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to provide such customary
assistance and cooperation (and to use reasonable best efforts to cause
its and their respective Representatives to provide such customary assistance
and cooperation), at Buyers sole cost and expense, with respect to any Debt
Financing as is reasonably requested by Buyer, including using reasonable best
efforts with respect to: (i) upon reasonable request, participating in and
assisting with the due diligence and marketing efforts related to such Debt
Financing, including, upon reasonable advance notice and during normal
business hours, participating in a reasonable number of meetings (including
one-on-one meetings or conference calls with the parties acting as agents or
arrangers for, and prospective lenders, investors in, and purchasers of, the
Debt Financing), presentations, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions,
road shows and sessions with prospective lenders, investors and rating
agencies and other syndication activities; (ii) delivering to Buyer and its
Financing Sources as promptly as reasonably practicable documentation and
other information that is required under applicable "know-your customer" and
anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the USA Patriot Act and
that is reasonably requested by the Financing Sources at least ten (10)
Business Days prior to Closing; (iii) requesting Sellers independent auditors
to cooperate with the Debt Financing consistent with their customary practice,
including by participating in a reasonable number of drafting sessions,
providing customary assistance with the due diligence activities of Buyer and
the Financing Sources (including, upon reasonable advance notice and during
normal business hours, participating in a reasonable number of accounting due
diligence sessions); (iv) assisting Buyer and the Financing Sources in the
preparation of (A) customary syndication documents and materials, including
bank information memoranda (confidential and public), lender and investor
presentations and

 



65  similar documents for the Debt Financing and (B) customary materials for
rating agency presentations, and similar documents in connection with the Debt
Financing; (v) cooperating reasonably with each Financing Sources due
diligence including in relation to the provision of, and reliance on, any
reports produced in connection with the transaction; (vi) executing and
delivering customary definitive financing documents, including certificates
and other documents, to the extent reasonably requested by Buyer and customary
for financings of the type similar to the Debt Financing; (vii) providing all
financial statements, financial data, audit reports and other information
with respect to the FH Business customarily included in marketing materials,
lender and investor presentations and similar documents for the syndication of
credit facilities similar to those described in the Debt Commitment Letter;
_provided_ that the only financial statements required to be delivered shall
be those described in _Section_ __ _ 3.5_ and _Section_ __ _ 5.25_; and
(viii) providing customary projected financial information relating only to
the FH Business as reasonably requested by Buyer to permit Buyer to prepare
customary projected financial information relating to Buyer (to be prepared on
a pro forma basis assuming the consummation of the Sale) which are
customarily required by financing sources for the syndication of credit
facilities similar to those described in the Debt Commitment Letter or for
purposes of obtaining corporate and debt ratings; _provided_ that the
effectiveness of any certificate, definitive agreements or other
documentation executed by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries shall be subject
to the Closing of the Sale. In addition, if, in connection with the marketing
of the Debt Financing, Buyer reasonably determines in consultation with the
lead arrangers for the Debt Financing that the disclosure of any material non-
public information with respect to the FH Business or the pro forma combined
financial position or results of operations of the Buyer and the FH Business
is necessary or advisable to include in any syndication materials or other
similar documents to be delivered to any "public side" lenders, then Buyer
shall have the right, upon prior written notice to Seller, to file or furnish
one or more Current Reports on Form 8-K (each a " _Buyer Form 8-K_")
containing such material non-public information and any required
reconciliations, which Buyer Form 8-K shall in no event contain (x) financial
projections or other estimates of future performance with respect to the FH
Business, (y) any information with respect to the FH Business that would
result in the loss of the ability to successfully assert any attorney-client
privilege of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, or (z) any material non-
public information with respect to the FH Business the disclosure of which
would reasonably be expected to conflict with, or result in any violation or
breach of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under any Contract to which Seller or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, in
each case to the extent existing as of the date of this Agreement; provided,
that nothing herein shall prevent, limit or restrict the disclosure of any
financial information or financial data, including the Required Financial
Statements and the Required Information. Additionally, Buyer will use
reasonable best efforts to limit the amount and scope of such material non-
public information with respect to the FH Business or the pro forma combined
financial position or results of operations of the Buyer and the FH Business
contained in any Buyer Form 8-K, but subject in all respects to compliance
with applicable Law regarding the disclosure of material non-public
information in syndication materials or other similar documents. Seller
hereby consents to the use of all of its and its Subsidiaries logos in
connection with the Debt Financing, provided that such logos are used solely
in a manner that is reasonable and customary for such purposes and that
is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective products, services, offerings or
intellectual property rights and on such other

 



66  customary terms and conditions as Seller shall reasonably impose. Seller
shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any syndication
materials or other similar documents (including drafts of any Buyer Form
8-Ks), or any materials for rating agencies, that include information about
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries prepared in connection with the Debt
Financing.

 

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth herein or in any other
agreement between Seller and Buyer (or its Affiliates), the Seller agrees
that Buyer and its affiliates may share customary projections with respect to
the FH Business with the Financing Sources identified in the Debt Commitment
Letter and to any existing lenders of Buyer, and that Buyer, its affiliates
and such Financing Sources may share such information with potential
Financing Sources in connection with any marketing efforts in connection with
the Debt Financing, provided that the recipients of such information are
subject to customary confidentiality arrangements between Buyer and such
parties (which need not include Seller). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, none of Seller, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
its or their respective directors or officers or other personnel shall be
required by this _Section_ __ _ 5.19_ to: (1) take any action or provide any
assistance that unreasonably interferes with the ongoing operations of Seller
and its Subsidiaries; (2) pass resolutions or consents to approve or
authorize the execution of the Debt Financing or the documents related to the
Debt Financing prior to the Closing (other than customary authorization and
representation letters provided in connection with marketing or
offering documents); (3) execute or deliver any certificate, document,
instrument or agreement that is effective prior to the Closing or agree to any
change or modification of any existing certificate, document, instrument or
agreement that is effective prior to the Closing (other than customary
authorization and representation letters and a payoff letter with respect to
any credit agreement); (4)(i) execute or deliver any solvency certificate with
respect to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) request that Sellers
independent accountants provide any consent or comfort letter or (iii) request
that any counsel for Seller or any of its Subsidiaries deliver any opinion in
connection with the Debt Financing (5) pay any commitment or other similar
fee; (6) cause any director, officer or other personnel to incur any personal
liability; (7) without limiting Sellers obligation to furnish the Required
Information or obtain the Seller Lender Consent, take any action that would
reasonably be expected to conflict with, or result in any violation or breach
of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under,
Sellers or any of its Subsidiarys organizational documents, any applicable
Laws or any Contract to which Seller or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, in
each case to the extent existing as of the date of this Agreement; (8) cause
any representation or warranty in this Agreement to be breached; or (9)
require Seller to provide access or disclose any information that would
jeopardize any attorney-client privilege of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(g) Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its Subsidiaries and its
and their respective Representatives from and against any and all losses,
damages, claims and out-of-pocket costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), actually suffered or incurred by them in connection with
any Debt Financing (including any action taken in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 5.19_) and any information utilized in connection therewith
(other than information provided by Seller or any of its Representatives in
writing for use in the Debt Financing documents), in any case, except to the
extent suffered or incurred as a result of the gross negligence, willful
misconduct, fraud or Intentional Breach by or of the Seller or its
Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives. In addition, Buyer shall,
promptly upon request

 



67  by Seller, reimburse Seller for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by Seller
or its Subsidiaries in connection with the performance of Sellers obligations
under this _Section_ __ _ 5.19_, except as otherwise provided in  _Section_
__ _ 5.24(a)_.

Section 5.20 _Conflicts; Privileges_. It is acknowledged by each of the
parties that Seller has retained Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP ("
_Skadden_ ") to act as its counsel in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and that Skadden has not acted as counsel for any other
Person in connection with the negotiation and execution of the Transaction
Documents (the " _Matter_ ") and the transactions contemplated hereby and that
no other party or Person has the status of a client of Skadden for conflict of
interest or any other purposes as a result thereof. Buyer hereby agrees that,
in the event that a dispute arises between Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Transferred FH Companies and their Closing
Subsidiaries) and Seller or any of its Affiliates (including, prior to the
Closing, the Transferred FH Companies and their Subsidiaries) related to the
Matter, Skadden may represent Seller or any such Affiliate in such dispute
even though the interests of Seller or such Affiliate may be directly adverse
to Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Transferred FH Companies and their Closing Subsidiaries) and even though
Skadden may have represented a Transferred FH Company or one of its
Closing Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to such dispute, or
may be handling ongoing matters for Buyer or a Transferred FH Company or one
of its Closing Subsidiaries, and Buyer and the Transferred FH Companies and
their Closing Subsidiaries hereby waive, on behalf of themselves and each of
their Affiliates, any conflict of interest in connection with such
representation by Skadden to the extent related to the Matter. Buyer further
agrees that, as to all communications, whether written or electronic, to the
extent related to the Matter, among Skadden, Seller and its Subsidiaries, the
Transferred FH Companies and their Closing Subsidiaries, and all files,
attorney notes, drafts or other documents, to the extent related to
the Matter and that predate the Closing, the attorney-client privilege, the
expectation of client confidence and all other rights to any evidentiary
privilege belong to Seller and may be controlled by Seller and shall not pass
to or be claimed by Buyer or its Subsidiaries or the Transferred FH Companies
or any of their Closing Subsidiaries, but in no event shall Seller waive any
such privilege to the extent related to any of the Transferred FH Companies or
any one of its Closing Subsidiaries. Seller and Buyer agree to take and to
cause their respective Affiliates to take, all steps necessary to implement
the intent of this _Section_ __ _ 5.20_. Seller and Buyer further agree that
Skadden and its respective partners and employees are third party
beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 5.20_.

Section 5.21 _Local Purchase Agreements; Transition Services Agreement_.

(a) The parties hereto agree to enter into, and to cause their respective
Subsidiaries, as applicable, to enter into, the Transition Services Agreement
at or prior to the Closing. To the extent there is a conflict between any of
the provisions of this Agreement and the Transition Services Agreement, the
provisions of the Transition Services Agreement shall control with respect to
the subject matter thereof.

(b) Immediately prior to the Closing, Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on
the other hand, shall cause the applicable executed Local Purchase Agreements
to be delivered to the other parties thereto and to consummate the Sale as
provided for therein and, after the

  



68  Closing, Seller and Buyer shall cause their respective Subsidiaries party to
the Local Purchase Agreements to comply with such respective Subsidiaries
obligations thereunder;  _provided_ , that the foregoing obligations are
subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.16_ and _Section_ __ _ 5.17_. To the extent
there is a conflict between any of the provisions of this Agreement and any
Local Purchase Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall control.

Section 5.22 _Specified Litigation_. Without limiting  _Section_ __ _ 5.10_,
following the Closing Date, Seller shall have exclusive authority and control
over the investigation, prosecution, defense and appeal of all Actions
relating to or arising in connection with the Excluded Businesses, the
Excluded Assets or the Retained Liabilities (each, a " _Seller Action_ "), and
may settle or compromise, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect
to any such Action without the consent of Buyer;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if both Seller (or a Retained Subsidiary) and Buyer (or any of its
Subsidiaries, including any Transferred FH Company or its Closing
Subsidiaries) are named as parties to any Seller Action (a " _Joint Action_
"), Seller shall not settle such Joint Action without the written consent of
Buyer (not to be unreasonably withheld) unless such settlement releases Buyer
(or such of its Subsidiaries named as parties) from all Liabilities
in connection with such Joint Action and provides relief consisting solely of
money damages borne by Seller (or a Retained Subsidiary), and provided further
that, to the extent this Section 5.22 conflicts with Section 7.3 (with respect
to Tax Audits), Section 7.3 shall govern.

Section 5.23 _Insurance_. From and after the Closing, and excluding for the
avoidance of doubt insurance policies and coverage covering claims or losses
related to Retained Asbestos Liabilities and any other Retained Liabilities,
Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with
Buyer to afford to Buyer, the FH Business, the Transferred FH Companies and
the Closing Subsidiaries rights to seek insurance coverage under occurrence-
based insurance policies covering pre-Closing occurrences, accidents,
events, injuries and/or damages in respect of covered claims or losses to the
extent related to an Assumed Liability, so that Buyer, the FH Business, the
Transferred FH Companies and the Closing Subsidiaries may seek the benefit of
such coverage and, to the extent applicable, the right to proceeds, under any
such policies in respect of any such covered claim or losses related to an
Assumed Liability. Any such rights of to receive the benefit of coverage under
and, to the extent applicable, proceeds with respect to, any such insurance
claim shall be subject to any deductibles, self-insured retentions, retained
amounts, retentions or exclusions and to the other terms of the applicable
insurance policy. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 5.23 shall not
require the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to provide access to or benefits
under any insurance policies of Seller or its Subsidiaries for Retained
Asbestos Liabilities. This _Section_ __ _ 5.23_ shall not require Seller to
convert any "claims made" policy to an "occurrence based" policy and shall not
obligate Seller to maintain any insurance policy in effect such that it covers
claims made or events occurring after the Closing. Buyer shall promptly
reimburse Seller for any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs
incurred by Seller in the performance of its obligations under this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.23_.

 



69 Section 5.24 _Later Discovered Assets_.

 

(a) In the event that there are any contracts, agreements or other assets that
are FH Assets or Acquired FH Assets and were not transferred to Buyer as part
of this Agreement because such contracts, agreements or other assets were not
discovered until after the Closing or inadvertently were not assigned (each, a
" _Later Discovered Asset_ "), Seller agrees, at Buyers request and expense,
to the extent permitted under the terms and conditions of such Later
Discovered Asset and under applicable Laws, to assign such Later Discovered
Asset to Buyer or its Affiliates. To the extent that Sellers, any FH
Asset Sellers, or any FH Affiliates rights under any such Later Discovered

consent of any Person, such Later Discovered Asset shall be treated in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 5.17_.

are Excluded Assets and that were inadvertently transferred to Buyer and its
Affiliates as part of this Agreement, or not transferred by a Transferred FH

at Sellers request and expense, to the extent permitted under the terms and
conditions of such assets and under applicable Law, to assign such assets to
Seller or its Affiliates promptly following discovery thereof.

Affiliates to continue the employment of each then-current Transferred FH
Company Employee immediately following the Closing on the terms set forth in
this _Article VI_.

 



75 (b) _Offers of Employment_. Not later than thirty (30) days prior to the
anticipated date of Closing (or such greater period as required by applicable
Law), Buyer shall or shall cause one of its Affiliates to offer employment
with Buyer or one of its Affiliates to each then-current Offer Employee,
commencing as of the Closing on the terms set forth in this _Article VI_.

(c) _Automatic Transfer Employees_. It is intended that in accordance with the
Transfer Regulations, the employment and the contracts of employment of the
Automatic Transfer Employees will (other than in respect of any such employee
who objects to a transfer or resigns and leaves prior to the Closing Date)
transfer automatically to Buyer or one of its Affiliates as a result of the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement, and accordingly each such
contract of employment shall have effect from the Closing Date as if
originally made between Buyer, or its applicable Affiliate, and the
applicable Automatic Transfer Employee, and all rights, powers, duties,
liabilities and obligations of Seller or its Affiliates in respect of, or in
relation to, such Automatic Transfer Employees and their contracts of
employment in force immediately before the Closing shall transfer to Buyer or
its applicable Affiliate in accordance with the Transfer Regulations. Buyer
and its Affiliates shall provide such information as Seller or its Affiliates
may reasonably require in sufficient time to enable Seller and its Affiliates
to meet any information and consultation requirements they may have pursuant
to the Transfer Regulations or other applicable Law with or in relation to
their employees or any Employee Representative in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer and its Affiliates shall
not propose any change to any Automatic Transfer Employees working conditions
or terms and conditions or employment or otherwise take any action (including
communication with any Automatic Transfer Employee or Employee Representative)
that is intended to cause an Automatic Transfer Employee to resign prior to
the Closing. If the contract of employment of any Employee based in a
jurisdiction where the Transfer Regulations might apply does not transfer to
the Buyer or any of its Affiliates in accordance with the Transfer Regulations
as intended, such Employee shall then be an Offer Employee and Buyer or its
Affiliate shall offer such Employee employment in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 6.1(b)_ provided that such offer shall be on the terms that would have
applied, including recognition of continuity of service, had the Employee
transferred to Buyer or its Affiliates pursuant to the Transfer Regulations.

(d) _Delayed Transfer Employees_. Notwithstanding anything set forth in 
_Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)_ to the contrary, each Delayed Transfer Employee who
has a legal or contractual right to return to employment with a Transferred FH

effective as of the date on which such Delayed Transfer Employee is eligible
to return to active service; _provided_ , that all references in this
Agreement to events that take place with respect to Offer Employees as of the
Closing shall take place with respect to any Delayed Transfer Employee as of
such Delayed Transfer Employees commencement of employment with Buyer or one
of its Affiliates.

 

(e) _Payments Pursuant to Transferred Benefit Plans_. Buyer shall cause each
applicable Transferred FH Company or Closing Subsidiary to pay all amounts
payable under each Transferred Benefit Plan maintained by such Transferred FH
Company or Closing Subsidiary no later than the date such amounts become due
in the time and manner set forth in such Transferred Benefit Plan to
the extent such amounts are Retained Liabilities. To the extent

 



76  any such payment is a Retained Liability and is not reflected in Final Net
Working Capital, Buyer shall notify Seller of such payment and Seller shall
reimburse Buyer for such amount, including in each case any payroll Taxes
attributable thereto, within thirty (30) days of receiving notice.

Section 6.2 _Terms and Conditions; Compensation and Benefits_.

(a) Subject, and in addition, to the requirements imposed by applicable Law,
during the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Continuation Period_ "), Buyer shall,
or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, provide each Transferred Employee
with (i) a base salary or hourly wage rate that is at least equal to the base
salary or hourly wage rate provided to the Transferred Employee immediately
prior to the Closing, and (ii) cash incentive compensation opportunities as a
percentage of base salary or hourly wage rates that are at least equal to the
cash incentive compensation opportunities provided to the Transferred Employee
immediately prior to the Closing as such a percentage, and (iii) to provide
the Transferred Employees in the aggregate with other compensation and
employee benefits (other than severance payments and benefits and equity
compensation) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the other
compensation and employee benefits (other than severance payments
and benefits and equity compensation) provided to such Transferred Employees
in the aggregate, _provided_ , that Buyer is not obligated to take into
account for comparability any (x) retention, deal-based bonuses, or other
changes in compensation in each case established in connection with preparing
for and carrying out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (y) any
benefits continuing to be provided by Seller pursuant to the Transition

(b) Subject, and in addition, to the requirements imposed by applicable Law,
Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, provide each Transferred

severance payments and benefits that are no less favorable than the
severance payments and benefits that would have been provided to the
Transferred Employee upon a similar termination of employment immediately
prior to the Closing.

 

(c) Except as otherwise agreed to between the Buyer and the Seller with
respect to an Offer Employee, Buyer shall, or shall cause one of
its Affiliates to, provide each Transferred Employee with full credit for
such Transferred Employees service with Seller or any of its Affiliates or
predecessors prior to the Closing for eligibility, vesting, and determination
of vacation and severance benefits under any benefit plan sponsored or
maintained by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates (each, a " _Buyer Plan_ ") in
which such Transferred Employee is eligible to participate on or following the
Closing Date;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such service shall not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication
of benefits or provide service credits for defined benefit accruals with
respect to defined benefit plans. With respect to each Buyer Plan in which
one or more Transferred Employees are eligible to participate on or following
the Closing Date that is a health or benefits plan, Buyer shall, or shall
cause one of its Affiliates to, (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to
waive any limitation on health coverage of such Transferred Employees due to
pre-existing conditions, waiting periods, active employment requirements and

77  commercially reasonable efforts to credit each such Transferred Employee
with all deductible payments, co-payments and co-insurance paid by such
Transferred Employee under any Employee Benefit Plan prior to the Closing
during the year in which the Closing occurs for the purpose of determining the
extent to which any such Transferred Employee has satisfied any applicable
deductible and whether such Transferred Employee has reached the out-of-pocket
maximum for such year, such crediting to be required if and only to the
extent that Seller has provided all information, and in a format, reasonably
requested by Buyer and necessary to provide such credit.

 

(d) Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, assume all

(a) _Assumed Pension Liabilities_. From and after the Closing, the Assumed
Pension Liabilities shall become or remain, as applicable, the responsibility
of the applicable Transferred FH Company or Closing Subsidiary. Seller shall
ensure that all Assumed Pension Assets related to the Assumed Pension
Liabilities shall be transferred to or held by the applicable Transferred FH
Company or Closing Subsidiary. All other Liabilities relating in any manner
to any Seller Pension Plan shall be retained or assumed by Seller or its
applicable post-Closing Affiliate.

 

(b) Upon completion of the transfer of assets and liabilities as described in
this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, Buyer or such applicable Affiliate and the
applicable Buyer pension plan shall be fully responsible for all benefits
relating to past service of such Transferred Pension Participants and none of
Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall have any liabilities whatsoever with
respect to such benefits. Effective as of the Closing Date, the Transferred
Pension Participants shall cease to accrue any additional benefits under any
Seller Pension Plans. Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall
use reasonable best efforts to ensure that Seller and its Affiliates are
released from any existing surety (if applicable) for Assumed Pension
Liabilities.

 

(c) Specific procedures for the determination and transfer of Assumed Pension
Assets and Assumed Pension Liabilities for the Seller U.S. DB Plan are listed
in _Section_ __ _ 6.3(c)_ of the Sellers Disclosure Letter.

Section 6.4  _Treatment of 401(k) Plan Accounts_.

(a) Effective as of the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its
Affiliates to, have in effect a defined contribution retirement plan that is
tax-qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and includes a qualified cash
or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (the
" _Buyer 401(k) Plan_ "). Each U.S. Transferred Employee who is a participant
immediately prior to the Closing in a defined contribution retirement plan of
the Seller that is tax-qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (each, a "
_Seller 401(k) Plan_ ") shall be enrolled in the Buyer 401(k) Plan as soon as
practicable following the Closing Date. Each U.S. Transferred Employee who is
not a participant in the Seller 401(k) Plan immediately prior to the Closing
shall be permitted to enroll in the Buyer 401(k) Plan after the Closing Date
in accordance with the terms of the Buyer 401(k) Plan.

 



78 (b) Buyer shall cause the Buyer 401(k) Plan to provide each U.S. Transferred
Employee with full credit for such U.S. Transferred Employees service with
Seller or any of Sellers Affiliates or predecessors prior to the Closing for
purposes of eligibility and vesting under the Buyer 401(k) Plan.

 

(c) As soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date, Seller shall take all
commercially reasonable measures needed to cause the transfer to the Buyer

are attributable to U.S. Transferred Employees, including all promissory notes
and receivables in respect of plan loans to U.S. Transferred Employees under
the Seller 401(k) Plan that remain outstanding as of the Closing and accrued
liabilities arising out of any applicable qualified domestic relations order.
Buyer shall direct the trustee of the Buyer 401(k) Plan to accept such
transfer of assets and liabilities from the Seller 401(k) Plan. Such transfer
of assets and liabilities shall be made in accordance with the applicable
requirements of _Section_ __ _ 411(d)(6)_ and _414(l)_ of the Code.

 

(d) Buyer and Seller shall cooperate to take any and all commercially
reasonable measures needed to effect the transition to the Buyer 401(k) Plan
of all outstanding loans under the Seller 401(k) Plan with respect to U.S.
Transferred Employees so as to prevent, to the extent reasonably possible, a
deemed distribution or loan offset with respect to such outstanding loans.
Such actions may include, for example, amending the Seller 401(k) Plan to
permit a U.S. Transferred Employee to continue to make scheduled loan payments
to the Seller 401(k) Plan after the Closing, but before the Seller 401(k) Plan
assets and liabilities are transferred to the Buyer 401(k) Plan, and adopting
administrative procedures to facilitate such loan payments.

Section 6.5  _Treatment of Flexible Spending Accounts_. Unless otherwise
agreed to by Buyer and Seller, effective as of the Closing, Buyer shall, or

account plan in which the U.S. Transferred Employees shall be eligible to
participate (the " _Buyer FSA Plan_ "). Effective on or as soon as practicable
after the Closing, Seller shall transfer the account balances of the U.S.
Transferred Employees from the applicable medical and dependent care account
plans of Seller and its Affiliates (each, a " _Seller FSA Plan_ ") to the
Buyer FSA Plan, and Buyer shall be responsible for the obligations of the
Seller FSA Plan to provide benefits to the U.S. Transferred Employees with
respect to such transferred account balances at or after the Closing. Buyer
shall continue to honor all payroll deductions as most recently elected by the
U.S. Transferred Employee under the Seller FSA Plan for the remainder of the
year in which the Closing occurs. Effective on or as soon as practicable after
the Closing, (i) if the aggregate benefits paid by the Seller FSA Plan to the
U.S. Transferred Employees prior to the Closing exceed the aggregate payroll
deductions made in respect of the U.S. Transferred Employees at or prior to
the Closing, then Buyer shall reimburse Seller for the amount of such excess
or (ii) if the aggregate payroll deductions made in respect of the U.S.
Transferred Employees at or prior to the Closing exceed the aggregate
benefits paid by the Seller FSA Plan to the U.S. Transferred Employees prior
to the Closing, then Seller shall reimburse Buyer for the amount of such
excess.

 



79 Section 6.6 _Treatment of Accrued Leave_. Effective as of the Closing, Buyer
shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, assume or retain, as the case
may be, all obligations of the Seller and its Affiliates (including the
Transferred FH Companies and the Closing Subsidiaries) for the accrued and
unpaid annual leave, vacation, and paid time off of the Employees except
where, pursuant to applicable Law, Seller and its Affiliates are required to
pay an accrued amount to an Employee in connection with Closing. For a period
of one year following the Closing (or such longer period as is required by
applicable Law), Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, provide annual
leave, vacation and paid time off benefits to Transferred Employees that are
at least as favorable as those provided under the applicable programs
of Seller and its Affiliates.

Section 6.7 _Labor Consultations_. Seller and its Affiliates shall, and Buyer
and its Affiliates shall, cooperate fully in meeting any information and
consulting obligations or otherwise discussing or negotiating with, relevant
Employee Representatives. Seller shall complete, or cause to be completed,
prior to the Closing, and Buyer shall assist and cooperate fully with Seller
in causing to be completed, all notifications to, and all consultations with,
employees, Employee Representatives, labor boards and relevant Governmental
Authorities concerning the acquisition and the other transactions
contemplated hereby whether an information or consulting obligation or
otherwise pursuant to the Transfer Regulations or other applicable Law. Buyer
and the Transferred FH Companies and the Closing Subsidiaries, jointly and
severally, shall indemnify Seller against any Liability which arises out of a
complaint or failure or alleged failure to provide applicable information or
otherwise cooperate fully with Seller and its Affiliates in meeting any and
all information and consultation obligations or in respect of any subsequent
award of compensation in respect of a breach or alleged breach of the
information and consultation obligations where that complaint or failure to
act is primarily a result of an act or omission of Buyer or one of its
Affiliates.

Section 6.8 _WARN Act_. Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, agrees
to provide any required notice under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act of 1988, as amended, or any similar applicable state, local,
or foreign law or regulation requiring notice to employees in the event of a
closing or layoff (the " _WARN Act_ ") after the Closing Date, and to
otherwise comply with the WARN Act with respect to any "plant closing" or
"mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act) or group termination or similar
event affecting Employees (including as a result of the consummation of
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and occurring from and after the
Closing. Buyer shall not, and shall not permit its Affiliates to, take any
action on or after the Closing Date that would cause any termination of
employment of any Employees by any member of the Seller or its Affiliates
occurring prior to the Closing Date to constitute a "plant closing," "mass

use reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other to effectuate the
provisions set forth in this _Article VI_ relating to the transfer of the

80  Assets and Liabilities, including by using reasonable efforts to cooperate
to (i) exchange information related to Employees and their dependents and
beneficiaries, including employment records and benefits information and any
historic records needed to administer obligations under assumed pension plans
and retiree plans and programs (subject in each case to the Sellers
reasonable, good faith determination that the exchange of such information is
in compliance with all applicable employee data protection Laws), (ii)
transfer the participation of Transferred Employees from Seller Benefit Plans
to Buyer Plans where applicable, (iii) allow Employees to remain on medical
coverage with Seller for a post-Closing transition period of ninety (90) days
to facilitate Buyers providing comparable benefits, and (iv) encourage
Employees to become Transferred Employees. Seller and Buyer and
their respective Affiliates (including the Transferred FH Companies and their
Closing Subsidiaries) shall mutually agree, in good faith, to reasonable
processes, procedures and/or documentation relating to any material employee

ARTICLE VII

 

 _TAX MATTERS_

 

Section 7.1 _Straddle Periods_ .

 

(a) Buyer and Seller agree that they will treat the Transferred FH Companies
and the Closing Subsidiaries as if they ceased to be part of the Sellers
"affiliated group" (within the meaning of Section 1504 of the Code, and any
comparable or similar provision of state, local or foreign Laws), as of the
close of business on the Closing Date. Buyer and Seller agree that if any
Transferred FH Company or Closing Subsidiary is permitted but not required
under applicable foreign, state or local Tax Laws to treat the Closing Date as
the last day of a taxable period, Buyer and Seller shall treat such day as the
last day of a taxable period; _provided_ , _however_ , and without affecting
the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_, Seller shall not be required to
treat the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable period of any
Transferred FH Company or Closing Subsidiary to the extent that such
treatment would materially increase the Tax liability of Seller, the
applicable FH Share Seller or such Transferred FH Company or Closing
Subsidiary in each case attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period.

 



81 (b) In the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the
Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the determination of Taxes
attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period
shall be made by assuming that the Straddle Period ended on the Closing Date
(and for such purpose, the taxable period of any partnership or other pass-
through entity will be deemed to terminate at such time), except that (1)
exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis
and (2) Taxes (such as real or personal property Taxes) that are imposed on a
periodic basis, in each case, shall be prorated on the basis of the number of
days in the Pre-Closing Tax Period as compared to the number of days in the
Post-Closing Tax Period. Taxes attributable to Subpart F income, determined in
accordance with Section 952 of the Code, of a Transferred FH Company or
Closing Subsidiary that is characterized as a foreign corporation for U.S.
federal income tax purposes for the taxable year including the Closing Date
shall be allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax
Period assuming that the taxable year of the Transferred FH Company or
Closing Subsidiary terminated on the Closing Date.

Section 7.2 _Tax Returns_.

 

(a) Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ hereof, Seller shall (at its
own expense) prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file or cause to be filed,
when due, (i) all Tax Returns for any Affiliated Group of which any
Transferred FH Company or Closing Subsidiary is a member that also includes
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates), (ii) all Tax Returns of the
FH Asset Sellers, (iii) all income Tax Returns of the Transferred FH Companies
and Closing Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than a Straddle
Period), and (iv) all other Tax Returns of the Transferred FH Companies and
Closing Subsidiaries required to be filed (taking into account extensions)
prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall and shall cause the Transferred FH
Companies and their Closing Subsidiaries to cooperate with, and take any
action reasonably requested by, Seller with respect to the preparation and
filing of such Tax Returns. The immediately preceding sentence shall, in no
way, be construed as limiting or otherwise modifying the rights
and obligations of the parties under _Section_ __ _ 7.6_ hereof. With
respect to any such Tax Returns filed after the Closing Date, such Tax Returns
shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the past practice of Seller and
its Subsidiaries and their Affiliates unless otherwise required by Law, and
Seller shall provide drafts of such Tax Returns (or in the case of Tax Returns
of an Affiliated Group, pro forma versions of such Tax Returns reflecting only
the items of the Transferred FH Companies and Closing Subsidiaries) to Buyer
at least forty-five (45) days prior to the due date for filing such Tax
Returns in the case of income Tax Returns, and in such period of time prior to
filing as Seller shall reasonably determine to be practicable in the case of
other Tax Returns. Buyer shall provide any comments to Seller with respect to
such Tax Returns within fifteen (15) days of Buyers receipt thereof (or as
soon as reasonably practicable if such Tax Return was provided for review
less than thirty (30) days prior to filing), and Seller shall incorporate all
reasonable comments provided by Buyer.

 

(b) Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ hereof, Buyer shall (at its own
expense) prepare, or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed, when
due, all Tax Returns with respect to the Transferred FH Companies and their
Closing Subsidiaries or the Acquired FH

 



82  Assets required to be filed, other than those described in _Section_ __ _
7.2(a)_ hereof, and each such Tax Return with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the past practice of the
Transferred FH Companies and Closing Subsidiaries unless otherwise required by
Law. If Seller may be required to indemnify Buyer pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.4(a)_, in respect of Taxes shown on any such Tax Return, Buyer shall provide
drafts of such Tax Return to Seller at least forty-five (45) days prior to the
due date for filing such Tax Return in the case of income Tax Returns, and in
such period of time prior to filing as Buyer shall reasonably determine to be
practicable in the case of other Tax Returns. Seller shall provide any
comments to Buyer with respect to such Tax Returns within fifteen (15) days
of Sellers receipt thereof (or as soon as reasonably practicable if such Tax
Return was provided for review less than thirty (30) days prior to filing),
and Buyer shall incorporate all reasonable comments provided by Seller.

(c) If for any reason the Buyer or Seller does not agree with any of the
comments provided by the other party pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_, the Buyer or Seller, as applicable, shall notify the
other party of its disagreement within fifteen (15) days of receiving such
comments. Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any
disputes over such Tax Returns for fifteen (15) days. Any disputes over such
Tax Returns that cannot be resolved through negotiations between Buyer and
Seller shall be taken to the Independent Accountants. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither Buyer nor Seller shall be obligated to take any position on
any such Tax Returns that the Independent Accountants do not determine to be
at least more likely than not to be sustained by a court of law if
challenged; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing limitation shall not
apply and Buyer or Seller shall be required to take any such position if the
other party (at its expense) provides an opinion (or other written advice or
evidence) to Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, from a nationally recognized
law or accounting firm, which opinion (or other written advice or evidence) is
reasonably satisfactory to the party to which it is provided, concluding
that such position is at least more likely than not to be sustained by a
court of law if challenged. The costs and expenses of the Independent
Accountants shall be borne by Buyer and Seller, respectively, in the
proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of the items that are
unsuccessfully disputed by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, (as finally
determined by the Independent Accountants) bears to the aggregate dollar
amount of the items submitted to the Independent Accountants.

 

Section 7.3 _Contest Provisions_.

 

(a) _Notification of Contests_. Seller and its Affiliates, on the one hand,
and Buyer and its Affiliates, on the other hand (the " _Recipient_ "), shall
notify the other party in writing within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by
the Recipient of written notice of any pending or threatened audits,
adjustments, assessments, examinations or proceedings (whether judicial or
administrative) which may affect the liability for Taxes of such other party
or may give rise to an indemnification payment under _Section_ __ _ 9.4(a)_
or _Section_ __ _ 9.4(b)_ by such other party (a " _Tax Audit_ ");
_provided_ , that failure to give such notice (or the provision of notice that
is not in sufficient detail to notify the other party of the nature of the Tax
Audit) shall not void any indemnification obligation hereunder except to the
extent such failure to give proper notice materially adversely affects the
other partys right to participate in and contest the Tax Audit.

 



83 (b) _Control of Tax Audits_.

 

(i) In the case of any Tax Audit of (A) any Tax Return prepared and filed by
Seller or required to be prepared and filed by Seller hereunder and, or (B)
any Tax Return in respect of any Straddle Period which Tax Audit relates
primarily to Taxes for which Seller is liable hereunder, Seller may assume the
defense of such Tax Audit by providing written notice to Buyer within fifteen
(15) days of the receipt of the notice required under _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_.
Subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_(iii), Buyer may observe, at its own
expense, the defense of such Tax Audit and employ counsel of its choice at
its expense and Seller shall keep Buyer informed regarding the progress and
substantive aspects of such Tax Audit and, upon the reasonable request Buyer,
shall consult with Buyer from time to time regarding the conduct of such Tax
Audit. If Seller does not assume the defense of any such Tax Audit, Buyer
shall defend such Tax Audit in accordance with the provisions of _Section_ __
_ 7.3(b)_(ii) and shall not settle or otherwise dispose of such Tax Audit
without Sellers prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(ii) Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)(i)_, and _Section_ __ _
7.3(b)(iii)_, Buyer shall control all Tax Audits; _provided_ that (i) Buyer
shall keep Seller informed regarding the progress and substantive aspects of
any issues in such Tax Audit for which Seller may have liability pursuant to
this Agreement or be entitled to a payment pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.5_,
(ii) Seller shall be entitled to participate in such Tax Audit with respect
to any issues for which Seller may have liability pursuant to this Agreement
and (iii) Buyer shall not settle or otherwise dispose of any issues in such
Tax Audit for which the Seller may have liability pursuant to this
Agreement, without obtaining Sellers prior written consent (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(iii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
Buyer shall not be entitled to participate in any Tax Audit relating to any
consolidated, combined, affiliated or unitary Tax Return that includes the
Seller or any of its Affiliates. If any Tax Audit controlled by Seller
pursuant to Section 7.3(b)(i) may have the effect of materially increasing the
Tax liability of Buyer, the Transferred FH Companies, any Closing Subsidiary,
or any other Subsidiary or Affiliate of Buyer for any Post-Closing Tax Period
and for which the Buyer Indemnified Parties would not have a right to
indemnification hereunder, Seller shall not settle or otherwise dispose of any
such Tax Audit without Buyers prior written consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

Section 7.4 _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, all Taxes with respect to any excise, sales, use, transfer
(including real property transfer), stamp, documentary, filing, recordation
and other similar Taxes arising directly or indirectly from the signing of
this Agreement or Closing (including, for the avoidance of doubt, those
arising pursuant to the Local Purchase Agreements) (" _Transfer Taxes_ ")
shall be borne fifty percent (50% by Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by Seller.
The Parties shall (i) file any Tax Returns required to be filed for purposes
of any Transfer Taxes as a result of signing of this Agreement or Closing
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, those arising pursuant to the Local
Purchase Agreements) and (ii) cooperate as reasonably requested by the other
party and keep each other reasonably informed in relation to any Transfer
Taxes. For the avoidance of doubt, Transfer Taxes shall not include VAT
described in  _Section_ __ _ 7.10_.

 



84 Section 7.5 _Certain Post-Closing Settlement Payments and Post-Closing
Actions_.

 

(a) _Refunds and Credits_. Seller shall be entitled to any Tax refunds that
are received by Buyer and any amounts credited against Tax to which the
Buyer, the Transferred FH Companies or their Closing Subsidiaries become
entitled (including as a result of any amended Tax Returns) that relate to the
Transferred FH Companies or their Closing Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax
Periods or that are subject to indemnification by Seller pursuant to this
Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, refunds or credits in
respect of VAT attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period), to the extent such
refunds or credits were not taken into account in determining Final Net
Working Capital and are not attributable to the carryback of a net operating
loss of any Transferred FH Company or Closing Subsidiary generated in a Post-
Closing Tax Period. Buyer shall transfer, or cause to be transferred, to
Seller, within ten (10) days of receipt, the amount of the refund or credit
(including interest) received or utilized by Buyer, the Transferred FH
Companies or any of their Closing Subsidiaries, or any of their respective
Affiliates, net of any reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in obtaining
such refund or credit and any Taxes borne by Buyer, the Transferred FH
Companies or any of their Closing Subsidiaries, or any of their respective
Affiliates as a direct result of their receipt of such refund or utilization
of any such credit. Buyer shall claim any such refund or to utilize any such
credit as soon as reasonably possible upon Sellers written request. Buyer
agrees to furnish to Seller all information, records and assistance reasonably
requested by Seller to verify the amount of the refund or credit, provided
that Buyer shall not be required to furnish to Seller any consolidated,
combined, affiliated or unitary Tax Return that includes Buyer or any
Subsidiary or Affiliate of Buyer other than the Transferred FH Companies or
any of their Closing Subsidiaries. The amount of economic benefit of any such
refunds or credits of the Transferred FH Companies and their Closing
Subsidiaries for any Straddle Period shall be equitably apportioned between
Seller and Buyer in a manner consistent with _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ hereof.

(b)  _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_. None of Buyer, the Transferred FH Companies
or their Closing Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates shall amend any Tax
Return prepared and filed by Seller pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_
hereof without the prior written consent of Seller (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(c) _Post-Closing Actions_. After the Closing, none of Buyer or its Affiliates
and the Transferred FH Companies or their Closing Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Affiliates shall make or change any Tax election or take any
other action relating in whole or in part to the Transferred FH Companies or
their Closing Subsidiaries or agree to the waiver or extension of the statute
of limitations with respect to Taxes of the Transferred FH Companies or their
Closing Subsidiaries, in each case with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
and that would have retroactive effect in a Pre-Closing Tax Period, without
the prior written consent of Seller (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 

Section 7.6 _Mutual Cooperation_. Seller and Buyer shall, and each shall cause
its Affiliates to, cooperate with each other in paying any Taxes, filing any
Tax Return and conducting any Tax Audit (including any judicial or

other, its officers, directors, employees and agents for any fact finding,
consultation and discussions related to the preparation and filing of any Tax
Return, the conduct of any Tax Audit (including any judicial or administrative
proceeding), and any other matter with respect to Taxes; (g) execute such
powers of attorney as are reasonably requested and required by Seller or any
of Sellers Affiliates or Buyer or any of Buyers Affiliates on behalf of, as

Sellers Affiliates to enable the requesting party to represent the other
party in a Tax Audit involving a Tax for which the requesting party is liable
under applicable Law; and (h) take any action reasonably necessary to obtain
and provide any receipts or other proof of payment form any Tax Authority

Returns other than information relating solely to the Transferred FH
Companies, the Closing Subsidiaries and the Acquired FH Assets. Seller and

of limitation (including periods of waiver) has expired for any Tax Return

respective Affiliates shall retain all Tax work papers and related materials
in its possession and under its control that were used in the preparation of
any such Tax Return. Each party will notify the other party sixty (60) days
prior to disposing of any Tax records relating to Pre-Closing Tax Periods
and will deliver to such other party any such records requested by such
party.

Section 7.8 _Section_ __ _ 338(g) Election_ _and related Matters_.

(a) Buyer shall not, without the prior written consent of Seller (which may
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), make or file an

(a) _Termination of Existing Tax Sharing Agreements_. Seller hereby agrees and
covenants that any Tax Sharing Agreement to which any of the Transferred FH

terminate and be void and have no effect and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be abandoned; _provided_ , that if (x) such termination shall (I)
result from the Intentional Breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or other agreement contained herein or (II) occur following an Intentional
Breach or (y) the Intentional Breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or other agreement contained herein shall cause the Closing not to occur,
then, except as otherwise provided in  _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_, such
breaching party shall be fully liable for any and all damages incurred or
suffered by the other party as a result of such failure or breach. If this
Agreement is terminated as provided herein:

 

(i) each party hereto will redeliver, and will cause its agents (including

due pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_, and, in order to obtain such
payment, Seller commences a suit that results in a judgment against Buyer for
the amount set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_ or any portion thereof, Buyer
shall pay to Sellers designee its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees) incurred in connection with such suit.

 

(d) Subject to Sellers right to seek specific performance pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 10.7_ and any order pursuant thereto, in any circumstance in
which Seller is permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 9.1(f)_ and receive the Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.2(b)_, Sellers termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.1(f)_ and receipt of the Reverse Termination Fee from Buyer pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller and
its Affiliates against Buyer, the Financing Sources and the Financing Related
Parties and any of their respective, direct or indirect, former, current or
future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members,
directors, officers, Affiliates, employees, agents, other Representatives or
assignees (collectively, with the Buyer, the " _Buyer Related Parties_ ") for
any loss suffered as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement in this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby
or the Debt Commitment Letter, and upon such termination by Seller and receipt
of the Reverse Termination Fee, none of the Buyer Related Parties shall have
any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or the Debt Commitment
Letter (except that Buyer shall remain obligated for, and Seller and its
Subsidiaries may be entitled to remedies with respect to, any breach of the

or otherwise.

agreement); _provided_ , that for the avoidance of doubt, (x) the obligations
of Buyer to assume, and to indemnify Seller Indemnified Parties for, the
Assumed Liabilities and (y) the obligations of Seller to retain, and indemnify

Parties organized outside of the United States arising from the deductibility

amount otherwise paid to it or a reduction in the amount otherwise paid by it
pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof.

to indemnification) until it is finally and fully resolved. Any Action or
claim for Losses subject to indemnification under this  _Section_ __ _ 9.4_
with respect to a breach of any covenant or agreement may be made at any time
during the term of such covenant or agreement or prior to the one year
anniversary of any termination of such covenant or agreement pursuant to
Section 9.3.

(f) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, no indemnity may be
sought pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.4(a)_ in respect of any Losses or Taxes

of business (other than any such action expressly required or permitted by
this Agreement or required by applicable Law) (a " _Buyer Tax Act_ ") or (ii)
that are Transfer Taxes for which Buyer is responsible under  _Section_ __ _
7.4_, or (iii) that are Taxes attributable to a Post-Closing Tax Period other

or _Section 9.4(a)(ii)(H)_.

 



96 (g)

 

(i) Upon receipt by a Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party (the
" _Indemnified Party_ ") of notice from a third party of any Third Party
Claim against such Indemnified Party with respect to which such Indemnified
Party desires to make a claim for Losses under this _Section_ __ _ 9.4_
(other than any such action, suit, proceeding, claim, demand or assessment
relating to Taxes), the Indemnified Party (or Seller or Buyer on behalf of an
Indemnified Party) shall promptly give written notice thereof to the party
from whom indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") setting
forth, with reasonable specificity, the nature of and facts underlying each
particular claim (including a description of the basis on which
indemnification is being sought under this Agreement), a copy of any
documentation received from the third party and, to the extent known, an
estimate of the Losses relating thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure
to give such notice shall not eliminate the right to indemnification provided
hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been
prejudiced as a result of such failure. The Indemnifying Party shall have the
right, at its option, to assume the defense of, at its own expense and by its
own counsel, any such matter as to which the Indemnified Party is seeking
indemnification hereunder; _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party may assume
control of such defense only if (A) it acknowledges in writing to the
Indemnified Party that any Losses that may be assessed against the
Indemnified Party in connection with such Third Party Claim constitute Losses
for which the Indemnified Party shall be indemnified fully pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 9.4_ and (B) such Third Party Claim does not involve criminal
liability of the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates or seek material
injunctive relief against the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates. If
the Indemnifying Party shall, in accordance with the preceding sentence,
undertakes to assume control of the defense of such Third Party Claim, it
shall notify the Indemnified Party of its intention to do so within thirty
(30) days after the Indemnifying Party initially receives notice of such Third
Party Claim from the Indemnified Party (it being understood that the
Indemnified Party shall have the right prior to receipt of such notice from
the Indemnifying Party to take all actions that the Indemnified Party deems
necessary or appropriate to preserve its rights with respect to such Third
Party Claim), and the Indemnified Party shall agree to cooperate fully, at the
Indemnifying Partys expense, with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in
the compromise of, or defense against, any such Third Party Claim; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any such asserted
liability without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to
be unreasonably withheld) unless such settlement fully and unconditionally
releases the Indemnified Party in connection with such matter and provides
relief consisting solely of money damages borne by the Indemnifying Party.
Notwithstanding an election of the Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of
such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ
separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim.
The Indemnifying Party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of
one firm of counsel to the Indemnified Party in each jurisdiction (and shall
pay such fees, costs and expenses to or as directed by the Indemnified Party
at least quarterly), if, but only if, (x) the defendants in, or targets of,
any such action or proceeding include both an Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party, and such Indemnified Party shall have reasonably
concluded, based on the advice of counsel, that there is a material conflict
of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party with
respect to such proceeding (in which case the Indemnifying Party shall not
have the right to direct the defense of such action or proceeding on behalf of
the Indemnified Party) or (y) the Indemnified Party controls the defense of
such Third Party Claim in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 9.4(g)_. In
any event, the Indemnified Party and its counsel shall cooperate with the
Indemnifying

 



97  Party and the non-controlling party and its counsel and shall not assert any
position in any proceeding inconsistent with that asserted by the
controlling party. The controlling party shall keep the non-controlling party
advised of the status of such Third Party Claim and the defense thereof and
shall consider in good faith recommendations made by such non-controlling
party with respect thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the provisions of Section 9.4(g) of the Sellers Disclosure Letter
will apply with respect to any Third Party Claim relating to Retained
Asbestos Liabilities.

(ii) If the Indemnifying Party does not assume or have the right to
assume control of the defense of any Third Party Claim pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 9.4(g)(i)_ above, then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
participate in any such defense at its sole cost and expense, but in such
case, the Indemnified Party shall control the investigation and defense of
the Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that, the Indemnified Party
shall not consent to any settlement of a Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be unreasonably withheld).
The Indemnifying Partys decision to allow the Indemnified Party to take the
lead with respect to any indemnity obligation of the Indemnifying Party shall
not limit, expand or otherwise affect the Indemnifying Partys obligation to
indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to any such indemnity obligation,
and if an Indemnified Party settles a Third Party Claim it is defending
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 9.4(g)_(ii) without obtaining the
Indemnifying Partys written consent to such settlement in violation of the
immediately preceding sentence, then the Indemnifying Party shall be relieved
of its indemnification obligations hereunder with respect to such Third Party
Claim, to the extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby.

(iii) In the event any Indemnified Party should have an indemnification claim
against any Indemnifying Party under this Agreement that does not involve a
Third Party Claim, promptly after becoming aware of any facts or circumstances
which the Indemnified Party believes have given or would reasonably be
expected to give rise to a right of indemnification pursuant to this
Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim to the
Indemnifying Party in writing setting forth, with reasonable specificity, the
nature of and facts underlying each particular claim (including a description
of the basis on which indemnification is being sought under this Agreement)
and, to the extent known, an estimate of the Losses relating thereto.
The failure by any Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying Party
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability that it may have
to such Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
has been prejudiced by such failure. If the Indemnifying Party disputes its
liability with respect to such claim, the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of
such dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be
resolved by litigation in the appropriate court of competent jurisdiction.

(h) Except in cases of fraud or Intentional Breach, the indemnification
provisions of this Agreement (i) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy (other
than injunctive relief or specific performance as contemplated by _Section_ __
_ 10.7_) following the Closing with respect to any breach or non-fulfillment
of any representation, warranty, agreement, covenant or any other obligation
contained in this Agreement or the Transition Services Agreement, (ii) shall
apply without regard to, and shall not be subject to, any limitation by reason
of set-off, limitation or otherwise and (iii) are intended to be comprehensive
and not to be limited by any 

 



98  requirements of Law concerning prominence of language or waiver of any legal
right under any Law (including rights under any workers compensation statute
or similar statute conferring immunity from suit). In furtherance of the
foregoing, each party hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, any and all other rights, claims and causes of action
(including rights of contributions, if any) known or unknown, foreseen
or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future, that it may have
against Seller or any of its Affiliates or Buyer or any of its Affiliates, as
the case may be, arising under or based upon any Law (including any such Law
relating to environmental matters (including Environmental Laws) or arising
under or based upon any securities Law, common Law or otherwise).

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, except in
cases of fraud or Intentional Breach or, in the case of the following clause
(ii), breaches of Seller Fundamental Representations or Buyer Fundamental
Representations, neither Seller nor Buyer shall be required to provide
indemnification for Losses under _Section_ __ _ 9.4(a)(i)(C)_, _Section_ __ _
9.4(a)(ii)(F)_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.4(b)(i)(C)_ to the Buyer Indemnified
Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties, respectively, (i) for any individual
item where the Loss relating thereto is less than $75,000 (the " _De Minimis
Claim Threshold_ ") or (ii) in respect of each individual item where the
Loss relating thereto is equal to or greater than the De Minimis Claim
Threshold, unless (i) in the case of breaches of _Section_ __ _ 3.24_, the
aggregate amount of all Losses incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties in
respect of claims that exceed the De Minimis Claim Threshold (in the
aggregate) exceeds $1,000,000 (the " _Lower_ _Basket_ "), in which case the
obligation to provide indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 9.4(a)(i)(C)_
to the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall only apply with respect to such
amounts that are in excess of the Lower Basket or (ii) the aggregate amount of
all Losses incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified
Parties, as applicable, in respect of claims that exceed the De Minimis Claim
Threshold (in the aggregate) (other than Losses incurred by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties in respect of breaches of _Section_ __ _ 3.24_ by Seller,
which shall not be taken into account) exceeds $6,000,000 (the " _Basket_ "),
in which case the obligation to provide indemnification under _Section_ __ _
9.4(a)(i)(C)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.4(a)(ii)(F)_ or  _Section_ __ _
9.4(b)(i)(C)_ to the Buyer Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties,
as the case may be, shall only apply with respect to such amounts that are in
excess of the Basket.

 

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, except in cases
of fraud or Intentional Breach, neither Seller nor Buyer shall be required to
make payments for indemnification to Buyer Indemnified Parties or the Seller
Indemnified Parties, respectively, (i) under _Section_ __ _ 9.4(a)(i)(C)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 9.4(a)(ii)(F)_(other than in cases of breaches of Seller
Fundamental Representations) or _Section_ __ _ 9.4(b)(i)(C)_ (other than in
cases of breaches of Buyer Fundamental Representations) when the aggregate
amounts paid by Seller or Buyer, as applicable, with respect thereto exceeds
$58,250,000 or (ii) under _Section_ __ _ 9.4(a)(i)(C)_, _Section_ __ _
9.4(a)(ii)(F)_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.4(b)(i)(C)_ when the aggregate amounts
paid by Seller or Buyer, as applicable, with respect thereto exceeds the
Final Purchase Price.

(k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, for purposes
of determining (i) whether there has been a breach of any representation or
warranty set forth in this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.2(c)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 8.3(c)_ and (ii) the amount of
Losses for which an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under
this _Section_ __ _ 9.4_, each such representation or warranty (other than
the representations and warranties set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.5(a)_, the
first sentence of _Sections 3.6_ , _3.8_ , _4.11(b)_ , _4.11(d)_ and any other

 



99  representations and warranties calling for a list of "material" items) shall
be deemed to have been made without any qualifications or limitations as to
materiality (including any qualifications or limitations made by reference to
a Material Adverse Effect or Buyer Material Adverse Effect).

(l) Any payments made to a party pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.4_ shall
be treated as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price for Tax purposes to
the extent permitted by Law.

 

(m) (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Sellers
indemnity obligation pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.4(a)(i)(C)_ with respect
to any breach of Sellers representations and warranties set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 3.13_ shall be subject to the following limitations:

 

(1) if the cost of Cleanup or for correcting a non-compliance with
Environmental Law subject to indemnity by Seller is increased after the
Closing due to an act or omission by any Person other than Seller, any of its
respective employees or representatives or a Governmental Authority acting
pursuant to its jurisdiction, Seller shall not be responsible for any such
increase in costs incurred;

(2) Seller shall not be responsible for any costs, including costs of Cleanup
and for corrective actions, to the extent such costs are incurred due to (A)
any change in Environmental Laws; (B) any change resulting or arising from the
closure, sale, modification, excavation, or construction of, or at, a
facility, premises or business; (C) any change in use of the facilities from
manufacturing to any other use; or (D) implementation of any Cleanup or
corrective action that is not conducted to achieve the least stringent
applicable Remediation Standards and in the most cost-effective manner to the
extent approved by relevant Governmental Authority; and

 

(3) Seller shall not be responsible for costs of Cleanup, corrective action,
or other Losses arising out of or related to any investigation, compliance or
risk audit, assessment, study or other remedial or corrective action that any
Buyer Indemnified Party voluntarily initiates, performs or causes to be
performed by any Person or Governmental Authority (including costs or Losses
arising out of or related to any investigation, compliance or risk audit,
assessment, study or other remedial or corrective action that any Buyer
Indemnified Party initiates, performs or causes to be performed which is not
required by any Environmental Law or by a Governmental Authority).

(ii) With respect to any claim involving a demand for the investigation or
Cleanup of any exposure to or Release of Hazardous Substance, Seller shall
have the right to take the lead and implement any such investigation or
Cleanup. Buyer may, at its own expense, remain reasonably involved. However,
for the avoidance of doubt, Buyers involvement as provided in this paragraph
shall not include voluntary communications or contact of any nature whatsoever
with any Person or Governmental Authority except as specifically pre-approved
in writing by Seller. Seller shall undertake any such work required herein in
a manner designed to minimize disruption, to the extent reasonably
practicable, with the conduct of operations at the Real Property. Buyer shall
agree to allow reasonable access to conduct any of the work contemplated
herein and shall fully cooperate with Seller in the performance of the work.

 



100 (iii) If Buyer or its Affiliates (1) settles any Third Party Claim, or (2)
initiates contact with any Governmental Authority, in relation to any matter
for which Seller has an indemnity obligation pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.4(a)(i)(C)_ for any breach of Sellers representations and warranties set
forth in  _Section_ __ _ 3.13_ without obtaining Sellers prior written
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld), then Seller shall be relieved of
its indemnification obligations hereunder with respect to such matter.

 

ARTICLE X

_MISCELLANEOUS _

Section 10.1 _Amendment and Modifications_. This Agreement may be amended,
modified or supplemented at any time by the parties hereto, but only by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of the parties. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 10.1_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement, _Section_ __ _ 9.2(d)_, this _Section_ __ _ 10.1_, _Section_ __
_ 10.2_, _Section_ __ _ 10.9(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 10.9(c)_, _Section_ __ _
10.14_ and  _Section_ __ _ 10.17_ (and any definition set forth in, or other
provision of, this Agreement to the extent that an amendment or modification
of such definition or other provision would amend or modify the substance of
any of the foregoing provisions) may not be amended or modified in a manner
that would be materially adverse to any Financing Source or any of its
Financing Related Parties without the prior written consent of such adversely
affected Financing Source (and any such amendment or modification without
such prior written consent shall be null and void).

Section 10.2 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, the
parties hereto entitled to the benefits of the respective term or provision
may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties contained herein or in any document, certificate or writing
delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance with any obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition contained herein;  _provided_ that there
shall be no waiver of _Section_ __ _ 9.2(d)_, this _Section_ __ _ 10.2_,
_Section_ __ _ 10.1_, _Section_ __ _ 10.9(b)_,  _Section_ __ _ 10.9(c)_,
_Section_ __ _ 10.14_ or _Section_ __ _ 10.17_ (or any provision of this
Agreement to the extent a waiver of such provision would modify the substance
of any of the foregoing provisions) in a manner that would be materially
adverse to any Financing Source (or its Financing Related Parties) without the
prior written consent of such Financing Source (and any such waiver without
such prior written consent shall be null and void). Any agreement on the part
of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the party not entitled to the
benefits of such extension or waiver. No failure or delay on the part of any
party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder shall impair such right or
be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any
representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of such right preclude other or further exercise thereof or any other
right.

Section 10.3 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement (a) constitutes,
together with the Local Purchase Agreements and the Transition Services
Agreement, the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof (other than the Confidentiality Agreement) and (b) shall not be
assigned by

 



101  operation of law or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that either party
may assign its rights and obligations to any Wholly Owned Subsidiary of such
party (unless to do so would restrict or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), but no such assignment shall
relieve either party of its obligations hereunder; _provided_ _further_ that
Buyer may grant a security interest in, and collaterally assign, any of its
rights under this Agreement in connection with the Debt Financing (so long as
any such assignment does not relieve Buyer of its obligations hereunder).

 

Section 10.4 _Validity_. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision
of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any
other provisions of this Agreement, each of which shall remain in full force
and effect.

Section 10.5  _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other
communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been

Section 10.6 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of laws thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
each of the parties hereto agrees that, except as specifically set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter, all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of the Financing
Sources or any of the Financing Related Parties in any way relating to this
Agreement, the Debt Financing or the performance thereof or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby shall be exclusively governed by, and
constructed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York and
without reference to the choice-of-law principles that would result in the
application of the laws of a different jurisdiction.

 

Section 10.7 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that if any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no
adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would be difficult to
determine, and that, subject to the following provisions of this  _Section_
__ _ 10.7_, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy at law or in
equity. Except as otherwise contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 10.7_, the
parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of injunctive relief,
specific performance or other equitable relief is unenforceable, invalid,
contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of
monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy. Except as otherwise
contemplated by this  _Section_ __ _ 10.7_, each of the parties hereto
hereby waives (a) any defenses in any action for specific performance,
including the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any
requirement under any Law to post a bond or other security as a prerequisite
to obtaining equitable relief. The parties hereto agree that, notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, Seller shall be entitled to specific
performance (or any other equitable relief), to cause Buyer to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, including to effect the Closing in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2_, on the terms and subject to the
conditions in this Agreement, if, and only if: (i) all conditions in
_Section_ __ _ 8.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ have been satisfied as of the
date on which the Closing would otherwise be required to occur (other than
those conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing (
_provided_ such conditions would have been satisfied as of such date)), (ii)
Buyer fails to complete the Closing by the date the Closing would otherwise be
required to have occurred pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.2_, (iii) the full
proceeds of the Debt Financing

 



103  would be available to Buyer at the Closing and (iv) Seller has confirmed in
a written notice delivered to the Buyer that Seller is prepared to and able
to, and will, effect the Closing upon the funding of the Debt Financing. The
parties hereto agree that Seller shall be entitled to enforce specifically
Buyers obligations under this Agreement to draw upon the Debt Financing if,
and only if, each of the following conditions has been satisfied: (x) all of
the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ and
all of the conditions precedent set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter have
been satisfied as of the date on which the Closing would otherwise be
required to occur (other than those conditions that, by their nature, are to
be satisfied at the Closing ( _provided_ such conditions would have been
satisfied as of such date)), (y) Buyer fails to complete the Closing by the
date the Closing would otherwise be required to have occurred pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.2_ and (z) Seller has confirmed in a written notice
delivered to Buyer that Seller is prepared to and able to, and will, effect
the Closing upon the funding of the Debt Financing. The election of Seller to
pursue an injunction or specific performance shall not restrict, impair or
otherwise limit Seller from subsequently seeking to terminate this Agreement
and seeking to collect the Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.2(b)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that under no circumstances shall Seller be
permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 10.7_ and the payment of the Reverse Termination Fee.

 

Section 10.8 _Publicity_. Except as otherwise expressly permitted by this
Agreement, each of the parties to this Agreement hereby agrees with the other
party hereto that no press release or similar public announcement or
communication shall, if prior to, or after, the Closing, be made or be caused
to be made (including by such parties respective Affiliates) concerning the
execution or performance of this Agreement unless the parties shall have
agreed in advance with respect thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing (i)
either party may make or cause to be made any press release or similar public
announcement or communication as may be required to comply with the
requirements of any applicable Laws or the rules and regulations of each stock
exchange upon which the securities of one of the parties is listed and (ii)
Seller may disclose any information concerning the transactions contemplated
hereby which it deems appropriate in its reasonable judgment, in light of its
status as a publicly owned company, including to securities analysts and
institutional investors and in press interviews;  _provided_ , that with
respect to the FH Business (except to the extent it relates to Sellers
activities with respect to the effect on Seller of the separation or
disposition of the FH Business), to the extent practicable, Seller will
try in good faith to remain within the bounds of the parties prior
disclosures.

Section 10.9 _Jurisdiction; Forum, Etc_ _._

(a) The parties hereto agree that the appropriate, exclusive and convenient
forum for any disputes between any of the parties hereto arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be in any state or
federal court in the State of Delaware. The parties hereto further agree that
the parties will not bring suit with respect to any disputes arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any court or
jurisdiction other than the above specified courts; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the foregoing shall not limit (i) Sellers or any of its Subsidiaries
ability or right to join, implead or otherwise bring any third-party claim
against Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries in an action brought against Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries by a third party in a jurisdiction outside of
the State of Delaware and Buyer

 



104  agrees that it (and its Subsidiaries, as applicable) will submit to such
jurisdiction or (ii) Buyers or any of its Subsidiaries ability or right to
join, implead or otherwise bring any third-party claim against Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries in an action brought against Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries by a third party in a jurisdiction outside of the State of
Delaware and Seller agrees that it (and its Subsidiaries, as applicable) will
submit to such jurisdiction. The parties hereto further agree, to the extent
permitted by law, that final and unappealable judgment against a party in any
action or proceeding contemplated above shall be conclusive and may
be enforced in any other jurisdiction within or outside the United States by
suit on the judgment, a certified or exemplified copy of which shall be
conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such judgment.

 

(b) EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT TO ANY
DISPUTE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY SUCH ACTION INVOLVING ANY FINANCING SOURCE OR
FINANCING RELATED PARTY) OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the parties
hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in
law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any
Financing Source or Financing Related Party in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt
Financing or the performance thereof, in any forum other than any federal
court of the United States of America located in, or, if that court does not
have subject matter jurisdiction, in any state court located in, in each case,
the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York.

 

Section 10.10 _Descriptive Headings_. The descriptive headings herein are
inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be part of
or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

Section 10.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be signed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if
the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This
Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have received a
counterpart hereof signed by the other parties hereto. For the convenience of
the parties, any number of counterparts hereof may be executed, each such
executed counterpart shall be deemed an original and all such
counterparts together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Facsimile
transmission (including the e-mail delivery of documents in Adobe PDF format)
of any signed original counterpart and/or retransmission of any signed
facsimile transmission shall be deemed the same as the delivery of an
original.

Section 10.12 _Expenses_. Whether or not the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are consummated, and except as otherwise expressly set forth
herein, all costs and expenses (including legal fees, accounting fees,
investment banking fees and filing fees) incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses (" _Transaction Expenses_ "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any filing fees required in connection with seeking the
Required Antitrust Approvals shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller.

 



105 Section 10.13 _Construction_. The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that
each party and its counsel have reviewed and revised this Agreement and that
any rule of strict construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be
resolved against the drafting party shall not be employed in the
interpretation of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.14 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit
of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended
to confer upon any Person other than Seller and Buyer (and their respective
Subsidiaries), FH Indemnitees under  _Section_ __ _ 5.18_, Skadden and its
respective partners and employees under _Section_ __ _ 5.20_, any rights or
remedies under or by reason of this Agreement, it being understood that the
foregoing shall not limit the right of a Seller Indemnified Party or a Buyer
Indemnified Party to bring claims for indemnification under _Section_ __ _
9.4_ in respect of Losses; _provided_ , that the Financing Sources and, to the
extent specifically described therein their respective Financing Related
Parties shall be third party beneficiaries of _Section_ __ _ 9.2(d)_, this
_Section_ __ _ 10.14_, _Section_ __ _ 10.1_,  _Section_ __ _ 10.2_,
_Section_ __ _ 10.9(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 10.9(c)_ and _Section_ __ _ 10.17_.

 

Section 10.15 _Interpretation_. An item arising with respect to a specific
representation or warranty shall be deemed to be "reflected on," "set forth
in" or "given effect in numbers on" a balance sheet or financial statement, to
the extent any such phrase appears in such representation or warranty, to the
extent that (a) there is a reserve, accrual or other similar item underlying
a number on the face of such balance sheet or financial statement that relates
to the subject matter of such representation or (b) such item is otherwise set
forth on the face of such balance sheet or financial statement or in the
notes thereto.

When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section or Exhibit,
such reference shall be to an Article or Section of, or an Exhibit to, this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Wherever the words "include," "includes"
or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." References to "dollar" or "$"
contained herein are to United States Dollars (unless otherwise specified).
The words "hereof," "herein," "hereby," "hereto" and "hereunder" and words of
similar import, when used in this Agreement, shall refer to this Agreement as
a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The words "date
hereof" or "date of this Agreement" shall refer to the date of this
Agreement. The meaning assigned to each term defined herein shall be equally
applicable to both the singular and the plural forms of such term, and words
denoting any gender shall include all genders. Where a word or phrase is
defined herein, each of its other grammatical forms shall have a corresponding
meaning. References to any federal, state, local or foreign Law shall be
deemed to refer to such federal, state, local or foreign Law as amended from
time to time and to any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder (
_provided_ that for purposes of any representations and warranties contained
in this Agreement that are made as of a specific date or dates, references to
any statute shall be deemed to refer to such statute, as amended, and to any
rules or regulations promulgated thereunder, in each case, as of such date).
References to a contract or agreement mean such contract or agreement as
amended or otherwise supplemented or modified from time to time; _provided_
_that_ with respect to any contract or agreement listed on

 



106  any Schedule or disclosure letter, all such amendments, supplements and
modifications must also be listed in the appropriate Schedule or disclosure
letter. References to a Person are also to its permitted successors and
assigns. References to accounting terms used and not otherwise defined herein
have the meaning assigned to them under GAAP. References to any list on or
attachment to a Schedule or disclosure letter shall mean that such list or
attachment is true, correct and complete. References to "ordinary course of
business" or "ordinary course" shall be deemed to mean "ordinary course of
business consistent with past practices." "Extent" in the phrase "to the
extent" means the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such
phrase does not mean simply "if." A term that begins with an initial capital
letter, is not defined herein and reflects a different part of speech than a
correlative term that begins with an initial capital letter and is defined
herein, shall be interpreted in a correlative manner. No summary of this
Agreement prepared by any party shall affect the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. If any date on which a party is required to make a payment
pursuant to the terms hereof is not a Business Day, then such party shall make
such payment on the next succeeding Business Day. If the Closing shall occur,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any payment
obligation of Buyer hereunder shall be a joint and several obligation of Buyer
and the Transferred FH Companies and their Closing Subsidiaries (other than
any Transferred FH Companies or Closing Subsidiaries thereof that, at such
time, have not been transferred, directly or indirectly, to Buyer in
accordance with this Agreement).

 

Section 10.16 _Disclosure Letters_. Each disclosure letter shall be arranged
in sections and subsections that correspond to the sections and subsections
of this Agreement. The disclosure of any matter in any disclosure letter to
this Agreement shall expressly not be deemed to constitute an admission to any
third party by Seller or Buyer, or to otherwise imply, that any such matter
is material for the purpose of this Agreement. Any information, item or other
disclosure set forth in any section of a disclosure letter shall be deemed to
have been set forth in any other section of such disclosure letter, if, and
only if, the relevance of such disclosure to such other section of such
disclosure letter is reasonably apparent from the fact specified in such
disclosure.

 

Section 10.17 _No Recourse to Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, (a) it is acknowledged and agreed that all claims,
obligations, liabilities or causes of action, whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise, that may be based upon, in respect of, arise
under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to
this Agreement, the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
(including any representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as
an inducement to enter into, this Agreement) or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement may be made only against (and are those solely of) the
entities that are expressly identified as parties to this Agreement in the
Preamble to this Agreement and (b) the Seller agrees, on behalf of itself, its
Affiliates and each of its and its Affiliates respective former, current or
future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members,
controlling persons, agents or Representatives (collectively, the " _Seller
Parties_ ") that the Financing Sources and each of their respective Financing
Related Parties shall be subject to no liability or claims to the Seller
Parties in connection with the Debt Financing or in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether

is compliant with applicable VAT law, including setting forth VAT as may be
required by applicable law.

A Wing, L.B.S. Marg, Ghatkopar (W), Mumbai - 400086, Maharashtra, India and
having Permanent Account Number [] issued by the Indian Income-tax department
(the "Company").

The Buyer, the Seller and the Company shall hereinafter collectively be
referred to as the "Parties" and each individually as a "Party".

WHEREAS

 



   A. | The Company is engaged in the business of manufacture and supply
of pumps and pumping systems. The Company has a total issued and paid up share
capital of INR 40,359,400 (Indian Rupees Forty million three hundred and
fifty nine thousand four hundred) divided into 4,035,940 (Four million thirty
five thousand nine hundred and forty) equity shares of INR 10 (Indian Rupees
Ten) each. 
---|--- 
 



   B. | The Seller is the legal and beneficial owner of 4,035,938 (Four
million thirty five thousand nine hundred and thirty eight) fully paid up
equity shares of the Company (the "Sale Shares").  
---|--- 



   C. | The Seller has agreed to sell and the Buyer has agreed to purchase
the Sale Shares from the Seller, free from all encumbrances and together with
all rights, title and interest therein, on the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement. 
---|--- 



   D. | The shareholding of the Company, aggregating to 100% (One hundred
per cent) of the share capital of the Company, on the Execution Date and
immediately after Closing (as defined hereinafter) is set out in Part A of
Schedule 1 and Part B of Schedule 1, respectively. 
---|--- 



   E. | The Parties now desire to enter into this Agreement, to set out
the terms and conditions mutually agreed upon between the Parties with respect
to purchase of Sale Shares by the Buyer from the Seller. 
---|--- 
 



   1  | Note to Draft: The PAN of the Buyer will be required at the time
of Closing, for the purpose of making Form 15CA/CB filings in India, prior to
remittance of the Purchase Price (see Clause 5.3.1).  
---|--- 
   2  | Note to Draft: The PAN of the Seller is required to be provided to
the Buyer prior to the remittance of the Purchase Price otherwise, the Buyer
would be required to withhold tax from the Purchase Price at the rate of 20%
(instead of 10% applicable on long term capital gains in all other cases).
However, if the Seller is unable to obtain the PAN by the Closing Date,
another alternative for ensuring that the tax provision imposing the higher
tax rate of 20% is not attracted is if the Seller furnishes the following
alternate documents and particulars: (1) name, e-mail id, contact number; 2)
address in the country of residence; 3) tax residency certificate (TRC); and
4) tax identification number (TIN) in the country of residence - Where TIN is
not available, a unique identification number is required to be furnished
through which the taxpayer is identified in the country of residence. Do note
that it is imperative for the Seller to obtain the PAN since the PAN will
also be required for the Buyers withholding tax return, for claiming credit
of taxes withheld by the Buyer, and for filing the Sellers income tax return
in India.  
---|---

collective Beneficial Ownership of Shares of the Stockholder and its Group
Members, as a group, would not exceed the Standstill Level; _provided_ that

the Stockholder or any of its Group Members from making a non-public offer to

Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company, or other similar
extraordinary transaction involving the Company, any Subsidiary of the
Company or any of its securities or indebtedness, or enter into any
discussions, negotiations, arrangements, understandings or agreements (whether

disclose any of the foregoing actions or the possibility of a business
combination, merger or other type of transaction or matter described in this
_Section 4.1_;

(l) knowingly advise, assist, arrange or otherwise enter into any discussions

ARTICLE 5

 

REGISTRATION RIGHTS



 

Section 5.1. _Demand Registration_.

 

(a) Subject to the Stockholders satisfaction of its obligations under
_Section 5.25_ of the Purchase Agreement with respect to the financial
statements then required, from and after the end of the Lock-Up Period, the
Stockholder may request in writing (a " _Request_ ") (a) that the Company file
a prospectus supplement (the " _Takedown Prospectus Supplement_ ") to an
effective Shelf Registration Statement filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the
Securities Act with respect to the Registrable Securities identified in the
Request (a " _Takedown Request_ ") or, (b) if such Shelf Registration
Statement is not available for the resale of the Registrable Securities,
including if for any reason the Company shall be ineligible to maintain or use
a Shelf Registration Statement, that the Company register under the
Securities Act all or part of the Registrable Securities that are
Beneficially Owned by the Stockholder or its Affiliates (i) on a Registration
Statement on Form S-3 or, (ii) if the Company is not then eligible to file a
Form S-3, any other available form (a " _Demand Registration_ "), in each
case, including sales or distributions by way of underwritten offering, block
trade or other distribution plan designated by the Stockholder. The
Stockholder shall be entitled to make no more than three (3) Requests for an
underwritten offering in any twelve-month period (it being understood that
each underwritten offering (including any underwritten block trade) under this
Agreement shall count as a Request, even if such offering is a Takedown
Request conducted pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement and regardless of
whether such offering is publicly marketed before or after the underwriters
agree to purchase the Registrable Securities, unless the Stockholder
withdraws its request in the circumstances described in the second sentence
of _Section 5.6_), and each such Request shall be to register an amount of
Registrable Securities equal to the lesser of (i) an aggregate market value as
of the date of such Request of at least fifty million dollars ($50,000,000)
and (ii) the total outstanding Registrable Securities then held by the
Stockholder; provided, that any Request pursuant to this clause (ii) shall
have a minimum aggregate market value as of the date of such Request of at
least twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000). The Company shall not be
obligated to effect a Demand Registration or Takedown Request during the sixty
(60) day period following the effective date of a Registration Statement
pursuant to any other Demand Registration or the closing of any underwritten
offering pursuant to a Takedown Request. Each Request pursuant to this
_Section 5.1(a)_ shall be in writing and shall specify the number of
Registrable Securities requested to be registered and the intended method of
distribution of such Registrable Securities. Nothing in this _Article 5_ shall
affect, supersede or otherwise modify any of the restrictions on Transfer set
forth in _Article 2_ or any other provision of this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, underwritten overnight bought deals will count as a
Request.

 



13 (b) Subject to the Stockholders satisfaction of its obligations under 
_Section 5.25_ of the Purchase Agreement with respect to the financial
statements then required, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
file within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date an automatic shelf
registration statement (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) on
Form S-3 (an " _Automatic Shelf Registration Statement_ "), or if the Company
does not qualify as a well-known seasoned issuer as defined in Rule 405 under
the Securities Act (a " _WKSI_ "), a Registration Statement (which shall be
on Form S-3 if the Company is then eligible to use such form) permitting the
public resale of Registrable Securities, on a delayed or continuous basis
pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act in accordance with the
requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder (including any Automatic Shelf Registration Statement, a " _Shelf
Registration Statement_ "), or otherwise designating an existing Shelf
Registration Statement with the SEC, covering the sale or distribution of all
of the Registrable Securities from time to time by the Stockholder pursuant to
one or more Takedown Requests, including by way of underwritten offering,
block trade or other distribution plan designated by the Stockholder, and to
cause such Shelf Registration Statement to become or be deemed effective by
the end of the Lock-up Period.

 

Section 5.2. _Restrictions on Registrations_. The Company may postpone the
filing or the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or of a supplement or
amendment thereto (including any Takedown Request) or suspend the use of an
effective Registration Statement if the Board of Directors determines in good
faith that such Demand Registration or Shelf Registration, as the case may
be, would (i) reasonably be expected to materially impede, delay, interfere
with or otherwise have a material adverse effect on any material acquisition
of assets (other than in the ordinary course of business), merger,
consolidation, tender offer, financing or any other material business
transaction by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) require
disclosure of information that has not been, and is otherwise not required to
be, disclosed to the public, the premature disclosure of which the Company,
after consultation with outside counsel to the Company, believes would
materially and adversely affect the Company (any such period to be referred to
as a " _Blackout Period_ "). The Company shall not exercise its postponement
rights in this _Section 5.2_ more than twice during any period of twelve (12)
consecutive months and such Blackout Period shall not be more than seventy-
five (75) days and all Blackout Periods (irrespective of individual duration)
shall not total more than ninety (90) days during any such period of twelve
(12) consecutive months; provided that a Blackout Period may not commence less
than 30 days following the end of the most recently completed Blackout
Period. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Company shall not be permitted to file a registration statement to register
for sale, or to conduct any registered securities offerings (including any
"take-downs" off of an effective shelf registration statement) of, any of its
securities either for its own account or the account of any security holder or
holders during any Blackout Period.

 

Section 5.3. _Maintenance of Shelf Registration Statements_. The Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts and take all actions required or reasonably
requested by the Stockholder to maintain the effectiveness of its Shelf
Registration Statement until the earlier of such time as (i) all Registrable
Securities covered by such Shelf Registration Statement have 

 



14  been sold pursuant thereto and (ii) such Registrable Securities cease to be
Registrable Securities, in accordance with the requirements of the Securities
Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder and subject to the
Blackout Periods set forth in _Section 5.2_ including, if necessary, by
renewing or refiling a Shelf Registration Statement prior to expiration of the
existing Shelf Registration Statement or by filing with the SEC a post-
effective amendment or a supplement to the Shelf Registration Statement or any
document incorporated therein by reference or by filing any other required
document or otherwise supplementing or amending the Shelf
Registration Statement, if required by the rules, regulations or instructions
applicable to the registration form used by the Company for such Shelf
Registration Statement or by the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any state
securities or blue sky Laws, or any rules and regulations thereunder. The
Company shall pay the registration fee with respect to the filing of a Shelf
Registration Statement or, in the case of an Automatic Shelf Registration
Statement, a "take-down" from such Automatic Shelf Registration Statement
within the time period required by applicable Law. If, at any time following
the filing of an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement when the Company is
required to re-evaluate its WKSI status, the Company determines that it is
not a WKSI, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to post-
effectively amend the Automatic Shelf Registration Statement to a Registration
Statement or Shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 or file a new Shelf
Registration Statement on Form S-3, have such Shelf Registration Statement
declared effective by the SEC and keep such Shelf Registration Statement
effective during the period in which such Shelf Registration Statement is
required to be kept effective in accordance with this Article 5.

Section 5.4. _Selection of Underwriters; Underwritten Offering_. If the
Stockholder so notifies the Company in a Request, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause a Demand Registration or Takedown Request to
be in the form of an underwritten offering. In connection with any
underwritten Demand Registration or Takedown Request, the Stockholder shall
have the right to select the managing underwriter, _provided_ , that such
underwriter shall be a nationally recognized investment bank. Within two (2)
Business Days following the Stockholders Request, the Company shall have the
right to select an additional underwriter to serve as co-managing underwriter
with equal economics but listed to the right of the managing underwriter
selected by the Stockholder, _provided_ , that such underwriter shall be
a nationally recognized investment bank reasonably acceptable to the
Stockholder and provided further that the Company shall not have the right to
select an additional underwriter for overnight block trades where such
selection would, in the reasonable judgement of the Stockholder, have a
materially adverse effect on the success of the offering. The Stockholder may
not participate in any registration under this Agreement which is underwritten
unless the Stockholder agrees to sell the Registrable Securities held by the
Stockholder on the basis provided in any underwriting agreement with the
underwriters and completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of
attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other customary documents
reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.

Section 5.5. _Piggyback Registrations_.

 

(a) If the Company determines to publicly sell in an underwritten offering
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, a "take-down" pursuant to a
prospectus supplement to an effective shelf registration statement) or
register for sale any of its securities either for its own account or the
account of a security holder or holders, other than a registration pursuant
to 

 



15   _Section 5.1_, a registration relating solely to any employee or director
equity or equity-based incentive or compensation plan or arrangement or any
similar employee or director compensation or benefit plan on Form S-8, a
registration relating to the offer and sale of securities of any class other
than the Registrable Securities even if such securities are convertible or
exchangeable into securities of the same class as Registrable Securities, or
a registration relating solely to a corporate reorganization (including by way
of merger of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with any other business)
or acquisition of another business, any registration relating solely to an
exchange of the Companys own securities or a registration on any registration
form that does not permit secondary sales (a " _Piggyback Registration_ "),
the Company shall (i) as soon as reasonably practicable but in no event less
than five (5) Business Days prior to the initial filing of a registration
statement or preliminary prospectus supplement, as the case may be, in
connection with such Piggyback Registration (or less than two (2) days prior
to the date of the commencement of any such offering if such Piggyback
Registration is conducted as an underwritten unmarketed block trade) give
written notice of its intention to effect such sale or registration to the
Stockholder and (ii) subject to _Section 5.5(b)_ and _Section 5.5(c)_,
include in such Piggyback Registration and in any underwriting involved
therein (whether prior to or following the expiration of the Lock-Up Period)
all of such Registrable Securities as are specified in a written request or
requests (" _Piggyback Requests_ ") made by the Stockholder received by the
Company within three (3) days of receipt of such notice from the Company (or
two (2) days with respect to an underwritten umarketed block trade). Such
Piggyback Requests shall specify the number of Registrable Securities
requested to be disposed of by the Stockholder.

 

(b) If a Piggyback Registration is an underwritten primary offering on behalf
of the Company, and the managing underwriters advise the Company in writing
that in their good faith opinion the aggregate number of securities requested
to be included in such registration exceeds the number which can be sold in an
orderly manner in such offering without adversely affecting the success of
such offering (including an adverse effect on the offering price), the
Company shall include in such registration only such securities as the Company
is advised by such managing underwriters can be sold without such an effect,
which securities shall be included in the following order of priority:

(i) first, the securities the Company proposes to sell,

 

(ii) second, the securities requested to be included in such registration by
the Stockholder, and

 

(iii) third, any other securities requested to be included in such
registration.

 

(c) If a Piggyback Registration is an underwritten secondary offering on
behalf of any holder of Other Registrable Securities, and the managing
underwriters advise the Company in writing that in their good faith opinion
the number of securities requested to be included in such registration exceeds
the number which can be sold in an orderly manner in such offering without
adversely affecting the success of such offering (including an adverse effect
on the offering price), the Company shall include in such registration only
such securities as the Company is advised by such managing underwriters can be
sold without such an effect, which

 



16  securities shall be included in the following order of priority: (i) first,
the securities requested to be included in such registration by the
Stockholder and the Other Registrable Securities requested to be included in
such registration on a pro rata basis and (ii) second, any other securities
requested to be included in such registration.

 

(d) The Company and any holder of Other Registrable Securities initiating any
Piggyback Registration shall have the right to, in its sole discretion,
defer, terminate or withdraw any registration initiated by it under this
_Section 5.5_ whether or not the Stockholder has elected to include any
Registrable Securities in such registration.

 

Section 5.6. _Withdrawals_. The Stockholder may withdraw all or any part of
the Registrable Securities from a Registration Statement at any time prior to
the effective date of such Registration Statement. If such withdrawal is made
primarily as a result of the failure of the Company to comply with any
provision of this Agreement, the Company shall be responsible for the
payment of all Registration Expenses in connection with such registration and
such registration shall not count as a Demand Registration for purposes of
_Section 5.1._ In the case of any other withdrawal, the Stockholder shall pay
for the Registration Expenses associated with the withdrawn registration
unless the Stockholder counts such withdrawn registration as one of its three
(3) Requests referred to in _Section 5.1(a)_.

 

Section 5.7. _Registration Procedures_. Whenever the Stockholder has made a
Request in accordance with _Section 5.1_ that any Registrable Securities be
registered pursuant to this Agreement, the Company shall as expeditiously as
reasonably practicable:

(a) (i) no later than fifteen (15) days, in connection with a Demand
Registration, or five (5) Business Days, in connection with a Takedown Request
(or two (2) Business Days if the offering requested in the Takedown Request is
to be conducted as an underwritten unmarketed block trade), after the receipt
by the Company of the applicable Request but subject to the Blackout Periods
set forth in _Section 5.2_, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC a
Required Registration Statement or Takedown Prospectus Supplement, as the
case may be, providing for the registration under the Securities Act or the
offering of the Registrable Securities which the Stockholder has specified in
the applicable Request and in accordance with the intended methods of
distribution thereof specified in such Request. The Company shall use
reasonable best efforts (A) to have such Required Registration Statement, in
connection with a Demand Registration, declared effective by the SEC as soon
as practicable thereafter and subject to the Blackout Periods set forth in
_Section 5.2_, to keep such Required Registration Statement continuously
effective for a period of at least ninety (90) days (or, in the case of an
underwritten offering, such period as the underwriters may reasonably require)
following the date on which such Required Registration Statement is declared
effective (or such shorter period which shall terminate when all of
the Registrable Securities covered by such Required Registration Statement
have been sold pursuant thereto), including, if necessary, by filing with the
SEC a post-effective amendment or a supplement to the Required Registration
Statement or Required Shelf Registration Statement or the related prospectus
or any document incorporated therein by reference or by filing any other
required document or otherwise supplementing or amending the Required
Registration Statement or Required Shelf Registration Statement, if required
by the rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form
used by the Company for such Required Registration Statement or Required Shelf
Registration 

 



17  Statement or by the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any state securities
or blue sky Laws, or any rules and regulations thereunder, and (B) to keep the
Shelf Registration Statement related to the Takedown Prospectus Supplement in
connection with a Takedown Request continuously effective pursuant to _Section
5.3_, and (ii) before filing such Required Registration Statement or Takedown
Prospectus Supplement, as the case may be, or any amendments or supplements
thereto, or before using any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus related to the
offer and sale of Registrable Securities, provide to the Stockholder and any
managing underwriter(s) and their respective counsel, copies of all documents
proposed to be filed or furnished or used, including documents incorporated by
reference (but excluding the portions of such documents that are or will be
subject to a request for confidential treatment), and the Stockholder and the
managing underwriter(s) and their respective counsel shall have the reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon, and the Company will make such
changes and additions thereto as may reasonably be requested by the
Stockholder and the managing underwriter(s) and their respective counsel
prior to such filing or use, unless the Company reasonably objects to such
changes or additions; provided, however, that the Company shall not file any
amendment or supplement or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to which the
Stockholder or the underwriters or their respective counsel, shall reasonably
object;

(b) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to such
Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith and the
Takedown Prospectus Supplement, if applicable, and any Issuer Free Writing
Prospectus related to the offer and sale of Registrable Securities (subject
to the review and comment provisions set forth in _Section 5.7(a)_ and
_Section 5.2_ above) and perform such other actions (including those
described in Section 5.3 with respect to an Automatic Registration Statement)
as may be necessary to maintain the effectiveness of such Registration
Statement and to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect
to the disposition of all securities covered by such Registration Statement
and such Takedown Prospectus Supplement for the applicable periods set forth
herein;

(c) furnish to the Stockholder and each managing underwriter or other
purchaser and their respective counsel such number of copies of such
Registration Statement, each amendment and supplement thereto, the prospectus
included in such Registration Statement (including each
preliminary prospectus) and the Takedown Prospectus Supplement, if
applicable, (in each case including all exhibits other than those which are
being incorporated into such Registration Statement by reference and that are
publicly available), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus related to the offer
and sale of Registrable Securities and such other documents as the Stockholder
may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the
Registrable Securities owned by the Stockholder;

 

(d) use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify such Registrable
Securities under such other securities or blue sky Laws of such jurisdictions
in the United States as the Stockholder or any managing underwriter or other
purchaser may reasonably requests, and to continue such registration or
qualification in effect in such jurisdiction and to maintain any such approval
for as long as permissible pursuant to the laws of such jurisdiction and the
regulations of the Governmental Authority, or for as long as any such seller
requests or until all of such Registrable Securities are sold, whichever is
shortest, and do any and all other acts and things which may be reasonably
necessary or advisable to enable the Stockholder to consummate the disposition
in such jurisdictions of the Registrable Securities owned by the
Stockholder; 

 



18   _provided_ that the Company shall not be required to (i) qualify generally
to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to
qualify, (ii) consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction
or (iii) subject itself to taxation in any jurisdiction where it is not so
subject;

 

(e) in the event of any offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to a
Registration Statement, (i) enter into an underwriting agreement or similar
agreement, in usual and customary form, with the managing underwriter(s) or

expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities, (ii)
cause its senior officers to participate in "road shows" and investor
presentations and other information meetings organized by the managing

marketing activities (provided however, in no circumstance shall the Company
be required to participate in road shows or other information meetings in
connection with more than three (3) such offerings in any twelve (12)-month
period) and (iii) cause to be delivered to the Stockholder and the
underwriter(s) or other purchaser(s) opinions of counsel to the Company
addressed to the underwriter(s) or other purchaser(s), in customary form,
covering such matters as are customarily covered by opinions for an
underwritten public offering as the underwriter(s) or other purchaser(s) may
request;

(f) notify the Stockholder and each managing underwriter or other purchaser
and their respective counsel, at any time when a prospectus relating thereto
(including a Takedown Prospectus Supplement) is required to be delivered under
the Securities Act, of the happening of any event as a result of which
the prospectus included in such Registration Statement, as then in effect,
the Takedown Prospectus Supplement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus related
to the offer and sale of Registrable Securities, or any document incorporated
therein by reference contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits
any fact necessary to make the statements therein, not misleading, and in such
case, subject to _Section 5.2_, the Company shall promptly prepare a
supplement or amendment to such prospectus, Takedown Prospectus Supplement,
Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or document so that, as thereafter delivered to
the holders of such Registrable Securities, such prospectus, Takedown
Prospectus Supplement, Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or document shall not
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any fact
necessary to make the statements therein, not misleading;

 

(g) use its reasonable best efforts to cause all such Registrable Securities
which are registered to be listed on each securities exchange on which
similar securities issued by the Company are then listed;

(h) provide and cause to be maintained a transfer agent and registrar for all
Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement not later than

in book-entry form only, facilitate the timely preparation of certificates
representing the Registrable Securities to be sold and not bearing any
restrictive legends, in such denominations and registered in such names as the
selling holders shall request prior to the closing of the offering;

 



19 (i) enter into such customary agreements and use reasonable best efforts to
take all such other actions as the Stockholder and the underwriter(s) or
other purchaser(s), if any, reasonably request in order to expedite or
facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities;

 

(j) make available for inspection by the Stockholder and any underwriter or
other purchaser participating in any disposition pursuant to a Registration
Statement and any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by the
Stockholder (including the attorney appointed by the Company) or any
underwriter or other purchaser, financial and other records, pertinent
corporate documents and properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
shall be reasonably necessary to enable them to exercise their due diligence
responsibility, and cause the Companys officers, directors, employees and
independent accountants to supply all other information reasonably requested
by the Stockholder or any such underwriter or other purchaser, attorney,
accountant or agent in connection with such Registration Statement;

 

(k) if such offering of Registrable Securities is made pursuant to a
Registration Statement, use reasonable best efforts to obtain "comfort"
letters dated the pricing date and the closing date of the offering of the
Registrable Securities under the underwriting or other agreement from the
Companys independent public accountants in customary form and covering such

counsel representing the Company for the purposes of such
registration, addressed to the underwriter(s) or other purchaser(s) covering

are customarily included in such opinions and letters;

to such Registration Statement; respond reasonably and completely to any and
all comments received from the SEC or the staff of the SEC, with a view
towards causing such Registration Statement or any amendment thereto to be

threat of any proceeding for such purpose;

 

(r) to the extent requested in writing by the lead managing underwriter(s) or
other purchaser(s) with respect to an underwritten offering of Equity
Securities, agree, and cause the directors or officers of the Company to
agree, to enter into customary agreements restricting the sale or distribution
of Equity Securities during the period commencing on the date of the request
(which shall be no earlier than fourteen (14) days prior to the expected
"pricing" of such offering) and continuing for not more than ninety (90) days
after the date of the "final" prospectus (or "final" prospectus supplement if
the offering is made pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement), pursuant to
which such offering shall be made, plus an extension period, as may be
proposed by the lead managing underwriter(s) or other purchaser(s) to address
FINRA regulations regarding the publishing of research, or such lesser period
as is required by the lead managing underwriter(s) or other purchaser(s); and

 



21 (s) use reasonable best efforts to take all other steps reasonably necessary
to effect the registration of the Registrable Securities contemplated hereby.

In connection with any Registration Statement in which the Stockholder
is participating, the Stockholder shall furnish to the Company in writing
such information regarding the Stockholder as the Company may from time to
time reasonably request specifically for use in connection with any such
Registration Statement or prospectus.

Upon notice by the Company to the Stockholder of any Blackout Period, the
Stockholder shall keep the fact of any such notice strictly confidential, and
during any Blackout Period, discontinue its offer and disposition of
Registrable Securities pursuant to the applicable Registration Statement and
the prospectus relating thereto and any Takedown Prospectus Supplement
for the duration of the Blackout Period set forth in such notice (or until
notice of the termination of such Blackout Period shall have been given to the
Stockholder in writing by the Company). The Stockholder agrees that upon
receipt of any notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the
kind described in clauses (f), (q)(ii), (q)(iii), (q)(iv) or (q)(v) above, it
shall forthwith discontinue its offer and disposition of Registrable
Securities pursuant to the applicable Registration Statement and the
prospectus relating thereto and any Takedown Prospectus Supplement until its
receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated
by clause (q)(ii), or until it is advised in writing by the Company that
the use of the applicable prospectus and any Takedown Prospectus Supplement
may be resumed, and has received copies of any additional or supplemental
filings that are incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in
such prospectus or Takedown Prospectus Supplement; _provided_ that the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to supplement or amend the
applicable Registration Statement and prospectus and any Takedown Prospectus
Supplement as promptly as practicable and shall extend the time periods under
clause (a) above with respect to the length of time that effectiveness of a
Registration Statement must be maintained by the amount of time that the
Stockholder is required to discontinue disposition of such Registrable
Securities.

Section 5.8. _Registration Expenses_. Subject to _Section 6.1_, all expenses
incident to the Companys performance of, or compliance with, its obligations
under this Agreement including (a) all registration and filing fees, all fees
and expenses of compliance with securities and blue sky laws (including the
reasonable and documented fees and disbursements of counsel for the
underwriters in connection with blue sky qualifications of the Registrable
Securities pursuant to _Section 5.7_), (b) all printing and copying expenses
(including expenses of printing certificates for the Registrable Securities
in a form eligible for deposit with the Depository Trust Company and of
printing prospectuses as requested by any holder of Registrable Securities),
(c) all messenger and delivery expenses, (d) all fees and expenses of the
Companys independent certified public accountants and counsel (including,
with respect to "comfort" letters and opinions) and (e) all reasonable fees
and disbursements of one single primary outside counsel and one outside local
counsel for each jurisdiction that Registrable Securities shall be distributed
for the holders thereof, which counsels shall be selected by the Company and
reasonably acceptable to the Stockholder, and in the case of the primary
outside counsel shall be of national standing (collectively, the "
_Registration Expenses_ ") shall be borne by the Company. The Registration
Expenses shall be borne by the Company regardless of whether or not
any registration statement is filed or becomes effective. The Company will
pay its internal expenses (including all salaries and expenses of its officers
and employees performing legal or accounting duties, the expense of 

 



22  any annual audit and the expense of any liability insurance), the expenses
and fees for listing the securities to be registered on each securities
exchange and included in each established over-the-counter market on which
similar securities issued by the Company are then listed or traded and any
expenses of the Company incurred in connection with any "road show". The
Stockholder shall pay its pro rata portion (based on the number of
Registrable Securities registered) of all underwriting discounts and
commissions relating to the sale of the Stockholders Registrable Securities
pursuant to any registration.

 

Section 5.9. _Requested Information_. Not less than five (5) Business Days
before the expected filing date of each Registration Statement or Takedown
Prospectus Supplement pursuant to this Agreement (or as soon as reasonably
practical in connection with a Takedown Prospectus Supplement to be filed in
connection with an unmarketed block trade), the Company shall notify
each holder of Registrable Securities who has timely provided the requisite
notice hereunder entitling such holder to register Registrable Securities in
such Registration Statement of the information, documents and instruments from
such holder that the Company or any underwriter or other purchaser reasonably
requests in connection with such Registration Statement or Takedown Prospectus
Supplement, including a questionnaire, custody agreement, power of attorney,
lockup letter and underwriting or other agreement, each in customary form
reasonably acceptable to such holders (the " _Requested Information_ "). If
the Company has not received, on or before the second Business Day before the
expected filing date of the Registration Statement or Takedown Prospectus
Supplement, the Requested Information from such holder, the Company may file
the Registration Statement or Takedown Prospectus Supplement without including
Registrable Securities of such holder. The failure to so include in any
Registration Statement or Takedown Prospectus Supplement the Registrable
Securities of a holder of Registrable Securities (with regard to that
Registration Statement or Takedown Prospectus Supplement) shall not result in
any liability on the part of the Company to such holder.

Section 5.10. _Holdback Agreements_. The Stockholder agrees to enter into
customary agreements restricting the sale or distribution of Equity
Securities to the extent reasonably required in writing by the lead managing
underwriter(s) with respect to an applicable underwritten primary offering on
behalf of the Company relating to the registration of Equity Securities
having an aggregate value of at least fifty million dollars ($50,000,000)
during the period commencing on the date of the request (which shall be no
earlier than fourteen (14) days prior to the expected "pricing" of such
underwritten offering) and continuing for not more than sixty (60) days after
the date of the "final" prospectus (or "final" prospectus supplement if the
underwritten offering is made pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement),
pursuant to which such underwritten offering shall be made, plus an extension
period, as may be proposed by the lead managing underwriter(s), required to
address any applicable FINRA regulations regarding the publishing of
research, or such lesser period as is required by the lead managing
underwriter(s). The Stockholder shall not be required to enter into a holdback
agreement pursuant to this _Section 5.10_ (a) at any time when the aggregate
number of Shares that are Beneficially Owned by the Stockholder and its Group
Members, as a Group, is less than 5% of the shares of Common Stock issued and
outstanding, (b) unless the Company and the directors and executive
officers of the Company are subject to comparable restrictions, (c) unless
the Stockholder has had the opportunity to review and provide reasonable
comments on any such holdback agreement and (d) unless the Stockholder was
offered an opportunity to participate in

 



23  the offering pursuant to Section 5.5. The postponement rights in clause (b)
of the first sentence in _Section 5.2_ and the holdback obligation in this
_Section 5.10_ shall not be applicable to the Stockholder for more than a
total of one hundred fifty (150) days during any period of twelve (12)
consecutive months.

 

Section 5.11. _Rule 144 Reporting_. With a view to making available to the
Stockholder the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the SEC which
may permit the sale of the Registrable Securities to the public without
registration, the Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to:

 

(a) make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood
and defined in Rule 144 or any similar or analogous rule promulgated under
the Securities Act, at all times after the effective date of the first
registration filed by the Company for an offering of its securities to the
general public;

 

(b) file with the SEC, in a timely manner, all reports and other documents
required of the Company under the Exchange Act; and

 

(c) so long as the Stockholder owns any Registrable Securities, furnish to the
Stockholder promptly upon request (i) a written statement by the Company as
to its compliance with the reporting requirements of Rule 144 of the
Securities Act and of the Exchange Act, (ii) a copy of the most recent annual
or quarterly report of the Company filed with the SEC and (iii) such
other reports and documents as the Stockholder may reasonably request in
connection with availing itself of any rule or regulation of the SEC allowing
it to sell any such securities without registration, in each case to the
extent not readily publicly available.

Section 5.12. _Company Indemnification_. The Company agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Stockholder,
its Affiliates and each of its and their respective directors, officers,
partners, members, employees, advisors, representatives and agents and each
Person, if any, who controls the Stockholder (within the meaning of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act) from and against any and all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and expenses whatsoever (including reasonable,
documented expenses of investigation and reasonable, documented attorneys
fees and expenses) caused by, arising out of or relating to any untrue or
alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in any Registration
Statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto (including a Takedown Prospectus Supplement)covering the
resale of any Registrable Securities by or on behalf of the Stockholder or any
Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any omission or alleged omission of a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading or any violation of the Securities Act or
state securities laws or rules thereunder by the Company relating to any
action or inaction by the Company in connection with such registration,
except insofar as such untrue statement or omission is based on information
contained in any affidavit or statement furnished in writing by the
Stockholder for use in connection with such Registration Statement, which
shall be limited to the Stockholders name, address and number of shares of
Registrable Securities owned by the Stockholder. This indemnity shall be in
addition to any liability the Company may otherwise have. Such indemnity shall
remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on
behalf of the Stockholder or any indemnified party and shall survive the
transfer of such securities by the Stockholder.

 



24 Section 5.13. _Stockholder Indemnification_. The Stockholder and any
Permitted Transferees jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold
harmless, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company, its
Affiliates, its and their respective directors, officers, partners, members
and agents and each Person, if any, who controls the Company (within the
meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act) from and against any and
all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable,
documented expenses of investigation and reasonable, documented attorneys
fees and expenses) caused by, arising out of or relating to any untrue or
alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in the Registration
Statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto (including Takedown Prospectus Supplement) covering the
resale of any Registrable Securities by or on behalf of the Stockholder or any
omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only to the
extent that such untrue statement or omission is contained in any information
or affidavit furnished in writing by the Stockholder for use in connection
with such Registration Statement, which shall be limited to the Stockholders
name, address and number of shares of Registrable Securities owned by the
Stockholder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Stockholder shall not be
liable for any amounts in excess of the net proceeds received by the
Stockholder from sales of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration
Statement to which the claims relate. This indemnity shall be in addition to
any liability the Stockholder may otherwise have. Such indemnity shall remain
in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf
of the Company or any indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of such
securities by the Company.

 

Section 5.14. _Resolution of Claims_. Any Person entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this _Article 5_ shall give prompt written notice to the
indemnifying Party of any claim with respect to which it seeks
indemnification; _provided_ that the failure so to notify the indemnifying
Party shall not relieve the indemnifying Party of any liability that it may
have to the indemnified party hereunder except to the extent that the
indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced or otherwise forfeits substantive
rights or defenses by reason of such failure. If notice of commencement of any
such action is given to the indemnifying Party as above provided, the
indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it
may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying Party similarly notified, to
assume the defense of such action at its own expense, with counsel chosen by
it and reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party. The indemnified
party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and
participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
shall be paid by the indemnified party unless (a) the indemnifying Party
agrees to pay the same, (b) the indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense
of such action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified
party within a reasonable amount of time after receipt of notice of such
claim from the Indemnified Parry or (c) the named parties to any such action
(including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying Party and the
indemnified party and such parties have been advised by such counsel that
either (i) representation of such indemnified party and the indemnifying Party
by the same counsel would be inappropriate under applicable standards of
professional conduct or (ii) it is reasonably foreseeable that there will be
one or more material legal defenses available to the indemnified party which
are different from or additional to those

 



25  available to the indemnifying Party. In any of such cases, the indemnified
party shall have the right to participate in the defense of such action with
its own counsel, the reasonable, documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses
of which shall be paid by the indemnifying Party, it being understood,
however, that the indemnifying Party shall not be liable for the fees and
expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to
any local counsel) for all indemnified parties. No indemnifying Party shall
be liable for any settlement entered into without its written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). No
indemnifying Party shall, without the consent of such indemnified party (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), effect any
settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which such
indemnified party is a party and indemnity has been sought hereunder by such
indemnified party, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional
release of such indemnified party from all liability for claims that are the
subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include an omission of
fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.

Section 5.15.  _Contribution_. If the indemnification provided for in
_Section 5.12_ or _Section 5.13_ is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any
losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to herein, the indemnifying
Party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall to the
extent permitted by applicable Law contribute to the amount paid or payable by
such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability
in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the
indemnifying Party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other
in connection with such loss, claim, damage or liability, as well as any
other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the
indemnifying Party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by a court
of Law by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact
relates to information supplied by the indemnifying Party or by the
indemnified party and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of any loss, claim, damage
or liability referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the
limitations set forth in this _Section 5.15_, any legal or other fees,
charges or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any
investigation or proceeding. The Parties agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contribution pursuant to this _Section 5.15_ were determined by
pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to in this _Section 5.15_.
No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution
from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

 

Section 5.16. _Company Facilitation of Sale_. If any Registrable Securities
are certificated and bear any restrictive legend, or are held in non-
certificated book-entry form and are subject to any stop transfer or similar
instruction or restriction, the Company shall upon the request of the holder
of such Registrable Securities, as applicable, promptly cause such legends to
be removed and new certificates without any restrictive legends to be issued
or cause such stop transfer or similar instructions or restrictions to be
promptly terminated and removed, including by delivering customary
representation letters and instruction letters to the transfer agent
reasonably acceptable to the transfer agent, if (a) such Registrable
Securities have been resold pursuant to an effective Registration Statement or
(b) the holder of such Registrable 

 



26  Securities provides the transfer agent with reasonable assurance that such
Registrable Securities can be sold, assigned or transferred pursuant to Rule
144 or otherwise without registration and without any restriction whatsoever
under the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, including an opinion
of outside legal counsel (the reasonable costs and expenses of which shall be
reimbursed by the Company), reasonably acceptable to the transfer agent, to
such effect.

Section 5.17. _Transfers_. To the extent that any Registrable Securities are
Transferred, the obligations of the Company shall not be expanded in any
respect and, the registration rights provided for in this _Article 5_ , to the
extent assigned, shall be shared by all holders of Registrable Securities and
all such persons shall be jointly and severally liable for any obligations.

Section 5.18. _WKSI Status_. The Company is not an ineligible issuer and is
a WKSI, in each case as defined under the Securities Act, and is currently
eligible to file and use an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement.

Equity Securities, and in such case only to the extent so required by Law, or

_Section 5.13_, _5.14_ , _5.15_ and  _5.16_ , this Agreement is intended for
the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

 

Section 6.10. _Severability_. In the event that any one or more of the terms
or provisions of this Agreement or the application thereof to any Person or
circumstance is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of
this Agreement, or the application of such term or provision to Persons or
circumstances or in jurisdictions other than those as to which it has been
determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, and the Parties shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to substitute one or more valid, legal
and enforceable terms or provisions into this Agreement which, insofar as
practicable, implement the purposes and intent of the Parties. Any term or
provision of this Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part,
degree or within certain jurisdictions shall remain in full force and effect
to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable to the extent consistent with
the intent of the Parties as reflected by this Agreement. To the extent
permitted by applicable Law, each Party waives any term or provision of Law
which renders any term or provision of this Agreement to be invalid, illegal
or unenforceable in any respect.

 

Section 6.11. _Business Days_. If the last or appointed day for the taking of
any action or the expiration of any right required or granted in this
Agreement is not a Business Day (including where such period of time is
measured in calendar days), then such action may be taken or such right may be
exercised on the next succeeding Business Day.

 



30 Section 6.12. _Governing Law and Venue: Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SUBSTANTIVE
AND PROCEDURAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS RULES OF
CONFLICTS OF LAW. The Parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction
of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, to the extent
the court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction, the federal
courts of the United States of America for the District of Delaware with
respect to all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the
interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement, and of
the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and waive, and agree not to
assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation
or enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it is not subject thereto
or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not
maintainable in such courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate
or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such
courts, and the Parties agree that all claims with respect to such action or
proceeding shall be heard and determined exclusively in such Court of Chancery
or federal court. The Parties agree that a final judgment in any such any
action, suit or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.
The Parties consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the person
of such Parties solely for such purpose and over the subject matter of such
dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with
any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in _Section 6.3_ or in
such other manner as may be permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient
service.

(b) EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER. EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER. EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS IN THIS _SECTION 6.12(b)_.

 

Section 6.13. _Enforcement_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement was not performed in accordance with its specific terms or was
otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof in any court referred to in

 



31   _Section 6.12_, without proof of actual damages (and each Party hereby
waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection
with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at Law or in equity. The Parties further agree not to assert that
a Exhibit remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary
to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary
damages would provide an adequate remedy for such breach.

Section 6.14. _No Other Registration Rights_. The Company shall not enter
into any Contract or other agreement or obligation with respect to its Equity
Securities that adversely affects the priorities of the Stockholder or is
otherwise inconsistent or in contravention of the Stockholders rights
hereunder, including its registration rights under Article 5 and the "cut-
back" priorities in _Section 5.5_.

32 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company and the Stockholder have caused this Agreement
to be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized, all as

Business in the ordinary course prior to the Effective Date to the extent
provided prior to the Effective Date, as set forth on _Schedule 2.1(a)_ (the "
_Seller Services_ ").

 

(b) In the event that Buyer internally restructures, reorganizes or transfers
the Business to an Affiliate or a third party, Seller shall continue to
provide the Seller Services to such Affiliate or third party to the extent
provided prior to such restructuring, reorganization or transfer, but only
insofar as such Affiliate or such third party continues to conduct the
Business.

 

Section 2.2 _Services to be_ _Provided_ _to Seller_.

 

(a) Buyer shall provide, or shall cause its Affiliates or third party service
providers to provide, to the Seller Parties all services provided by the
Transferred FH Companies to the Retained Business of Seller and its Affiliates
in the ordinary course prior to the Effective Date to the extent provided
prior to the Effective Date, as set forth on _Schedule 2.2(a)_ (the " _Buyer
Services_ " and, together with the Seller Services and the Additional
Services, the " _Services_ ").

 

(b) In the event that Seller internally restructures, reorganizes or transfers
the Retained Business to which the Buyer Services relate to an Affiliate or a
third party, Buyer shall continue to provide the Buyer Services to such
Affiliate or third party to the extent provided prior to such restructuring,
reorganization or transfer, but only insofar as such Affiliate or such third
party continues to conduct the Retained Business to which the Buyer Services
relate.

Section 2.3 _Omitted Services_. If, at any time following the Effective Date,
either Party becomes aware of any service that (a) had been provided prior to
the Effective Date that is not included on _Schedule 2.1(a)_ or _Schedule
2.2(a)_ , as applicable, or (b) which, due to the separation of the FH
Business from the business of the Seller, is reasonably necessary to continue
to conduct the FH Business in substantially the manner as the FH Business was
conducted prior to the date of the Purchase Agreement, and in each case of
(a) and (b), which the Parties had not specifically agreed to omit from such
schedule (each such service, an " _Omitted_

 



3   _Service_ "), then upon notice to the other Party, such service will be
added to the applicable schedule and become a Seller Service or Buyer Service,
as applicable. The Party that must resume such Service shall resume provision
of such Service as soon as reasonably practicable. The Fees for any Omitted
Service shall be mutually agreed in writing and shall be consistent with the
Fees for similar Services hereunder.

 

Section 2.4 _Additional Services_.

 

(a) If either Party desires to receive an additional service which is not a
Service pursuant to Sections 2.1 through 2.3 (or to expand the scope or
lengthen the duration of any Service), the Service Coordinators shall meet (in
person or by telephone) within ten (10) days of the other Partys receipt of a
written notice by the Party desiring to add such additional service
to discuss in good faith whether such other Party is willing to provide such
additional service (or such expanded scope or lengthened duration of a
Service) (each such service, to the extent provided, an " _Additional Service_
").

 

(b) The Parties shall mutually agree on the scope, terms, Fees and duration of
all Additional Services, all of which shall be set forth on  _Schedule 2.4_.

Section 2.5 _Service Coordinators_. Seller and Buyer shall each nominate a
representative to act as the primary contact person with respect to the
performance of the Services (each, a " _Service Coordinator_ "). Unless
otherwise agreed upon by the Parties, all communications relating to this
Agreement and to the Services provided hereunder shall be directed to the
Service Coordinators. The initial Service Coordinators for Buyer and Seller,
including relevant contact information, are set forth on _Schedule 2.5_.
Either Party may replace its Service Coordinator at any time by providing
notice in accordance with Section 11.3 of this Agreement.

Section 2.6 _Standard of Performance_. Each Party shall (and shall cause any
party performing services on its behalf to) use commercially reasonable
efforts, skill and judgment in providing the Services. Without limiting the
foregoing, all Services shall be provided in a timely and workmanlike manner,
at level of quality, performance and timeliness consistent with past practice
in the twelve (12) months prior to the Effective Date.

 

Section 2.7 _Cooperation_.

 

(a) Each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts, and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its respective Affiliates and third
party service providers, to cooperate with the other Party in all matters
relating to the provision and receipt of the Services and to minimize the
expense, distraction and disturbance to each Party, and shall perform all
obligations hereunder in good faith and in accordance with principles of fair
dealing. Such cooperation shall include (i) the execution and delivery of such
further instruments or documents as may be reasonably requested by the other
Party to enable the full performance of each Partys obligations hereunder
and (ii) notifying the other Party in advance of any changes to a Partys
operating environment or personnel (especially changes with respect to
employee status), and working with the other Party to minimize the effect of
such changes.

 



4 (b) Each Party will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide information
and documentation sufficient for the other Party to perform the Seller
Services or the Buyer Services, as applicable, in the manner they were
provided in the ordinary course prior to the Effective Date, and will use
commercially reasonable efforts to make available, as reasonably requested by
the other Party, sufficient resources and timely decisions, approvals and
acceptances in order that the other Party may perform its obligations under
this Agreement in a timely and efficient manner.

 

(c) The Buyer Parties and the Seller Parties shall follow, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates and third party service providers to follow, the
policies, procedures and practices with respect to the Services followed by
the Buyer Parties or the Seller Parties, as applicable, immediately prior to
the Effective Date, except for any changes to such policies, procedures
and practices required due to changes in applicable Law (or changes in the
interpretation or enforcement of applicable Law) following the Effective Date.
A failure of either Party to act in accordance with this Section 2.7 that
prevents the other Party or its Affiliates or third parties from providing a
Service hereunder shall relieve the Party providing the Service of its
obligation to provide such Service until such time as the failure has been
cured; _provided_ , that the Party claiming the failure has previously
notified the other Party in writing of such failure, where practicable at
least five (5) Business Days prior to suspension of provision of such Service.

 

Section 2.8 _Migration and Integration_. Except as expressly set forth in
Section 2.10 or Schedule 2.1(a) or 2.2(a) hereto, or the Purchase Agreement,
the Party receiving Services hereunder shall bear all costs to migrate such
Services, from the other Partys systems and technology and to integrate such
Services, as applicable, with such Partys own systems and technology.

Section 2.9 _Certain Changes_. Either Party, when acting as a service
provider, may change (a) its policies and procedures, (b) any Affiliates that
provide any Services or (c) the location from which any Service is provided at
any time; _provided_ that such Party shall always remain responsible for the
performance of the Services in accordance with this Agreement.

Section 2.10 _Excluded Software_ _and Delayed Transferred Software_. With
respect to any software or databases licensed under the Excluded FH Software
Licenses, and for Transferred Software for which consents are not obtained to
enable the FH Business to continue to utilize such Transferred Software as of
Closing, for a period of six (6) months after the Closing, Seller shall
provide the Buyer, Transferred FH Companies and Closing Subsidiaries with
access to and use of such software or databases licensed under the Excluded FH
Software Licenses and the Transferred Software to the same extent that the FH
Business required access to or use of such software prior to the Closing,
subject to a pro rata portion of the license and other fees payable by Seller
in connection with such licenses during such period; provided that Buyer may
provide notice of cessation of use of any item of such software on thirty (30)
days prior written notice. Seller shall indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates
from and against any third party claims which arise from the provision
of such access and use constituting a breach of contract under the applicable
Excluded FH

 



5  Software Licenses or the IP Contracts under which the Transferred Software
is provided to Seller. For the Transferred Software which is licensed from SAP
or its Affiliates ("SAP Software"), except for any such software which is an
Excluded FH Software License, if the consent to transfer such license to the
SAP Software to Buyer is not obtained within six (6) months of the Closing,
then Seller shall pay Buyers external costs of procuring a replacement from
SAP for the license to such SAP Software, up to the extent to which such SAP
Software was utilized by or for the FH Business prior to the Closing. Further,
Buyer shall not be responsible for its inability to provide the Buyer
Services to Seller hereunder to the extent such inability arises from the
failure to transfer to Buyer any Transferred Software or any of the software
or databases under the Excluded FH Software Licenses. As used herein, "
_Transferred Software_ " means software or databases licensed under any IP
Contract related to computer software or databases that are used in the
operation of the FH Business to which Seller or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or to which any of the FH Assets is subject, other than the software and
databases licensed under the Excluded FH Software Licenses.

any specific employee or acquire any specific additional equipment or
software, unless the other Party agrees to bear all associated costs;
_provided_ that such Party shall remain responsible for the performance of the
Seller Services or Buyer Services, as applicable, in accordance with this
Agreement.

Section 3.2 _Third Party Limitations_. Each Party acknowledges and agrees
that the Services provided by a Party through third parties or using third
party Intellectual Property are subject to the terms and conditions of any
applicable agreements between the provider of such Service and such third
parties. Each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (a) obtain
any necessary consent from such third parties in order to provide such
Services or (b) if any such consent is not obtained, provide acceptable
alternative arrangements to provide the relevant Services sufficient for the
other Partys purposes. Nothing in this Section 3.2 shall limit either Partys
obligations under the Purchase Agreement. Except as expressly set forth in
Section 2.10 or Schedule 2.1(a) or 2.2(a) or the Purchase Agreement, all
costs associated with (a) and (b), above, shall be borne by the recipient of
the applicable Service for which the applicable consents are required.

 



6 Section 3.3 _Compliance with Laws_. Neither Party shall provide, or cause to
be provided, any Service to the extent that the provision of such Service
would require such Party, any of its Affiliates or any of their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives to violate (a) any
applicable Law, (b) any policies and/or procedures of such Party which (i)
were in effect immediately prior to the Effective Date or (ii) which come into
effect after the Effective Date but are implemented or revised to reflect a
change in applicable Law.

Section 3.4 _Excluded Services_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth herein, in no event shall the Seller Services include any of the
services set forth on _Schedule 3.4(a)_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth herein, in no event shall the Buyer Services include any of
the services set forth on _Schedule 3.4(b)_.

 

Section 3.5 _Force Majeure_.

 

(a) The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, or cause
to be provided, the Services without interruption. If any Party providing, or
causing to be provided, Services is wholly or partially prevented from, or
delayed in, providing one or more Services, or one or more Services are
interrupted or suspended, by reason of events beyond its reasonable control
(including acts of God, fire, explosion, accident, floods, earthquakes,
embargoes, epidemics, war, acts of terrorism, or nuclear disaster) (each, a "
_Force Majeure Event_ "), such Party shall not be obligated to deliver the
affected Services during such period, and the Party that would have received
such Services shall not be obligated to pay for any Services not delivered.

 

(b) Upon the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, the affected Party shall
promptly give written notice to the other Party of the Force Majeure Event
upon which it intends to rely to excuse its performance, and of the expected
duration of such Force Majeure Event. The duties and obligations of such Party
hereunder shall be tolled for the duration of the Force Majeure Event, but
only to the extent that the Force Majeure Event prevents such Party from
performing its duties and obligations hereunder.

(c) During the duration of a Force Majeure Event, the affected Party shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or remove such Force Majeure
Event, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resume its performance
under this Agreement with the least practicable delay. From and during the
occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, the other Party may replace the affected
Services by providing such Services for itself or engaging a third party to
provide such Services.

 

(d) During a Force Majeure Event and ending upon the recommencement of the
applicable Services by the affected Party upon termination of such Force
Majeure Event, the affected Party shall pay or reimburse, as applicable, the
difference, if any, between (i) all of the other Partys reasonable costs
associated with any replacement Services and (ii) the amount the other
Party would have paid to such Party under the terms of this Agreement for the
provision of such Services had such Party continued to perform such Services.

 



7 Section 3.6 _Disaster Recovery Services_. No Party shall be required to
provide disaster recovery Services to the extent that the Party that would
receive such Services has materially altered the equipment, hardware or
software to which such disaster recovery Services pertain.

 

Section 3.7 _Interim Basis Only_. Each Party acknowledges that the purpose of
this Agreement is to provide Services to the other Party on an interim basis,
until such Party can perform the Services for itself. Accordingly, at all
times from and after the Effective Date, each of Seller and Buyer shall use
its respective commercially reasonable efforts to make or obtain
any approvals, permits or licenses, implement any computer systems and take,
or cause to be taken, any and all other actions necessary or advisable for it
to provide the Services for itself as soon as reasonably practicable.

 

ARTICLE IV

_PAYMENT _

Section 4.1 _Base Term Fees_.

 

(a) In consideration for the Seller Services, Buyer shall pay to Seller the
fees for each service as set forth on _Schedule 2.1(a)_  (" _Seller Fees_ ").

(b) In consideration for the Buyer Services, Seller shall pay to Buyer the
fees for each service as set forth on _Schedule 2.2(a)_ (" _Buyer Fees_ ",
together with the Seller Fees, the " _Fees_ ").

 

Section 4.2 _Billing and Payment Terms_.

 

(a) Each Party shall invoice the other Party monthly for all charges for
Services provided by the invoicing Party pursuant to this Agreement. Such
invoices shall contain reasonable detail of the Service provided and the
charge therefor. The Party receiving such invoice shall pay the invoicing
Party for all undisputed amounts due for Services provided hereunder within
sixty (60) days from receipt of an invoice therefor.

(b) A Party may dispute any or all charges after the receipt of the applicable
invoice. If a Party disputes any charges, the Parties shall work together in
good faith to resolve such dispute in accordance with Section 11.15. If the
resolution of such a dispute is that a Party owes an amount of money to the
other Party, the Party that owes money shall add a credit of such owed amount
to the next invoice that such Party prepares as a Service provider, _provided_
, that if no further such invoices are due, the Party owing such amount shall
pay it to the other Party within sixty (60) days following resolution of the
dispute. A failure by a Party to dispute a charge within ninety (90) days
after receipt of invoice shall not waive such Partys audit and collection
rights under Section 11.15.

 

(c) The Parties acknowledge that there may be a lag in the submission of
charges from third parties relating to the provision of Services, and that
the Party providing Services through such third parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain such third party invoices, and to provide same to
the other Party, in a timely fashion.

 



8 (d) The existence of a dispute pursuant to Section 4.2(b) above shall not
excuse either Party from any other obligation under this Agreement, including
each Partys obligations to continue to provide Services hereunder.

 

Section 4.3 _Sales Taxes_. All consideration under this Agreement is exclusive
of any sales, transfer, value-added, goods or services tax or similar gross
receipts based tax (including any such taxes that are required to be withheld,
but excluding all other taxes including taxes based upon or calculated by
reference to income, receipts or capital) imposed against or on services
provided (" _Sales Taxes_ ") by a Party providing Services hereunder, or
against or on such Party as a result of such Services, and such Sales Taxes
will be added to the consideration where applicable. Such Sales Taxes shall
be separately stated on the relevant invoice to the Party receiving Services
hereunder. All taxable goods and services for which a Party receiving Services
hereunder is compensating, or reimbursing, a Party providing Services
hereunder shall be set out separately from non-taxable goods and services, if
practicable. The Party receiving Services hereunder shall be responsible for
any such Sales Taxes and shall either (i) remit such Sales Taxes to the Party
providing Services hereunder (and such providing Party shall remit the such
amounts to the applicable taxing authority) or (ii) provide such providing
Party with a certificate or other acceptable proof evidencing an exemption
from liability for such Sales Taxes. In the event the Party providing
Services hereunder fails timely to invoice Sales Taxes on taxable goods or
services covered by this Agreement, such providing Party shall notify the
Party receiving Services hereunder in a timely manner and such receiving
Party shall remit such Sales Taxes to such providing Party, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such receiving Party shall not be responsible for the payment
of any additions to such Sales Taxes, including penalties and interest
imposed due to a failure by such providing Party to remit or cause to be
remitted such Sales Taxes in a timely manner to the appropriate taxing
authority, unless such failure relates to the failure of the such receiving
Party to pay to such providing Party the amount of the Sales Taxes properly
invoiced in accordance with the terms herein.

Section 4.4  _No Offset_. In no event shall a Party offset any amounts due
hereunder for its receipt of Services by amounts owed to it hereunder for its
provision of Services.

subcontractors shall not): (i) use the other Partys Network to develop

circumvent, adversely affect or attempt to break, interrupt, circumvent or
adversely affect any security system or measure of the other Party; (iii)
obtain, or attempt to obtain, access to any hardware, program or data
comprised in the other Partys Network except to the extent reasonably
necessary to perform or receive the Services; or to which such other Party
has given its prior written consent for such Party to obtain or attempt to
obtain such access; and (iv) use, disclose or give access to any part of the
other Partys Network to any third party, other than its agents and sub-
contractors authorized by such other Party in accordance with this Section
5.1. All user identification numbers and passwords for a Partys Network
disclosed to the other Party, and any information obtained from the use of
such Partys Network, shall be deemed Confidential Material of such disclosing
Party.

 

(e) If a Party or any of its employees, agents or subcontractors breach any
provision of this Article, such Party shall promptly notify the other Party

of such other Party.

(c) Seller shall ensure that any of its employees, agents and subcontractors
who access any of Buyers electronic systems in connection with performance
of the Seller Services or receipt of the Buyer Services, shall have reviewed,
acknowledged and accepted Buyers standard employee Acceptable Use Policy
training prior to such access.

 

Section 5.3 _Record Retention_. Each Party shall take reasonable steps to
preserve and maintain all records relating to the Service provided by such
Party hereunder, which Records shall be (a) in the case of Seller, retained by
Seller and/or its Affiliates for the period of time specified by Sellers
record retention policies and procedures (as may be amended from time to
time), but no less than three (3) years from provision of such Services or (b)

following the Effective Date and of which a Party has given the other Party
reasonable notice, each Party shall maintain any records and any other
materials related to any of the foregoing until otherwise directed and
authorized by the requesting Party.

Section 5.4 _Audit_.

 

(a) The Party receiving a Service may from time to time review or audit any
document, information or matter relating to the other Partys performance of
the Services, through its own staff or through contractors, agents, auditors
or advisers and will ensure that such persons are bound by a confidentiality
provision substantially similar to that contained in Article VI.

 

(b) The Party providing a Service will provide the other Party and its
employees, contractors, agents, auditors and advisers with such information,
assistance and access to such Partys premises, employees and documentation as
is reasonable in order that they may fully and promptly carry out each audit;
_provided_ , that the auditing Party will permit the audited Party
the opportunity to deliver any information required by the auditing Party
prior to the auditing Party carrying out any audit hereunder which may render
an audit visit unnecessary.

 

Section 5.5 _Regulatory Audit_. In addition to the rights set out above, each
Party acknowledges and agrees that certain government departments and
regulatory, statutory and other entities, committees and bodies which, whether
under statute, rules, regulations, codes of practice or otherwise, are
entitled to regulate, investigate or influence any matters within this
Agreement or any other affairs of the other Party (collectively, "
_Regulatory Bodies_ ") from time to time require the right, whether by virtue
of Law, regulation, code of conduct or otherwise, to investigate the affairs
of such other Party; and accordingly each Party agrees to provide such access
as is referred to in Section 5.4 and all such other access, information and
assistance as such Regulatory Bodies properly require in order to fulfill such
requirements. If a Party considers that any requirement relates to
information which is confidential to such Party, such Party will be entitled
to disclose the information directly to the Regulatory Body without having to
disclose it to the other Party.

 

Section 5.6 _Audit Results_.

 

(a) Without prejudice to each Partys other rights under this Agreement, if
the other Partys exercise of its rights under this Article results in audit
findings that such Party has failed to perform its material obligations under
this Agreement, the auditing Party will make the audit findings available to
the audited Party, and the Parties will use all reasonable efforts to agree
to a remedial plan and a timetable for achievement of the planned actions
and/or improvements. Following agreement of the timetable, the audited Party
will implement that plan in accordance with the agreed timescales and will
confirm its completion by a notice in writing to the auditing Party. If the
audited Party fails to agree to or implement such plan within thirty (30) days
of the auditing Partys written request, the auditing Party will be entitled
to terminate this Agreement or any part thereof pursuant to the provisions of
Article X.

cause its Affiliates or third party service providers providing Services

the Sarbanes Oxley Act as it relates to the Services, and (b) such Partys
auditors to provide the Auditors Attestation. The other Party will confirm the

 _CONFIDENTIALITY_

 

Section 6.1 _Confidential Materials_. Each Party shall keep confidential and
shall not make available or disclose any information or material of the other
Party or its Affiliates that is or has been (a) disclosed by such other Party
or its Affiliates under or in connection with this Agreement, whether orally,
electronically, in writing or otherwise, including copies, or (b) learned,
acquired, or generated by the other party in connection with this Agreement,
including the terms of this Agreement (collectively, " _Confidential Material_
") to any Person, or make or permit any use of such Confidential Material
without the prior written consent of the other Party. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Confidential Material may be disclosed on an as needed basis to
Personnel of the receiving Party as required for the purpose of fulfilling
the receiving Partys obligations under this Agreement. Each Party shall take
all reasonable steps to ensure that any such Confidential Material disclosed
to any such Person in accordance with this Section 6.1 is treated as
confidential by such Person and shall require its subcontractors to enter
into a confidentiality agreement which imposes confidentiality obligations no
less protective of the Confidential Material than those imposed upon under
this Agreement.

 



12 Section 6.2 _Permitted Disclosures_ . The provisions of this Article shall not
apply to any Confidential Material which: (a) is or becomes commonly known
within the public domain other than by breach of this Agreement or any other

who is lawfully authorized to disclose such information free from any
obligation of confidentiality; or (c) is independently developed without
reference to any Confidential Material.

prevent either Party from disclosing Confidential Material where it is
required to be disclosed by judicial, administrative, governmental or
regulatory process in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or claim or
otherwise by applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that a Party that is so
required to disclose Confidential Material shall, if legally permitted, give
the other Party prior reasonable notice as soon as possible, of such required
disclosure so as to enable such other Party to seek relief from such
disclosure requirement or measures to protect the confidentiality of the
disclosure.

Section 6.4 _Unauthorized Disclosures_. Each Party shall immediately inform
the other Party in the event that it becomes aware of the possession, use or
knowledge of any of such other Partys Confidential Material by any Person not
authorized to possess, use or have knowledge of the Confidential Material and
shall at the request of such other Party provide such reasonable assistance as
is required by such other Party to mitigate any damage caused thereby.

 

Section 6.5 _Injunctive Relief_. Without prejudice to any other rights or
remedies that a Party may have, each Party acknowledges that the other Party
may not have an adequate remedy at law for any breach by such Party or its
Personnel of the provisions of this Article VI, and that therefore any such
other Party shall be entitled to equitable relief including
injunctive relief. Each Party agrees to provide reasonable assistance at its
own expense or to join at the request of the other Party in any action against
any of such Partys staff where such other Party is seeking equitable relief,
including injunctive relief, for any such breach.

Section 6.6 _Destruction of Confidential Material_. Upon the termination of a
given Service, the service provider Party will, and will cause its Affiliates

made or brought by a third party that is not an Affiliate of the Indemnified

arising out of (a) Seller Parties material breach of this Agreement or (b) a
claim that Services and materials provided by a Seller Party under this
Agreement infringe or misappropriate such third partys Intellectual Property.

 



14 Section 9.2 _Indemnification of Seller_. Subject to the terms of this Article
IX, from and after the Effective Date, Buyer shall indemnify, defend, save

Section 9.3 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Party of notice of the
commencement or threatened commencement of any civil,
criminal, administrative, or investigative action or proceeding involving a
Third Party Claim in respect of which such Indemnified Party will seek
indemnification pursuant to this Article IX, the Indemnified Party shall, in
the case of a Buyer Indemnified Party, notify Seller, and, in the case of a
Seller Indemnified Party, notify Buyer (Seller or Buyer, as the case may be,
the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), in writing. No failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall relieve it of its obligations under this Agreement
except to the extent that it can demonstrate that it was materially prejudiced
by such failure.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of
notice to elect, at its option, to assume and control the defense of, at its
own expense and by its own counsel, any such Third Party Claim, and shall be
entitled to assert any and all defenses available to the Indemnified Party to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the (i) applicable Seller Party shall have sole control of the defense
(including selecting counsel) of any Third Party Claim brought against such

Body or other supervisory agency, notwithstanding the fact that such Seller
Party is indemnified by the Indemnifying Party for such Third Party Claim
pursuant to Section 9.2 and (ii) applicable Buyer Party shall have sole
control of the defense (including selecting counsel) of any Third Party Claim
brought against such Buyer Party by (A) any customer of such Buyer Party or

liability with respect to, such Third Party Claims without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party (or the Party otherwise controlling the defense
of settlement pursuant to clause (b) above) shall undertake to compromise or
defend any such Third Party Claim, it shall promptly, but in any event within
ten (10) days of the receipt of notice

 



15  from the Indemnified Party of such Third Party Claim, notify the Indemnified
Party of its intention to do so, and the Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate

defense against, any such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnifying Party (or the Party otherwise controlling the defense of
settlement pursuant to clause (b) above) shall not settle, compromise or
discharge, or admit any liability with respect to, any such Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the other Party (which consent will not

provision whereby the plaintiff or claimant in the matter releases the other
Party from all liability with respect thereto.

 

(d) Notwithstanding an election to assume the defense of any action or
proceeding, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate
counsel and to participate in the defense of such action or proceeding, and
the Indemnified Party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of
such separate counsel, unless the Indemnifying Party shall have authorized
the Indemnified Party to employ separate counsel at the Indemnifying Partys
expense.

(e) The Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party and their counsel shall
cooperate in the defense of any Third Party Claim subject to this Article IX,

Party Claims and provide copies of all relevant correspondence
and documentation relating thereto. All costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the Indemnified Partys cooperation, to the extent requested
by the Indemnifying Party, shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party. In any
event, the Indemnified Party shall have the right at its own expense to
participate in the defense of such asserted liability, subject to the
allocation of control set forth in this Section 9.3.

 

(f) If the Indemnifying Party receiving such notice of a Third Party Claim
does not elect to defend such Third Party Claim, or does not defend such
Third Party Claim in good faith, the Indemnified Party shall have the right,
in addition to any other right or remedy it may have hereunder, at the
Indemnifying Partys expense, to defend such Third Party Claim; _provided_ ,

discharge, or admit any liability with respect to, any such Third Party Claim
without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

ANY MANNER CONNECTED WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF,
REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION AND WHETHER OR NOT SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN
INFORMED OF, OR OTHERWISE MIGHT HAVE ANTICIPATED, THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL A PARTYS LIABILITY IN THE AGGREGATE FOR DAMAGES

Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall any Indemnifying Party be
obligated under this Article IX to indemnify an Indemnified Party otherwise
entitled to indemnity hereunder in respect of any Losses to the extent that
such Losses result from (a) the Indemnified Partys willful or intentional
misconduct or negligence, (b) the acts or omissions of the Indemnified Party,

Indemnifying Party at the Indemnified Partys direction.

Section 9.6  _Payments_. Amounts payable by the Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnified Party in respect of any Losses for which such Party is entitled to
indemnification hereunder (" _Indemnity Payments_ ") shall be paid in
immediately available funds within ten (10) Business Days after the later of
(i) the receipt of a written request from the Party entitled to such Indemnity
Payment and (ii) the date of payment of the amount that is the subject of the
Indemnity Payment by the Party entitled to receive the Indemnity Payment,
except to the extent contested by the Indemnifying Party. All such Indemnity
Payments shall be made to the designated account of, and in the manner
specified in writing by, the Party entitled to such Indemnity Payments.

Section 9.7 _Insurance_ _; Tax Benefits_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
Losses shall be net of any insurance or other prior or subsequent recoveries
actually received by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates in connection
with the facts giving rise to the claim for indemnification. If an Indemnified
Party shall have used commercially reasonable efforts to recover any
amounts recoverable under insurance policies and shall not have recovered the
applicable Losses, the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the amount by
which such Losses exceeds the amounts actually recovered.

 

(b) Any indemnity payments made pursuant to this Article IX by any
Indemnifying Party to an Indemnified Party shall be increased to account for
any Tax cost incurred by the Indemnified Party upon the receipt of such
payment (grossed up for such payment) and shall be made net of any Tax Benefit
available to the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates resulting from the
payments of the amounts indemnified against giving rise to such indemnity
payments. For purposes of determining the amount of any Tax Benefit available
or

 



17  Tax cost incurred, the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to pay Tax at the
highest United States federal income tax corporate marginal rate in effect in
the year such indemnifiable Loss is incurred and the recipient of the Tax
Benefit shall be deemed to realize or utilize any Tax Benefit in the first
taxable year that such Tax Benefit may be realized or utilized under Law after
taking into account all other Tax Attributes of such Indemnified Party and
the projected utilization of such Tax Attributes as computed by the recipient
of such Tax Benefit. If a Tax Benefit resulting from the incurrence or payment
of Losses is available to any Indemnified Party or its Affiliates in multiple
Tax years, the amount of such Tax Benefit for purposes of this Section 9.7(b)
shall be the net present value of all of such available Tax Benefits,
calculated by using a discount rate equal to the long-term.

 

Section 9.8 _Remedies Exclusive_. Except as otherwise specifically provided
herein, the remedies provided in this Agreement shall be the exclusive
monetary remedies (including equitable remedies that involve monetary payment,
such as restitution or disgorgement, other than specific performance to
enforce any payment or performance due hereunder) of the Parties from and
after the Effective Date in connection with any non-performance, partial or
total, of any term, provision, covenant or agreement contained herein.

 

Section 9.9 _Mitigation_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, each Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate any claim or liability that an Indemnified Party asserts
or may assert under this Agreement.

 

Section 9.10 _No Double Recovery; No Limitation_. The remedies provided in
this Agreement shall not be cumulative with any duplicative remedy available
pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. Nothing contained in this Article IX shall
limit or alter the obligation of any Party to indemnify any other Party
pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.

this Agreement, this Agreement shall become effective, and each Service shall
commence, on the Effective Date, and this Agreement shall remain in force, and
each Service shall continue for the time period set forth on Schedule 2.1 or
Schedule 2.2 as applicable, unless earlier terminated by the Parties as

Section 10.2 _Extension of Certain Services_. Not less than ten (10)
days prior to the expiration of the Base Term, Buyer or Seller, as
applicable, shall notify the other Party if such Party determines in good
faith that it will not be able to complete the transition from, or to replace,
one or more Services prior to the expiration of the Base Term for such
Services. In the event of such a request, the other Party shall continue to
provide such Services, and, solely with respect to such Services, to extend
the term of the provision of such Services for: (a) one (1) additional period
of equal length to the original term set forth in Schedule 2.1(a) or Schedule
2.2(a) as applicable and (b) one (1) further additional such period with the
other Partys prior 

 



18  written consent (each, an " _Extension Term_ " and, together with the Base
Term, the " _Term_ "); _provided_ , that (a) such Party shall at all times
use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the duration of any such
extension and (b) such Party shall indemnify the other Party for any
reasonable increased expenses, payments, penalties or liabilities incurred by
the other Party solely as a result of any such extension (which
indemnification payments shall be in addition to any Fees which may be due as
a result of such extension) so long as such other Party provided prior notice
of the likely incurrence and amount of such increased expenses, payments,
penalties or liabilities.

Section 10.3 _Termination_.

 

(a) _Termination by Seller or Buyer_. This Agreement, or any Service provided
hereunder, as applicable, may be terminated by either Party (the "
_Terminating Party_ ") upon written notice to the other Party, if:

(i) the other Party makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors
or becomes insolvent, or a receiver is appointed for, or a court approves
reorganization or arrangement proceedings on, such Party;

 

(ii) performance of this Agreement or any Service provided by the other Party
hereunder has been rendered impossible for a period of at least sixty (60)
days by reason of the occurrence of any Force Majeure Event, or if any other
event occurs that is reasonably deemed to permanently prevent the performance
of this Agreement or any Service provided hereunder;  _provided_ , _however_
, that this Agreement may only be terminated under this Section 10.3(a)(ii)
with respect to the affected Service; or

 

(iii) required by any Governmental Authority, upon thirty (30) days notice or
sooner if necessary; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that prior to any such notice
of termination, the Parties mutually agree that this Agreement cannot be
amended in a manner that will satisfy such Governmental Authority without
materially changing the effect or intent of this Agreement.

(b) _Partial Termination_. Either Party may, as a Service recipient, on thirty
(30) days written notice to the other Party, terminate any Seller Service or
Buyer Service, as applicable. Any such terminated Service shall be deleted
from _Schedule 2.1(a)_ or _Schedule 2.2(a)_ , as applicable, and the
terminating Party shall have no obligation to continue to use or pay for any
such Seller Service or Buyer Service, as applicable; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that this Agreement shall remain in effect until neither Party requires any
Service from the other Party, or until otherwise terminated pursuant to this
Article X. Any termination notice delivered by either Party shall specify in
detail the Service or Services to be terminated, and the effective date of
such termination. 

Section 10.4 _Effect of Termination_. In the event that this Agreement is
terminated for any reason:

 

(a) Each Party agrees and acknowledges that the obligations of each Party to
provide the Services, or to cause the Services to be provided, hereunder
shall immediately cease. Upon cessation of the applicable Partys obligation
to provide any Service, the Party receiving the Service shall stop using,
directly or indirectly, such Service.

 



19 (b) Upon request, each Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and third
parties (subject to the terms of such Partys agreements with such third
parties) retained by such Party or its Affiliates to, return to the other
Party or, at the other Partys option, destroy (and certify to the destruction
of) all tangible personal property and books, records or files owned by such
other Party or its Affiliates and third parties and used in connection with
the provision of Services that are in their possession as of the termination
date.

 

(c) In the event that Buyer seeks to discontinue a Seller Service without
providing the 30-day notice provided for herein, Buyer shall be responsible
to Seller Parties for reasonable and proper termination charges, including all
reasonable cancellation costs; _provided_ , that the Seller Parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to minimize such cancellation costs.

(d) The following matters shall survive the termination of this Agreement (i)
the rights and obligations of each Party under Article I, Section 5.3,
Section 5.7, Article VI, Article VII, Article VIII, Article IX, Section 10.4
and Article XI and (ii) the obligations under Article IV of each Party to pay
