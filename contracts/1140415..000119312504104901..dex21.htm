Seller an amount equal to One Hundred Thirty-Nine Million and No/100 Euro
(139,000,000), plus any positive Estimated Working Capital Adjustment, or

(such amount being referred to as the " _Purchase Price_ "), which amount will
be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account (or
accounts) as shall be designated in writing no later than two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date by Seller to Dresser.



3.2 _Pre-Closing Estimate; Post-Closing Adjustment of Purchase Price_.



(a) No later than three (3) Business Days prior to Closing, Seller shall cause
to be prepared and delivered to Dresser a statement of the "Closing Working
Capital", which shall be the result of the (i) sum of all accounts receivable
plus inventory of the Business, _minus_ (ii) accounts payable of the Business,
as estimated as of the Determination Date and prepared in accordance with the
Accounting Principles and in the format set forth in _Schedule 1.1(h)_.
Closing Working Capital shall specifically exclude Indebtedness and capital
leases, but shall include any cash of Seller that has been contributed to
Buyer at Closing. Dresser shall have no right to object to the



 

24 calculation of Closing Working Capital delivered by Seller provided such
calculation was (A) prepared in good faith, and (B) prepared in accordance
with the Accounting Principles and in the format set forth in _Schedule
1.1(h)_ , and on a basis consistent with the preparation of the Financial
Statements as of the Fiscal Date.



(b) As promptly as practicable after the Closing, but in any event within
ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Seller (with the assistance of
Dresser, as reasonably requested by Seller) will cause to be prepared and
delivered to Dresser an audited statement prepared in accordance with the
Accounting Principles, in the format set forth in _Schedule 1.1(h)_ , and on
a basis consistent with the preparation of the Financial Statements as of the
Fiscal Date, setting forth Sellers calculation of the Net Working Capital and
Sellers calculation of the Net Working Capital Deficit or Net Working
Capital Surplus, as applicable, as of the Determination Date (the " _Closing
Statement_ ").



(c) If Dresser disagrees with Sellers calculation of Net Working Capital and
the resulting Net Working Capital Deficit (or Surplus) as set forth in the
Closing Statement delivered pursuant to Section 3.2(b), Dresser may, within
forty-five (45) days after delivery of such documents, deliver, in writing, a
notice to Seller disagreeing with Sellers calculation of Net Working Capital
and the resulting Net Working Capital Deficit (or Surplus) and setting forth
Dressers calculation of Net Working Capital and resulting Net Working Capital
Deficit (or Surplus). Any such notice of disagreement shall specify those
items and amounts as to which Dresser disagrees, and Dresser shall be deemed
to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Closing
Statement. If Dresser does not notify Seller of any dispute within forty-five
(45) days of the delivery of the Closing Statement pursuant to Section 3.2(b),
the Closing Statement shall be deemed to be the Final Closing Statement.



(d) If a notice of disagreement shall be delivered pursuant to Section 3.2(c),
Dresser and Seller shall, during the thirty (30) days following such delivery
(or such longer period as Dresser and Seller shall mutually agree in writing),
use their best efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in
order to determine the Net Working Capital and the resulting Net Working
Capital Deficit (or Surplus). If, during such period, Dresser and Seller are
unable to reach such settlement, Dresser or Seller shall promptly thereafter
retain the Independent Accounting Firm to promptly review the disputed items
or amounts for purposes of calculating Net Working Capital and the resulting
Net Working Capital Deficit (or Surplus). In making such a calculation, the
Independent Accounting Firm shall (i) consider only those items or amounts
in the Closing Statement and in Sellers calculation of Net Working Capital
and the resulting Net Working Capital Deficit (or Surplus) as to which Dresser
has disagreed and (ii) assign to such disputed amounts a value which is equal
to or between (but not above or below) the values assigned by Dresser and
Seller to such disputed amounts. The Independent Accounting Firm shall deliver
to Dresser and Seller, as promptly as practical, a report setting forth each
such calculation and such report shall result in the determination of the
Final Closing Statement. The determination by the Independent Accounting Firm
as aforesaid shall not be treated as an arbitration, but as a determination
made on an equitable basis ( _equo apprezzamento_ ) under Article 1349,



 

25 first paragraph, of the Italian Civil Code and will be final and binding on
the Parties. The Independent Accounting Firm shall use its best efforts to
complete its work within thirty (30) days following its engagement. The
expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm to resolve a dispute under this
Section 3.2(d) shall be shared equally by Dresser and Seller.



(e) Dresser and its auditors shall have the opportunity to observe the
physical inventory taken in connection with the Closing Statement (which may
begin prior to the Closing Date).



(f) Within five (5) Business Days after the determination of the Final Closing
Statement in accordance with this Section 3.2,

 



(i) if there is a Net Working Capital Deficit, then Seller shall pay to
Dresser an amount equal to the Net Working Capital Deficit, as a reduction of
the Purchase Price; and



(ii) if there is a Net Working Capital Surplus, then Dresser shall pay to
Seller an amount equal to the Net Working Capital Surplus, as an increase in
the Purchase Price.



(g) The net payment made pursuant to Section 3.2(f) shall (i) include
interest at the Reference Rate per annum from the Closing Date through the
date of such payment (on the basis of a 360-day calendar year), and (ii) be
made in Euro by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such bank
account as shall be designated in writing by the recipient at least three (3)
Business Days prior to the payment date.



 

(h) Dresser and Seller agree that they will and agree to cause their
respective independent accountants to cooperate in the preparation of the
Closing Statement and the calculation of Net Working Capital and the resulting
Net Working Capital Deficit (or Surplus), including, making available to the
extent reasonably required Books and Records (subject to appropriate
indemnification) and accounting personnel.

Entity with respect to any such inquiry or request. In addition, each Party

Party to this Agreement shall agree to participate in any meeting with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry
unless it consults with the other Party in advance whenever practicable, and,
to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other Party the
reasonable opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting.



6.4 _Further Assurances_. Each Party shall cooperate, and use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Law to consummate the Acquisition. Seller will use Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to ensure that the conditions set forth in ARTICLE IX hereof are
satisfied, insofar as such matters are within the control of Seller, and each

the conditions set forth in ARTICLE IX hereof are satisfied, insofar as such
matters are within the control of Dresser and Buyer. The Parties further
covenant and agree, with respect to a threatened or pending preliminary or
permanent injunction or other order, decree or ruling or statute, rule,
regulation or executive order that would adversely affect the ability of the
Parties to



 

41 consummate the Acquisition, to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to prevent
or lift the entry, enactment or promulgation thereof, as the case may be.

within the scope and extent set forth in  _Schedule 6.6_ (the " _S-X
Financials_ ") as promptly as practicable and, (a) with respect to the S-X
Financials for the periods ending December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2003, no
later than the Closing Date, and (b) with respect to the S-X Financials for
the period ending December 31, 2001, which shall be consistent in scope with
the S-X Financials delivered at Closing (the " _ 01 S-X Financials_"), no
later than June 30, 2004; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the S-X Financials
for the periods ending December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2003, together with
the Auditors opinion thereon, shall be deposited in escrow with a notary
reasonably satisfactory to the Parties (and such deposit shall satisfy
Sellers obligation to deliver to Buyer such S-X Financials no later than the

and replace with the S-X Financials for the three years ended December 31,
2001, 2002 and 2003, (together with the Auditors opinion thereon) at such
time as Seller is to deliver the 01 S-X Financials to Buyer, or, if the 01
S-X Financials have not been delivered to Buyer on or before June 30, 2004,
then the S-X Financials held in escrow by the notary shall be released to
Buyer. In the event the 01 S-X Financials are not delivered on or prior to
July 6, 2004, as Buyers and Dressers exclusive remedy for such
failure, Seller shall owe to Buyer 2 million as liquidated damages. Seller
shall owe to Buyer an additional 50,000 per day as liquidated damages for
every day after July 6, 2004 that the 01 S-X Financials have not been
delivered to Buyer, up to a maximum amount (including the 2 million) of 5.0
million. Should Seller fail to pay the 2 million as liquidated damages within
30 days following its date due, interest shall accrue on such amount at the
Reference Rate from and after such 30th day. The daily liquidated damages
amount of 50,000 shall be aggregated and paid in one lump sum within 30 days

Buyer or (ii) Seller owing to Buyer the maximum amount



 

42 of liquidated damages, and any such amount unpaid thereafter shall accrue

provide the Auditors with all work papers, financial information, consents,
management representation letters or other necessary documentation or
information reasonably required so that the S-X Financials are prepared in

Efforts to cause the Auditors to grant their consent to include the S-X
Financials in any filing with the SEC or offering memorandum in connection
with a private placement of securities that may be made or delivered by Buyer
or its Affiliates from time to time, and will request the Auditors to provide
a "comfort letter" relating to a filing or offering memorandum containing the
S-X Financials and provide such information as the Auditors may reasonably
request in connection with its delivery of such comfort letter.

unsolicited inquiries concerning possible employment which are received by
the other Party from or on behalf of such person; (ii) general solicitation of

any actual out of pocket losses, claims, damages or reasonable expenses
(including amounts paid in settlement and reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses), net of any insurance proceeds and Tax benefits and other amounts as
provided in Section 11.5 (any of the foregoing, a " _Loss_ ") arising out of:



(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller in ARTICLE IV
of this Agreement;

 



(b) any breach of any covenant, agreement or undertaking made by Seller in
this Agreement;



(c) any Excluded Liability; or



(d) any fraud or willful misconduct of Seller in connection with this
Agreement or the Seller Ancillary Documents.



11.2 _Indemnification Obligations of Dresser and Buyer_. From and after
Closing, Dresser and Buyer, jointly and severally, shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties from, against and in respect of
any and all Losses arising out of:



(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Dresser or Buyer in
ARTICLE V of this Agreement;



(b) any breach of any covenant, agreement or undertaking made by Dresser or
Buyer in this Agreement;



 

51 (c) any Assumed Liability;



(d) the issuance, ownership and sale of the Shares; or



(e) any fraud or willful misconduct of Dresser or Buyer in connection with
this Agreement or the Buyer Ancillary Documents.



11.3 _Indemnification Procedure_. __



(a) _Procedures for Third Party Claims_. Promptly after receipt by an
Indemnified Party of notice by a third party of a threatened or filed
complaint or the threatened or actual commencement of any audit,
investigation, action or proceeding with respect to which such Indemnified
Party may be entitled to receive payment from the other Party for any Loss,
such Indemnified Party shall provide written notification to Buyer, on the one
hand, or Seller, on the other hand, whoever is the appropriate indemnifying
Party hereunder (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), within five (5) days after the
Indemnified Partys knowledge of threatening or filing of such complaint or
knowledge of the threatened or actual commencement of such audits,
investigation, action or proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure
to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from
liability under this Agreement with respect to such claim only if, and only
to the extent that, such failure to notify the Indemnifying Party results in
(i) the forfeiture by the Indemnifying Party of rights and defenses otherwise
available to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim or
(ii) material prejudice to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim.
The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice delivered to
the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days thereafter, to assume the
defense of such complaint, audit, investigation, action or proceeding,
including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party and the payment of the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel
(unless (i) the claim relates to an environmental, criminal or injunctive
matter (other than those contemplated by the Environmental Report) or (ii) the
claim is also asserted against an Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
reasonably determines in good faith that joint representation would be
inappropriate (collectively, " _Indemnified Party Controlled Claims_ ")),
provided that the Indemnifying Party acknowledges its obligation to indemnify
the Indemnified Party in respect of the entire amount of the claims asserted
therein. If the Indemnifying Party declines or fails to assume the defense of
the audit, investigation, action or proceeding on the terms provided above
within such thirty (30) day period, (or in case of any Indemnified
Party Controlled Claims), the Indemnified Party may employ counsel to
represent or defend it in any such audit, investigation, action or proceeding
in such a manner as it may deem appropriate, and the Indemnifying Party for
the Loss in question will pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such
counsel as incurred; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party will
not be required to pay the fees and disbursements of more than one (1) counsel
for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction in any single audit,
investigation, action or proceeding. In any audit, investigation, action or
proceeding with respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder,
the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party, whichever is not assuming
the defense of such action, shall have the right to participate in such matter
and to retain its own counsel at such Partys



 

52 own expense. The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may
be, shall at all times use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to keep the
Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, reasonably
apprised of the status of any matter the defense of which they are maintaining
and to cooperate in good faith with each other with respect to the defense of
any such matter. No Indemnifying Party shall consent to a settlement of, or
the entry of any judgment arising from, any claim or legal proceeding which it
is defending without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld if the settlement does not
in any way restrict or impair the future operations of the Business, and may
be withheld for any reason or no reason at all if the settlement has
such effect) unless the Indemnifying Party (w) admits in writing its
liability, (x) agrees to hold the Indemnified Party harmless from and against
any losses, damages, expenses and liabilities arising out of such settlement,
and (y) concurrently with such settlement the Indemnifying Party pays into
court the full amount of all losses, damages, expenses and liabilities to be
paid by the Indemnifying Party in connection with such settlement. No
Indemnified Party may settle or compromise any claim or consent to the entry
of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought
hereunder without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).



(b) _Procedures for Direct Claims_. If an Indemnified Party in good faith
claims a right to payment pursuant to this Agreement not involving a third
party claim covered by Section 11.3(a) hereof, such Indemnified Party shall
send written notice of such claim to the appropriate Indemnifying Party.
Such notice shall specify the basis for such claim. If the Indemnifying Party
has timely disputed its liability with respect to such claim, the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a
resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations, such
dispute shall be resolved by arbitration in accordance with this Agreement.



(c) _Gilbarco Claims_. Dresser and Buyer acknowledge that, from and after the
Closing, the Gilbarco Claims shall be deemed to have been notified to Buyer,
and shall be governed by the provisions of Section 11.3(a). Accordingly,
Buyer, as the Indemnifying Party, shall assume the defense of the Gilbarco
Claims. Seller shall reimburse Buyer for 50% of any Losses related to
any settlement or judgment consented to by Seller pursuant to the procedures
in Section 11.3(a) and which is allocable to the Gilbarco Claims for the sale
of fuel dispensers by Seller prior to Closing; provided that such
reimbursement shall not exceed 500,000.



11.4 _Survival_. 



(a) The representations and warranties given or made by any Party in ARTICLE
IV and ARTICLE V shall survive the Closing for a period ending fifteen (15)
days after completion of the audited financial statements of the Business as
of and for the period ending December 31, 2004; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that such survival period will under no circumstances extend beyond April 30,
2005, and shall thereafter be of no further force or effect, except that (i)
the representations and warranties contained in Section 4.16 (Taxes) and
4.15 (Labor Matters) shall survive the Closing until the date thirty days
following the expiration of any applicable statutes of limitations, (ii) the



 

53 representations and warranties contained in Section 4.3 (Authorization),
Section 4.5 (Title to Assets) and Section 4.8 (Title to Owned Real Property)
shall survive the Closing for a period ending on the tenth anniversary
thereof; (iii) any warranty as to which a claim (including a contingent claim)
shall have been asserted in good faith during the applicable survival period
shall continue in effect with respect to such claim until such claim only
shall have been finally resolved or settled; and (iv) the representations and
warranties contained in Section 5.9 (SEC Reports) shall not survive the
Closing.



(b) The covenants and agreements of the Parties contained in this Agreement,
including those set forth in ARTICLE VII and ARTICLE VIII, shall survive the
Closing indefinitely, unless otherwise specified herein.



11.5 _Liability Limits_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, each Partys obligation to indemnify, defend and hold any
Indemnified Party harmless shall be limited as follows:



(a) No amounts of indemnity shall be payable pursuant to Section 11.1 unless
the amount of Loss suffered by Buyer Indemnified Party related to each
individual claim exceeds 139,000 (unless the single occurrence giving rise to
Sellers liability is part of a series of occurrences of the same kind arising
out of the same set of facts), and then, subject to the other limitations of
this Agreement, to the full extent of such claim;



(b) No amounts of indemnity shall be payable pursuant to Section 11.1 unless
and until, after taking into account the other limitations of this Section
11.5, Buyer Indemnified Parties shall have suffered indemnifiable Losses in
excess of 300,000 in the aggregate, in which case Buyer Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to recover only such Losses in excess of such amount;



(c) In no event shall the aggregate amount of indemnity required to be paid by
Seller to all Buyer Indemnified Parties exceed an amount equal to fifteen
percent (15%) of the Purchase Price as adjusted pursuant to Section 3.2;



(d) The limitation amounts set forth in Sections 11.5(a), 11.5(b) and 11.5(c)
shall not apply to (i) claims for Losses incurred by Buyer Indemnified
Parties resulting from any fraud or willful misconduct of Seller in connection
with this Agreement or the Seller Ancillary Documents, or (ii) any claims for
indemnification relating to an Excluded Liability;



(e) For purposes of computing the aggregate amount of claims against Seller,
the amount of each claim by a Buyer Indemnified Party shall be deemed to be an
amount equal to, and any payments by Seller pursuant to Section 11.1 shall be
limited to, the amount of Losses that remain after deducting therefrom
(A) the amount, if any, of any accrued liability or reserve on the Financial
Statements and specifically identified to such Loss or category of such Loss,
(B) the amount of any accrued liability or reserve included in the calculation
of the Net Working Capital and specifically identified to such Loss or
category of such Loss (excluding any amounts considered under clause



 

54 (A)), (C) any third party insurance proceeds paid directly by a third party to
Buyer or paid by Seller to Buyer following receipt of such proceeds from a
third party and any indemnity, contributions or other similar payment payable
by any third party with respect thereto, in each case only with respect to
insurance policies in existence prior to the Closing and applicable to the
Transferred Assets and (D) any net Tax benefit actually recognized by a Buyer
Indemnified Party or any Affiliate thereof with respect to the Losses or items
giving rise to such claim for indemnification; and

 



(f) In any claim for indemnification under this Agreement, no Indemnifying
Party shall be required to indemnify any Indemnified Party for indirect,
punitive, special, or consequential damages, nor for any loss of profit or
revenue, any multiple of reduced cash flow, loss of tenants,
lenders, investors or buyers incurred by such Indemnified Party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any of the foregoing damages shall be indemnifiable to the
extent, and only to the extent, an Indemnified Party is obligated to pay any
such damages as a result of a third party claim covered by Section 11.3(a).



11.6  _Reasonable Steps to Mitigate_. The Indemnified Party will take all
reasonable steps to mitigate all Losses, including availing itself of any
defenses, limitations, rights of contribution, claims against third Persons
and other rights at Law or equity, and will provide such evidence and
documentation of the nature and extent of the Loss as may be reasonably
requested by the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Partys reasonable steps
include the reasonable expenditure of money to mitigate or otherwise reduce
or eliminate any Loss for which indemnification would otherwise be due under
this ARTICLE XI, and the Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified
Party for the Indemnified Partys reasonable expenditures in undertaking the
mitigation, together with interest thereon from the date of payment to the
date of repayment at the Reference Rate.



11.7 _Exclusive Remedies Following the Closing Date_. Following the Closing
Date, the provisions of this ARTICLE XI, Section 12.8 and Section
12.12 hereof set forth the exclusive rights and remedies of each Party to
seek or obtain damages or any other remedy or relief whatsoever from any Party
with respect to matters arising under or in connection with this Agreement and
the Acquisition from and after the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing herein shall limit in any way such Partys remedies in respect of
fraud by another Party arising in connection with this Agreement, or for
breach of any ancillary agreement delivered in connection herewith that is to
be performed after the Closing.



11.8 _Environmental Remedies_. Without limiting the generality of Section
11.7, each of Dresser and Buyer understands and agrees that its right to
indemnification under Section 11.1 for breach of the representations and
warranties contained in Section 4.17 and for Excluded Liabilities constituting
Environmental Liabilities retained by Seller under Section 2.5(e) shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer and its Affiliates
against the Seller Indemnified Parties with respect to any environmental,
health, or safety matter relating to the past, current or future facilities,
properties or operations of the Business, including any such matter arising
under any Environmental, Health, and Safety Laws; provided that nothing
herein shall limit in any way either Partys remedies for breach of the EHS
Agreement. Aside from such right to indemnification, each of Dresser and Buyer
hereby waives any right, whether arising at Law or in equity, to seek
contribution, cost recovery, damages, or any other recourse or



 

55 remedy from Seller, and hereby releases and holds harmless the Seller
Indemnified Parties from any claim, demand or liability, with respect to any
such environmental, health, or safety matter (including any arising under any
Environmental, Health, and Safety Laws).

facsimile is transmitted to the facsimile number specified in this Section
12.2 (or in accordance with the latest unrevoked direction from such party),
and confirmation is received.



12.3 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement or any
Ancillary Document is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any
rule of Law or public policy, all other terms, conditions and provisions of
this Agreement or the applicable Ancillary Document shall nevertheless remain
in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
Acquisition is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement or the applicable Ancillary Document so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the Acquisition be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.



12.4 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions
hereof shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. Neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned,
directly or indirectly, including by operation of Law, by any Party without
the prior written consent of the other Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Buyer may effect the assignment described under Section 2.14 without the
consent of Seller.



12.5 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is exclusively for the
benefit of Seller, and its successors and permitted assigns, with respect to
the obligations of Buyer under this Agreement, and for the benefit of Dresser
and Buyer, and its respective successors and permitted assigns, with respect
to the obligations of Seller, under this Agreement, and this Agreement shall
not be deemed to confer upon or give to any other third party any remedy,
claim, liability, reimbursement, cause of action or other right.



12.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits
attached hereto), the Confidentiality Agreement and the Ancillary Documents
constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject
matter of this Agreement and supersede all other prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement.



12.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of Italy (regardless of the Laws that
might otherwise govern under



 

58 applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof) as to all matters,
including matters of validity, construction, effect, performance and
remedies.



12.8 _Specific Performance_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that any
breach of the terms of this Agreement would give rise to irreparable harm for
which money damages would not be an adequate remedy and accordingly the
Parties agree that, in addition to any other remedies, each Party shall be
entitled to enforce the terms of this Agreement by a decree of specific
performance without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages
as a remedy.



12.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute one
and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more
counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered (including
by facsimile) to the other Party.



12.10 _Amendment; Modification_. This Agreement may be amended, modified or
supplemented at any time by written agreement of the Parties.



12.11 _Disclosure Schedules_. Certain agreements and other matters are listed
in the Schedules for informational purposes only, notwithstanding the fact
that, because they do not rise above applicable materiality thresholds or
otherwise, they are not required to be listed herein by the terms of this
Agreement. In no event shall the listing of such agreements or other matters
in the Schedules be deemed or interpreted to broaden or otherwise amplify
Sellers representations and warranties, covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement or in any Ancillary Document, and nothing in the Schedules
shall influence the construction or interpretation of any of the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any Ancillary
Document. The headings contained in the Schedules are for convenience of
reference only and shall not be deemed to modify or influence
the interpretation of the information contained in the Schedules or the
Agreement. Furthermore, the disclosure of a particular item of information in
the Schedules shall not be taken as an admission by Seller that such
disclosure is required to be made under the terms of any of such
representations and warranties. Disclosure of any fact or item in any Schedule
hereto referenced by a particular section in this Agreement shall be deemed to
have been disclosed with respect to any other section in this Agreement if
such disclosure specifically references such other section of this Agreement.
The specification of any Euro amount in the representations or warranties
contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item in
any Schedules hereto is not intended to imply that such amounts, or higher or
lower amounts or the items so included or other items, are or are not
material, and no party shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts or
the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy as to whether
any obligation, items or matter not described herein or included in a Schedule
is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement.



12.12 _Dispute Resolution_.



 

(a) _Arbitration Scope_. Any dispute, controversy, or claim of any and every
kind or type, whether based on contract, tort, statute, regulations, or
otherwise, arising out of, connected with, or relating in any way to this
Agreement, the relationship of the parties, the obligations of the parties or
the operations carried out under this Agreement,



 

59 including any dispute as to the existence, validity, construction,
interpretation, negotiation, performance, non-performance, breach,
termination, or enforceability of this Agreement shall be settled through
final and binding arbitration. Any and all of the arbitrators orders and
decisions may be enforced if necessary by any court having jurisdiction. The
award may be confirmed in, and judgment upon the award entered by, any court
having jurisdiction.



(b) _Institutional Arbitration_. The arbitration shall be conducted in
accordance with the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the
International Chamber of Commerce.



(c)  _Number of Arbitrators_. If the amount in dispute involves less than 5
million, exclusive of interest and costs, then the arbitration shall be
conducted and finally settled by a sole arbitrator appointed by the
International Chamber of Commerce. If the amount in controversy, exclusive of
interest and costs, is 5 million or more, or if the amount in dispute is
unknown, or if relief other than damages is sought, then the arbitration shall
be conducted and finally settled by three (3) arbitrators appointed as
follows: (i) each party shall appoint an arbitrator, and the two arbitrators
so appointed shall appoint a third arbitrator who shall act as Chairman of the
tribunal; (ii) if either party fails to appoint an arbitrator within 30 days
of the receiving notice of the appointment of an arbitrator by the other
party, such arbitrator shall at the request of that party be appointed by the
Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce; and (iii) if
the two arbitrators to be appointed by the parties fail to agree upon a third
arbitrator within 30 days of the appointment of the second arbitrator, then
the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the Court of Arbitration of the
International Chamber of Commerce. For purposes of this Section 12.12,
Dresser and DEG shall be considered to be one party.



(d) _Place of Arbitration_. Unless otherwise agreed by all parties to the
arbitration, the site of the arbitration under this Agreement shall be Milan,
Italy.



(e)  _Language_. The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in the
English language.



(f) _Use of Courts_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided herein,
any Party may apply to a court (i) for interim measures of protection or pre-
award relief, and (ii) if and to the extent that any arbitral award rendered
in the arbitration proceedings is or would be unenforceable.



(g) _Notice_. All notices required for any arbitration proceeding shall be
deemed properly given if sent by first class mail and facsimile to the
parties at the addresses listed in Section 12.2 of this Agreement.



(h) _Interpretation of "Material Adverse Effect_ ". In resolving any dispute
regarding the meaning of the phrase "Material Adverse Effect" or in
determining whether a "Material Adverse Effect" has occurred or would occur,
the arbitrators (if such dispute is submitted to arbitration pursuant to
Section 12.12) and the Parties shall 



 

60 apply the principles outlined by the Delaware Court of Chancery in _IBP, Inc.
v. Tyson Foods, Inc_ , provided that neither (i) any adverse change resulting
from conditions affecting any nations economy generally, including such
conditions related to the Business, nor (ii) any adverse change resulting from
or relating to financial, banking or securities markets (including any
disruption thereof and the decline in the price of any security or any market
index) shall constitute a Material Adverse Effect.
