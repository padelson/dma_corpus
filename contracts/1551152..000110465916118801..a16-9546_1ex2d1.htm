(a) _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 2.3(a)), Merger Sub I
shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate corporate existence
of Merger Sub I shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be the Surviving
Company in the Merger (the " ** _Initial Surviving Company_** "), and the
separate corporate existence of the Company shall continue unaffected by the
Merger, except as set forth in Article IV. The Merger shall have the effects
specified in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all property, rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub I shall vest
in the Initial Surviving Company, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Sub I shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Initial Surviving Company.

 



 

(b) _The Subsequent Merger_. Immediately following the Merger, Parent shall
cause the Initial Surviving Company to be merged with and into Merger Sub II
(the " ** _Subsequent Merger_** ") and the separate corporate existence of the
Initial Surviving Company shall thereupon cease. Merger Sub II shall be the
surviving limited liability company in the Subsequent Merger (sometimes
hereinafter referred to as the " ** _Surviving Company_** "), and the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub II shall continue unaffected by the
Subsequent Merger, except as set forth in Article IV. The Subsequent Merger
shall have the effects specified in the DLLCA and the DGCL. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Subsequent
Effective Time (as defined in Section 2.3(b)), all property, rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Initial Surviving Company
and Merger Sub II shall vest in the Surviving Company, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Initial Surviving Company and Merger Sub II
shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company.

 



 

2.2 _Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the Company
and Parent, the closing for the Merger (the " ** _Closing_** ") shall take
place at the

 



      
 

 



 

offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad Street, New York, New York, at
9:00 A.M. (Eastern Time) on the date (the " ** _Closing Date_** ") that is the
second (2nd) Business Day following the day on which the last to be satisfied
or waived of the conditions set forth in Article VIII (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) shall be satisfied
or waived in accordance with this Agreement.

 



 

2.3 _Effective Time_.

 



 

(a) _The Merger_. As soon as practicable following the Closing, the parties
hereto shall cause a Certificate of Merger (the " ** _First Delaware
Certificate of Merger_** ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the
DGCL to effect the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the time when
the Delaware Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as may be agreed by the
parties in writing and specified in the First Delaware Certificate of Merger
(the " ** _Effective Time_** ").

 



 

(b) _The Subsequent Merger_. Immediately following the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause a Certificate of Merger (the " ** _Second Delaware Certificate of
Merger_** ") to be executed, acknowledged and duly filed by Merger Sub II with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in Section 18-209
of the DLLCA to effect the Subsequent Merger. The Subsequent Merger shall
become effective immediately following the Effective Time (the " **
_Subsequent Effective Time_** ") upon duly filing the Second Delaware
Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State on the Closing
Date.

 



 

2.4 _Tax Consequences_. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended
that the Merger and the Subsequent Merger be treated as a single integrated
transaction that will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code, and this Agreement is intended to be and is
adopted as a plan of reorganization for the purposes of Sections 354 and 361
of the Code.

ARTICLE V

 



 

 _Effects of the Merger_

 



 

5.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub
II, the Company or any holder of any Company Capital Stock:

 



 

(a) _Conversion of Company Capital Stock_. Each Company Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (1) Company
Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II or any other direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, or Company Shares owned by the
Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, and
in each case not held on behalf of third parties, and (2) Company Shares that
are owned by Stockholders (" ** _Dissenting Stockholders_** ") who have
properly made and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL or Chapter 13 of the CGCL (the Company Shares referred
to in clauses (1) and (2), the " ** _Excluded Shares_** ")) shall be converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration. At the Effective
Time, all of the Company Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a " **
_Certificate_** ") formerly representing any of the Company Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration, without interest. With respect to the Per Share
Closing Consideration component of the Per Share Merger Consideration, at the
election of each Stockholder in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 5.5(b), each Company Share shall represent the right to receive the
following:

 



 

(i) for each Company Share with respect to which the Standard Election has
been made (or deemed to have been made) and not been revoked pursuant to
Section 5.5(b), the Per Share Standard Election Consideration;

 



 

(ii) for each Company Share with respect to which the Cash Election has been
made and not been revoked pursuant to Section 5.5(b), the Per Share Cash
Election Consideration; or

 



 

(iii) for each Company Share with respect to which the Stock Election has been
made and not been revoked pursuant to Section 5.5(b), the Per Share Stock
Election Consideration.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of such Excluded
Share, cease to be outstanding, be cancelled without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist, subject to any rights the
holder thereof may have under Section 5.5(g).

 



 

(c) _Merger Sub I Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, each share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub I issued and outstanding

 



      
 

 



 

immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Initial Surviving Company.
From and after the Effective Time, any and all certificates representing the
common stock of Merger Sub I shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the
number of shares of common stock of the Initial Surviving Company into which
they were converted in accordance with the preceding sentence.

 



 

(d) _Merger Sub II LLC Interests_. At the Subsequent Effective Time, each
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Initial Surviving
Company issued and outstanding immediately following the Effective Time shall
be cancelled and cease to exist and no consideration shall be paid or payable
in respect thereof, and (ii) each limited liability company interest of Merger
Sub II shall be unaffected by the Subsequent Merger and shall remain
outstanding as a limited liability company interest in the Surviving Company.

 



 

(e) _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class of shares by
reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, stock split,
reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event
shall have occurred (other than in connection with the Merger), then the
Aggregate Stock Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, without
duplication, to proportionally reflect such change; _provided_ that nothing in
this Section 5.1(e) shall be construed to permit Parent to take any of the
foregoing actions with respect to the Parent Common Stock to the extent
otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement, including Section 7.1(c).

 



 

(f) _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued
to the holders of Company Shares in connection with the Merger and any such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock. Parent shall
pay to each Holder of Company Shares converted pursuant to the Merger who
would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock (after aggregating all shares represented by the Certificates
delivered by such holder), in lieu thereof and upon surrender thereof, an
amount in cash (without interest) equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(i) the fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all Company Shares held by
such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time) by (ii) the Parent
Trading Price (the " ** _Fractional Share Cash Amount_** ").

 



 

5.2 _Treatment of Company Options and Warrants_.

 



 

(a) _Company Options_.

 



      
 

 



 

(i) _One Year Accelerated Vesting_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
the vesting schedule applicable to each Company Option that is outstanding and
unexercised and not vested shall be adjusted so that each vesting date that is
scheduled to occur on or after the Effective Time shall accelerate by one year
(the " ** _One Year Accelerated Vesting_** ").

 



 

(ii) _Vested Company Options_. At the Effective Time, each Company Option that
is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time and
that is vested as of the Effective Time (after application of the One Year
Accelerated Vesting and any vesting acceleration provisions set forth in the
terms of such Company Option, if any) (each, a " ** _Vested Company Option_**
") shall be cancelled and terminated at the Effective Time and the holder
thereof shall be entitled, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder
with respect thereto, to receive with respect to each share of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Option an amount in cash equal to the Per
Company Option Merger Consideration. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in
any event within three (3) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall cause the
Surviving Company or its designee to pay to each holder of Vested Company
Options a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the aggregate
Per Company Option Closing Payments payable with respect to the Vested Company
Options held by such Holder through the payroll system of the Surviving
Company. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company, its designee or
the Paying Agent to, deliver the applicable portion of each Future Payment to
each such Holder in accordance with Section 5.5(a).

 



 

(iii) _Unvested Company Options_.

 



 

(A) At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is not vested as
of the Effective Time (after application of the One Year Accelerated Vesting
and any vesting acceleration provisions set forth in the terms of such Company
Option, if any) (each, an " ** _Unvested Company Option_** ") shall,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease
to represent an option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock and shall be
converted into an option to purchase a number of shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (x) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Unvested Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the Option Conversion
Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent)
equal to (1) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of such
Unvested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, _divided_ by
(2) the Option Conversion Ratio; _provided_ , _however_ , that the exercise
price and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable pursuant to
the Unvested Company Options shall be determined in accordance with the
foregoing, subject to such adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy
the requirements of Section 409A of the Code; _provided_ , _further_ , that in
the case of any Unvested Company Option to which Section 422 of the Code
applies, if any, the exercise price and the

 



      
 

 



 

number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable pursuant to such option
shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing, subject to such
adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of Section
424(a) of the Code. Except as specifically provided above, following the
Effective Time, each Unvested Company Option shall continue to be governed by
the same terms (including vesting and exercisability terms) as were applicable
to such Unvested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time,
except to the extent such terms are rendered inoperative by reason of the
Merger; _provided_ that each Unvested Company Option shall vest in full on a
termination of the Holders employment (x) involuntarily by the Holders
employer without "Cause" (as such term is defined in Section 5.2(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter), (y) voluntarily by the Holder for "Good Reason"
(as such term is defined in Section 5.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter)
or (z) due to the Holders death or by the Holders employer due to
disability, on or after the Effective Time (the " ** _Double Trigger
Vesting_** ").

 



 

(B) Following the Effective Time, each holder of an Unvested Company Option
(as converted in accordance with Section 5.2(a)(iii)(A)) shall be entitled,
subject to such Unvested Company Option vesting, to receive with respect to
each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Unvested Company Option an
amount in cash equal to (i) each Per Share Milestone Payment, _plus_ (ii) the
Per Share Holdback Distribution Amount, _plus_ (iii) each Per Share Escrow
Release Amount, in each case in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
If an Unvested Company Option is cancelled or forfeited prior to vesting, then
the portion of each of (i) each Per Share Milestone Payment, (ii) the Per
Share Holdback Distribution Amount, and (iii) each Per Share Escrow Release
Amount that is attributable to such Unvested Company Option will be
reallocated among the Holders in accordance with this Agreement.

 



 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
payment of any portion of the Per Company Option Merger Consideration will be
paid with respect to a Company Option after the later of (x) the fifth (5th)
anniversary of the Effective Time and (y) the latest time that payment of such
amounts would not result in a tax on the Holder thereof under Section 409A of
the Code. Any payment of the Per Company Option Merger Consideration with
respect to Company Options that is paid after the later of (x) the fifth (5th)
anniversary of the Effective Time and (y) the latest time that payment of such
amounts would not result in a tax on the Holder thereof under Section 409A of
the Code will be reallocated to holders of Company Shares in accordance with
their Pro Rata Share of such amounts (calculated excluding such Company
Options).

 



 

(b) _Exercise of Warrants_. The Company shall take or cause to be taken all
action necessary to cause, immediately prior to the Effective Time, the
exercise of the unexercised portion, if any, of the Warrants in accordance
with their respective terms. For the avoidance of doubt, at the Effective
Time, each Company Common Share

 



      
 

 



 

and share of Series B Preferred Stock issued pursuant to the exercise of the
Warrants and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
treated as Company Shares in accordance with Section 5.1(a). The Company will
comply with that certain agreement listed as Item 10 on Section 6.1(b)(i)
(Part A) of the Company Disclosure Letter and such compliance shall be
reflected appropriately in the Spreadsheet.

 



 

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the board of directors of
the Company or any duly authorized committee thereof shall adopt any
resolutions and take any corporate or other action necessary to effectuate the
provisions of Sections 5.2(a) and 5.2(b).

 



 

5.3 _Milestone Payments_.

 



 

(a) If any of the following events shall occur (each a " ** _Milestone_** "),
Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, pursuant to Section 5.3(f) and Section
5.5, the corresponding milestone payment set forth in this Section 5.3(a)
(each a " ** _Milestone Payment_** "):

Alternate Therapeutic Milestone Product and all Related Alternate Therapeutic
Milestone Products with respect thereto (the " ** _Estimated Forecast
Statement_** ") or (ii) a statement, signed on behalf of Parent by an
authorized officer, that the forecast worldwide peak annual Net Trade Sales of
such Alternate Therapeutic Milestone Product and all Related Alternate

 



       
 

 



 

 **CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT**

 

 **[***] Indicates that text has been omitted which is the subject of a
confidential**

 

 **treatment request. This text has been seperately filed with the SEC.**

 



 

Therapeutic Milestone Products with respect thereto would exceed
$1,000,000,000 (a " ** _Stipulation Statement_** "). Any such Estimated
Forecast Statement shall (i) set forth in reasonable detail the forecast
worldwide peak annual Net Trade Sales of such Alternate Therapeutic Milestone
Product and all Related Alternate Therapeutic Milestone Products with respect
thereto and (ii) include supporting detail with respect to the material
assumptions, analysis, figures and calculations underlying the forecast
worldwide peak annual Net Trade Sales of such Alternate Therapeutic Milestone
Product and all Related Alternate Therapeutic Milestone Products with respect
thereto. Parents good faith estimate of the forecast worldwide peak annual
Net Trade Sales of such Alternate Therapeutic Milestone Product and all
Related Alternate Therapeutic Milestone Products with respect thereto shall be
calculated in a manner consistent with Parents (or the applicable Milestone
Partys) typical practices for such forecasts with respect to pharmaceutical
products having similar market potential as such Alternate Therapeutic
Milestone Product together with all Related Alternate Therapeutic Milestone
Products with respect thereto. [***]

 



 

If a Milestone Payment is due, such Milestone Payment shall be due within
thirty (30) days [***]

 



 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be obligated to deliver an
Estimated Forecast Statement with respect to the occurrence of POC Achievement
with respect to any Alternate Therapeutic Milestone Product if such Alternate
Therapeutic Milestone Product or any Related Alternate Therapeutic Milestone
Product with respect thereto has previously triggered the achievement of any
of the Milestones in clauses (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) of Section 5.3(a) and
the payment of the corresponding Milestone Payment, respectively.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
(1) the Milestones set forth in clauses (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) of Section
5.3(a) with respect to an Alternate Therapeutic Milestone Product would have
been achieved but for the fact that the forecast worldwide peak annual Net
Trade Sales of any Alternate Therapeutic Milestone Product and all Related
Alternate Therapeutic Milestone Products with respect thereto [***]
not to exceed $1,000,000,000 at the time such Milestone would have been
triggered, and (2) at any time, whether on, prior to or following December 31,
2022, the actual worldwide peak annual Net Trade Sales of such Alternate
Therapeutic Milestone Product and all Related Alternate Therapeutic Milestone
Products with respect thereto exceed $1,000,000,000, then the Milestone with
respect to such Alternate Therapeutic Milestone Product shall be deemed to
have been achieved and the Milestone Payment with respect to such Milestone
shall be due within thirty (30) days following the date on which the worldwide
peak annual Net Trade Sales exceeded $1,000,000,000.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Each Milestone Payment payable to the Holders (together with any Milestone
Interest in respect of late Milestone Payments due and payable in accordance
with Section 7.13(b)) shall be delivered by Parent or its designee on each
Future Payment Date to the Paying Agent on behalf of and for further
distribution to the Holders in accordance with Section 5.5 and the
Spreadsheet.

 



 

(f) The right of the Holders to receive the Milestone Payments (i) is solely a
contractual right and will not be evidenced by a certificate or other
instrument, (ii) may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, encumbered
or in any other manner transferred or disposed of, in whole or in part, other
than through a Permitted Transfer, (iii) does not represent any equity or
ownership interest in Parent or in any constituent company to the Mergers or
any of their respective Affiliates, and (iv) does not give the Holders any
right to receive interest payments (except for Milestone Interest in respect
of late Milestone Payments as set forth in Section 7.13(b)).

 



 

(g) The right of any Holder to receive any or all Milestone Payments may be
waived by such Holder by means of a written waiver instrument (a " **
_Milestone Share Waiver_** ") executed by such Holder (any such Holder, a " **
_Milestone Waiving Holder_** ") and delivered to the Stockholder
Representative. Additionally, the right of any holder of an Unvested Company
Option to receive any Milestone Payment in respect of such Unvested Company
Option will be contingent upon, and such Milestone Payments payable in respect
of an Unvested Company Option shall be held by the Parent or its designee
until, vesting of such Unvested Company Option. On the date on which such
Unvested Company Option vests, any previously earned Milestone Payments shall
be paid by Parent to, or delivered by Parent to the Surviving Company, its
designee or the Paying Agent on behalf of and for further distribution to, the
holder of such Unvested Company Option in accordance with Section 5.5 and the
Spreadsheet. If an Unvested Company Option is cancelled or forfeited prior to
vesting, then the holder thereof (the " ** _Milestone Forfeiting Holder_** ")
will not be entitled to any Milestone Payments in respect of such Unvested
Company Option (the " ** _Milestone Option Forfeiture_** "). Upon the receipt
of any Milestone Share Waiver, and in the event of a Milestone Option
Forfeiture, the Stockholder Representative shall equitably apportion the
Milestone Waiving Holders and/or Milestone Forfeiting Holders Fully Diluted
Share of the Milestone Payments, if any, covered by such Milestone Share
Waiver or Milestone Option Forfeiture, as applicable, among all Holders then
entitled to a portion of the Milestone Payments, ratably in accordance with
their respective Fully Diluted Shares, and the Holder Representative shall
amend the Spreadsheet in accordance with Section 5.5(a) to effect such
apportionment. Any Milestone Payments held by Parent or its designee on behalf
of an Unvested Company Option that is later equitably apportioned in
accordance with this Section 5.3(g) shall be paid on the next Future Payment
Date in accordance with Section 5.3(e) or, if there is no Future Payment Date,
shall be delivered by Parent or its designee as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Milestone Option Forfeiture to the Paying Agent on behalf of and
for further distribution to the Holders in accordance with Section 5.3 and the
Spreadsheet. The Stockholder Representative shall furnish to any Milestone
Waiving Holder such documentation as

 



      
 

 



 

 **CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT**

 

 **[***] Indicates that text has been omitted which is the subject of a

 **treatment request. This text has been seperately filed with the SEC.**

 



 

such Milestone Waiving Holder may reasonably request to evidence such waiver
for Tax and accounting purposes.

 



 

(h) The Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the Holders) acknowledges and
agrees that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, there
is no assurance that any Milestone will be achieved or that the Holders will
receive any Milestone Payment. For clarity, this Section 5.3(h) does not
constitute a waiver of Parents obligations under Section 7.13(d).

5.4 _Stockholder Representative Expenses Holdback Amount; Escrow Amount_.

 



 

(a) _Stockholder Representative Expenses Holdback Amount_. On the Closing
Date, on behalf of the Holders, Parent shall withhold from the Aggregate Cash
Merger Consideration otherwise payable to the Holders and pay to the
Stockholder Representative, on behalf of the Holders, an amount in cash equal
to the Stockholder Representative Expenses Holdback Amount, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account specified by the Stockholder
Representative in writing no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, to be held and used by the Stockholder Representative pursuant
to the terms of Section 11.4. The portion of the Stockholder Representative
Expenses Holdback Amount deposited on behalf of each Holder shall be equal to
such Holders Pro Rata Share of the Stockholder Representative Expenses
Holdback Amount.

 



 

(b) _Escrow Amount_. On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent, the Stockholder
Representative and the Escrow Agent shall enter into the Escrow Agreement. On
the Closing Date, (i) the Company shall deliver to the Escrow Agent an amount
equal to (A) all cash on hand of the Company as of the Closing Date _minus_
(B) the Company Transaction Expenses and (ii) Parent shall pay to the Escrow
Agent the Escrow Fund Shortfall Amount, if any. The amounts paid to the Escrow
Agent pursuant to this Section 5.4(b) shall be maintained and disbursed as
provided in Article IX and the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Amount shall
constitute security for the indemnification obligations provided for in
Article IX and shall be held and distributed in accordance with the provisions
of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The portion of the Escrow Amount
deemed hereunder to be deposited on behalf of each Holder shall be equal to
such Holders Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Amount. Parent shall pay all fees
and expenses of the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

5.5 _Exchange Procedures_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. The Person referred to in Section 5.5(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, or another nationally recognized paying agent selected by

 



      
 

 



 

the Company, shall act as the paying and exchange agent (the " ** _Paying
Agent_** ") in the Merger. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent, the Company and
the Stockholder Representative shall enter into an agreement with the Paying
Agent (the " ** _Paying Agent Agreement_** ") which shall have customary terms
and shall provide that, (i) on the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit with the
Paying Agent, for the benefit of and payment to the Stockholders, the Closing
Payment Fund, and (ii) on each Future Payment Date, Parent or the Escrow
Agent, as applicable, shall deposit with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of
and payment to the Holders, an amount in cash equal to such Future Payment
payable to the Holders in accordance with this Agreement, including each
Milestone Payment due and payable pursuant to Section 5.3(a), (each such
deposit, a " ** _Future Payment Fund_** " and, together with the Closing
Payment Fund, the " ** _Payment Funds_** ") by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account specified by the Paying Agent in writing no
later than two (2) Business Days prior to each Future Payment Date. The Paying
Agent Agreement shall provide that the Payment Funds shall be held and
disbursed by the Paying Agent, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to hold
and disburse the Payment Funds, in accordance with this Section 5.5 and the
Spreadsheet. The Paying Agent shall hold the Payment Funds in segregated
accounts on behalf of the Holders and use the Closing Payment Fund and each
Future Payment Fund for the sole purpose of delivery of the Per Share Closing
Consideration to the Stockholders and the delivery of the applicable portion
of each Future Payment, if any, to the Holders, respectively, in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement. At the election of any Holder who is to
receive in excess of $1,000,000 in connection with the transactions by this
Section 5.5, the Paying Agent shall make any cash payment in excess of
$1,000,000 by wire transfer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, from and after the Effective Time, the
Spreadsheet may be amended by a written statement delivered by the Stockholder
Representative to the Paying Agent, Parent and the Surviving Company. Parent,
the Surviving Company and the Paying Agent shall cooperate to implement
procedures to effect any required withholding of Taxes with respect to any
payments specified to be made through the Paying Agent to former holders of
Company Options.

 



 

(b) _Election Procedures_. Each Holder of Company Shares as of the date of
this Agreement shall have the right, subject to the limitations set forth in
this Section 5.5(b), to submit an election with respect to the form of such
Stockholders Per Share Closing Consideration (each, an " ** _Election_** ")
in accordance with the following procedures:

 



 

(i) Promptly following the delivery of the Information Statement to the
Holders, the Paying Agent shall mail a form of election (an " ** _Election
Form_** "), such Election Form to be in such form and have such provisions as
Parent and the Company reasonably agree, to each Stockholder as of the date of
this Agreement.

 



 

(ii) Each Stockholder shall specify in its Election Form submitted in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.5(b) whether such Stockholder
elects to receive, with respect to each Company Share held by such
Stockholder, (A) the Per Share Standard Election Consideration (such Election,
the " ** _Standard Election_** "), (B) the Per

 



      
 

 



 

Share Cash Election Consideration (such Election, the " ** _Cash Election_**
"), or (C) the Per Share Stock Election Consideration (such Election, the " **
_Stock Election_** ").

 



 

(iii) To be effective, an Election Form must be properly completed, duly
executed and submitted to the Paying Agent no later than 5:00 P.M. (Eastern
Time) on the date that is two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date
(which date shall be announced by the Company to the Holders as soon as
practicable, but in no event less than five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date) (the " ** _Election Deadline_** "). Any Stockholder who does not
properly make an Election in accordance with the provisions of this Section
5.5(b), or whose Election Form is not received by the Paying Agent prior to
the Election Deadline in the manner provided in this Section 5.5(b)(iii),
shall be deemed to have made the Standard Election with respect to its Company
Shares.

 



 

(iv) Any Stockholder may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline, change
or revoke such Stockholders Election by written notice received by the Paying
Agent prior to the Election Deadline, accompanied by a properly completed and
duly executed revised Election Form. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, all Elections shall be automatically deemed to be
revoked upon a valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article
X.

 



 

(v) Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Paying Agent Agreement, the
Paying Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine if any Election is
not properly made by a Stockholder with respect to any Company Shares. In the
event that the Paying Agent makes the foregoing determination, such Election
shall be deemed to be of no force or effect and the Company Shares covered by
such Election shall be deemed to have made a Standard Election unless a proper
Election is thereafter made with respect to such Company Shares prior to the
Election Deadline.

 



 

(vi) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3)
Business Days thereafter), the Paying Agent shall effect the allocation of the
aggregate Per Share Closing Consideration among the Holders of Company Shares
(other than Excluded Shares) as set forth in Section 5.1(a), which allocation
shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the Stockholders absent manifest
error. For the avoidance of doubt, the aggregate amount of cash to be paid and
the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued to the
Stockholders in respect of the aggregate Per Share Closing Consideration shall
not exceed the aggregate amounts that would have been paid and issued to all
Holders of Company Shares (other than Excluded Shares) had the Standard
Election been made with respect to all Company Shares.

 



 

(vii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject
to Section 5.5(b)(viii), each Stockholder who is not an Accredited Investor
shall be deemed to have made a Cash Election with respect to each Company
Share held by such Stockholder and such Company Shares shall not be subject to
proration pursuant to this Agreement. Any Stockholder who does not complete,
sign and deliver the accredited

 



      
 

 



 

investor questionnaire distributed with the Information Statement shall be
deemed to be a non-Accredited Investor.

 



 

(viii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
(i) in no event shall the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to
be issued to the holders of Company Shares exceed the number set forth in
clause (i) of the definition of "Aggregate Stock Merger Consideration" and
(ii) a Stockholder may be deemed to have made a Stock Election or a Standard
Election to the extent necessary for the Merger and the Subsequent Merger to
qualify for and maintain the tax treatment described in Section 2.4.

 



 

(c) _Exchange Procedures_.

 



 

(i) _Letter of Transmittal_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any
event within three (3) Business Days thereafter), the Paying Agent shall mail
to each holder of record of Company Shares as of the Effective Time (other
than holders of Excluded Shares): (A) a letter of transmittal in customary
form specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in Section 5.5(f))
to the Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in such form and have
such other provisions as Parent and the Company reasonably agree, and (B)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in Section 5.5(f))
in exchange for the Per Share Closing Consideration and the right to receive
the applicable portion of each Future Payment, if any and when due and payable
in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

(ii) _Surrender of Certificates_. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section 5.5(f)) to
the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of the letter of transmittal,
duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the aggregate Per Share Closing Consideration (including, if
applicable, the Fractional Share Cash Amount) and the right to receive the
applicable portion of each Future Payment, if any and when due and payable in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, in each
case with respect to the number of Company Shares represented by such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in
Section 5.5(f)), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon the
surrender of any Certificate.

 



 

(iii) _Future Payments_. With respect to each Future Payment, if any and when
due and payable in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the Paying Agent shall pay to each Holder promptly after each
Future Payment Date (and in any event within three (3) Business Days
thereafter) a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the
applicable portion of such Future Payment payable to the Holder in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Company Shares or
other equity securities of the Company that were outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate or other
instrument representing Company Shares or other equity securities of the
Company is presented to the Surviving Company, Parent or the Paying Agent for
transfer, it shall (subject to compliance with the exchange procedures of
Section 5.5(b)) be cancelled and exchanged for the amount to which the Holder
thereof is entitled pursuant to this Article V. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of
the Company, the aggregate Per Share Closing Consideration to be exchanged
upon due surrender of the Certificate or instrument may be issued to such
transferee if the Certificate or other instrument formerly representing such
Company Shares is properly presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all
documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and to
reasonably evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or
are not applicable.

 



 

(e) _Termination of Payment Funds_. Any portion of the Closing Payment Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments of the Closing Payment Fund) that
remains unclaimed by the Stockholders for twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Company. Any portion of a
Future Payment Fund (including the proceeds of any reinvestment of such Future
Payment Fund) with respect to a Future Payment that remains unclaimed by the
Holders for twelve (12) months after the Future Payment Date for each such
Future Payment shall be delivered to the Surviving Company. Any holder of
Company Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied
with this Section 5.5 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Company for
payment of the Per Share Closing Consideration and to Parent for the
applicable portion of any Future Payments, if any and when due and payable in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, upon due
surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates), without any interest thereon. Any holder of Company Options who
has not theretofore received its applicable portion of Future Payments, if any
and when due and payable in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement, in accordance with Section 5.2(a) and this Section 5.5,
shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of such Future Payments.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Company, Parent, Paying
Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former Holder or holder of
Warrants for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

 



 

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of
a bond in customary amount and on such terms as may be reasonably required by
the Paying Agent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or
the Surviving Company with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will
issue a check in an aggregate amount equal to (i) the number of

 



      
 

 



 

Company Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
_multiplied_ by the Per Share Closing Consideration, _plus_ (ii) the
applicable portion of each Future Payment, if any, then due and payable to
such Person in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

 



 

(g) _Appraisal Rights_. No Person who properly demands appraisal of such
Persons Company Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or, to the extent
applicable, Chapter 13 of the CGCL shall be entitled to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration with respect to the Company Shares owned by such Person
unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn or otherwise
lost such Persons right to appraisal under the DGCL or CGCL, as applicable.
Each Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive only the payment
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL or Chapter 13 of the CGCL, as applicable,
with respect to Company Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. If, after
the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws
or loses such right, such Excluded Shares shall thereupon be treated as if
they had been converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration, and the Surviving Company shall remain liable for payment of
the Per Share Merger Consideration for such Company Shares; _provided_ that
such holder shall be deemed to have made a Cash Election with respect to the
Per Share Closing Consideration in accordance with Section 5.5(c). The Company
shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal,
attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served
pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the Company relating to
stockholders rights of appraisal, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in
and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal under the DGCL or CGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), voluntarily make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve
any withdrawal of any such demands.

 



 

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Paying Agent, the Surviving
Company and the Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement,
including any Future Payment and any Per Company Option Closing Payment, to
any Holder such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations
thereunder, or any other applicable provision of any Law relating to Taxes. To
the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld, such deducted or
withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by the deducting or withholding Person
to the applicable Governmental Entity as required pursuant to applicable Law,
and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Holders in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

 



 

(i) _No Interest_. No interest shall accumulate on any cash or stock payable
in connection with the Merger (other than interest accrued on the Escrow
Account pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and Milestone Interest in respect of
late Milestone Payments as set forth in Section 7.13(c)).

 



       
 

 



 

(j) _Limitation on Cash Consideration Payable_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, if the Threshold Percentage (determined, as of
the Effective Time, without regard to this sentence) is less than 40.1%, then
(x) the amount set forth in clause (i) of the definition of "Aggregate Cash
Merger Consideration" shall be deemed reduced by a sufficient amount (the " **
_Cash Reallocation Amount_** ") and (y) the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock set forth in clause (i) of the definition of "Aggregate Stock Merger
Consideration" shall be increased by a number of shares equal to the Cash
Reallocation Amount divided by the Parent Stock Price, such that the Threshold
Percentage, calculated after giving effect to such adjustments will be equal
to 40.1%.

 



 

5.6 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. The provisions of this Article V are intended
to be for the benefit of, and, following the Effective Time they shall be
enforceable against, Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II and the Surviving
Company only by, the Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Holders, who
are intended third party beneficiaries thereof. The covenants and obligations
of the Stockholder Representative in this Article V are intended to be for the
benefit of, and, following the Effective Time may be enforced against, the
Stockholder Representative by the Holders, who are intended third party
beneficiaries thereof.

 _Representations and Warranties_

 



 

6.1 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as set forth in
the corresponding sections or subsections of the disclosure letter delivered
to Parent by the Company immediately prior to entering into this Agreement
(the " ** _Company Disclosure Letter_** ") (it being agreed that disclosure of
any item or matter in any section or subsection of the Company Disclosure
Letter shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section or
subsection of this Agreement to which the relevance of such item or matter is
reasonably apparent), the Company  but no other Person whatsoever  hereby

standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization. The Subsidiary of
the Company is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization, except where the
failure to be so organized, validly existing and in good standing would not,

requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted
and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign

or similar entity in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or
operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so organized, validly existing,
qualified, or where relevant, in good standing, or to have such power or
authority, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to
Parent complete and correct copies of the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of the Company and its
Subsidiary, each as amended to the date of this Agreement, and each as so
delivered is in full force and effect.

Agreement, there are no preemptive or other outstanding rights, options,
restricted stock, phantom stock rights, warrants, conversion rights, stock
appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements,
arrangements, calls, commitments or rights of any kind that obligate the
Company to issue or sell any shares of capital stock or other securities of

(e) _SEC Reports and Financial Statements_.

 



 

(i) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed or furnished all
forms, documents and reports required to be filed or furnished by it with the
SEC since January 1, 2014 (all such documents and reports filed or furnished
by Parent or any

 



      
 

 



 

of its Subsidiaries, the " ** _Parent SEC Documents_** "). As of their
respective dates or, if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment
(and, in the case of registration statements and proxy statements, on the
dates of effectiveness and the dates of the relevant meetings, respectively),
the Parent SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002, as amended (the " ** _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_** "), as the case may
be, and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and none
of the Parent SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact
or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

 



 

(ii) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules) of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents (w) present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Parent and
its consolidated results of operations for the fiscal periods then ended, (x)
were prepared in conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto),
(y) comply in all material respects with the applicable accounting
requirements and with the rules and regulations of the Exchange Act, the
Securities Act and the SEC and (z) have been prepared from, and are in
accordance with, the books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries. The
books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being,
maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other
applicable legal and accounting requirements.

Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(iv) Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in
paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act)
as required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-5 under the Exchange Act. Parents
disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all
material information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it
files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded and reported within the
time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
material information is accumulated and communicated to Parents management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Based on its most recent evaluation of internal controls
over financial reporting prior to the date of this Agreement, Parents
principal executive officer and principal financial officer have disclosed to
Parents auditors and the audit committee of Parents

 



      
 

 



 

board of directors (x) all known significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material
respect Parents ability to report financial information and (y) any known
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in Parents internal control over financial
reporting.

 



 

(f) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since the Balance Sheet Date, there has been
no change, event or condition that has resulted in, or would reasonably be
expected to result in, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(g) _Litigation_. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (i) to the
Knowledge of Parent, there is no investigation or review pending or threatened
by any Governmental Entity with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
and (ii) there are no civil or criminal actions, suits, claims, hearings,
investigations or proceedings pending (or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened) against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to any
Parent Benefit Plans or any fiduciaries of any Parent Benefit Plans in their
capacity as such. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or
subject to the provisions of any material judgment, order, writ, injunction,
decree or award of any Governmental Entity which would reasonably be expected
to, individually or in the aggregate, (x) have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, or (y) prevent or materially delay the ability of Parent to consummate
the Merger, the Subsequent Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 



 

(h) _Compliance with Laws_. Except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect,

in compliance with all applicable Laws.

 



 

(i) _Regulatory Matters_. Except as would not, individually or in the

(j) _Interested Stockholder_. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
(including Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II) (i) owns, or at any time during the

obligations under this Agreement and to cause Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II
to perform its obligations under this Agreement. Parent will have at or prior
to the Closing, sufficient funds to pay the Aggregate Merger Consideration and
all other payments

 



      
 

 



 

contemplated by this Agreement to be paid at the Closing and to perform the
other obligations of Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II contemplated by
this Agreement to be effected at the Closing. Parent will have, as of the date
any other amounts become payable by Parent pursuant to this Agreement,
sufficient funds to pay such amounts. None of Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger
Sub II has incurred any financial obligation, commitment, restriction or
liability of any kind that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of
Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II to consummate the Merger, the Subsequent
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(l) _Capitalization of Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II_. The authorized capital
stock of Merger Sub I consists solely of 1,000 shares of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, all of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of
the issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub I, and all of the
issued and outstanding membership interests of Merger Sub II, are, and at the
Effective Time and the Subsequent Effective Time will be, owned by Parent or a
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. Neither Merger Sub I nor
Merger Sub II has conducted any business prior to the date of this Agreement
or has, or prior to the Effective Time will have, assets, liabilities or
obligations of any nature other than those incident to its formation and
pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger, the Subsequent Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. All of the outstanding shares of
capital stock Merger Sub I and limited liability company interests of Merger
Sub II have been duly authorized and validly issued, and are fully paid and
non-assessable.

 



 

(m) _Information Supplied_. The information relating to Parent and its
Affiliates to be supplied by or on behalf of Parent to the Company for
inclusion in the Information Statement will not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they are made, not misleading. The Information
Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with any applicable
provisions of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.2(m), no
representation or warranty is made by Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II
with respect to information or statements made or incorporated by reference in
the Information Statement based upon information supplied by the Company or
any of its Representatives expressly for use or incorporation by reference
therein.

 



 

(n) _Reorganization_. Parent has not taken any action and is not aware of any
fact or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger
and the Subsequent Merger from being treated as a single integrated
transaction that will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code.

 



 

(o) _No Other Representations_. Except for the representations and warranties
contained in this Section 6.2, none of Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II
or any other Person makes any other express or implied representation or
warranty

 



      
 

 



 

(including any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular
purpose) with respect to Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Parent disclaims any other
representations or warranties, whether made by Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger

or advice that may have been or may be provided to the Company by any
director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or other Representative of
Parent or any of its Affiliates, or any other Person). Parent makes no
representations or warranties to the Company regarding any projection or
forecast regarding future results of operations or profitability of Parent,
Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II.

and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent,
Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II have relied solely upon the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in Section 6.1 (as modified by the Company
Disclosure Letter) (and acknowledge that such representations and warranties

shall (i) within ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing, disclose to
Parent its calculations with respect to the excess parachute payments, along
with the assumptions used to make the calculations and the data necessary for
Parent to confirm the accuracy of the calculations, (ii) to the extent not
already obtained, promptly seek the consent of the recipient of any such
payment that would otherwise be due and owing that such payment shall not be
due and owing, paid or retained, absent 280G Stockholder Approval (as defined
below), and (iii) promptly (and in any case prior to the Effective Time) cause
all such payments to be adequately disclosed to, and obtain the vote (whether
of approval or disapproval) and use commercially reasonable efforts to have
all such payments approved by a vote of, the stockholders of the Company
meeting the requirements of the Code and the applicable treasury regulations
(" ** _280G Stockholder Approval_** "). Parent shall have the right to review
and comment on any disclosure required by clause (iii) before such disclosure
is made. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.2, if
an excess parachute payment resulting from (x) any accelerated vesting of
Company Options, (y) the exercise of a Warrant to purchase Company Common
Shares or (z) the lapse of restrictions applicable to any Company Common
Shares is waived in accordance with clause (ii) of the first sentence of this
Section 7.2(h), and 280G Stockholder Approval of such payment is not obtained,
then such accelerated vesting, exercise or lapse of restrictions, as
applicable, will not apply. Any Company Option that does not vest as a result
of this Section 7.2(h) will be an Unvested Company Option and will be subject
to the terms of Section 5.2(a)(iii); _provided_ that such Company Option will
not be entitled to the Double Trigger Vesting. Any Warrant to purchase Company
Common Shares that is not exercised as a result of this Section 7.2(h) will be
converted at the Effective Time into a warrant to purchase Parent Common Stock
in accordance with the terms set forth in Section 5.2(a)(iii); _provided_ that
such Warrant will not be entitled to the Double

 



      
 

 



 

Trigger Vesting. Any Warrant to purchase Company Common Shares that is
converted at the Effective Time will be treated for purposes of this Agreement
(including for purposes of the Milestone Payments, Holdback Distribution
Amount and the Escrow Release Amount) in a manner consistent with an Unvested
Company Option. Any Company Common Share that remains subject to restrictions
as a result of this Section 7.2(h) will be converted at the Effective Time
into a Parent Common Share in accordance with the terms set forth in Section
5.2(a)(iii); _provided_ that such Company Common Share will not be entitled to
the Double Trigger Vesting. Any Company Common Share that is converted at the
Effective Time will be treated for purposes of this Agreement (including for
purposes of the Milestone Payments, the Holdback Distribution Amount and the
Escrow Release Amount) in a manner consistent with an Unvested Company Option.

 



 

7.3 _Access and Information_.

 



 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, subject to
applicable Law and any reasonable rules, regulations and policies maintained
by each of Parent and the Company, upon reasonable advance notice, each of
Parent and the Company shall (and shall cause each of their respective
Subsidiaries to) afford the other partys officers and other authorized
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours, under the
supervision of designated personnel or Representatives and in such a manner as
to not interfere with the operations of the other party or any of its
Subsidiaries, to any employees, properties, books, contracts, documents and
records reasonably requested by the other party, _provided_ that no
investigation pursuant to this Section 7.3(a) shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty made by Parent or the Company herein,
and _provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing shall not require either
Parent or the Company (i) to permit any inspection, or to disclose any
information, that in the reasonable judgment of Parent or the Company, as
applicable, would result in the disclosure of any Trade Secrets and Know-How
of third parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to
confidentiality if the withholding party shall have used commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such
inspection or disclosure or (ii) to disclose any privileged information of
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries. All requests for
information made pursuant to this Section 7.3(a) shall be directed to the
executive officer or other Person designated by Parent or the Company, as
applicable, and neither Parent nor the Company shall directly or indirectly
contact any officer, director, employee, agent or representative of the other
party or any of its Subsidiaries without the prior approval of such designated
Person. In an effort to prevent any interference or disruption caused by such
access, each of Parent and the Company may, in their sole discretion,
reasonably limit the number of individuals having access to, and the number of
visits to, their respective facilities. All such information shall be governed
by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

(b) For a period of six (6) years following the Closing Date, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Company to, retain all material books,
Contracts, documents and records of the Company and its Subsidiary pertaining
to all periods prior

 



      
 

 



 

to the Closing. From and after the Closing Date, subject to any applicable Law
and any reasonable rules, regulations and policies maintained by Parent, upon
reasonable advance notice, Parent shall (and shall cause the Surviving Company
to) afford the Stockholder Representative and any of its authorized
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours, under the
supervision of Parents designated personnel or Representatives and in such a
manner as to not interfere with the operations of Parent or the Surviving
Company, to any employees, properties, books, contracts, documents and records
reasonably requested by the Stockholder Representative (i) in response to the
request or at the direction of a Governmental Entity, (ii) in connection with
the preparation of Tax Returns or other documents related to Tax matters and
(iii) in connection with the determination of any matter relating to the
rights or obligations of any Person under this Agreement, the Voting
Agreement, and the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not
require Parent (x) to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information,
that in the reasonable judgment of Parent would result in the disclosure of
any Trade Secrets and Know-How of third parties or violate any of its
obligations with respect to confidentiality if Parent shall have used
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to
such inspection or disclosure or (y) to disclose any privileged information of
Parent or the Surviving Company.

 



 

7.4 _Publicity_. The initial press release regarding the Merger shall be a
joint press release and thereafter the Company and Parent shall consult with
each other prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise making public
announcements with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and prior to making any filings with any third
party and/or any Governmental Entity (including any national securities
exchange or interdealer quotation service) with respect thereto, except as may
be required by Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service or
by the request of any Governmental Entity; _provided_ , that neither the
Company nor Parent shall be required by this Section 7.4 to consult with the
other in the event of any dispute between the parties relating to this
Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company and Parent, and their
respective affiliates and Representatives, may make statements that are not
inconsistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made by Parent and the Company in compliance with this Section 7.4.

 



 

7.5 _Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) Parent agrees that:

 



 

(i) during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
second anniversary of the Effective Time, each employee of the Company and its
Subsidiary who continues to remain employed with the Company and its
Subsidiary at the Effective Time (a " ** _Continuing Employee_** ") will
continue to be provided with base salary or base wage that is no less
favorable than the greater of the base salary or base

 



      
 

 



 

wage provided by the Company or its Subsidiary, as applicable, to each such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time; and

 



 

(ii) during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
first anniversary of the Effective Time, each Continuing Employee will

are no less favorable than the target cash compensation opportunities provided
by the Company or its Subsidiary, as applicable, to each such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (B) benefits that are no
less favorable in the aggregate than the benefits provided by the Company or
its Subsidiary, as applicable, to each such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and (C) severance benefits that are no less
favorable than the severance benefits provided to such Continuing Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Company to, honor all employee benefit obligations to current and
former employees under the Company Benefit Plans.

 



 

(b) Parent will cause any Parent Benefit Plans which the Continuing Employees
of the Company and its Subsidiary are entitled to participate in after the
Effective Time to take into account for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting and accrual of paid time off and severance benefits
thereunder (except to the extent it would result in a duplication of
benefits), service by employees of the Company and its Subsidiary as if such
service were with Parent, to the same extent such service was credited under a
comparable plan of the Company. Notwithstanding any other statement in this
Section 7.5(b) or any other provision of this Agreement, service by employees
of the Company and its Subsidiary shall not be considered for purposes of
benefit accruals under any defined benefit plan or for purposes of qualifying
for subsidized early retirement benefits under any Parent Benefit Plan. In
addition, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that: (i) the Continuing Employees
are immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and
all plans providing benefits after the Effective Time to the extent coverage
under such plan is intended to replace coverage under a comparable plan in
which such Continuing Employees participated immediately before the Effective
Time, and (ii) all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements for purposes of each plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits are waived for such Continuing Employees
and their covered dependents, and that Continuing Employees and their
dependents receive credit for expenses incurred under a Company Benefit Plan
during the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of
satisfying any applicable deductible, co-insurance and out-of-pocket
requirements under any welfare benefit plans that such Continuing Employees
(and, as applicable, their covered dependents) are eligible to participate in
after the Effective Time as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such plans.

 



 

(c) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to, honor all
individual bonus and performance incentive bonus agreements between the
Company and each Continuing Employee for the calendar year 2016, as listed on
Section 6.1(h) of the

 



      
 

 



 

Company Disclosure Letter to the extent that such agreements remain in effect
as of the Effective Time. True and complete copies of all agreements listed in
Section 6.1(h) of the Company Disclosure Letter, including all amendments,
have been made available to Parent.

 



 

(d) For purposes of this Section 7.5, compensation and benefits provided by
Execustaff HR, Inc. on behalf of the Company shall be treated as provided by
the Company.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall (i) be an
amendment of any particular Company Benefit Plan, (ii) give any third party
any right to enforce the provisions of this Section 7.5 or (iii) prevent
Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their Affiliates from (x) amending or
terminating any particular benefit plan or (y) terminating the employment of
any particular employee.

 



 

7.6 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Company to, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law (and Parent shall also advance expenses as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ that
the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification), each present and former director and officer of the Company
and its Subsidiary (in each case, in their capacities as such) (collectively,
the " ** _Company Indemnified Parties_** ") against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Any Company Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
Section 7.6(a), upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but the failure to so
notify shall not relieve Parent, the Initial Surviving Company or the
Surviving Company of any liability it may have to such Company Indemnified
Party, except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the
indemnifying party. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i)
Parent or the Surviving Company shall have the right to assume the defense
thereof and Parent and the Surviving Company shall not be liable to such
Company Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any
other expenses subsequently incurred by such Company Indemnified Parties in
connection with the defense thereof, except that if Parent or the Surviving
Company elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Company
Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of
interest between Parent or the Surviving Company and the Company

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnified Parties, the Company Indemnified Parties may retain counsel
satisfactory to them, and Parent or the Surviving Company shall pay all
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Company Indemnified
Parties promptly as statements therefor are received; and (ii) the Company
Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter.

 



 

(c) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Company to, fulfill and honor in all respects
the obligations of the Company pursuant to any indemnification agreements
between the Company and the Company Indemnified Parties, subject to applicable
Law. For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, the Governing
Documents of the Surviving Company will contain provisions with respect to
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses that are at least as
favorable to the Company Indemnified Parties as those contained in the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as in effect on the
date hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
the Company Indemnified Parties. The provisions of such indemnification
agreements and Governing Documents shall continue to apply in respect of any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation brought against the Company
Indemnified Parties within such six (6) year period until the final
disposition of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

 



 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company as of the Effective Time
to, obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of
at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current
insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability insurance
(" ** _D andO Insurance_**") with benefits and levels of coverage at least as
favorable as the Companys existing policies with respect to matters existing
or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby); _provided_
, that in no event shall the Company, Parent or the Surviving Company expend
for such policies an aggregate premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual
premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance. If the Company and
the Surviving Company for any reason fail to obtain such a "tail" insurance
policy as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Company to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of
at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in
place as of the date of this Agreement with benefits and levels of coverage at
least as favorable as those provided in the Companys existing policies as of
the date of this Agreement, or the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Company to, use reasonable best efforts to purchase
comparable DandO Insurance for such six (6) year period with benefits and levels
of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing
policies as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , that in no event shall
Parent or the Surviving Company be required to expend for such policies an

 



       
 

 



 

aggregate premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently
paid by the Company for such insurance.

 



 

(e) If Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their respective successors
or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or
entity and shall not be the continuing or Surviving Company or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity,
then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company shall assume all of
the obligations set forth in this Section 7.6.

 



 

(f) The provisions of this Section 7.6 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each of the Company Indemnified Parties, who are
the intended third party beneficiaries hereof. The rights of the Company
Indemnified Parties under this Section 7.6 shall be in addition to any rights
such Company Indemnified Parties may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or its Subsidiary, or under any
applicable Contracts or Laws.

 



 

7.7 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company and its board of directors shall grant such approvals and take such
actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation on such transactions.

 



 

7.8 _Information Statement_. As promptly as practicable following the date of
this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall prepare and cause to be delivered
to all Stockholders a notice and information statement (the " ** _Information
Statement_** ") including, without limitation, (a) a description of the
principal terms of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the appointment of the Stockholder Representative, (b) a notice,
in accordance with Sections 228(e) and 262(d)(2) of the DGCL and Chapter 13 of
the CGCL, to all such Persons who did not execute the Written Consent, of
their appraisal rights, and (c) the information with respect to the Parent
Common Stock comprising the Aggregate Stock Merger Consideration required to
comply with the information and disclosure requirements set forth in Rules 502
and 506 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. Each of Parent
and the Company shall furnish all information (including financial statements)
concerning such Person and its Affiliates to the other, and provide such other
assistance, as may be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation
and distribution of the Information Statement. The Company shall provide a
draft of the Information Statement and related materials to Parent within a
reasonable period of time prior to the dispatch thereof and will consider in
good faith any comments proposed by Parent. In connection with the foregoing,
the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a
confidentiality agreement from each Stockholder with respect to the provisions
of this Agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and
the Company.

 



      
 

 



 

Parent shall comply with and take any other action required to be taken under

specifying the amount of the Company Transaction Expenses.

 



 

(b) At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company

7.10 _No Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) Subject to Section 7.10(c) below, the Company agrees that it shall not,

knowingly encourage (including by providing information or assistance),
knowingly facilitate or knowingly induce any Alternative Proposal, (ii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations (other than informing Persons
of the provisions set forth in this Section 7.10) regarding, or knowingly take
any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any offer or
proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Alternative Proposal, (iii) approve, agree to, accept, endorse or recommend
any Alternative Proposal, (iv) submit any Alternative Proposal for the consent
or approval of the Stockholders, or (v) enter into any letter of intent or
agreement in principle or any agreement providing for any Alternative
Proposal.

 



 

(b) The Company shall, and the Company shall direct its Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect
to any offer or proposal that constitutes an Alternative Proposal.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, until the receipt
by the Company of the Required Stockholder Approval, if the Company receives
an unsolicited _bona fide_ Alternative Proposal that the board of directors of
the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and its financial advisors, constitutes or is reasonably likely
to result in a Superior Proposal, then the Company may engage in discussions
or negotiations with such Person with respect to such Alternative Proposal if
the board of directors of the Company determines in good

 



      
 

 



 

faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to
do so would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary obligations under
Delaware Law. Following the execution and delivery of this Agreement and until
the receipt by the Company of the Required Stockholder Approval, the Company
shall notify Parent promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
after receipt of any Alternative Proposal, any proposals or inquiries that
would reasonably be expected to lead to an Alternative Proposal, or any
inquiry or request for nonpublic information relating to the Company or its
Subsidiary by any Person who has made or would reasonably be expected to make
any Alternative Proposal. Subject to the terms of any confidentiality
agreement entered into by the Company prior to the date hereof, if any, such
notice shall indicate the identity of the Person making the Alternative
Proposal, inquiry or request, and the material terms and conditions of any
such proposal or offer or the nature of the information requested pursuant to
such inquiry or request, including copies of all written requests, proposals
or offers, including proposed agreements received by the Company. In
connection therewith, (i) the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on
a prompt and timely basis of the status and material terms (including any
amendments or proposed amendments to such material terms) of any such
Alternative Proposal or potential Alternative Proposal and keep Parent
reasonably informed on a prompt and timely basis as to the nature of any
information requested of the Company with respect thereto, and (ii) the

the Milestones in Section 5.3(a) has either been achieved or Parent has

Intellectual Property rights, Contracts and/or Parents Subsidiaries with
respect to a Carve-Out Transaction (each such Person, an " ** _Acquiror_** ")
shall have executed and delivered to the Stockholder Representative a written
assumption agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to the Stockholder
Representative, expressly assuming the due and punctual payment of any and all

accordance with Section 7.14(a), the Acquiror shall succeed to, and be
substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, Parent under this

covenants under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in the event
that the Acquiror does not have total assets of at least $10,000,000,000 as

the purpose of financing the Aggregate Cash Merger Consideration and any other
amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and all related fees and expenses of Parent,

the Company hereunder has been breached or whether a condition precedent to
the Merger and the Subsequent Merger has been satisfied.

obligation of the Company, its Subsidiary or any of their respective

or instrument (other than customary authorization and representation letters)
relating to the Financing will be effective until the Closing, and neither the

approve any financing or Contracts related thereto prior to the Closing.

 



 

(c) All non-public or other confidential information provided by the Company
or any of its Representatives to Parent pursuant to this Agreement will be

confidentiality undertakings in connection with the Financing.

 



 

(d) Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company

with the arrangement of the Financing and any information used in connection
therewith, except with respect to (i) any information provided in writing by

ARTICLE IX

 



 

 _Escrow Fund and Indemnification_

 



 

9.1 _Survival_. All representations, warranties and covenants of the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II set forth in this Agreement shall
survive the consummation of the Merger and continue in full force and effect
until the

 



      
 

 



 

Escrow Termination Date, after which time all such representations, warranties
and covenants shall terminate; _provided_ , _however_ , that this Section 9.1
shall not limit any covenant of the parties which by its terms contemplates
performance after the Effective Time, including the provisions of this Article
IX and Article XI; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if, at any time prior to
the Escrow Termination Date, any Indemnified Party, acting in good faith,
shall have timely and duly delivered a Claim Notice in accordance with the
terms of this Article IX in respect of any such representation and warranty or
covenant, then the claim asserted in such Claim Notice and the corresponding
representation and warranty or covenant of the Company shall survive the
Escrow Termination Date to the extent, and only to the extent, of the claim
set forth in such Claim Notice until such time as such claim is finally
resolved in accordance with the terms of this Article IX. All other agreements
of the Company and Parent contained in this Agreement shall not survive the
consummation of the Merger, and shall terminate and be of no further force or
effect at the Effective Time. It is the intention of the parties that this
Section 9.1 governs the survival periods and termination dates of all
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement and, except as
otherwise provided herein, supersedes any applicable statutes of limitations
that would otherwise apply to such representations and warranties, other than
statutes of limitations governing claims under federal and state securities
laws.

 



 

9.2 _Escrow Fund_. The amounts to be deposited into escrow pursuant to Section
5.4(b) shall be deposited with an institution selected jointly by Parent and
the Stockholder Representative as escrow agent (the " ** _Escrow Agent_** "),
the portion of such deposit up to the Escrow Amount, together with any
interest or other amounts that may be earned thereon, to constitute an escrow
fund (the " ** _Escrow Fund_** ") and to be governed by the provisions set
forth in this Agreement and in the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Fund shall be
available to fund any payment required by Section 9.7 and, subject to the
limitations set forth in this Article IX, shall be available to compensate
Parent (on behalf of itself or any other Indemnified Party) for Losses
described in Section 9.3(a).

 



 

9.3 _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) Following the Effective Time, and from and only to the extent of the
Escrow Fund, Parent and the Surviving Company, their respective Subsidiaries
and their and their respective Subsidiaries officers and directors
(collectively, the " ** _Indemnified Parties_** ") shall be entitled to be
indemnified, defended and held harmless from the Escrow Fund for, from and
against any Losses actually suffered, incurred or paid by them to the extent
they arise or result from:

 



 

(i) the failure of any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in
Section 6.1 to be true and correct as of the Effective Time (or, with respect
to representations and warranties that by their terms refer to a specific or
earlier date, as of such date), it being understood that in determining
whether any such representation or warranty failed to be true and correct,
such representation and warranty (other than those set forth in the second
sentence of Section 6.1(e)(i) (Financial Statements), Section 6.1(e)(iii)
(Internal Controls), Section 6.1(f) (Absence of Certain Changes), Section

 



      
 

 



 

6.1(h)(i) (Company Benefit Plans), clauses (ii) and (ix) of Section 6.1(k)
(Company Regulatory Matters), Section 6.1(l)(i) (Company Material Contracts),
Section 6.1(p) (Taxes), Section 6.1(q)(viii) (IT Assets) and Section 6.1(w)
(Disclosure Matters)) shall be considered without regard to any materiality or
Company Material Adverse Effect qualifiers; or

 



 

(ii) any failure by the Company to perform any covenant of the Company set
forth in this Agreement required to be performed on or prior to the Effective
Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that that none of the Indemnified Parties shall
be entitled to indemnification under this Article IX if the required
performance of any such covenant was waived by Parent prior to the Effective
Time.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
"Losses" shall not include, and there shall not be recoverable from the Escrow
Fund, any costs or expenses (including attorneys fees or expenses) incurred
or paid by any Indemnified Party in connection with any dispute with the
Stockholder Representative or any other Person concerning the parties
respective rights and obligations under this Article IX, which costs and
expenses shall be borne by such Indemnified Party.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover any Losses pursuant to Section
9.3(a)(i) (x) with respect to any individual claim or series of related claims
arising out of the same facts or circumstances involving Losses contemplated
by Section 9.3(a)(i) of less than $250,000 (the " ** _De Minimis Amount_** "),
and (y) unless and until the aggregate amount of the Losses collectively
incurred by the Indemnified Parties for which the Indemnified Parties have
been finally determined (pursuant to Section 9.7(m)) to be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Section 9.3(a)(i) exceeds an aggregate amount
(disregarding any individual claim or series of related claims arising out of
the same facts or circumstances lower than the De Minimis Amount) equal to
$45,000,000 (the " ** _Deductible Amount_** "), after which, subject to the
limitations set forth in this Article IX, the indemnifying party shall be
liable for the amount of any such Losses that are in excess of the Deductible
Amount in the aggregate; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing
limitations shall not apply to (x) breaches of, or inaccuracies in, the
Company Fundamental Representations or the representation and warranty set
forth in Section 6.1(e)(iv) or (y) Losses that arise from any intentional
fraud committed by or on behalf of the Company or any of its directors,
officers, employees or stockholders in the making of any representation or
warranty made by the Company in Section 6.1.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
except as provided in Section 9.10 recovery from the Escrow Fund shall serve
as the sole and exclusive source of indemnification from which the Indemnified
Parties may collect Losses under Section 9.3(a).

 



      
 

 



 

(e) The right of the Indemnified Parties to indemnification pursuant to this
Section 9.3 will not be affected by any investigation conducted or knowledge
acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing, with respect to
any accuracy of any representation or warranty, or performance of or
compliance with any covenant or agreement herein.

 



 

9.4 _Adjustments to Losses_.

 



 

(a) In calculating the amount of any Loss which an Indemnified Party is
entitled to recover pursuant to this Article IX, the proceeds actually
received by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates under any insurance
policy or pursuant to any claim, recovery, settlement or payment by or against
any other Person, net of the present value of any increase in premiums
actually imposed by the applicable insurance carrier as a result of the
occurrence of the Loss and any other reasonable, actual costs or expenses
incurred in connection with securing or obtaining such proceeds.

 



 

(b) With respect to any claim brought by an Indemnified Party against any
Holder relating to this Agreement and any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, each Holder expressly waives any right of subrogation, contribution,
advancement, indemnification or other claim against the Company with respect
to any amounts owed by such Holder pursuant to this Article IX.

 



 

(c) In calculating the amount of any Loss which an Indemnified Party is
entitled to recover pursuant to this Article IX, the amount of any accruals or
reserves made and specifically referred to in the Financial Statements, in
each case, to the extent that the same was not reversed prior to the Closing
Date and to the extent such accruals and reserves are related to such Loss,
shall be deducted.

 



 

(d) If an Indemnified Party recovers an amount from a third party in respect
of a Loss that is the subject of indemnification under this Article IX after
all or a portion of such Loss has been recovered pursuant to this Article IX,
(i) the Indemnified Party shall promptly remit to the Stockholder
Representative the excess (if any) of (A) the amount of the Loss recovered
from the Escrow Fund, _plus_ (B) the amount received from the third party in
respect thereof, _less_ (C) the amount of the relevant Loss and (ii) the
Stockholder Representative shall distribute such excess amount to the Holders
in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share.

 



 

(e) No Indemnified Parties may recover more than once in respect of any Loss.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) no Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to indemnification or reimbursement under any provision of
this Agreement for any amount to the extent such Indemnified Party or any of
its Affiliates has been indemnified or reimbursed for such amount under any
other provision of this Agreement and (ii) no Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to indemnification or reimbursement under

 



      
 

 



 

this Article IX in respect of any component of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration, including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company Transaction
Expenses.

 



 

(f) No claim for recovery of Losses under this Article IX shall be available
to the extent that facts and circumstances that might serve as the basis of
such claim would not have arisen but for, or any Loss related thereto was
increased by (but only to the extent of such increase), the passing of, or
change in, any Law or any change in the interpretation or application of any
of the foregoing, following the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
"Losses" shall not include, and there shall not be recoverable under this
Article IX, any punitive, indirect or special damages, or any other damages
that would not have been reasonably foreseeable to the parties as of the date
hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section 9.4(g) shall
preclude any recovery by an Indemnified Party against an indemnifying party
for a Third Party Claim. Furthermore, except for Third Party Claims, the
Indemnified Parties shall have no right to make an indemnification claim for
any Loss to the extent it is primarily a possible or potential Loss that the
Indemnified Parties believe may be suffered, incurred or paid rather than a
Loss that has, in fact, been suffered, incurred or paid by the Indemnified
Parties.

 



 

9.5 _Claims_.

 



 

(a) In the event that any Indemnified Party seeks to assert any claim pursuant
to Section 9.3(a), other than a Third Party Claim (a " ** _Direct Claim_** "),
such Indemnified Party shall promptly, but in no event more than thirty (30)
calendar days following the Indemnified Partys receipt of information
sufficient for the Indemnified Party to conclude that there has occurred a
failure of the type contemplated by Section 9.3(a), provide the Stockholder
Representative with a written notice thereof (a " ** _Direct Claim Notice_**
"). Failure of the Indemnified Party to give such notice will not relieve the
indemnifying party from its indemnification obligations hereunder, except to
the extent that the indemnifying party is actually and materially prejudiced
thereby. Each Direct Claim Notice shall describe in reasonable detail the
basis asserted by the Indemnified Party for such claim (the " ** _Claim
Basis_** "), specify the amount or the estimated amount, in Dollars, of Losses
actually incurred or paid by the Indemnified Party as a result of the Claim
Basis, to the extent then ascertainable (the " ** _Claim Amount_** "), and
include all available documentation supporting the Claim Basis and Claim
Amount.

 



 

(b) In the event that any written claim or demand for which the Escrow Fund
may be available to compensate any Indemnified Party under Section 9.3(a) is
asserted against any Indemnified Party by a third party (a " ** _Third Party
Claim_** "), such Indemnified Party shall promptly, but in no event more than
thirty (30) calendar days following such Indemnified Partys receipt of such
Third Party Claim, provide the Stockholder Representative with a written
notice thereof (a " ** _Third Party Claim Notice_** "); _provided_ , _however_
, that if the Indemnified Party receives a complaint, petition

 



      
 

 



 

or any other pleading in connection with such Third Party Claim which requires
the filing of an answer or other responsive pleading, the Indemnified Party
shall provide the Stockholder Representative with the Third Party Claim
Notice, together with a copy of such pleading, at least ten (10) calendar days
prior to the date a responsive pleading thereto is required to be filed (or
promptly upon receipt by the Indemnified Party, if the Indemnified Party
receives such complaint, petition or other pleading within such ten (10)
calendar day period). Failure of the Indemnified Party to give such notice
will not relieve the indemnifying party from its indemnification obligations
hereunder, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually and
materially prejudiced thereby. Each Third Party Claim Notice shall attach a
copy of such Third Party Claim, describe in reasonable detail the Claim Basis
for such claim, specify the Claim Amount for such Third Party Claim and
include all available documentation supporting the Claim Basis and Claim
Amount.

 



 

(c) The Stockholder Representative shall have thirty (30) calendar days after
receipt of each Third Party Claim Notice (the " ** _Defense Determination
Period_** ") to notify the Indemnified Party of its election to defend the
Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim. In the event that the
Stockholder Representative notifies the Indemnified Party within the Defense
Determination Period of such election, the Stockholder Representative shall
have the right to defend the Indemnified Party by appropriate proceedings and
shall have the power to direct and control such defense; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Stockholder Representative may not assume control of the
defense to a Third Party Claim (i) involving any criminal proceeding, action,
indictment, allegation or investigation, or in which relief other than
monetary damages is sought; (ii) involving the Companys Intellectual Property
or the alleged misuse, infringement, misappropriation or violation of any
third partys Intellectual Property or (iii) if the Stockholder Representative
has not notified the Indemnified Party in writing that the Holders will be
liable to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to all Losses relating
to such Third Party Claim, subject to the limitations of Section 9.3. Once the
Stockholder Representative has made such election, (i) the Indemnified Party
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in any such
defense, at its sole expense ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to participate in any such defense with separate
counsel at the expense of the Holders if (A) so requested by the Stockholder
Representative to participate or (B) in the written opinion of outside counsel
to the Indemnified Party a conflict or potential conflict exists between the
Indemnified Party and the Holders that would make such separate representation
advisable; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Holders shall not be required to
pay for more than one such counsel for all Indemnified Parties in connection
with any Third Party Claim), and (ii) the Stockholder Representative shall
not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle such
Third Party Claim unless (1) the claimant provides an unqualified release of
the Indemnified Parties from all liability in respect of such Third Party
Claim, (2) such settlement does not involve any injunctive relief binding upon
the Indemnified Parties or any of their Affiliates, (3) such settlement does
not encumber any of the material assets of any Indemnified Party or their
Affiliates or impose any restriction or condition that would apply to or
materially affect any Indemnified Party or the conduct of

 



      
 

 



 

any Indemnified Partys business and (4) such settlement does not involve any
admission of liability or wrongdoing by any Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates.

 



 

(d) In the event that the Stockholder Representative fails to notify the
Indemnified Party prior to the expiration of the Defense Determination Period
of its election to defend the Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim,
(i) the Indemnified Party shall assume its own defense, and all reasonable,
actual costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses)
incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with such defense shall
constitute "Losses" to the extent, but only to the extent, that such
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article IX
in respect of such Third Party Claim, and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall
not, without the consent of the Stockholder Representative (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld), settle such Third Party Claim.

 



 

9.6 _Mitigation_. Each Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate any Loss which an Indemnified Party is entitled to recover
from the Escrow Fund under this Article IX upon acquiring actual knowledge of
any event which would be reasonably likely to, or does, give rise to such
Loss. In the event an Indemnified Party fails to so use its commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate an indemnifiable Loss in accordance with the
preceding sentence, the portion of such Loss that could reasonably have been
avoided had the Indemnified Party made the efforts required by this Section
9.6 shall not be recoverable from the Escrow Fund under this Article IX.

 



 

9.7 _Resolution of Claims_.

 



 

(a) Each Indemnified Party shall provide to the Escrow Agent a copy of any
Direct Claim Notice or Third Party Claim Notice (either, a " ** _Claim
Notice_** ") simultaneously with the delivery thereof to the Stockholder
Representative. No Claim Notice shall be provided to the Stockholder
Representative or the Escrow Agent following the Escrow Termination Date.

 



 

(b) Upon receipt of a Claim Notice in accordance with the terms of this
Article IX, the Escrow Agent shall set aside and hold, as a reserve to cover
the claim set forth in the Claim Notice (the " ** _Indemnified Party Claim_**
"), a portion of the Escrow Fund equal to the Claim Amount set forth therein
(a " ** _Reserve_** "), until there is a final resolution of such Indemnified
Party Claim in accordance with the terms of this Article IX.

 



 

(c) Following receipt by the Stockholder Representative and the Escrow Agent
of a Claim Notice in accordance with the terms of this Article IX, the
Stockholder Representative shall have no fewer than sixty (60) calendar days
(the " ** _Claim Investigation Period_** ") to make an investigation of the
Indemnified Party Claim. In connection with each Indemnified Party Claim,
Parent and the other Indemnified Parties shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates and Representatives to, (x) allow the

 



      
 

 



 

Stockholder Representative and its Representatives to investigate the facts,
matters and circumstances alleged to have given rise to such Indemnified Party
Claim and the related Claim Basis and Claim Amount, and (y) disclose to the
Stockholder Representative and its Representatives all material of which they
are aware which relates to the Indemnified Party Claim and promptly provide
such information and assistance as the Stockholder Representative and its
Representatives shall reasonably request, including reasonable access to
premises and personnel (including any employee with knowledge relating to the
relevant facts, matters or circumstances or who can otherwise reasonably
assist the requesting party), and the right to examine and copy or photograph
any relevant assets, accounts, correspondence, documents and records.

 



 

(d) At any time prior to the expiration of the Claim Investigation Period, the
Stockholder Representative may dispute the Indemnified Party Claim, the
related Claim Basis and/or all or any part of the related Claim Amount
specified in such Claim Notice (a " ** _Dispute_** ") by providing written
notice of such dispute (a " ** _Dispute Notice_** ") to Parent and the Escrow
Agent on or prior to the expiration of the Claim Investigation Period. Each
Dispute Notice shall specify, in reasonable detail, the factual grounds for
the Dispute, specify the portion of the Indemnified Party Claim which the
Stockholder Representative does not dispute, if any, and include all available
documentation supporting such Dispute.

 



 

(e) If the Escrow Agent does not receive from the Stockholder Representative a
Dispute Notice on or prior to the expiration of the Claim Investigation
Period, then the Escrow Agent shall release and distribute to Parent, in
accordance with the terms of this Article IX and the Escrow Agreement, no
fewer than three (3) Business Days after the expiration of the Claim
Investigation Period, such portion of the Escrow Fund equal to the applicable
Reserve and, upon payment thereof, such Reserve and such Indemnified Party
Claim shall be deemed to have been finally resolved and discharged in full.

 



 

(f) If the Escrow Agent receives from the Stockholder Representative, on or
prior to the expiration of the Claim Investigation Period, a Dispute Notice,
then, to the extent applicable, the Escrow Agent shall release and distribute
to Parent a portion of the Escrow Fund equal to the uncontested portion of the
Claim Amount, if any, no later than three (3) Business Days after receipt of
such Dispute Notice and, upon payment thereof, the relevant portion of the
Reserve, Indemnified Party Claim and Dispute shall be deemed to have been
finally resolved and discharged in full.

 



 

(g) Following the receipt by Parent and the Escrow Agent of a Dispute Notice,
if Parent and the Stockholder Representative agree in writing, prior to or on
the date of the expiration of the Claim Investigation Period, as to the
validity and amount of all or a portion of the Claim Amount of any Indemnified
Party Claim that is subject to a Dispute Notice, they shall promptly and
jointly provide to the Escrow Agent a written notice (a " ** _Joint Escrow
Notice_** ") directing the Escrow Agent to apply a specified portion of the
Escrow Fund in settlement of such Indemnified Party Claim (a " **
_Settlement_** "), and

 



      
 

 



 

such Joint Escrow Notice shall contain instructions from Parent as to the
delivery of such portion of the Escrow Fund necessary to pay the Settlement;
_provided_ , _however_ , for the avoidance of doubt, that the Settlement
amount shall in no event include any uncontested portion of the Claim Amount
previously released from the Escrow Fund in accordance with Section 9.7(f).
The Escrow Agent shall pay the Settlement no later than three (3) Business
Days after receipt of such Joint Escrow Notice by the Escrow Agent. Upon
payment of the Settlement, the relevant portion of the Reserve, Indemnified
Party Claim and Dispute shall be deemed to have been finally resolved and
discharged in full. In connection with any Settlement, the Stockholder
Representative may also deliver a Dispute Notice in connection with any
portion of such Indemnified Party Claim not so settled.

 



 

(h) Parent and the Stockholder Representative agree to meet, confer and
negotiate in good faith from time to time, each as and when reasonably
requested by the other, for a period of thirty (30) calendar days following
the date of any Dispute Notice (the " ** _Dispute Negotiation Period_** "), in
order to attempt to resolve the Dispute in its entirety. If Parent and the
Stockholder Representative agree, on or prior to the expiration of the Dispute
Negotiation Period, as to the validity and amount of all or a portion of any
Indemnified Party Claim, they shall promptly and jointly provide to the Escrow
Agent a Joint Escrow Notice directing the Escrow Agent to apply a specified
portion of the Escrow Fund in resolution of such Dispute (a " ** _Negotiated
Resolution_** "), and such Joint Escrow Notice shall contain instructions from
Parent as to the delivery of such portion of the Escrow Fund necessary to pay
the Negotiated Resolution and, upon payment thereof, the relevant portion of
the Reserve, Indemnified Party Claim and Dispute shall be deemed to have been
finally resolved and discharged in full. The Escrow Agent shall pay the
Negotiated Resolution no later than three (3) Business Days after receipt of
such Joint Escrow Notice by the Escrow Agent.

 



 

(i) Promptly following the receipt of a court order or judgment of such court
of competent jurisdiction resolving a Dispute, which order or judgment has
become a final order from which no appeal has been or can be had (a " **
_Final Judgment_** "), Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall, by
Joint Escrow Notice, direct the Escrow Agent (x) to promptly pay to Parent,
out of any remaining portion of the Escrow Fund, if any, the amount of any
such Losses incurred by Parent (or any other Indemnified Party) pursuant to
such Final Judgment and (y) to release any remaining Reserve in excess of any
amount to be paid to Parent pursuant to the immediately preceding clause (x),
and upon receipt by the Escrow Agent of the Joint Escrow Notice and payment to
Parent of any amount referred to in the preceding clause (x), the relevant
Reserve, Indemnified Party Claim and Dispute shall be deemed to have been
finally resolved and discharged in full. Any such payment to Parent will be
made by the Escrow Agent no later than three (3) Business Days after receipt
of such Joint Escrow Notice by the Escrow Agent.

 



 

(j) If Parent and the Stockholder Representative agree to a resolution of any
Dispute prior to any Final Judgment, Parent and the Stockholder Representative

 



      
 

 



 

shall, by Joint Escrow Notice, direct the Escrow Agent to make delivery from
the Escrow Fund of the amount dictated by such agreement between Parent and
the Stockholder Representative, and upon payment thereof, the relevant
Reserve, Indemnified Party Claim and Dispute shall be deemed to have been
finally resolved and discharged in full. Such payment will be made by the
Escrow Agent no later than three (3) Business Days after receipt of such Joint
Escrow Notice by the Escrow Agent.

 



 

(k) On or as promptly as practicable following the Closing Date (and in any
event within five (5) Business Days thereafter), the Escrow Agent shall
release and distribute to the Stockholder Representative a portion of the
Escrow Fund equal to the amount, if any, by which the amount paid into escrow
by the Company pursuant to Section 5.4(b)(i) exceeded the Escrow Amount.
Promptly following the Escrow Termination Date (and in any event within five
(5) Business Days thereafter), the Escrow Agent shall release and distribute
to the Stockholder Representative the balance of the Escrow Fund, less any
portion of the Escrow Fund subject to a Reserve. Following the Escrow
Termination Date, upon final resolution of any Dispute, the portion of the
Escrow Fund subject to a related Reserve shall be released and distributed in
accordance with such resolution as set forth in a Joint Escrow Notice or
written notice from the Stockholder Representative, as provided in this
Article IX.

 



 

(l) Any amount released from the Escrow Fund to the Stockholder Representative
shall be distributed by the Stockholder Representative to the Holders in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (1) any Unvested Company Option that is forfeited prior to vesting
and prior to the payment of an amount released from the Escrow Fund to the
Stockholder Representative shall not be entitled to any portion of any Escrow
Release Amount and (2) the right of any holder of an Unvested Company Option
that is outstanding and not vested on the date on which an amount is released
from the Escrow Fund to the Stockholder Representative to receive a Pro Rata
Share of such Escrow Release Amount with respect to such Unvested Company
Option will be contingent upon, and such Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Release
Amount shall be held by the Stockholder Representative until, vesting of such
Unvested Company Option. On the date on which such Unvested Company Option
vests, the Stockholder Representative shall pay to the holder of such Unvested
Company Option the Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Release Amount in respect of
the Unvested Company Option. If such Unvested Company Option is cancelled or
forfeited prior to vesting, then the holder thereof will not be entitled to
any Escrow Release Amount in respect of such Unvested Company Option (the " **
_Escrow Release Amount Forfeiture_** "). In the event of an Escrow Release
Amount Forfeiture, the portion of the Escrow Release Amount in respect of such
Unvested Company Option will be added to the next Milestone Payment that
becomes due and payable in accordance with Section 5.3 or, if no Milestone
Payment remains, shall be delivered to the Paying Agent on behalf of and for
further distribution to the Holders in accordance with Section 5.5.

 



 

(m) Any Indemnified Party Claim or any portion thereof, and the liability for
and amount of any Losses for which any Indemnified Party is entitled to

 



       
 

 



 

indemnification pursuant to Section 9.3(a) in respect thereof, shall be deemed
to be "finally determined" for purposes of this Article IX: (i) when Parent
and the Stockholder Representative have so determined by mutual agreement in a
Settlement pursuant to Section 9.7(g), a Negotiated Resolution pursuant to
Section 9.7(h) or otherwise, (ii) upon the expiration of the Claim
Investigation Period with respect to such Indemnified Party Claim if the
Stockholder Representative shall not have delivered a Dispute Notice to the
Escrow Agent with respect to such Indemnified Party Claim or a portion
thereof, or (iii) when a Final Judgment with respect to such Indemnified Party
Claim or portion thereof has been entered into.

 



 

9.8 _Characterization for Tax Purposes_. All payments made out of the Escrow
Fund to an Indemnified Party in respect of any indemnification claim pursuant
to Section 9.3 shall be treated as adjustments to the Aggregate Merger
Consideration for Tax purposes.

 



 

9.9 _No Set-Off_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, (i) no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to set off, deduct or
retain any amount that may be due to such Indemnified Party under this Article
IX from any Future Payment, including any Milestone Payment, that becomes due
and payable to the Holders in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and
(ii) no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover from the Escrow Fund in
respect of any claim by such Indemnified Person against any Holder or any
other Person for which the Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Article IX.

 



 

9.10 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except as specifically provided in the last sentence
of this Section 9.10, the rights and remedies of the Indemnified Parties under
this Article IX shall be the sole and exclusive rights, remedies and causes of
action for monetary damages which each Indemnified Party may have against the
Holders, the Stockholder Representative (in each case, in their capacity as
such) and their respective Affiliates and Representatives under, in connection
with, arising out of, resulting from or in any way related to this Agreement,
the Escrow Agreement, the Merger or any other matter contemplated hereby or
thereby, or the process leading up to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and the Merger, under any theory of
recovery whatsoever (including at law or in equity). Without limitation to the
generality of, and in connection with and in furtherance of, the foregoing:
(i) each of Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II and, following the Closing,
the Surviving Company (on behalf of themselves and each of their Affiliates,
which Parent agrees to cause to comply with the provisions of this Section
9.10) expressly waives any and all rights, remedies and causes of action,
other than those specified in the immediately preceding sentence, it (or its
Affiliates) may have against the Holders, the Stockholder Representative or
their respective Affiliates now or in the future under, in connection with,
arising out of, resulting from or in any way related to this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement, the Merger or any other matter contemplated hereby or
thereby, or the process leading up to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and the Merger; and (ii) Parent agrees and
acknowledges that, following the

 



      
 

 



 

Closing, the sole remedy for any claim by Parent (or any other Indemnified
Party) against the Holders, the Stockholder Representative and their
respective Affiliates in respect of this Agreement, shall be an action for
damages under, and in accordance with, the terms of this Article IX and all
such claims by Parent (or any other Indemnified Party) against the Holders,
the Stockholder Representative and their respective Affiliates shall be
satisfied solely and exclusively out of the Escrow Fund and shall in no event
exceed the Escrow Amount. Each party hereby waives any provision of any Law to
the extent that it would limit, restrict, conflict with, or otherwise
interfere with the application of, the foregoing agreements. The provisions of
this Section 9.10 are intended to be for the benefit of, and following the
Effective Time they shall be enforceable by, the Holders, who are intended
third party beneficiaries hereof. **_NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING AND
NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IN
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL LIMIT THE RIGHT OF ABBVIE INC. OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES
OR ANY OTHER INDEMNIFIED PARTY TO SEEK ANY REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO IT UNDER ANY
APPLICABLE LAW (I) IN RESPECT OF ANY INTENTIONAL FRAUD COMMITTED BY OR ON
BEHALF OF THE COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES OR
STOCKHOLDERS IN THE MAKING OF ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY MADE BY THE
COMPANY IN THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE DISCLOSURE
REPRESENTATION OR (II) PURSUANT TO ANY DOCUMENT, INSTRUMENT OR OTHER AGREEMENT
THAT IS MADE A PART OF THE ENTIRE AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO PURSUANT TO
THE FIRST SENTENCE OF SECTION 11.9._**

agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement, or if any
representation or warranty of the Company shall have become untrue, in either
case such that the conditions set forth in Section 8.2(a) or 8.2(b) would not

(30) days following the receipt of written notice by the Company from Parent
of such breach (it being understood that Parent may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(e) if Parent is in material breach of
this Agreement or if such breach by the Company is cured so that such
conditions would then be satisfied);

 



 

(f) by Parent, at any time after 7:00 A.M. (Eastern Time) on the Business Day
following the date of this Agreement and prior to the time when the Required
Stockholder Approval is delivered to Parent; or

 



 

(g) by the Company, if (i) the Required Stockholder Approval has not yet been
received by the Company, and (ii) the board of directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to terminate this Agreement would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary obligations under Delaware Law.

Agreement under Section 10.1 will be effective immediately upon the delivery
of a valid written notice of the terminating party to the other party hereto.

11.4 _Stockholder Representative_.

 



 

(a) The Stockholder Representative (x) shall hold the Stockholder
Representative Expenses Holdback Amount in an account segregated from its
corporate funds, (y) shall use the Stockholder Representative Expenses
Holdback Amount solely for the purposes set forth in this Section 11.4 and not
for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes, and (z) shall not
voluntarily make any portion of the Stockholder Representative Expenses
Holdback Amount available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. The
Stockholder Representative shall have the right to recover from the
Stockholder Representative Expenses Holdback Amount, prior to any distribution
to the Holders, the Stockholder Representatives reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in the performance of its duties under this Agreement (" **
_Charges_** "), including, without limitation, costs and expenses resulting
from the employment of financial advisors, attorneys, auditors and other
advisors and agents assisting in the assessment of arbitration, litigation and
settlement of any disputes arising under this Agreement, the Paying Agent
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. Upon final resolution of all liabilities
and obligations of the Holders pursuant to the Stockholder Representative
Agreements, and full reimbursement of all Charges of the Stockholder
Representative as

 



      
 

 



 

provided herein, the Stockholder Representative shall distribute any remaining
portion of the Stockholder Representative Expenses Holdback Amount (the " **
_Holdback Distribution Amount_** ") to the Holders in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Share; _provided_ that (1) the number of Fully Diluted
Shares used for purposes of determining the Pro Rata Share shall not include
any Shares underlying any Unvested Company Options that have been forfeited as
of the date of such distribution and (2) any Holdback Distribution Amount
corresponding to any Excluded Shares or any Company Shares with respect to
which the holders thereof have not claimed payment of the Per Share Closing
Consideration in accordance with Section 5.5(b) prior to the termination of
the Closing Payment Fund pursuant to Section 5.5(e) shall be paid to the
Surviving Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) any Unvested Company
Option that is forfeited prior to vesting and prior to the payment of the
Holdback Distribution Amount to the Holders shall not be entitled to any
portion of the Holdback Distribution Amount and (B) the right of any holder of
an Unvested Company Option that is outstanding and not vested on the date on
which the Holdback Distribution Amount is paid to the Holders to receive a Pro
Rata Share of the Holdback Distribution Amount with respect to such Unvested
Company Option will be contingent upon, and such Pro Rata Share of the
Holdback Distribution Amount shall be held by the Stockholder Representative
until, vesting of such Unvested Company Option. On the date on which such
Unvested Company Option vests, the Stockholder Representative shall pay to the
holder of such Unvested Company Option the Pro Rata Share of the Holdback
Distribution Amount in respect of the Unvested Company Option. If such
Unvested Company Option is cancelled or forfeited prior to vesting, then the
holder thereof will not be entitled to any Holdback Distribution Amount in
respect of such Unvested Company Option (the " ** _Holdback Distribution
Amount Forfeiture_** "). In the event of a Holdback Distribution Amount
Forfeiture, the portion of the Holdback Distribution Amount in respect of such
Unvested Company Option will be added to the next Milestone Payment that
becomes due and payable in accordance with Section 5.3 or, if no Milestone
Payment remains, shall be delivered to the Paying Agent on behalf of and for
further distribution to the Holders in accordance with Section 5.5.

 



 

(b) The Stockholder Representative shall have the right to enforce and protect
the rights and interests of the Holders arising out of or in any manner
relating to this Agreement and each other agreement, document, instrument or
certificate referred to herein or the transactions provided for herein, and to
take any and all actions which the Stockholder Representative believes are
necessary or appropriate under this Agreement to enforce and protect such
rights of the Holders, including asserting or pursuing any claim against
Parent or the Surviving Company. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Stockholder Representative shall have the authority to (i) give
and receive notices and communications, (ii) negotiate disputes arising under,
or relating to, this Agreement or any other agreement, document, instrument or
certificate referred to herein or the transactions provided for herein or
therein, (iii) execute and deliver such waivers, consents and amendments with
respect to any and all matters or issues, including those which may have a
negative impact on the Holders, and (iv) settle indemnity or other claims
under this Agreement and authorize payment from any escrow account, _provided_

 



      
 

 



 

that any amendment to this Agreement that would adversely affect a Holder
compared to other Holders shall require the written consent of such Holder.
Parent and the Surviving Company shall not have the right to object to,
dissent from, protest or otherwise contest the authority or power of the
Stockholder Representative to so act in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. The Stockholder Representative shall act as it believes to be in
the best interests of the Holders.

 



 

(c) With respect to any actions to be taken after the Effective Time pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement, the Stockholder Representative will follow the
instructions of a majority of the members of an advisory committee of
Stockholders (the " ** _Advisory Committee_** "), which Advisory Committee
shall be comprised of the individuals set forth in a written communication to
be furnished by the Company to Parent not fewer than three (3) Business Days
prior to Closing; _provided_ that (x) if, with respect to any matter, the
Advisory Committee does not provide instructions in a timely manner, the
Stockholder Representative shall act as it believes to be in the best
interests of the Holders, and (y) with respect to any matter which, pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement, requires the consent or approval of a
specified majority of the Stockholders, the Stockholder Representative and the
Advisory Committee will not take action without having obtained such required
consent or approval. Except as otherwise decided by the written consent of
Stockholders holding, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, a
majority of the Fully Diluted Shares (the " ** _Majority Holders_** "), the
Advisory Committee will have three (3) or more members and, in case of any
resignation or vacancy for any other reason, the remaining members of the
Advisory Committee will appoint any other Stockholder to fill the vacancy on
the Advisory Committee.

 



 

(d) At any time after the Effective Time, the Stockholder Representative may
resign upon thirty (30) days written notice to the Company (prior to the
Effective Time), Parent (following the Effective Time) and the Holders, and
may be removed for any reason or no reason by the written consent of a
majority of the members of the Advisory Committee or the Majority Holders. In
the event of the resignation or removal of the Stockholder Representative, a
new Stockholder Representative shall be appointed by the written consent of a
majority of the members of the Advisory Committee or the Majority Holders. A
copy of the written consent appointing such new Stockholder Representative
shall be sent to Parent, such appointment to be effective on the later of the
date indicated in such written consent or the date a copy of such written
consent is received by Parent.

 



 

(e) The Stockholder Representative hereby represents and warrants to Parent,
Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II and the Company that: (i) the Stockholder
Representative is a legal entity, validly existing and, in all material
respects, in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization,
(ii) the Stockholder Representative has all requisite limited liability
company power and authority and has taken all limited liability company action
necessary in order to execute and deliver this Agreement, the Paying Agent
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and to perform its obligations thereunder,
(iii) this Agreement has been, and the Paying Agent Agreement

 



      
 

 



 

and the Escrow Agreement will be, duly executed and delivered by the
Stockholder Representative and, assuming the valid execution and delivery by
all counterparties hereto, constitutes or, in the case of the Paying Agent
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, will constitute, a valid and binding
obligation of the Stockholder Representative, enforceable against the
Stockholder Representative in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors rights generally and by
general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding
in equity or at law), and (iv) the execution, delivery and performance by the
Stockholder Representative of this Agreement, the Paying Agent Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement does not and will not constitute or result in a breach or
violation of, or a default under, the certificate of formation or the bylaws
or the limited liability agreement of the Stockholder Representative.

 



 

(f) In the event of any pending or threatened action, claim, dispute or other
proceeding related to this Agreement, with respect to any information that the
Stockholder Representative may share with the Holders, the Stockholder
Representative and such Holders will have a commonality of interest with
respect thereto and agree that it is their intention and understanding that
sharing of information will not waive or diminish the continued protection of
the attorney-client privilege, the work product doctrine or any other
applicable privilege or doctrine.

 



 

(g) The provisions of this Section 11.4 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, the Holders, who are intended third party
beneficiaries hereof.

 



 

11.5 _Attorney Client Matters_.

 



 

(a) Parent agrees to comply with the provisions of this Section 11.5 and,
following the Closing, agrees to cause Parents controlled Affiliates and
Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing, the Company and its
Subsidiary) (collectively with Parent, the " ** _Parent Parties_** ") to
comply with the provisions of this Section 11.5 and to execute and deliver any
documents or agreements reasonably requested by the Stockholder Representative
to implement such provisions.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding any representation of the Company or its Subsidiary by
Sullivan and Cromwell LLP (" ** _S andC_**") prior to the Closing Date, each
Parent Party:

 



 

(i) consents to SandCs representation of the Stockholder Representative and/or
any Holder (the " ** _Stockholder Parties_** ") in connection with any matters
or disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Voting
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Paying Agent Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby;

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) waives any claim it has or may have that SandC has a conflict of interest
or is otherwise prohibited from engaging in such representation based upon
SandCs prior representation of the Company or its Subsidiary; and

 



 

(iii) agrees that, if a dispute arises between any Stockholder Party, on the
one hand, and any Parent Party, on the other hand, SandC may represent such
Stockholder Party notwithstanding that the interests of such Stockholder Party
and such Parent Party may be directly adverse and that SandC may have
represented the Company or its Subsidiary in a substantially related matter.

 



 

(c) As to all communications prior to the Closing that relate in any way to
this Agreement, the Voting Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Paying Agent
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and that are (x)
privileged communications between SandC or another legal advisor, on the one
hand, and, prior to the Closing, any Stockholder Party or the Company or its
Subsidiary, on the other hand, or (y) communications that refer or relate to
such privileged communications (collectively, " ** _Confidential
Communications_** "), each Parent Party agrees that:

 



 

(i) the attorney-client privilege belongs, to the extent such privilege
exists, to the applicable Stockholder Party, may be controlled by such
Stockholder Party and will not pass to or be claimed by any Parent Party. Each
Parent Party will not assert that privilege has been waived with respect to
Confidential Communications coming into the possession of such Parent Party.
To the extent that any Parent Party has or maintains any control of such
privilege of such Confidential Communications, such Parent Party will not,
except as may be required by applicable Law, waive or attempt to waive such
privilege without the prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that, following the Closing, a
dispute arises between any Parent Party and a third party (other than a
Stockholder Party, but including any Governmental Entity), such Parent Party
shall assert the attorney-client privilege against such third party to the
extent necessary to prevent disclosure of Confidential Communications.

 



 

(ii) Confidential Communications shall be and remain the exclusive property of
the Stockholder Parties, notwithstanding that some Confidential Communications
may have come into the possession of the Parent Parties. Each Parent Party
will take reasonable steps to protect the confidentiality of such Confidential
Communications.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this Section 11.5 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each of the Stockholder Parties, who are intended
third party beneficiaries hereof.

 



 

11.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each such counterpart being deemed to be an original instrument,
and all such counterparts shall together constitute the same agreement.

 



       
 

 



 

11.7 _GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_.

 



 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY, INTERPRETED AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THAT
WOULD RESULT IN THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ANY OTHER STATE OR WOULD DIRECT
A MATTER TO ANOTHER JURISDICTION. Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or,
if (and only if) such court finds it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the
Superior Court of the State of Delaware (Complex Commercial Division) or, if
subject matter jurisdiction over the matter that is the subject of the action
or proceeding is vested exclusively in the federal courts of the United States
of America, the federal court of the United States of America sitting in the
district of Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements
delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto,
and each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not
to commence any such action or proceeding except in the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court finds it lacks subject
matter jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware (Complex
Commercial Division) or, if subject matter jurisdiction over the matter that
is the subject of the action or proceeding is vested exclusively in the
federal courts of the United States of America, the federal court of the
United States of America sitting in the district of Delaware, as applicable,
and any appellate court from any thereof, (ii) agrees that any claim in
respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court
finds it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the State of
Delaware (Complex Commercial Division) or, if subject matter jurisdiction over
the matter that is the subject of the action or proceeding is vested
exclusively in the federal courts of the United States of America, the federal
court of the United States of America sitting in the district of Delaware, as
applicable, and any appellate court from any thereof, (iii) waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may
now or hereafter have to the jurisdiction or laying of venue of any such
action or proceeding in such courts and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
such action or proceeding in such courts. Each of the parties hereto agrees
that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to
service of process inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the
courts referred to in this Section 11.7(a) in the manner provided for notices
in Section 11.3. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party
to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS
DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE MERGER AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A)
NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
11.7(b).

 



 

11.8 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached,
and that money damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy
for any such damages. Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby
agree that in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Company, on
the one hand, or Parent, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II, on the other hand, of
any of their respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement,
the Company, on the one hand, and Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II, on
the other hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement, by the other(s)
(as applicable), and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other(s) (as applicable)
under this Agreement. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent, Merger Sub I
and Merger Sub II, on the other hand, hereby agree not to raise any objections
to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent
or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by such party
(or parties), and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such party (or parties)
under this Agreement.

 



 

11.9 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and
other agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to
herein, including the Company Disclosure Letter, together with each other
agreement entered into by or among any of Parent, the Merger Subs, the
Company, the Stockholder Representative and any Holder as of the date of this
Agreement that makes reference to this Section 11.9, constitute the entire
agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject

 



      
 

 



 

matter hereof, it being understood that the Confidentiality Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect until the Closing and shall survive any
termination of this Agreement. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY DOCUMENT,
INSTRUMENT OR OTHER AGREEMENT THAT IS MADE A PART OF THE ENTIRE AGREEMENT OF
THE PARTIES HERETO PURSUANT TO THE FIRST SENTENCE OF THIS SECTION 11.9,
NEITHER PARENT, MERGER SUB I AND MERGER SUB II NOR THE COMPANY MAKES OR RELIES
ON ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR INDUCEMENTS, AND EACH HEREBY
DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR INDUCEMENTS, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY OTHER INFORMATION, MADE BY,
OR MADE AVAILABLE BY, ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO,
OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, NOTWITHSTANDING THE
DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER OR THE OTHERS REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY
DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE
FOREGOING. No party hereto shall be bound by, or be liable for, any alleged
representation, promise, inducement or statement of intention not contained
herein.

 



 

11.10 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or implied
to the contrary in this Agreement or in any other document, instrument or
other agreement contemplated by or referred to herein or delivered in
connection herewith, the parties hereby acknowledge and agree that (a) no
Person other than the parties hereto has any obligations under this Agreement;
_provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Stockholder Representatives
obligations under this Agreement are solely with respect to the provisions
hereof that apply to the Stockholder Representative, (b) this Agreement may be
enforced only against, and any claims, obligations, liabilities or other
causes of action (whether at Law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) based upon, arising out or by reason of, or related in any manner
to a breach of this Agreement (including any representation or warranty made
in this Agreement), or the negotiation, execution, or performance of this
Agreement, may be made only against the parties hereto, and (c) with respect
to each party hereto, no current, former or future equity holders,
incorporators, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents,
Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners or Representatives
(or any successors, predecessors or assigns of the foregoing) shall have any
liability (whether at Law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) based
upon, arising out or by reason of, or related in any manner to, a breach of
this Agreement (including any representation or warranty made in this
Agreement), or the negotiation, execution, or performance of this Agreement,
including any liability in respect of this Agreement that may be granted by
statute or based on theories of equity, agency, control, instrumentality,
alter ego, domination, sham, single business enterprise, piercing the
corporate veil, unfairness, undercapitalization or otherwise; _provided_ ,
that in no event shall the provisions of this Section 11.10 restrict Parents
reliance on, and rights with respect to, any express representations or
warranties

 



      
 

 



 

of any Person contained in any document, instrument or other agreement that is
made a part of the entire agreement of the parties hereto pursuant to the
first sentence of Section 11.9. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement or otherwise, no party may seek to rescind this
Section 11.10 after the Closing.

 



 

11.11 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Section 5.6 (Third
Party Beneficiaries), Section 7.6 (Indemnification; Directors and Officers
Insurance), Section 7.11 (Rule 144), Section 9.10 (Exclusive Remedy), Section
11.5 (Attorney Client Matters) and Section 11.10 (No Recourse), Parent and the
Company hereby agree that their respective representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the
other parties hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this
Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon
any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder,
including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth
herein. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product
of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 11.2
without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently,
Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations
and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date hereof or as of any other date.

 



 

11.12 _Obligations of Parent and the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires the
Subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed
to include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause its Subsidiary
to take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the
Surviving Company to cause its Subsidiary to take such action.

 



 

11.13 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement,
all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including fees and expenses of financial
advisors, financial sponsors, legal counsel and other advisors, shall be paid
by the party incurring such expenses whether or not the Merger is consummated.

 



 

11.14 _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with the Merger and the Subsequent Merger shall be paid
by Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II when due, and Parent, Merger Sub I
and Merger Sub II will indemnify the Company and the Holders against liability
for any such Taxes.

 



      
 

 



 

11.15 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application of such provision to any
Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so
far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application of such provision, in any other jurisdiction.

 



 

11.16 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of law
or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may designate, by written
notice to the Company, another wholly owned direct or indirect Subsidiary to
be a constituent corporation in the Merger or the Subsequent Merger in lieu of
Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II, respectively, in which event all references
herein to Merger Sub I and/or Merger Sub II shall be deemed references to such
other Subsidiary or Subsidiaries, except that all representations and
warranties made herein with respect to Merger Sub I and/or Merger Sub II as of
the date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties made
with respect to such other Subsidiary or Subsidiaries as of the date of such
designation; _provided_ that any such designation shall not materially impede
or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or otherwise materially impede the rights of the Stockholders of the Company
under this Agreement. Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement
is void.

 



 

11.17 _Interpretation; Construction_.

 



 

(a) The table of contents, captions and headings herein are for convenience of
reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be
deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof.

 



 

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

 



 

(c) Matters reflected in any Section of this Agreement, including any section
or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter, are not necessarily limited to
matters required by this Agreement to be so reflected. Such additional matters
are set forth for informational purposes and do not necessarily include other
matters of a similar nature. No reference to or disclosure of any item or
other matter in any Section of this Agreement, including any section or
subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter, shall be construed as an
admission or indication that such item or other matter is material or

 



      
 

 



 

that such item or other matter is required to be referred to or disclosed in
this Agreement or the Company Disclosure Letter. Without limiting the
foregoing, no such reference to or disclosure of a possible breach or
violation of any Contract or Law shall be construed as an admission or
indication that a breach or violation exists or has actually occurred.

 



 

(d) As used herein, the term "made available" means, with respect to any
document, that such document was in the Companys electronic data room
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on or prior to the
