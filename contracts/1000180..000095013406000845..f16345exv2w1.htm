AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION 

   

 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION, dated as of October 20, 2005 (this " _Agreement_ "), by and among SanDisk Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _SanDisk_ "), Matrix Semiconductor, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Matrix_ "), Mike Acquisition Company LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of SanDisk (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Bruce Dunlevie, as a representative of Matrixs stockholders (the " _Stockholder Representative_ "). 

  

RECITALS 

   

 The board of directors of each of Matrix, SanDisk and Merger Sub have determined that the Merger (as defined in Section 1.1) would be advisable and in the best interests of the stockholders of their respective companies, and subject to the terms and conditions, set forth in this Agreement, and, in furtherance thereof, have approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 In order to induce SanDisk to enter into this Agreement, certain stockholders of Matrix are executing and delivering binding Support Agreements concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement. 

  

 Matrix and SanDisk intend that the Merger qualify as a "reorganization" under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "). This Agreement is adopted as a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a). 

  

AGREEMENT 

   

 In consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in this Agreement, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE 1 
 THE MERGER 

   

 1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") and the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (the " _LLC Act_ "), Matrix shall be merged with and into Merger Sub (the " _Merger_ ") at the effective time of the Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ") which shall be the time of Closing (as defined in Section 1.2) unless otherwise agreed by both parties as set forth in the certificate of merger, substantially in the form of _Exhibit A_ (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), to be filed if, as and when the Closing occurs with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Secretary_ "). Merger Sub shall be the surviving company (sometimes referred to as the " _Surviving Company_ ") in the Merger. If Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2T, or Treasury Regulations substantially to the same effect, are not effective at the time of Closing and the Merger cannot be consummated as a "reorganization" under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code, then (a) Merger Sub shall be converted under applicable law into a corporation, (b) the Merger shall be effected through the merger of the 

   ##### 

  

    

Merger Sub with and into Matrix (the "Reverse Merger"), and (c) Matrix shall
be the Surviving Company in the Reverse Merger. In the event of the Reverse
Merger, Section 5.3(c) shall not apply. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
SanDisk may change the structure of the Merger to a forward merger with
Matrix merging with and into SanDisk and SanDisk surviving the Merger. In such
event, SanDisk, as the surviving company after the Merger, may be referred to
as the Surviving Company. 

   

 1.2 Closing. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place as soon as practicable, and no more than two business days, after the satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE 5 or at such other time as the parties agree in writing. The Closing shall take place at the offices of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati PC (" _WSGR_ "), 650 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, California, or at such other location as the parties agree. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is herein referred to as the " _Closing Date_." 

  

 1.3 Effects of the Merger. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger, the applicable provisions of the DGCL and the LLC Act. 

   

 (b) At the Effective Time, the certificate of formation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of formation of the Surviving Company until thereafter amended as provided by the LLC Act and such certificate of formation;  _provided_ , _however_ , that at the Effective Time the certificate of formation of the Surviving Company shall be amended so that the name of the Surviving Company shall be "Matrix Semiconductor LLC." 

   

 (c) At the Effective Time, the operating agreement of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the operating agreement of the Surviving Company until thereafter amended as provided by the LLC Act, the certificate of formation of the Surviving Company and such operating agreement. 

   

 (d) At the Effective Time, the member of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the member of the Surviving Company for so long as provided under the LLC Act, the certificate of formation of the Surviving Company and the operating agreement of the Surviving Company. 

   

 1.4 Effects on Capital Stock and Membership Units. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, SanDisk, Matrix or the holders of any of the following securities, the following shall occur: 

  

 (a) Each share of capital stock of Matrix (the " _Matrix Capital Stock_ ") that is owned by Matrix, SanDisk, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 8.4(i) herein) shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. 

   

 (b) Each membership unit of Merger Sub (a " _Merger Sub Unit_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued,  

  ##### 

  

    

fully paid and nonassessable membership unit of the Surviving Company. Each
certificate evidencing ownership of Merger Sub Units shall evidence ownership
of membership units in the Surviving Company. 

   

 (c) (i) Each issued and outstanding share of Matrix Capital Stock (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 1.4 and Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 1.7)) shall be converted into the right to receive the portion of the consideration specified in Section 1.4(c)(ii) (the " _Merger Consideration_ ") as determined in Section 1.4(c)(iii). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Matrix Capital Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate formerly representing any such shares of Matrix Capital Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration as allocated in this Section 1.4 upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 1.5. 

   

 (ii) SanDisk shall issue (or, in the case of rights to acquire shares, commit to issue) in the aggregate, on account of all shares of Matrix Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and all rights (including options and warrants) to acquire shares of Matrix Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, excluding the Restricted Stock Units to be granted pursuant to Section 4.20(a), and the Additional Restricted Stock Units to be granted pursuant to Section 4.22, if any, a maximum number of shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of SanDisk (together with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock Purchase Rights attached thereto, " _SanDisk Common Stock_ "), equal to (A) $228,524,655 divided by (B) the SanDisk Closing Price (such maximum number of shares, the " _Maximum SanDisk Shares_ "). For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _SanDisk Closing Price_ " shall mean the Average SanDisk Trading Price (as defined below); _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) if the Average SanDisk Trading Price is less than $44.8866, then the SanDisk Closing Price shall be deemed to be $44.8866, or (2) if the Average SanDisk Trading Price is greater than $54.8614, then the SanDisk Closing Price shall be deemed to be $54.8614. The " _Average SanDisk Trading Price_ " shall be the weighted average closing price of the SanDisk Common Stock (as reported, absent manifest error, on Nasdaq.com) with respect to the five consecutive trading days ending on and including the trading day that is two trading days preceding the day on which the Closing Date occurs. A portion of the Merger Consideration equal to such number of shares of SanDisk Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the quotient of $10,000,000 divided by the SanDisk Closing Price shall be deposited at the Closing (the " _Escrow Fund_ ") with ComputerShare Trust Company, Inc., as escrow agent (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), in accordance with an Escrow Agreement, dated as of the Closing Date, substantially in the form of  _Exhibit B_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), by and among SanDisk, the Escrow Agent and the Stockholder Representative. The Escrow Fund will be held and distributed in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and ARTICLE 7 of this Agreement. 

  

 (iii) The Merger Consideration shall be allocated as follows: 

   

 (A) Each share of Series G Preferred Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, after giving effect to any and all
conversions of Matrix Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 1.4(c)(iii),
shall, subject to and in accordance with Sections 1.5(b) and 1.6, be
converted into 

   ##### 

   

   

the right to receive, and become exchangeable for, shares of SanDisk
Common Stock with an aggregate value equal to (1) $1.44 ($1.44 times the
issued and outstanding shares of Series G Preferred Stock immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be referred to herein as the " _Series G
Liquidation Preference_") plus (2) the Common Price Per Share; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall each share of Series G Preferred Stock
receive Merger Consideration having an aggregate value greater than $7.20. If
the Matrix Common Stock issuable upon conversion of any share of Series G
Preferred Stock would be entitled to receive Merger Consideration with an
aggregate value that is greater than $7.20, were such preferred
share converted prior to the Effective Time, then, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, such share of Series G Preferred Stock shall be converted
into Matrix Common Stock pursuant to Matrixs certificate of incorporation. 

   

 (B) Each share of Series E Preferred Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, after giving effect to any and all
conversions of Matrix Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 1.4(c)(iii),
shall, subject to and in accordance with Sections 1.5(b) and 1.6, be
converted into the right to receive, and become exchangeable for, shares of
SanDisk Common Stock with an aggregate value equal to (1) $1.2784 ($1.2784
times the issued and outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be referred to herein as the "
_Series E Liquidation Preference_") plus (2) the Common Price Per Share; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall each share of Series E
Preferred Stock receive Merger Consideration having an aggregate value
greater than $6.392. If the Matrix Common Stock issuable upon conversion of
any share of Series E Preferred Stock would be entitled to receive Merger
Consideration with an aggregate value that is greater than $6.392, were such
preferred share converted prior to the Effective Time, then, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, such share of Series E Preferred Stock shall be
converted into Matrix Common Stock pursuant to Matrixs certificate of
incorporation. 

   

 (C) Each share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, after giving effect to any and all
conversions of Matrix Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 1.4(c)(iii),
shall, subject to and in accordance with Sections 1.5(b) and 1.6, be
converted into the right to receive, and become exchangeable for, shares of
SanDisk Common Stock with an aggregate value equal to $1.00 ($1.00 times the
issued and outstanding shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be referred to herein as the " _Series A-1
Liquidation Preference_"). If the Matrix Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of any share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock would be entitled
to receive Merger Consideration with an aggregate value that is greater than
$1.00, were such share converted prior to the Effective Time, then,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, such share of Series A-1 Preferred
Stock shall be converted into Matrix Common Stock pursuant to Matrixs
certificate of incorporation. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (D) Each share of Series B-1 Preferred Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, after giving effect to any and all
conversions of Matrix Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 1.4(c)(iii),
shall, subject to and in accordance with Sections 1.5(b) and 1.6, be
converted into the right to receive, and become exchangeable for, shares of
SanDisk Common Stock with an aggregate value equal to $9.88 ($9.88 times the
issued and outstanding shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be referred to herein as the " _Series B-1
Liquidation Preference_"). If the Matrix Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of any share of Series B-1 Preferred Stock would be entitled
to receive Merger Consideration with an aggregate value that is greater than

 1.5 Exchange of Certificates. 

  

 (a) At or prior to the Closing, SanDisk shall enter into an agreement with ComputerShare Trust Company, Inc. (or such other bank or trust company in the United States as may be designated by SanDisk, the " _Exchange Agent_ "), which shall provide that SanDisk shall promptly after the Effective Time, make available to the Exchange Agent shares of SanDisk Common Stock and cash in amounts and at the times necessary for the payment of the Merger Consideration as specified and allocated in Section 1.4 upon surrender of Certificates; _provided_ that, on behalf of the former Matrix Stockholders, SanDisk shall deposit into the Escrow Fund a number of shares equal to the Escrow Amount (as defined in the Escrow Agreement). It being understood that any and all interest earned on funds made available to the Exchange Agent in accordance with this Agreement shall be turned over to SanDisk. 

   

 (b) At the Closing or within five business days after the Closing, the Exchange Agent shall deliver or mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as SanDisk and Matrix may reasonably specify and agree) and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering Certificates in exchange for consideration specified and allocated in Section 1.4. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration into which the shares formerly  

   ##### 

  

  

  

represented by such Certificate shall have been converted in accordance with
Section 1.4 (less any shares of SanDisk Common Stock deposited into the
Escrow Fund) as set forth on the Spreadsheet (as defined in Section 4.14),
and the Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled. SanDisk will request
that the Exchange Agent deliver the applicable portion of the Merger
Consideration as promptly as practicable to the holders of surrendered
Certificates, and upon the Stockholder Representatives reasonable request,
will reiterate its request. If a transfer of ownership of shares of Matrix
Capital Stock has not been registered in Matrixs transfer records, payment
may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate
so surrendered is registered if such Certificate is properly endorsed or
otherwise is in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such
issuance shall pay any transfer or other Tax (as defined in Section
2.9(a)) required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of SanDisk that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Other than interest earned that becomes part of the Escrow Fund, no interest
shall be paid or will accrue on the cash payable to holders of Certificates
in accordance with the provisions of this ARTICLE 1. 

   

 (c) All shares of SanDisk Common Stock issued and all cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this ARTICLE 1 (including shares of SanDisk Common Stock deposited into the Escrow Fund) shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Matrix Capital Stock represented by such Certificates, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Company of the shares of Matrix Capital Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this ARTICLE 1, except as otherwise provided by law. 

   

 (d) None of SanDisk, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person with respect to any cash delivered to a public official in accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which any amounts payable in accordance with this ARTICLE 1 would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 2.3), any such amounts shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Company, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 (e) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by SanDisk, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as SanDisk may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect thereto. 

   

 (f) The Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable in accordance with this Agreement to any former holder of shares of Matrix Capital Stock such amounts as the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent reasonably believes is required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To   ##### 

  

    

the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
taxing authority by the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the shares of Matrix Capital Stock in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving
Company or the Exchange Agent. 

   

 1.6 Fractional Shares. No fraction of a share of SanDisk Common Stock will be issued in connection with the Merger, and in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Matrix Capital Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of SanDisk Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of SanDisk Common Stock to be received by such holder) shall receive from SanDisk an amount of cash equal to such fraction of a share multiplied by the SanDisk Closing Price. 

  

 1.7 Dissenting Shares. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary and unless otherwise provided by applicable law, shares of Matrix Capital Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are owned by stockholders who have properly perfected their rights of appraisal in accordance with the provisions of applicable law (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until such stockholders shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their right of payment under applicable law, but, instead, the holders thereof shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the applicable provisions of law. If any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right of appraisal, each share of Matrix Capital Stock held by such stockholder shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into the right to receive and become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration specified and allocated in Section 1.4. 

   

 (b) Matrix shall give SanDisk (i) prompt notice of any objections filed in accordance with applicable law received by Matrix, withdrawals of such objections and any other instruments served in connection with such objections in accordance with applicable law and received by Matrix or its representatives and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to objections under applicable law consistent with Matrixs obligations thereunder. Matrix shall not, except with the prior written consent of SanDisk, (i) voluntarily make any payment with respect to any such objection, (ii) offer to settle or settle any such objection or (iii) waive any failure by a former Matrix stockholder to timely deliver a written objection or other act perfecting appraisal rights in accordance with applicable law.

 (b) Neither the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will: (i) materially impair the right of the Surviving Company to use, possess, sell or license any Matrix IP Right or portion thereof as Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries currently uses, possesses, sells or licenses such Matrix IP Right or portion thereof immediately prior to the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or consummation of the Merger; or (ii) cause any royalties, honoraria, fees or other payments to be payable by Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person (other than salaries payable to employees and independent contractors not contingent on or related to use of their work product) as a result of the ownership, use, possession, license-in, sale, marketing, advertising or disposition of any Matrix IP Rights by Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries to the extent necessary for the conduct of Matrixs and its Subsidiaries respective businesses as currently conducted by Matrix and its Subsidiaries, except for those royalties, honoraria, fees or payments that would be payable in the absence of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. After the Closing, all Matrix-Owned IP Rights will be fully transferable, alienable or licensable by the Surviving Company without restriction and without payment of any kind to any third party. 

   

 (c) Section 2.8(c) of the Matrix Disclosure Letter sets forth a list (by name and product SKU or version number) of each of the products and services currently produced, manufactured, marketed, licensed, sold, furnished or distributed by Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries (excluding third-party products or services resold or distributed by Matrix or its Subsidiaries) (each a " _Matrix Product or Service_ "). To the Knowledge of Matrix, neither the operation of Matrixs or any of its Subsidiaries businesses as currently conducted by Matrix and its Subsidiaries nor the use, development, manufacture, marketing, license, sale or furnishing of   ##### 

  

  

  

any Matrix Product or Service currently licensed, used, sold, provided or
furnished by Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries (i) violates any Contract
between Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries and any Person, or (ii) infringes
or misappropriates any Intellectual Property right of any Person. To the
Knowledge of Matrix, the development of any Matrix Product or Service, as
currently being conducted by Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries, does not (i)
violate any Contract between Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries and any
Person, or (ii) infringe or misappropriate, any Intellectual Property rights
of any Person. Neither Matrix nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
notice asserting that any Matrix IP Right or the proposed use, sale, license
or disposition of any Matrix Product or Service conflicts with or infringes
the Intellectual Property or other rights of any Person, nor to the Knowledge
of Matrix, is there any reasonable basis for any such assertion, and neither
Matrix nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice from any Person
offering a license under any Intellectual Property or other right to avoid
litigation or other claims. 

   

 (d) No current or former employee, consultant or independent contractor (who provides services to Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries on a fee for service basis) of Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries: (i) is, to the Knowledge of Matrix, in material violation of any term or covenant of any employment contract, patent disclosure agreement, invention assignment agreement, nondisclosure agreement, noncompetition agreement or any other Contract with any third party by virtue of such employees, consultants or independent contractors being employed by, or performing services for, Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries or using Trade Secrets or other Intellectual Property of others without permission; (ii) has, to the Knowledge of Matrix, developed any technology, Software or other copyrightable, patentable or otherwise proprietary work for Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries that is subject to any Contract under which such employee, consultant or independent contractor has assigned or otherwise granted to any third party any Intellectual Property or other right in or to such technology, Software or other copyrightable, patentable or otherwise proprietary work; (iii) has failed to execute and deliver to Matrix or one of its Subsidiaries an enforceable Contract regarding the protection of Matrixs or its Subsidiaries Trade Secrets and other Intellectual Property rights (and in the case of Trade Secrets and other Intellectual Property rights of Matrixs and its Subsidiaries customers and business partners, to the extent required by such customers and business partners); or (iv) has failed to deliver an enforceable written Contract assigning to Matrix or one of its Subsidiaries the rights to such employees, consultants or independent contractors contributions to the Matrix IP Rights arising out of services performed by such Person for Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries that may be owned by such Persons or that Matrix or one of its Subsidiaries does not otherwise own by operation of law. To the Knowledge of Matrix, neither the employment of any employee of Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries, nor the use by Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries of the services of any consultant or independent contractor subjects Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries to any obligation to any third party for improperly soliciting such employee, consultant or independent contractor to work for Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries, whether such obligation is contractual or otherwise. 

   

 (e) Matrix and each of its Subsidiaries has taken all necessary and appropriate steps to protect, preserve and maintain the secrecy and confidentiality of material Matrix-Owned IP Rights and to preserve and maintain all Matrixs and its Subsidiaries interests, proprietary rights and material Trade Secrets included among Matrix-Owned IP Rights. No current or former employee, officer, director, consultant or independent contractor of Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries has any right, license, claim or interest whatsoever in or with respect to any Matrix- 

     ##### 

 

   

Owned IP Rights. To the extent that any Intellectual Property developed or
otherwise owned by a third party is incorporated into, integrated or bundled
with, or used by Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries in the development,
manufacture or compilation of any of Matrix Products or Services (" _Third
Party Product Technology_ "), Matrix or one of its Subsidiaries has a written
agreement with such third party with respect thereto under which Matrix or
one of its Subsidiaries either (i) has obtained complete, unencumbered
(except as set forth in Section 2.8(g)(1) of the Matrix Disclosure Letter)
and unrestricted ownership of, and is the exclusive owner of, or (ii) has
obtained perpetual, irrevocable, non terminable licenses (sufficient for the
conduct of Matrixs and each of its Subsidiaries respective businesses and
the use, manufacture, marketing, license, sale, furnishing or intended or
contemplated use of any Matrix Product or Service) to, all such third partys
Intellectual Property in such Third Party Product Technology by operation of
law or by valid Contract. Section 2.8(e) of the Matrix Disclosure Letter sets
forth a list and description of all Third Party Product Technology. 

   

 (f) Section 2.8(f) of the Matrix Disclosure Letter contains a true and complete list of (i) all worldwide registrations made by or on behalf of Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries of any Patents, Copyrights, Trademarks or Domain Names with any Governmental Entity, including Domain Name registries, (ii) all applications, registrations and filings made with any Governmental Entity in accordance with applicable law by Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries to secure, perfect or protect its interest in Matrix-Owned IP Rights, including all Patents, Copyrights and Trademarks, and where applicable the jurisdiction in which each of the items of Matrix IP Rights has been applied for, filed, issued or registered, and (iii) all inter parties proceedings or actions to which Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and, to the Knowledge of Matrix, ex parte proceedings or actions before any court or tribunal (including the United States Patent and Trademark Office or equivalent authority anywhere else in the world) related to any of Matrix-Owned IP Rights. All registered Patents, Copyrights, Trademarks and Domain Names held by Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries are in force and subsisting, and, to Matrixs Knowledge, valid and enforceable, and Matrix or one of its Subsidiaries is the record owner thereof. Matrix or one of its Subsidiaries is the exclusive owner of all Trademarks used in connection with the sale, licensing, distribution or provision of any Matrix Products or Services by Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries. Matrix or one of its Subsidiaries owns exclusively, and has good title to, all Copyrights that are included or incorporated into Matrix Products or Services. 

   

 (g) Matrix or one of its Subsidiaries owns all right, title and interest in and to all Matrix-Owned IP Rights free and clear of any and all liens, claims, charges, security interests, mortgages, easements, covenants, pledges, licenses, options, preemptive rights, rights of first refusal or first offer, proxies, levies, voting trusts or agreements, or other adverse claims or restrictions on title or transfer of any nature whatsoever (" _Encumbrances_ "), other than those Encumbrances listed in Section 2.8(g)(1) of Matrix Disclosure Letter. The rights, licenses and interests of Matrix and each of its Subsidiaries in and to all Matrix-Licensed IP Rights are free and clear of all Encumbrances, other than licenses listed in Section 2.8(g)(2) of the Matrix Disclosure Letter. 

   

 (h) Neither Matrix nor any of its Subsidiaries has transferred ownership of any Intellectual Property that is or was owned by Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries, to any third party, or knowingly permitted Matrixs or any of its Subsidiaries rights in such Intellectual Property to lapse or enter the public domain (other than through the expiration of registered 

    ##### 

  

    

Intellectual Property at the end of its statutory term or the publication of
applications or registrations relating to Intellectual Property as required
by applicable law). 

   

 (i) Except as set forth in Section 2.8(i) of the Matrix Disclosure Letter, none of Matrix, any of its Subsidiaries or any other party acting on behalf of Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries has disclosed or delivered to any third party, or permitted the disclosure or delivery to any escrow agent or other party of, any Matrix Source Code (as defined below). No event has occurred, and no circumstance or condition exists, that (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) shall, or would reasonably be expected to, result in the disclosure or delivery by Matrix, any of its Subsidiaries or any other party acting on behalf of Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries to any third party of any Matrix Source Code. Section 2.8(i) of the Matrix Disclosure Letter identifies each Contract under which Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries has deposited, or is or may be required to deposit, with an escrow agent or other third party, any Matrix Source Code. " _Matrix Source Code_ " means, collectively, any human readable software source code, or any material portion or aspect of the software source code, or any material proprietary information or algorithm contained in or embedded in or combined with, in any manner, any software source code, in each case that is included among the Matrix-Owned IP Rights. 

   

 (j) To the Knowledge of Matrix, there is no unauthorized use, disclosure, infringement or misappropriation of any Matrix IP Rights by any Person, including any unauthorized use by any employee or former employee of Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries. Except in connection with the sale or licensing of any Matrix Product or Service or pursuant to those Contracts set forth in Section 2.20(i) of the Matrix Disclosure Letter, neither Matrix nor any of its Subsidiaries has agreed to indemnify any Person for any infringement of any Intellectual Property of any Person by any Matrix Product or Service that has been sold, licensed to third parties, leased to third parties, supplied, marketed, distributed or provided by Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (k) No Matrix Products or Services or Software owned by Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries were developed by or on behalf of, or using grants or any other subsidies of, any Governmental Entity or any university, college, or other educational institution or research center, and no government funding, facilities, then-faculty or then-students of a university, college, other educational institution or research center was used in the development of any Matrix Products or Services or Software owned by Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries.

" _Public Software_ " means any Software that (i) is or is required to be distributed as free Software or open source Software ( _e.g._ , Linux) or (ii) requires as a condition of its use, modification or distribution that it be disclosed or distributed in source code form or made available at no charge.

 (m) Matrix has provided in writing to SanDisk all information relating to any problem or issue with respect to any Matrix Product or Service, which does materially and adversely affect the value, functionality or fitness for the intended purposes of the same. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the Knowledge of Matrix, there have not been and there are no defects in any Matrix Product or Service, and there are no errors in any technical documentation, specifications, manuals, user guides, promotional materials, drawings, flow charts, diagrams, benchmark test results, and other written materials associated with or used with any Matrix Product or Service, which defects or errors would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Matrixs or any of its Subsidiaries businesses as currently conducted by Matrix and such Subsidiaries.

 2.20 Material Contracts. Except for Contracts listed in Sections 2.10, 2.11 or 2.20 of the Matrix Disclosure Letter, neither Matrix nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any material contract (a " _Material Contract_ "), including:

 All Material Contracts are in executed written form and Matrix or the applicable Subsidiary has performed all of the material obligations required to be performed by it and is entitled to all material benefits under, and is not alleged to be in material default in respect of any Material Contract. Each of the Material Contracts is in full force and effect with respect to Matrix and its Subsidiaries, and to the Knowledge of Matrix, the third party to such Material Contract. There exists no default or event of default or event, occurrence, condition or act, which would reasonably be expected to result in the Surviving Company not enjoying all economic benefits that Matrix or its applicable Subsidiary enjoyed prior to the Closing and to which they are entitled post-Closing under any Material Contract.

Except for the warranties and indemnities contained in those Contracts set forth in Section 2.20 of the Matrix Disclosure Letter and warranties implied by law, neither Matrix nor any of its Subsidiaries has given any warranties or indemnities relating to products or technology sold or services rendered by Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries.

 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SANDISK AND MERGER SUB 

   

 Subject to the exceptions set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by SanDisk and Merger Sub to Matrix concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the " _SanDisk Disclosure Letter_ ") (which disclosures shall delineate the section or subsection to which they apply but shall also qualify such other sections or subsections in this ARTICLE 3 to the extent it is reasonably apparent from a reading of the disclosure item that such disclosure is applicable to such other section or subsection and each of such exceptions shall be deemed to be representations and warranties hereunder), SanDisk and Merger Sub represent and warrant to Matrix as follows: 

  

 3.1 Organization, Standing and Power.

SanDisk owns all of the issued and outstanding membership units of Merger Sub. Each of SanDisk and Merger Sub is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities 

   ##### 

  

 

makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to
be so qualified or licensed would not individually or in the aggregate have a
Material Adverse Effect on SanDisk or Merger Sub. 

   

 3.2 Capital Structure. The authorized capital stock of SanDisk consists of 400,000,000 shares of SanDisk Common Stock and 4,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share.

 3.3 Authority; Noncontravention. SanDisk and Merger Sub have all requisite corporate or limited liability company power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or limited liability company action on the part of SanDisk and Merger Sub.

The execution and delivery of this Agreement by SanDisk and Merger Sub does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, (a) result in the creation of a lien on any properties or assets of SanDisk and Merger Sub or (b) conflict with, or result in any violation of, or default under (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both), or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation, renegotiation or acceleration of any obligation or loss of any benefit under, or require any consent, approval or waiver from any Person in accordance with, (i) any provision of the organizational documents of SanDisk or Merger Sub or (ii) any Contract filed as an exhibit to SanDisk SEC Documents (as defined in Section 3.4) or (iii) any Judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance or rule or regulation applicable to SanDisk, Merger Sub or any of the respective properties or assets, which in the case of clause (a) and (b) would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on SanDisk and Merger Sub. No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity or third party is required by or with respect to Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, except for (A) the filing of the Certificate of Merger, (B) such filings as may be required under the HSR Act and any applicable foreign antitrust laws, (C) the issuance of the Merger Permit (as defined in Section 4.4(b)) by the California Commissioner (as defined in Section 4.4(a)), or if necessary, the approval by the SEC, and (D) those consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations or filings, the failure of which if not obtained would have materially and adversely affected SanDisks ability to consummate the Merger. 

   ##### 

   

  

 3.4 SEC Documents; Financial Statements. 

  

 (a) Since December 29, 2003, SanDisk has timely filed or furnished all reports, schedules, forms, statements or other documents required to be filed or furnished with the SEC (collectively, as amended, the " _SanDisk SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective dates (or if subsequently amended or supplemented, on the date of the amendment or supplement), each such SanDisk SEC Report complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the " _Exchange Act_ ") or the Securities Act of 1933 (the " _Securities Act_ "), as applicable, and none of the SanDisk SEC Documents, as of their respective filing dates, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except to the extent corrected in a subsequently filed SanDisk SEC Document. 

   

 (b) The financial statements of SanDisk, including the related notes thereto, included in the SanDisk SEC Documents (the " _SanDisk Financial Statements_ ") complied as to form in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto as of their respective dates and were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent throughout the periods indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by the SEC on Form 10 Q, 8-K or any successor form under the Exchange Act). The SanDisk Financial Statements fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial condition and operating results of SanDisk and its Subsidiaries at the dates and during the periods indicated therein (except that unaudited statements may not contain footnotes and were or are subject to normal and recurring year end adjustments). 

   

 3.5 Compliance with Laws. Each of SanDisk and Merger Sub is not in material violation of, and has not received any written notices of material violation with respect to, any federal, state, local or foreign statute, law, regulations or permits or licenses issued under such laws with respect to the conduct of its business, or the ownership or operation of its business which would reasonably be expected to a Material Adverse Effect on SanDisk. 

  

 3.6 Absence of Certain Changes. Since July 3, 2005, there has not occurred any change, event or condition that, individually or in the aggregate with any other changes, events and conditions, has resulted in, or would reasonably be expected to result in, a Material Adverse Effect on SanDisk. 

  

 3.7 Board Approval. The board of directors of SanDisk and the member of Merger Sub have approved this Agreement. No vote of SanDisks stockholders is required in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 3.8 Tax Matters. Neither SanDisk, Merger Sub nor any of their Affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action, nor does SanDisk or Merger Sub have Knowledge of any fact or circumstance, that would prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means a bona fide written proposal that did not result from a breach of Section 4.3(a) proposing a transaction involving: (x) the sale, disposition or acquisition of the business or assets of Matrix that in the aggregate contributed 90% or more of Matrixs revenue over the prior twelve months; (y) the issuance, disposition or acquisition of (A) any capital stock or other equity security of Matrix (other than Matrix Capital Stock issued to employees of Matrix upon exercise of Matrix Options in routine transactions in accordance with Matrixs past practices), (B) any option, call, warrant or right (whether or not immediately exercisable) to acquire any capital stock or other equity security of Matrix, or (C) any security, instrument or obligation that is or may become convertible into or exchangeable for any capital stock or other equity security of Matrix; in each of clauses (A) through (C), representing in the aggregate 50% or more of the voting power of Matrix; or (z) any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization or similar transaction involving Matrix that if consummated would result in any Person (other than SanDisk) beneficially owning 

    ##### 

   

    

50% or more of any class of equity securities of Matrix. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means any Acquisition Proposal that the
Matrix Board determines in good faith (after (i) consultation with its
independent outside legal counsel and a nationally recognized financial
advisor and (ii) taking into account all of the terms and conditions of the
Acquisition Proposal and this Agreement, including (A) any counterproposal by
SanDisk pursuant to Section 4.3(c), (B) the likelihood that the transactions
contemplated by the Acquisition Proposal will close in a timely manner, and
(C) the extent to which the financing for the transactions contemplated by
the Acquisition Proposal, to the extent required, is committed or is
reasonably capable of being obtained on the terms proposed) is more favorable
to Matrixs stockholders than the Merger or any counterproposal pursuant to
Section 4.3(c). 

   

 (c) SanDisk may, within two business days after its receipt of Matrixs written notification of the Matrix Boards intention to withdraw or modify in an adverse manner the Matrix Board Recommendation, make a counterproposal to Matrix. During the three business days following Matrixs receipt of SanDisks counterproposal (the " _Renegotiation Period_ "), Matrix shall consider and discuss in good faith with SanDisk all proposals submitted by SanDisk and, without limiting the foregoing, shall meet with, and cause its financial advisors and legal counsel from time to time as reasonably required by SanDisk to consider and discuss SanDisks proposals with SanDisk and its advisors, attorneys and other representatives; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Matrix Board shall not withdraw or modify in an adverse manner the Matrix Board Recommendation until at least the first calendar day following the third business day after the beginning of the Renegotiation Period.

Neither SanDisk nor Matrix shall have any obligation to litigate or contest any administrative or judicial action or proceeding or any Order beyond the earlier of (i) 180 days after the date of this Agreement and (ii) the date of a ruling preliminarily enjoining the Merger issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.

 4.11 Treatment as Reorganization. Prior to the Effective Time, neither Matrix nor any of its Subsidiaries, and prior to and following the Effective Time, neither SanDisk nor any of its Subsidiaries, shall take any action that would cause the Merger or the Reverse Merger to fail to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Each of SanDisk and Matrix shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make representations to Jones Day and WSGR, as applicable, substantially in the form attached as Section 4.11 of the SanDisk Disclosure Letter and Section 4.11 of the Matrix Disclosure Letter, respectively, or, in the case of the Reverse Merger, in a form that is customary in order to support the treatment of such a merger as a "reorganization" within the meaning of section 368(c) of the Code. 

  

 4.12 Employees. 

  

 (a) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Continuing Employees_ " shall mean all individuals who are employees of Matrix as of the Closing. SanDisk shall (i) cause each Continuing Employee who remains employed after the Closing to become eligible for coverage under SanDisks employee benefit plans as promptly as practicable after the Closing, but in no event later than 60 days after the Closing and (ii) allow such Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents to participate in SanDisks employee benefit plans on terms no less favorable than those provided to similarly situated employees of SanDisk and its Subsidiaries; provided that SanDisk may, at its option, continue the coverage of Continuing Employees under the Matrix 401(k) savings plan for such period as SanDisk determines. Continuing Employees shall continue to be eligible for coverage under the Employee Benefit Plans until they become eligible for SanDisks employee benefit plans as described in the preceding sentence. Base compensation plus sales commissions, if applicable, and, except as described in the two preceding sentences, benefits shall not be decreased for a period of at least twelve months following the Closing for any Continuing Employee employed during that period, except for 

    ##### 

  

 

decreases also applied generally to similarly situated employees of SanDisk.
SanDisk shall cause Continuing Employees to be credited with service for all
periods of service with Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the
Closing for purposes of any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement
made available to Continuing Employees by SanDisk (a " _SanDisk Employee Plan_
"). Such service shall be credited for all purposes for which service is
either taken into account or recognized under such SanDisk Employee Plans;
_provided, however_ , that such service need not be credited to the extent
that it would result in duplication of coverage or benefits. 

   

 (b) Promptly following the Closing (but no later than the first SanDisk board of directors meeting following the Closing), each Continuing Employee shall be granted options to purchase shares of SanDisk Common Stock in an amount and on the same terms and conditions as granted to similarly situated newly hired employees of SanDisk. 

   

 (c) In addition to the above, with respect to medical, dental and vision coverage, SanDisk shall (i) not impose any pre-existing condition limitation or eligibility waiting period on such Continuing Employees under any SanDisk Employee Plan providing medical, dental or vision coverage in which the Continuing Employees become participants after the Closing except to the extent that, as of the Closing Date, such Continuing Employee had failed to satisfy such limitation or waiting period under the applicable Employee Benefit Plan providing such medical, dental or vision coverage, (ii) credit such Continuing Employees with any deductibles and out-of-pocket expenditures paid under any such Employee Benefit Plan prior to the Closing Date for purposes of satisfying the deductible or out-of-pocket limits under such SanDisk Employee Plan and (iii) credit the accounts of such Continuing Employees under any SanDisk Employee Plan which is a flexible spending plan with any unused balance in the account of such Continuing Employee under the applicable Employee Benefit Plan. 

   

 (d) In the event that SanDisk plans to terminate any Continuing Employee without cause on or prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date, then such employee will receive severance benefits that would be paid to such employee under SanDisks severance plan in effect on the date of such termination (taking into account all periods of service with Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries). For the purposes of this Section 4.12(d), Section 4.20(a) and Section 4.21(a), "cause" shall mean (i) any act of personal dishonesty taken by the employee in connection with his or her responsibilities as an employee that results in personal enrichment to the employee or harm to SanDisk, (ii) the employees conviction of, or plea of nolo contendere to, a felony, (iii) the employees gross negligence or gross misconduct with respect to SanDisk, and (iv) violation by the employee of the employees obligations to SanDisk under restrictive covenants applicable to the employee (such as a confidentiality obligation, a covenant not to compete or an agreement with respect to discoveries and inventions or SanDisks code of ethics), (v) the employees abandonment of his or her employment with SanDisk, (vi) the employees breach of a material employment policy of SanDisk, which is not cured within three days after written notice thereof to the employee or (vii) the employees breach of any agreement with SanDisk not described in the preceding clauses of this sentence which is material and is not cured within thirty days after written notice thereof to the employee. 

   

 (e) Nothing in this Agreement shall create in favor of any Person any right to continued or future employment. 

    ##### 

  

  

 4.13 Assumption of Options; Assignment of Repurchase Rights. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, the Matrix Stock Plans and each Matrix Option under the Matrix Stock Plans that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, be assumed by SanDisk. Each option so assumed by SanDisk under this Agreement shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including, if applicable, the terms and conditions set forth in the Matrix Stock Plans and the applicable stock option agreement) as are in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) such option shall be exercisable for that number of whole shares of SanDisk Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of SanDisk Common Stock) of the number of shares of Matrix Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such option immediately prior to the Effective Time and the Common Exchange Ratio, and (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of SanDisk Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed option shall be equal to the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) obtained by dividing the exercise price per share of Matrix Common Stock at which such option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Common Exchange Ratio. It is the intention of the parties that the options so assumed by SanDisk hereunder qualify, to the maximum extent permissible, following the Effective Time as "incentive stock options" as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent such options qualified as incentive stock options prior to the Effective Time and that all options to be assumed pursuant to this Section 4.13(a) be assumed in a manner consistent with Section 424 of the Code, regardless of whether such options are "incentive stock options." Within ten days after the Closing Date, SanDisk shall issue to each Person who immediately prior to the Effective Time was a holder of an outstanding option under the Matrix Stock Plan a document evidencing the foregoing assumption of such option by SanDisk. 

   

 (b) At or before the Effective Time, SanDisk shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of SanDisk Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Matrix Options assumed in accordance with this Section 4.13. As soon as practicable (but in no event later than five days) after the Effective Time, SanDisk shall, to the extent permitted under applicable law, file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate forms) with respect to the shares of SanDisk Common Stock subject to any Matrix Options. 

   

 (c) All outstanding rights to repurchase unvested shares of Matrix Capital Stock that Matrix may hold immediately prior to the Effective Time (all such rights, the " _Repurchase Options_ ") shall be assigned to the Surviving Company and shall thereafter be exercisable by SanDisk upon the same terms and subject to the same conditions that were in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that, from and after the Effective Time, the shares subject to each Repurchase Option shall be the number of shares of SanDisk Common Stock equal to the product of the Common Exchange Ratio and the number of shares of Matrix Common Stock which would have otherwise been subject to that Repurchase Option at the time of exercise had the Merger not occurred, and the purchase price payable per share under that Repurchase Option shall be determined by dividing the repurchase price in effect for each share of Matrix Capital Stock subject to that Repurchase Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Common Exchange Ratio (with such shares and price per share being subject to 

    ##### 

  

 

adjustment to appropriately reflect any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend, reorganization, reclassification, combination,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to SanDisk Common Stock
occurring after the Effective Time); it being understood that,
upon exercising any Repurchase Option, SanDisk shall succeed to the entire
right, title and interest in and to all of the shares of SanDisk Common Stock
subject to such Repurchase Option following payment of the purchase price per
share payable under the Repurchase Option. 

   

 4.14 Spreadsheet. Matrix shall prepare and deliver to SanDisk, at or prior to the Closing, a spreadsheet in form reasonably acceptable to SanDisk and the Exchange Agent, which spreadsheet shall be dated as of the Closing Date and shall set forth, as of the Closing Date, the following information relating to holders of Matrix Capital Stock, Matrix Options and Matrix Warrants: (i) the names of all Matrix stockholders, optionholders, warrantholders and their respective addresses, (ii) the number and kind of shares of Matrix Capital Stock held by, or subject to the Matrix Options or Matrix Warrants held by, such Persons and, in the case of shares, the respective certificate numbers, (iii) the allocation of the Merger Consideration contemplated by Section 1.4, (iv) the number of shares of SanDisk Common Stock (or options or warrants to purchase SanDisk Common Stock) and cash issuable to each holder of Matrix Capital Stock, Matrix Options or Matrix Warrants, (v) the interest of each former holder of Matrix Capital Stock in the Escrow Fund, (vi) the vesting arrangements with respect to Matrix Options and Matrix Capital Stock subject to Repurchase Options, (vii) the exercise price per share in effect for each Matrix Option immediately prior to the Closing Date, (viii) the allocation and vesting schedule of the Restricted Stock Units (as defined in Section 4.20(a)) and (ix) the allocation and vesting schedule of the Cash Bonus Awards (as defined in Section 4.21(a)) (the " _Spreadsheet_ "). 

  

 4.15 Expenses. If the Merger is not consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the fees and expenses of its advisers, accountants and legal counsel) shall be paid by the party incurring such expense. If the Merger is consummated, except as set forth on Section 4.15 of the Matrix Disclosure Letter, the stockholders of Matrix immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be responsible for all fees and expenses of Matrix (including legal, accounting, investment banking fees and insurance premiums) in excess of the amounts set forth in Section 4.15 of the Matrix Disclosure Letter incurred in connection with this Agreement and transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Additional Matrix Expenses_ "). 

  

 4.16 Section 280G Matters. 

  

 (a) Matrix shall obtain and deliver to SanDisk, prior to the initiation of the procedure described in Section 4.16(b), an excess parachute payment waiver, in substantially the form contained in Section 4.16(a) of the Matrix Disclosure Letter, from each Person who Matrix reasonably believes is, with respect to Matrix, any Subsidiary and/or any ERISA Affiliate, a "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code), as determined immediately prior to the initiation of the procedure described in Section 4.16(b), and who might otherwise have, receive or have the right or entitlement to receive a parachute payment from Matrix, SanDisk or any ERISA Affiliate of Matrix or SanDisk under Section 280G of the Code. 

    ##### 

  

  

 (b) Matrix shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, at the Matrix Stockholders Meeting or, if the Matrix Stockholders Meeting has not been and will not be held, concurrently with securing the written consent of Matrix stockholders adopting this Agreement, the approval by such number of stockholders of Matrix as is required by the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) so as to render the parachute payment provisions of Section 280G of the Code inapplicable to any and all payments and/or benefits provided in accordance with agreements, contracts or arrangements that, in the absence of the executed waivers described in Section 4.16(a), would be subject to such parachute payment requirements (in a manner which satisfies all applicable requirements of such Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, including Q-7 of Section 1.280G-1 of such Treasury Regulations). 

   

 4.17 Affiliate Agreements. Section 4.17 of the Matrix Disclosure Letter sets forth those persons who, in Matrixs reasonable judgment, are or may be Affiliates of Matrix within the meaning of Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act. Matrix shall provide SanDisk such information and documents as SanDisk shall reasonably request for purposes of reviewing such list. Matrix shall deliver or cause to be delivered to SanDisk, as soon as practicable after the execution of this Agreement (and in any case at least five business days prior to the Closing Date) from each of the Affiliates of Matrix, an executed Affiliate Agreement in the form attached hereto as  _Exhibit C_. SanDisk shall be entitled to place appropriate legends on the certificates evidencing any SanDisk Common Stock to be received by such Affiliates pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and to issue stop transfer instructions to the transfer agent for the SanDisk Common Stock consistent with the terms of such Affiliate Agreements. 

  

 4.18 Director and Officer Indemnification. For a period of six years from the Effective Time, SanDisk will, and will cause the Surviving Company to, fulfill and honor in all respects the indemnification obligations of Matrix pursuant to (a) any indemnification agreements between Matrix and its directors and officers (the " _Matrix Indemnified Parties_ ") entered into prior to the Effective Time, (b) Matrixs certificate of incorporation and bylaws as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (c) the Surviving Companys operating agreement as in effect at the Effective Time. All rights with respect to exculpation and indemnification for the benefit of the Matrix Indemnified Parties in the Surviving Companys operating agreement will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that diminishes the obligations of SanDisk and the Surviving Company to the Matrix Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Section 4.18. 

  

 4.19 Further Assurances. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts, and shall cooperate with each other party, to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary or appropriate to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including the satisfaction of the respective conditions set forth in ARTICLE 5 and any amendment to this Agreement in the event the structure of the Merger is to be changed pursuant to Section 1.1. Without limiting the generality or effect of the foregoing and subject to the terms of this Agreement, in the event an injunction or other order preventing the consummation of the Merger shall have been issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, each party shall its use commercially reasonable efforts to have such injunction or other order lifted. Each party, at the reasonable request of any other party, shall execute and deliver such other instruments and do 

   ##### 

   

    

and perform such other acts and things as may be necessary or reasonably
desirable for effecting completely the consummation of the Merger and the

 (c) The Restricted Stock Unit Grants will be made after the Restricted Stock Permit is granted, no later than immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (d) At the Effective Time, the Restricted Stock Unit Grants outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, be assumed by SanDisk. Each such Restricted Stock Unit Grant so assumed by SanDisk shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including, if applicable, the terms and conditions set forth in the Matrix Restricted Stock Plan and the applicable restricted stock agreement) as are in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that each Restricted Stock Unit shall be exercisable for one share of SanDisk Common Stock. Within ten days after the Closing Date, SanDisk shall issue to each Person who immediately prior to the Effective Time was a holder of an outstanding Restricted Stock Unit under the Matrix Restricted Stock Plan a document evidencing the foregoing assumption of such Restricted Stock Unit by SanDisk. 

   

 (e) At or before the Effective Time, SanDisk shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of SanDisk Common Stock for

The amounts and timing of such Cash Bonus Awards shall be as specified in Section 4.21(a) of the Matrix Disclosure Letter unless otherwise mutually agreed upon between Matrix and SanDisk. Any Cash Bonus Awards that are to vest during the six-month period after the Closing Date shall immediately vest if the Continuing Employee holding such Cash Bonus Award is terminated without cause (as defined in Section 4.12(d)) by SanDisk or the Surviving Corporation. If any of the Matrix employees listed on Section 4.21(a) of the Matrix Disclosure Letter cease providing services to Matrix or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time, such Persons Cash Bonus Awards as set forth on Section 4.21(a) of the Matrix Disclosure Letter shall be re-allocated to the remaining Matrix employees listed on Section 4.21(a) of the Matrix Disclosure Schedule on a pro rata basis based upon the allocations set forth on Section 4.21(a) of the Mike Disclosure Letter (or such other basis as the parties may mutually agree). 

   

 (b) At the Effective Time, the Cash Bonus Awards outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, be assumed by SanDisk. Each such Cash Bonus Award so assumed by SanDisk shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions as are in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 4.22 Additional Restricted Stock Units; Additional Cash Bonus Awards. If (a) the Average SanDisk Trading Price is less than $44.8866 and (b) the aggregate value of the amounts to be received by the Persons listed on Section 4.20(a) and 4.21(a) of the Mike Disclosure Letter pursuant to Sections 1.4(c)(iii), 4.13(a), 4.20(a) and 4.21(a), as calculated pursuant to the Spreadsheet, is less than 17% of the Total Deal Value, then, prior to the Effective Time, Mike shall either (at the option of SanDisk) issue such additional number of Restricted Stock Units (the "Additional Restricted Stock Units") and/or make such additional Cash Bonus Awards (the "Additional Cash Bonus Awards") such that, after the issuance of such Additional Restricted Stock Units and/or the granting of such Additional Cash Bonus Awards, such Persons shall receive an aggregate value equal to 17% of the Total Deal Value pursuant to Sections 1.4(c)(iii), 4.13(a), 4.20(a), 4.21(a) and this Section 4.22 on a pro rata basis with respect to Schedule 4.20(a) and Schedule 4.21(a). For purposes of this Section, the term "Total Deal Value" shall mean the product of (x)(i) $250,000,000 divided by (ii) $44.8866, multiplied by (y) the Average SanDisk Trading Price.

SanDisk shall have the right in its sole discretion to settle any such claim;  _provided, however_ , without the consent of the Stockholder Representative, no settlement of any such claim with third party claimants shall be determinative of the amount of Losses relating to such matter. If the Stockholder Representative consents to any such settlement, neither the Stockholder Representative nor any stockholder or option holder of Matrix immediately prior to the Effective Time shall have any power or authority to object to the amount or validity of any claim by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person against the Escrow Fund for indemnity with respect to such settlement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any Losses incurred or suffered by the Indemnified Persons, directly or indirectly, as a result of such claim, may constitute Losses under Section 7.2, subject to the limitations in this ARTICLE 7. 

  

 7.9 Stockholder Representative. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, Bruce Dunlevie shall be constituted and appointed as the Stockholder Representative. The Stockholder Representative shall be the exclusive agent for and on behalf of the stockholders and option holders of Matrix immediately prior to the Effective Time to: (i) give and receive notices and communications to or from SanDisk (on behalf of himself or any other Indemnified Person) and/or the Escrow Agent relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any of the transactions and other matters contemplated hereby or thereby; (ii) authorize deliveries to SanDisk of shares or other property from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims asserted by SanDisk (on behalf of itself or any other Indemnified Person, including by not objecting to such claims); (iii) object to such claims in accordance with Section 7.6; (iv) consent or agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand mediation and arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to, such claims; and (v) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing, in each case without having to seek or obtain the consent of any Person under any circumstance. The Stockholder Representative shall be the sole and exclusive means of asserting or addressing any of the above and no former stockholder or option holder shall have any right to 

    ##### 

  

 

act on its own behalf with respect to any such matters, other than any claim
or dispute against the Stockholder Representative. The Person serving as the
Stockholder Representative may be replaced from time to time by the holders
of a majority in interest of the shares or other property then on deposit in
the Escrow Fund upon not less than ten days prior written notice to SanDisk.
No bond shall be required of the Stockholder Representative, and the
Stockholder Representative shall receive no compensation for his services.
Notices or communications to or from the Stockholder Representative shall
constitute notice to or from each of the stockholders and option holders of
Matrix immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (b) The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable to any stockholder of Matrix immediately prior to the Effective Time for any act done or omitted hereunder as the Stockholder Representative while acting in good faith and any act done or omitted in accordance with the advice of counsel or other expert shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The stockholders of Matrix immediately prior to the Effective Time shall severally indemnify the Stockholder Representative and hold him harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the Stockholder Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of his duties hereunder. After all of the claims of SanDisk against the Escrow Fund are satisfied, the Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to seek reimbursement from the Escrow Fund for all of his or her reasonable expenses incurred. 

   

 (c) The Stockholder Representative shall have reasonable access to information about Matrix and the reasonable assistance of Matrixs former officers and employees for purposes of performing his duties and exercising its rights hereunder, _provided_ that the Stockholder Representative shall treat confidentially and not disclose any nonpublic information from or about Matrix or the Surviving Company to anyone (except on a need to know basis to individuals who agree to treat such information confidentially). 

   

 7.10 Actions of the Stockholder Representative. Any notice or communication given or received by, and any decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of, the Stockholder Representative that is within the scope of the Stockholder Representatives authority under Section 7.7(a) shall constitute a notice or communication to or by, or a decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of all stockholders or option holders of Matrix immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each such stockholder or option holder; and each Indemnified Person and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any such notice, communication, decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction as being a notice or communication to or by, or a decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of, each and every such stockholder or option holder. Except for their gross negligence and willful misconduct, each Indemnified Person and the Escrow Agent are unconditionally and irrevocably relieved from any liability to any person for any acts done by them in accordance with any such notice, communication, decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative.

 (a) Any disputes shall be settled under the Rules of Arbitration (except as set forth below) of the International Chamber of Commerce (the " _ICC Rules_ ") and as modified in this Section.

 (b) The arbitration shall take place in San Francisco, California and shall be the exclusive forum for resolving such disputes, controversies or claims.

 (d) The arbitrator may appoint an expert only with the consent of all of the parties to the arbitration.

Such court proceeding shall disclose only the minimum amount of information concerning the arbitration as is required to obtain such acceptance or order. 

   

 (g) Except as required by law, neither any party nor the arbitrator may disclose the existence, content or results of an arbitration brought in accordance with this Agreement. 

   

 (h) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any party may apply to any US court or administrative body of competent jurisdiction to obtain a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, permanent injunction or other injunctive relief to protect its interests, without breach of this Section and without any abridgment of the powers of the arbitrator set forth above. 

   

 (i) Each party to this Agreement hereby agrees that in connection with any such action process may be served in the same manner as notices may be delivered under Section 8.2 and irrevocably waives any defenses it may have to service in such manner. 

   

 (j) The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Federal Rules of Evidence and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as applicable in the Northern District of California (except that where under such rules the court has discretion to waive or extend 

    ##### 

  

 

provisions thereof or deadlines therein, the arbitrator shall not exercise
that right without the written consent of SanDisk and the Stockholder
Representative). 

   

 8.12 IP Litigation; Jurisdiction; Venue. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the sole jurisdiction, venue and dispute resolution procedure for actions related to Losses based upon, arising out of or otherwise by virtue of, in whole or in part, Section 2.8 or Matrix IP Rights shall be the United States Federal Court for the Northern District of California, and the parties to this Agreement hereby consent to the jurisdiction of such court. Each of the parties agrees that process may be served upon it in the manner specified in Section 8.2 and irrevocably waives and covenants not to assert or plead any objection which it might otherwise have to such jurisdiction and such process. 

  

 8.13 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. WHETHER IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 8.11 OR 8.12 OR OTHERWISE, EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF. 

  

 8.14 Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms. Therefore, the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, at law or in equity.
