Merger (as defined in Section&nbsp;1.1) would be advisable and in the best interests of the stockholders
of their respective companies, and subject to the terms and conditions, set forth in this

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>3.2 Capital Structure</B>. The authorized capital stock of SanDisk consists of 400,000,000 shares

relief and other equitable remedies. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by SanDisk and
Merger Sub does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, (a)
result in the creation of a lien on any properties or assets of SanDisk and Merger Sub or (b)
conflict with, or result in any violation of, or default under (with or without notice or lapse of
