its Subsidiaries to provide, Buyer with copies of the environmental reports
listed on Schedule 6.13, which reports constitute, to Sellers' Knowledge, all
Phase I and Phase II environmental site assessment reports or other
environmental reports concerning the Real Property which have been created in

existence of any governmental audit or examination of any Employee Plan or
Compensation Arrangement or of any facts, which would lead them to believe that
any such audit, or examination is pending or threatened. There exists no action,
suit or claim (other than routine claims for benefits) with respect to any
Employee Plan or Compensation Arrangement pending or, to Sellers' Knowledge,
threatened against any of such plans or arrangements, and Sellers possess no
knowledge of any facts which could give rise to any such action, suit or claim.

amendment that is not the subject of a favorable determination letter would
affect the validity of an Employee Plan's letter; (ii) no liability to the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Company (other than premium payments due in the
ordinary course of the Plan's operation) has been or is expected to be incurred
by Sellers or any ERISA Affiliate; (iii) no Employee Plan ever has incurred an
"accumulated funding deficiency," as such term is defined in Section 302(a)(2)
of ERISA and Section 412(a) of the Code, whether or not waived, and otherwise
always has fully met the funding standards required under Title I of ERISA and
Section 412 of the Code; (iv) no "reportable event," as that term is defined in
Section 4043(b) of ERISA ever has occurred with respect to any Employee Plan;
(v) there are no unfunded liabilities with respect to any Employee Plan, i.e.,
the actuarial present value of all "benefit liabilities" (determined within the
meaning of Section 401(a)(2) of the Code) under such Employee Plan, whether or
not vested, does not exceed the current value of the assets of such Employee
Plan; (vi) no prohibited transaction, within the definition of section 4975 of
the Code or Title 1, Part 4 of ERISA, has occurred which would subject the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate to any liability; (vii) no condition or event
exists with respect to any Employee Plan that could subject the Company or an
ERISA Affiliate to the imposition of a lien on the assets of the Company or any
ERISA under the Code or ERISA; and (viii) all contributions, premiums or
payments with respect to each Employee Plan or Compensation Arrangement have
been made when due.

                                    6.18.7   Except as set forth on Schedule
6.18, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transaction contemplated hereunder, alone or in conjunction with another
event, including but not limited to a termination of any individual's employment
or service, will: (i) result in any payment becoming due to any current or
former director or employee of the Company; (ii) result in the acceleration of
vesting of any benefit to be provided any current or former employee or
director; (iii) or increase any benefits otherwise payable to any current or
former employee or director.

reasonably necessary to confirm that Sellers have not committed a Breach.
Sellers will afford Buyer and its Representatives reasonable access to the

one or more persons designated by Sellers. To the extent that Buyer or any of
Buyer's Representatives discovers that Sellers have committed a Breach, Buyer
will promptly notify Sellers of the basis for such Breach; provided, however,
that, no review, analysis or other activity conducted or information obtained or
provided pursuant to this Section 8.1 shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made by Sellers. Promptly upon any Seller becoming

to Buyer and shall use their Best Efforts to promptly remedy the same; provided,
however, that no such notification shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made by Sellers.

business organization, keep available the services of the current officers,
employees, and agents, and maintain the relations and good will with its
suppliers, customers, landlords, creditors, employees, and agents.

                           8.3      Absence of Change of Events. Except as set
forth in Schedule 6.20.9 and except in the ordinary course of business, between
the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Sellers shall not, and shall
cause the Company not to take any affirmative action, or fail to take any
reasonable action within their or its control, as a result of which any of the
changes or events listed in Section 6.20 hereof is likely to occur.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Buyer hereby consents to the Company's
amendment of the ESOP prior to Closing, to fully vest all active employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries who are participants in the ESOP, to spin-off
from the ESOP into a separate plan (the "Spin-off Plan") the portion of the ESOP
that, on the date of Closing, is invested in Shares allocated to the accounts of
the active employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and to terminate the
Spin-off Plan and distribute to the Spin-off Plan's participants their account
balances under the Spin-off Plan, to the extent permitted by law, in an
immediately available lump sum distribution, such amendment, spin-off and
termination all being conditioned on the Closing having occurred.

and the Closing Date, Sellers shall, and shall cause the Company to (i)
cooperate with Buyer with respect to all filings that Buyer elects to make or
are necessary pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements in order to consummate
the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, and (ii) cooperate with Buyer in
obtaining all Consents necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by
the Agreement.

                           8.5      No Bankruptcy. Sellers shall not cause the
Company to (i) enter an Order for Relief under the Bankruptcy Code or commit any
act of bankruptcy, (ii) file a proceeding for the appointment of a receiver for
the Company, (iii) make an assignment for the benefit of the Company's
