with any Tax claim relating to Taxes of any Acquired Entity for a Straddle Period and (ii)
Purchaser shall control any Tax claim that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse

acceleration of income or delay of deductions) that would increase HCA&#146;s liability for Taxes
pursuant to <U>Article&nbsp;VI</U> or results in a timing difference (<U>e.g</U>., an acceleration of
deductions or delay of income) that would increase Purchaser&#146;s liability for Taxes pursuant to
<U>Article&nbsp;VI</U>, HCA or Purchaser, as the case may be, shall promptly make payments to Purchaser
or HCA as and when Purchaser or HCA, as the case may be, actually realizes any Tax benefits as a
result of such timing difference (or under such other method for determining the present value of
any such anticipated Tax benefits as agreed to by the parties). Such Tax benefit for federal,
state and local income tax purposes shall be computed for any year using Purchaser&#146;s or HCA&#146;s, as
the case may be, actual tax liability.

other than the Real Property; provided, further, neither HCA nor Purchaser shall be required to
incur any additional expenses or liability in order to effectuate the like-kind exchange, and the
like-kind exchange shall not delay the Closing. HCA and Purchaser each agree to pay the other an

Entities is treated as a sale of assets (&#147;<U>Purchased Assets</U>&#148;) to Purchaser for federal tax
purposes, the parties agree that Purchaser shall prepare a preliminary allocation of the applicable
portion of the Purchase Price (and all other capitalized costs) among the Purchased Assets in
accordance with Code Section&nbsp;1060 and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (and any similar
provisions of state, local or foreign law, as appropriate) (&#147;<U>Tax Allocation</U>&#148;). Purchaser
shall deliver its preliminary Tax Allocation to the Seller within one hundred twenty (120)&nbsp;Business
Days after the Closing Date, and the Seller shall have thirty (30)&nbsp;Business Days after receiving
the preliminary Tax Allocation (&#147;<U>Seller&#146;s Review Period</U>&#148;) to object to the preliminary Tax
Allocation. If the Seller timely raises any such objections, Purchaser and the Seller will attempt
to resolve such objections in good faith; provided, however, that if Purchaser and the Seller are
unable to resolve such issues within thirty (30)&nbsp;Business Days after the end of Seller&#146;s Review
Period, then either Purchaser or the Seller may elect, by written notice to the other, to have the
objections resolved by the Selected Accounting Firm, whose decision shall be binding on the parties
in the absence of manifest error. If the Seller fails to object to the preliminary Tax Allocation
within the Seller&#146;s Review Period, then such preliminary Tax Allocation shall be deemed acceptable
to the Seller, and such preliminary Tax Allocation shall be binding upon the parties, unless
Purchaser in good faith determines that adjustments are necessary and so notifies the Seller in
writing of such adjustment(s). If Purchaser notifies the Seller of any adjustment(s), then the
Seller shall have the right to object to the adjustment(s) by giving written notice of objection to
Purchaser within ten (10)&nbsp;Business Days after receipt of Purchaser&#146;s notice of adjustment(s).
Purchaser and the Seller will attempt to resolve such objections in good faith within ten (10)
Business Days after Purchaser receives the Seller&#146;s notice of objection; provided, however, that if
Purchaser and the Seller are unable to resolve such issues within ten (10)&nbsp;Business Days, then
either Purchaser or the Seller may elect, by written notice to the other, to have the objections
resolved by the Selected Accounting Firm, whose decision shall be binding on the parties in the
absence of manifest error. Thereafter, Purchaser, the Seller, and their respective Affiliates
shall report, act and file Returns (including, but not limited to Internal Revenue Service Form
8594) in all respects and for all purposes consistent with such finally determined Tax Allocation.
Neither Purchaser nor the Seller shall take any position (whether in audits, Returns, or otherwise)
that is inconsistent with such Tax Allocation, unless required to do so by applicable law. Prior
to filing IRS Form&nbsp;8594 (asset acquisition statement under Section&nbsp;1060) with respect to the
transactions described herein, the parties shall provide to each other a true and correct copy of
IRS Form&nbsp;8594 which each intends to file with respect to the transactions described herein.
