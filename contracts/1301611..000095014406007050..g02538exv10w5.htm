 (ii) Purchaser shall deliver the other certificates and documents required to be delivered by Purchaser pursuant to _Article VIII_. 

  

 2.6 _Multiple Closings_. 

  

 (a) If the conditions precedent in _Article VII_ are met for all Facilities other than for certain Acquired Entities which are not a Hospital (the " _Associated Business_ ") whose operations are immaterial to the operation of the associated Hospital, the Closing will proceed with respect to all Acquired Entities other than the Associated Business in accordance with this Agreement (any such Closing, a " _Partial Closing_ "). From and after the Partial Closing, HCA and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to complete the acquisition of the Associated Business. From and after the Partial Closing HCA shall cooperate in any reasonable arrangement to provide Purchaser the benefit under any and all rights of the Associated Business including but not limited to economic benefits and control of management decisions until the earlier of the date described in clause (ii) below, and such time as the Associated Business is acquired by Purchaser as described in the remainder of this  _Section 2.6(a)_. If, after such Partial Closing and prior to the later of (i) termination of this Agreement and (ii) the date that is 180 days after the Effective Time of such Partial Closing, the conditions precedent in _Article VII_ are subsequently satisfied with respect to any such excluded Acquired Entities, Purchaser shall be obligated to consummate the purchase of and HCA shall be obligated to consummate the sale of all such excluded Acquired Entities for which the conditions in _Article VII_ have been satisfied at a Closing in accordance with and subject to _Article II_. Such Closing will be held within ten business days after satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Articles VII_ and _VIII_ with respect to such Acquired Entities, or such other date as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties hereto. Such Closing will take place without regard to whether the conditions in _Article VII_ have been satisfied for all such excluded Acquired Entities. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) In the event that (i) the parties conclude in good faith that HCA was not able to deliver the economic benefits of the Associated Business between the Partial Closing and acquisition of the Associated Business by Purchaser or (ii) the Associated Business is not acquired by Purchaser, HCA and Purchaser will negotiate in good faith to determine an appropriate adjustment to the Base Purchase Price as a result of such failure to deliver economic benefit or exclusion of an Acquired Entity. 

   

 (i) If the parties are unable to agree upon such a price reduction, (1) the Base Purchase Price will not be reduced as of the Closing Date, (2) the Partial Closing will not be delayed as a result of the parties inability to agree upon such adjustment, (3) the Base Purchase Price will be adjusted after the Closing in accordance with dispute resolution procedures agreed upon by the parties, and (4) HCA will be required to pay Purchaser interest on such price adjustment from the date of the Partial Closing to the date of payment of such price adjustment at the rate of interest set forth in _Section 2.3(e)_. Either HCA or Purchaser may initiate such proceedings to determine the adjustment to the Base Purchase Price at any time following the Partial Closing. 

  

 (ii) If the parties have not determined the amount of the price adjustment with respect to an excluded Acquired Entity as of the date of a subsequent Closing at which Purchaser acquires such Acquired Entity, the parties will negotiate in good faith to determine the amount of interest to which Purchaser is entitled for having delivered the Base Purchase Price for such Acquired Entity at an earlier Closing. Such amount will be equal to interest at the rate set forth in _Section 2.3(e)_ on the portion of the Base Purchase Price attributable to such Acquired Entity from the date of the Partial Closing until the date of the subsequent Closing. If the parties are unable to agree upon such amount, (1) the Closing for the Acquired Entity will not be delayed as a result of the parties inability to agree upon such amount, and (2) the amount of such interest payment will be determined after the Closing in accordance with dispute resolution procedures agreed upon by the parties. Either HCA or Purchaser may initiate such proceedings to determine the adjustment to the Base Purchase Price at any time following the Partial Closing. 

  

 (iii) If the parties have determined the adjustment to the Base Purchase Price applicable to an excluded Acquired Entity (and, if such adjustment shall have been determined after the Partial Closing, HCA shall have paid Purchaser the amount due under clause (A), above, in respect of such excluded Acquired Entity), at any subsequent Closing of the sale of such Acquired Entity to Purchaser, the Base Purchase Price for such Acquired Entity will be the previously determined adjustment amount.

obligation of any nature to the Acquired Entities except for (i) the
assumption of the Assumed Liabilities and Assumed Contracts for which
accruals or reserves will be appropriately included in the Closing Date

 5.14 _Tax Filings_. Prior to the Effective Date, HCA will cause the Acquired Entities, in accordance with applicable law, to file with the necessary federal, state and local Governmental Authorities those specific itemized registrations related to only Taxes as set forth on  _Schedule 5.14_ (" _Tax Filings_ ").

HCA acknowledges that the foregoing powers are coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable. Purchaser shall be entitled to retain for its own accounts any amounts collected pursuant to the foregoing powers, including any amounts payable as interest in respect thereof. Purchaser agrees to act in good faith in seeking to collect, assert or enforce any claim against any third party in accordance with this _Section 5.14_ and shall fully indemnify HCA with respect to the consequences of any of the actions of Purchaser taken pursuant to this Section.

Purchaser agrees that, at the sole cost and expense of HCA, except as provided in _Section 6.3(e)_, below, it will make available to HCA, its Affiliates and their respective representatives, agents and independent auditors such documents and information as may be in the possession of Purchaser and its Affiliates relating to periods prior to the Effective Time and will permit HCA, its Affiliates and their respective representatives, agents and independent auditors to make copies of such documents and information.

period, Purchaser will promptly deliver the applicable Books and Records to
HCA. 

   

 (c) Purchaser acknowledges that as a result of entering into this Agreement and managing the Facilities Purchaser and its Affiliates will gain access to patient and other information which is subject to Laws regarding confidentiality.

HCA and its Affiliates shall be entitled to remove from the Facilities any Books and Records, but only for purposes of pending litigation involving a patient to whom such records refer, as certified in writing prior to removal by counsel retained by HCA or its applicable Affiliate in connection with such litigation. Any Books and Records removed from the Facilities shall be promptly returned to Purchaser following its use by HCA or its Affiliates. 

   

 (d) After the Closing, Purchaser agrees to make available to HCA such of Purchasers employees as HCA shall reasonably request for the purpose of assisting HCA in the preparation of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the other components of the Closing Statement pursuant to _Section 2.3_ hereof (and otherwise complying with _Article II_ hereof) and in connection with the resolution of any objections or disputes with respect to the post-closing adjustments to the Purchase Price in accordance with _Section 2.3_.

All quoted terms used in this  _Section 6.4_ and not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms under the WARN Act. 

   ##### 

  

  

 6.5 _Employee Matters_. 

  

 (a) As of the Effective Time, Purchaser shall continue the employment of all of the then-current employees of the Acquired Entities (including employees of the Business who currently are employed by an HCA Affiliate other than an Acquired Subsidiary but who will be employed by an Acquired Entity as of the Effective Time in connection with the Reorganization) and, with respect thereto: (i) maintain the salaries and wages at the levels in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) provide benefits which are substantially similar to the benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Purchaser and its subsidiaries, (iii) recognize the existing levels of service and seniority for benefit plan purposes (including but not limited to paid time off, vacation, sick, extended illness and holiday time), and (iv) provide credit for purposes of eligibility, vesting and rate of accrual under its benefit plans, programs or policies for service with the Acquired Entities. With respect to any self-insured welfare benefit plans maintained by Purchaser that cover employees of Acquired Entities, Purchaser shall cause such plans to provide credit for any co-payments or deductibles paid by such employees and waive all pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting periods that might otherwise apply to such employees, other than limitations or waiting periods that have not been satisfied under any welfare plans maintained by the Acquired Entities for their employees prior to the Effective Date. HCA shall be liable for the retention bonus and severance packages with senior management of the Facilities described in  _Schedule 6.5_ (the " _Retention Bonuses_ "). The Retention Bonuses represent all of the retention bonuses and severance pay packages provided for senior management of the Facilities. Nothing in this Agreement shall require the Acquired Entities or Purchaser to provide any severance pay to recipients of the Retention Bonuses. 

   

 (b) With respect to employees of the Acquired entities whose employment is terminated by Purchaser within one year of the Effective Time, Purchaser shall provide severance benefits thereto that are equivalent to or better than the severance benefits typically provided by Purchaser. Purchaser shall provide, and retain full responsibility for, COBRA continuation coverage (other than with respect to flexible spending accounts) to any employee or former employee of the Acquired Entities who is an MandA Qualified Beneficiary (as defined in Treas. Reg. § 54.4980B-9) and eligible to receive such coverage as of the Effective Time or who becomes eligible to receive such coverage due to events that arise with respect to employees of the Acquired Entities after the Effective Time. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding any provision herein, no term of this Agreement shall be deemed to create any contract with any employee, or to give any employee the right to be retained in the employment of Purchaser, an Acquired Entity, or any related employer, or to interfere with Purchasers or an Acquired Entitys right to terminate employment of any employee at any time. Nothing in this Agreement shall diminish Purchasers rights to change or terminate its policies regarding salaries, benefits and other employment matters at any time or from time to time. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto, and employees are not intended to be and shall not be construed as beneficiaries hereof. 

   

 (d) HCA shall provide reasonable access and information to the Purchaser regarding the Company Plans that are sponsored and maintained by the Acquired Entities. With respect to the Company Plans that are sponsored by HCA or its Affiliates, and in which the Acquired Entities are merely participating employers, HCA and/or its Affiliates will take all necessary and appropriate action to terminate the participation of the Acquired Entities therein effective immediately prior to the Closing; provided, however, that HCA will take appropriate actions so that the employees of the Acquired Entities who are employed at the Closing will accrue benefits under the HCA Retirement Plan and the HCA 401(k) Plan for the 2005 fiscal year of such plans, provided that such employees are otherwise eligible for an accrual, and will fund any contributions required with respect to such accruals. With respect to Company Plans that are sponsored by an Acquired Entity, HCA will reasonably cooperate with Purchaser 

     ##### 

  

    

in evaluating such Company Plans and assisting Purchaser in determining the
termination or continuation of all such Company Plans in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, prior to the Closing. HCA
shall cause all Company Plans that are sponsored by an Acquired Entity to be
terminated effective immediately prior to the Closing, unless Purchaser
notifies HCA to the contrary. HCA will take all reasonable steps necessary in
connection with the above, including providing required notices to
participants and appropriate governmental agencies and adopting all necessary
resolutions and Company Plan amendments. Notwithstanding the above, no
provision of this Agreement shall require Purchaser to assume any Company
Plan or any portion thereof, or continue same after the Closing. 

   

 6.6 _Compliance Program_. Purchaser represents and agrees that, as of Closing, it has or will implement and maintain an effective program to prevent and detect violations of legal requirements applicable to the delivery of goods and services in connection with any health care benefits and that such a program will comply with the provisions of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines relating to corporate compliance programs and will be mindful of any applicable guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Purchaser agrees that it will maintain such program for no less than five years following the Effective Time. 

  

 6.7 _Tax Matters_. 

  

 (a) _Termination of Existing Tax Sharing Agreements_. HCA shall cause all tax sharing agreements or similar arrangements with respect to or involving the Acquired Entities to be terminated effective as of the Effective Time and, after the Effective Time, the Acquired Entities shall not be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder. 

   

 (b) _Payment of Taxes_. 

   

 (i) HCA shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all Returns of or which include any of the Acquired Entities (including any amendments thereto) with respect to any taxable period ending at or prior to the Effective Time (a " _Pre-Closing Period_ "). Such Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practices. HCA shall provide Purchaser with copies of all Returns of only the Acquired Entities upon the request of Purchaser. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, HCA shall pay any and all Taxes imposed on or with respect to any Acquired Entity for a Pre-Closing Period (including, without limitation, any Taxes imposed on any Acquired Entity as a result of having been a member of the HCA Affiliated Group, and any Taxes that are determined by income or earned surplus attributable to a Pre-Closing Period). Purchaser shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all Returns of or which include any of the Acquired Entities and shall pay all Taxes of any of the Acquired Entities for all taxable periods other than a Pre-Closing Period, except to the extent provided in the preceding sentence and in paragraph (ii) below. 

  

 (ii) For purposes of the immediately preceding paragraph (i) and this paragraph (ii), if, for Tax purposes, the taxable period of an Acquired Entity that includes the Effective Time does not terminate at the Effective Time (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the parties hereto will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, elect with the relevant Governmental Authority to treat a portion of any such Straddle Period as a short taxable period ending as of the Effective Time and such short taxable period shall be treated as a Pre-Closing Period for purposes of this Agreement. In any case where applicable law does not permit such an election to be made then, for purposes of this Agreement, Taxes with respect to the Acquired Entities for the Straddle Period shall be allocated to the Pre-Closing Period using an interim closing-of-the-books method that complies with Treas. Reg. Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(i) (assuming that such taxable period ended at the Effective Time) and treating such period as a Pre-Closing Period for purposes of this Agreement, except that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (such as the deduction for depreciation) shall be apportioned on a per diem basis. In the case 

   ##### 

  

 

of any Straddle Period described in the preceding sentence, Purchaser shall
provide HCA and its authorized representatives with copies of the completed
Return for such period and a statement certifying the amount of Taxes shown
on such Return that are chargeable to HCA (the " _Tax Statement_ ") at least
30 days prior to the due date for the filing of such Return (including
any extension thereof), and HCA and its authorized representatives shall have
the right to review and comment on at HCAs expense each such Return and Tax
Statement prior to the filing of such Return. HCA and Purchaser agree to
consult and resolve in good faith any issues arising as a result of
the review of such Return and Tax Statement by HCA or their authorized
representatives and to mutually consent to the filing of such Return. If the
parties hereto are unable to resolve any dispute within ten Business Days
prior to the due date for filing of the Return in question (including
any extension thereof), the parties shall jointly request the Selected
Accounting Firm to resolve any issue in dispute as promptly as possible. If
the Selected Accounting Firm is unable to make a determination with respect
to any disputed issue prior to the due date (including extensions) for the
filing of the Return in question, the Purchaser and the Acquired Entities, as
the case may be, may file such Return without the consent of HCA, subject,
however, to the obligation thereafter to file an amended Return reflecting
the final decision of the Selected Accounting Firm (which decision shall be
rendered prior to the expiration of the period during which an amended Return
may validly be filed with respect to the applicable taxable period). Not
later than five days before the due date (including any extensions thereof)
for payment of Taxes with respect to such Return, HCA shall pay to Purchaser
an amount equal to the Taxes shown on the Tax Statement as being chargeable
to HCA pursuant to this paragraph (ii). If HCA has disputed such amount,
appropriate adjustments shall be made to the amount paid by HCA in order to
reflect the decision of the Selected Accounting Firm in immediately available
funds not later than five days after such decision has been rendered. Any
decision rendered by the Selected Accounting Firm in accordance with this
Section 6.7(b)(ii) shall be binding and conclusive, and the any expenses
relating to the engagement of the Selected Accounting Firm shall be shared
equally by HCA and Purchaser. 

   

 (c) _Refunds and Tax Benefits_. Purchaser shall pay to HCA, within 30 days of receipt, any refund or credit (including any interest paid or credited with respect thereto) received by Purchaser or any member of the Purchaser Affiliated Group of Taxes relating to any Pre-Closing Period or portions of Straddle Periods at or before the Effective Time. Purchaser shall, if HCA so requests, at HCAs expense cause the relevant Acquired Entity (or other relevant member of the Purchaser Affiliated Group) to file for any refund or credit to which HCA believes it is entitled pursuant to this _Section 6.7(c)_. Any Proceeding with respect to such a claim shall be governed by the provisions of this _Section 6.7_, including the provisions of _Section 6.7(e)_. 

   

 (d) _Cooperation_. 

   

 (i) HCA, on the one hand, and Purchaser and the Acquired Entities, on the other hand, agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other or their respective representatives, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance (including access to books and records) relating to the Acquired Entities as is reasonably necessary for the preparation of any Return, claim for refund, audit or similar matter, or the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any proposed adjustment of Taxes. 

  

 (ii) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 6.7(b)(ii)_, if HCA and Purchaser disagree as to the matters governed by this _Section 6.7_, HCA and Purchaser shall promptly consult with each other in an effort to resolve such dispute. If any such disagreement cannot be resolved within 15 days after either party asserts in writing that such dispute cannot be resolved, the Selected Accounting Firm shall act as an arbitrator to resolve such disagreement. The Selected Accounting Firms determination shall be binding and conclusive, and any expenses relating to the engagement of such Selected Accounting firm shall be shared equally by HCA and Purchaser. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) _Post-Closing Audits and Other Proceedings_. In the case of any audit, examination or other proceeding (" _Proceeding_ ") with respect to Taxes for which HCA is or may be liable pursuant to this Agreement (other than a Proceeding relating to Taxes for a Straddle Period), Purchaser shall promptly notify HCA in writing of any such Proceeding, and Purchaser shall timely execute or cause to be executed powers of attorney or other documents necessary to enable HCA to take all actions desired by HCA with respect to such Proceeding to the extent such Proceeding may affect the amount of Taxes for which HCA is liable pursuant to this Agreement; provided that, in acting on behalf of the Acquired Entities, HCA shall take no position that Purchaser determines will result in any negative Tax consequence to Purchaser or the Acquired Entities after the Effective Time. HCA shall have the sole right to control any such Proceedings, (including any Proceedings to initiate claims for refunds of or credits with respect to any Taxes for which HCA is liable pursuant to this Agreement and that HCA believes are available) including the right to initiate any claim for refund or credit, file any amended Return or take any other action that it deems appropriate with respect to such Taxes (or refunds or credits). All costs and expenses incurred in connection with any such Proceeding shall be borne by HCA, and Purchaser and the Acquired Entities shall be reimbursed by HCA for any and all reasonable direct costs and expenses incurred by them in connection with such Proceeding. Any settlement of a Proceeding shall be made subject to Purchasers prior written consent. In the event that Purchasers consent is withheld, Purchaser will assume the control, costs and expenses of the Proceeding. If such Proceeding is ultimately resolved by payment of an amount in excess of the amount in the original settlement proposal (or receipt of a refund in an amount less than the amount in the original settlement proposal), Purchaser will pay the amount of such excess (or shall pay HCA the amount of such refund shortfall). If such Proceeding is ultimately resolved by payment of an amount less than the amount of the original settlement proposal (or a refund or credit in an amount greater than the original settlement proposal), HCA will reimburse Purchaser for its costs and expenses to the extent of such difference. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) HCA shall control all Proceedings in connection with any Tax claim relating to Taxes of any Acquired Entity for a Straddle Period and (ii) Purchaser shall control any Tax claim that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operation of Purchaser or the Acquired Entities for any taxable periods including or ending after the Closing Date, excluding a Straddle Period addressed in 6.7(e)(i). 

   

 (f) _Timing Adjustments_. In the event that a final determination (which shall include the execution of a Form 870-AD or successor form) results in a timing difference ( _e.g_., an acceleration of income or delay of deductions) that would increase HCAs liability for Taxes pursuant to _Article VI_ or results in a timing difference ( _e.g_., an acceleration of deductions or delay of income) that would increase Purchasers liability for Taxes pursuant to  _Article VI_, HCA or Purchaser, as the case may be, shall promptly make payments to Purchaser or HCA as and when Purchaser or HCA, as the case may be, actually realizes any Tax benefits as a result of such timing difference (or under such other method for determining the present value of any such anticipated Tax benefits as agreed to by the parties). Such Tax benefit for federal, state and local income tax purposes shall be computed for any year using Purchasers or HCAs, as the case may be, actual tax liability. 

   

 (g) _Parties Agree to Act in Good Faith_. HCA and Purchaser agree to act in good faith in accordance with Section 47-1-203 of the Tennessee Code Annotated in taking any actions pursuant to this Section 6.7. 

   

 6.8 _Tax Elections and Allocations_. 

  

 (a) HCA will join with Purchaser in making an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code, and any corresponding elections under state, local or foreign tax law (collectively, a " _Section 338 Election_"), with respect to the purchase and sale of Shares pursuant hereto. The parties understand and agree that the purchase of the Shares will be treated for federal income tax purposes as if 

     ##### 

  

    

the Acquired Entities had each sold all of its assets, with the result that
the tax consequences of such a "deemed sale" of assets shall be required to be
included in the consolidated federal income tax return of HCA. HCA will pay
any Tax attributable to the making of the Section 338 Election excluding any
state transfer or sales taxes arising therefrom, the payment of which is
addressed in _Section 12.1_ of this Agreement. To facilitate the Section 338
Elections, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller, at least 15 days prior to the
Closing Date, drafts of Internal Revenue Service Form 8023 and any similar
forms under applicable state, local and foreign income Tax law (collectively,
the "Forms"). HCA shall review such Forms and provide any proposed revisions
to Purchaser at least five days prior to the Closing. Purchaser and HCA agree
to negotiate in good faith such proposed revisions and to attempt to resolve
any differences between the Parties (it being understood, however, that such
determination and/or agreement by HCA and Purchaser is not a condition to the
obligation of a Party to consummate the sale and purchase under this
Agreement). Purchaser shall duly and timely file the forms as prescribed by
Treasury Regulation Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 or the corresponding provisions
of applicable state, local or foreign income Tax law. As soon as practicable
after the Closing Date and at least 60 days prior to the due date and filing
of Internal Revenue Service Form 8883 by either party, Purchaser shall
provide HCA with a draft of Form 8883\. HCA shall review such Form 8883 and
provide any proposed revisions to Purchaser at least 30 days prior to the due
date of such Form 8883 for either party. HCA and Purchaser agree to cooperate
in good faith to (i) determine and agree upon the amount of the "adjusted
grossed-up basis" of the Shares within the meaning of Treas. Reg. § 1.338-5
and (ii) determine and agree upon the proper allocations (the " _Allocations_
") of the "adjusted grossed-up basis" of the Shares among the assets of
the Acquired Entities in accordance with Treas. Reg. § 1.338-6. In the event
the Parties reach agreement as to the information to be reflected on such
Form 8883, the Form 8883 shall be revised and timely filed as required by
law. In the event the parties do not reach agreement on the information to be
reflected on such Form 8883, Purchaser and HCA shall submit such disagreement
to the Selected Accounting Firm whose decision as to the proper allocation
shall be binding on both Purchaser and HCA. The costs of such Selected
Accounting Firm shall be shared equally by Purchaser and HCA. 

   

 (b) Purchaser and HCA each agree to take any and all actions at or prior to Closing as the other shall reasonably request a reasonable time prior to Closing to help the other effectuate a like-kind exchange of the Real Property pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code, and/or Revenue Procedure 2000-37 (governing reverse like-kind exchanges), including, without limitation (i) entering into a like-kind exchange trust agreement authorized by a "qualified intermediary" or a qualified exchange accommodation arrangement authorized with a "qualified exchange titleholder", if necessary, (ii) paying the Purchase Price to the qualified intermediary to acquire the replacement property in accordance with the instructions of the qualified intermediary or to the qualified exchange titleholder in accordance with the instructions of the qualified exchange titleholder, as applicable, and (iii) assigning this Agreement or a portion thereof to one or more Affiliates of the Acquired Entities or entering into a separate agreement for the purchase of Real Property with one or more Affiliates of the Acquired Entities in order to effectuate a like-kind exchange; provided, however, that in no event shall Purchaser be required to take title to any real property other than the Real Property; provided, further, neither HCA nor Purchaser shall be required to incur any additional expenses or liability in order to effectuate the like-kind exchange, and the like-kind exchange shall not delay the Closing. HCA and Purchaser each agree to pay the other an amount equal to all additional third party costs and expenses incurred by the other as a result of effectuating the transactions contemplated hereby in the manner contemplated by this _Section 6.8(b)_ (including such costs incurred in connection with the negotiation of the like-kind exchange trust agreement or the qualified exchange accommodation agreement contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of the others agents, representatives, accountants and counsel). Any such amounts shall be paid promptly upon receipt of evidence of such costs and expenses. HCA and Purchaser each also agree to indemnify, defend and hold Purchaser harmless from and against any and all claims and other liabilities of any kind arising with regard to _Section 6.8(b)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided herein, neither Purchaser nor HCA makes any representations or warranties as to the 

     ##### 

  

    

tax treatment for the transaction contemplated in this _Section 6.8(b)_ or
the ability of the transaction contemplated to qualify for like-kind exchange
treatment pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code. In no event shall either
party be released from any liability under this Agreement by reason of
structuring the transaction as a like-kind exchange as contemplated by this
_Section 6.8(b)_. 

   

 (c) _Code Section 1060 Allocation_. To the extent the sale of any of the Acquired Entities is treated as a sale of assets (" _Purchased Assets_ ") to Purchaser for federal tax purposes, the parties agree that Purchaser shall prepare a preliminary allocation of the applicable portion of the Purchase Price (and all other capitalized costs) among the Purchased Assets in accordance with Code Section 1060 and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (and any similar provisions of state, local or foreign law, as appropriate) (" _Tax Allocation_ "). Purchaser shall deliver its preliminary Tax Allocation to the Seller within one hundred twenty (120) Business Days after the Closing Date, and the Seller shall have thirty (30) Business Days after receiving the preliminary Tax Allocation (" _Seller s Review Period_") to object to the preliminary Tax Allocation. If the Seller timely raises any such objections, Purchaser and the Seller will attempt to resolve such objections in good faith; provided, however, that if Purchaser and the Seller are unable to resolve such issues within thirty (30) Business Days after the end of Sellers Review Period, then either Purchaser or the Seller may elect, by written notice to the other, to have the objections resolved by the Selected Accounting Firm, whose decision shall be binding on the parties in the absence of manifest error. If the Seller fails to object to the preliminary Tax Allocation within the Sellers Review Period, then such preliminary Tax Allocation shall be deemed acceptable to the Seller, and such preliminary Tax Allocation shall be binding upon the parties, unless Purchaser in good faith determines that adjustments are necessary and so notifies the Seller in writing of such adjustment(s). If Purchaser notifies the Seller of any adjustment(s), then the Seller shall have the right to object to the adjustment(s) by giving written notice of objection to Purchaser within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of Purchasers notice of adjustment(s). Purchaser and the Seller will attempt to resolve such objections in good faith within ten (10) Business Days after Purchaser receives the Sellers notice of objection; provided, however, that if Purchaser and the Seller are unable to resolve such issues within ten (10) Business Days, then either Purchaser or the Seller may elect, by written notice to the other, to have the objections resolved by the Selected Accounting Firm, whose decision shall be binding on the parties in the absence of manifest error. Thereafter, Purchaser, the Seller, and their respective Affiliates shall report, act and file Returns (including, but not limited to Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) in all respects and for all purposes consistent with such finally determined Tax Allocation. Neither Purchaser nor the Seller shall take any position (whether in audits, Returns, or otherwise) that is inconsistent with such Tax Allocation, unless required to do so by applicable law. Prior to filing IRS Form 8594 (asset acquisition statement under Section 1060) with respect to the transactions described herein, the parties shall provide to each other a true and correct copy of IRS Form 8594 which each intends to file with respect to the transactions described herein. 

   

 6.9 _Certain National and Regional Contracts_. Certain Affiliates of HCA have entered into contracts and/or leases with third parties to provide equipment, supplies and services on a national or regional basis to HCA and its Affiliates, including certain of the Acquired Entities. Certain of such contracts and/or leases are listed on _Schedule 6.9_ (such contracts and/or leases, the " _National Contracts_ "). At the Closing, at the option of HCA, such Affiliates of HCA shall assign to Purchaser or the Acquired Entities, and Purchaser or the Acquired Entities (as applicable) shall assume, the rights, benefits and obligations of such Affiliates in, to and under all or a portion of the National Contracts to the extent they relate to the Facilities. 

  

 6.10 _Cost Reports_. From and after the Effective Time, the parties shall comply with the terms and agreements set forth in _Exhibit K-1_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 6.11 _Non-Competition_. 

  

 (a) Except as permitted in this _Section 6.11_ during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the second anniversary of the Effective Time, HCA agrees that it shall not, and shall cause each of its Controlled Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, (i) engage in the operation of any Competing Business located within the Territory, or (ii) acquire, lease, construct, develop or own any Competing Business located within the Territory, or (iii) be a controlling shareholder, controlling partner, controlling member or controlling equity holder of, exercise management control over, or acquire or maintain a controlling interest in, any Competing Business that is located within the Territory (items (i) through (iii) collectively, " _Restricted Activities_ "). 

   

 (b) This _Section 6.11_ shall continue to apply if HCA is acquired by or merged with or into any other Person that engages in Restricted Activities, but shall not apply to (i) any Restricted Activities of such other Person existing as of the effective time of such merger or sale (including the completion of (A) the acquisition, development or construction of a Competing Business, or (B) the acquisition of an interest in a Person that is engaged in Restricted Activities, that, in either case, is under way at the effective time of the merger or acquisition), (ii) expansions and extensions of such existing exempt Restricted Activities, or (iii) insofar as the Restricted Activities described in clauses (i) and (ii), above, are concerned, to such other Person or its Affiliates that engage in such Restricted Activities. 

   

 (c) Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to prevent or limit the right of HCA or any of its Controlled Subsidiaries to purchase, acquire, merge or consolidate with, by any means whatsoever (and, thereafter, to own or operate), any Person (or the assets of any Person) that engages in Restricted Activities so long as the Person or assets that are purchased or acquired have or include five or more general acute care hospitals, with at least 4 of such hospitals located outside the Territory. Additionally, the covenants in _Section 6.11(a)_ will not apply to (i) any Persons or assets, operations or facilities that cease to be owned, directly or indirectly, by HCA, including assets, operations or facilities that may be divested or spun-off by HCA or its Affiliates, (ii) any transitional services (including IT and billing/collections services) provided by or on behalf of HCA or its Affiliates to (A) any such Person or assets, operations or facilities referred to in clause (i) above or (B) any Persons in which HCA has, directly or indirectly, any non-controlling ownership interest. 

   

 (d) HCA recognizes that the covenants in this _Section 6.11_, and the territorial, time and other limitations with respect thereto, are reasonable and properly required for the adequate protection of the acquisition of the Acquired Company Ownership Interests by Purchaser, and agrees that such limitations are reasonable with respect to its activities, business and public purpose. HCA agrees and acknowledges that the violation of the covenants or agreements in this _Section 6.11_ would cause irreparable injury to Purchaser and that the remedy at law for any violation or threatened violation thereof would be inadequate and that, in addition to whatever other remedies may be available at law or in equity, Purchaser shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive or other equitable relief without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting bond. The parties hereto also waive any requirement of proving actual damages in connection with the obtaining of any such injunctive or other equitable relief. 

   

 (e) It is the intention of each party hereto that the provisions of this _Section 6.11_ shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and the public policies of the state in which the applicable portion of the Territory is located, but that the unenforceability (or the modification to conform with such laws or public policies) of any provisions hereof shall not render unenforceable or impair the remainder of this Agreement. Accordingly, if any term or provision of this _Section 6.11_ shall be determined to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, either in whole or in part, this Agreement shall be deemed amended to delete or modify, as necessary, the offending provisions and to alter the balance of 

    ##### 

  

    

this Agreement in order to render the same valid and enforceable to the
fullest extent permissible as aforesaid. 

   

 6.12 _Closing Conditions_. Purchaser will use its best efforts to cause the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ hereof to be satisfied as soon as reasonably practicable, but in all circumstances prior to Closing Date. 

  

 6.13 _Insurance Agreements_. HCA shall, or shall cause an HCA Affiliate to, offer to the Acquired Entities physician malpractice insurance coverage on the terms and conditions set forth in _Exhibit F_. 

  

ARTICLE VII 
 CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATIONS OF PURCHASER 

   

 Except as may be waived in writing by Purchaser, the obligations of Purchaser to purchase the Acquired Company Ownership Interests and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on the Closing Date shall be subject to the satisfaction on or prior to the Closing Date of the following conditions: 

  

 7.1 _Representations and Warranties_. 

  

 (a) All representations and warranties of HCA set forth in this Agreement (other than those set forth in _Sections 3.2(c)_, _3.2(d)_ , _3.3(d)_ and _3.3(e)_ ) shall be true and correct as of the Closing Date in each case as if made on and as of the Closing Date (except to the extent such representations and warranties specifically speak as of an earlier date, in which case as of such date); provided, however, that this condition will be deemed to be satisfied so long as the failure of such representations and warranties to be true and correct (without regard to any qualifiers with respect to materiality contained in such representations and warranties) as of the Closing Date would not reasonably be expected to have a Business Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (b) All representations and warranties of HCA set forth in _Sections 3.2(c)_,  _3.2(d)_ , _3.3(d)_ and _3.3(e)_ shall be true and correct in all respects as if made on and as of the Closing Date. 

   

 (c) If the effect of any failure or alleged failure of a representation or warranty of HCA to be true and correct can be remedied by HCA through the payment of money or the giving of an absolute first dollar indemnity to Purchaser and/or an Affiliate of Purchaser, and HCA pays such money or gives such an indemnity, the related failure or alleged failure shall be deemed waived by Purchaser. 

   

 (d) For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser agrees that (i) Purchaser shall not be excused from consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based on the failure or alleged failure of any representation or warranty made by HCA to be true except to the extent provided in clauses (a) and (b), above, (ii) Purchaser will not assert the failure or alleged failure of any representation or warranty made by HCA to be true as a basis for not consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless (A) the failure of such representations and warranties (other than those set forth in _Sections 3.2(c)_, _3.2(d)_ , _3.3(d)_ and _3.3(e)_ ) to be true and correct (without regard to any qualifiers with respect to materiality contained in such representations and warranties) as of the Closing Date would reasonably be expected to have a Business Material Adverse Effect, or (B) the representations set forth in _Sections 3.2(c)_,  _3.2(d)_ , _3.3(d)_ and _3.3(e)_ are not true and correct in all respects, and (iii) except for the conditionality provided by this _Article VII_, the sole remedy of Purchaser for any failure of a representation and warranty made by HCA to be true and correct is to be indemnified as and to the extent set forth in _Article IX_. 

     ##### 

  

     

 7.2 _Compliance with Agreement_. On and as of the Closing Date, HCA shall have performed and complied with each covenant and agreement required by this Agreement to be performed and complied with by it on or before the Closing Date; provided that this condition will be deemed to be satisfied unless both (a) Purchaser shall have given HCA written notice of such failure to perform or comply and HCA shall not have cured such failure to perform or comply within 30 days after receipt of such notice and (b) the respects in which such covenants and obligations have not been performed would reasonably be expected to have had a Business Material Adverse Effect. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser agrees that (i) Purchaser shall not be excused from consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based on HCAs failure or alleged failure to have performed and complied with each covenant and agreement required by this Agreement to be performed by HCA on or before the Closing Date except as provided in clauses (a) and (b), above, (ii) Purchaser will not assert the failure or alleged failure of HCA to have performed and complied with each such covenant and requirement except as provided in clauses (a) and (b), above, and (iii) except for the conditionality provided by this _Article VII_, the sole remedy of Purchaser for any failure of HCA to perform or comply with any such covenant or requirement is to be indemnified as and to the extent set forth in _Article IX_. In no event shall any dispute over a reduction in the Purchase Price based on the failure or alleged failure of HCA to comply with any such covenant or agreement delay or postpone the Closing. 

  

 7.3 _Closing Certificates_. HCA shall have delivered to Purchaser a certificate, dated as of the Closing Date and signed on behalf of HCA by a Vice President thereof, certifying the fulfillment of the conditions specified in _Sections 7.1_ and _7.2_.

 (b) the signature and incumbency of the respective officers of HCA and Seller Group authorized to execute and deliver this Agreement and the other agreements and certificates that HCA or Seller Group is required to deliver on or before the Closing Date pursuant to this Agreement.

 7.6 _Consents, Authorizations, Etc_. Purchaser shall have obtained documentation or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser that: 

  

 (a) Purchaser has (i) received all required Permits of Governmental Authorities that Purchaser must as a matter of Law receive prior to Closing in order to consummate the transactions contemplated herein; and (ii) received reasonable assurance from the applicable Governmental Authorities that such Permits as are required to operate the Facilities as currently operated by HCA and its Affiliates (other than Permits the failure of which to obtain would not reasonably be expected to have a Hospital Group Material Adverse Effect) shall be issued promptly following the Effective Time and be effective as of the Effective Time; and 

     ##### 

  

     

 (b) All waiting periods under the HSR Act and any similar state Law shall have expired or been terminated.

 7.8 _Good Standing Certificates_. At the Closing, HCA shall have delivered to Purchaser good standing certificates issued with respect to each of the Acquired Entities issued by the Secretary of State of the relevant entitys state of organization and qualification. Each such good standing certificate shall be dated as of a date that is not more than 60 days prior to the Closing Date. 

  

 7.9 _Services Agreements_. HCA shall have delivered to Purchaser executed originals of the Services Agreements with terms and conditions consistent with _Exhibit M_, and an executed original of the Computer and Data Processing Agreement, each in form and substance satisfactory to Purchaser.

 (a) _Title Work_. Within 30 days of the date of this Agreement, HCA shall cause to be furnished to Purchaser the Title Work for those portions of the Real Property listed on _Exhibit O_ together with legible copies of all exceptions to title referenced therein. The Title Work shall set forth the state of title as of each commitments effective date to the portions of the Real Property listed on _Exhibit O_, together with all exceptions or conditions to such title, including, without limitation, all easements, restrictions, rights-of-way, covenants, reservations, and all other encumbrances of record affecting such Real Property which would appear in an owners title policy or leasehold policy of title insurance, if issued. 

   

 (b) _Survey_. Within 30 days of the date of this Agreement, HCA shall cause to be furnished to Purchaser the Surveys for those portions of the Real Property listed on _Exhibit O_ , which Surveys shall be current as-built surveys of these portions of the Real Property listed on _Exhibit O_ (the " _Surveys_ "). The Surveys shall meet the requirements of an ALTA/ACSM survey as adopted in 1999 by the American Land Title Association and the American Congress on Surveying and Mapping, including Table A optional items 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7(a), 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 and 16.

The Survey shall contain a certification that except as shown thereon, the applicable portion of the Real Property is not located within the 100 year flood plain or other flood hazard area. 

     ##### 

  

     

 (c) _Defects and Cure_. The Title Work and the Surveys are collectively referred to as " _Title Evidence_ ". Purchaser shall notify HCA in writing within twenty (20) days after its receipt of the last of each component of the Title Evidence for each Facility of any liens, claims, encroachments, exceptions or defects (other than Permitted Encumbrances) disclosed in the Title Evidence to which Purchaser objects (collectively, " _Defects_ "). HCA, at its sole cost and expense, shall cure any such Defects on or before Closing (" _cure_ " shall include an endorsement to an owners or a leasehold policy of title insurance, as applicable, reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, either eliminating the Defect, insuring over the Defect or insuring against the effect of the Defect or an agreement by HCA that is reasonably acceptable to Purchaser to indemnify Purchaser with respect to the Defect) or HCA may elect to not cure the objections and shall give written notice to Purchaser within thirty (30) days of its receipt of Purchasers notice of Defects of its decision. Within 30 days of Purchasers receipt of notice from HCA of uncured Defects, Purchaser may waive such uncured Defects and close or, subject to the provisions of  _Section 2.6_, may terminate this Agreement as if it were a termination pursuant to  _Section 10.1(c)_. If HCA fails to timely give such notice, HCA shall be deemed to have elected not to cure the Defects, whereupon Purchaser may waive such Defects and close, or may terminate this Agreement with respect to the Facility affected by the Defect. Upon termination of this Agreement under the terms of this _Section 7.11_, no party to this Agreement shall have any further obligations with respect to the Facility affected by the Defect. 

   

 (d) At the Closing, HCA will cause to be furnished to Purchaser a pro forma of a current ALTA Form Owners Title Policy or Leasehold Policy, as applicable, (the " _Title Policy_ ") for those portions of the Real Property listed on _Exhibit O_ by the title insurance company providing the Title Work (the " _Title Company_ "). The Title Policies shall be issued as of the Closing Date in an amount equal to the portion of the Purchase Price being allocated to such portion of the Real Property and shall insure to the applicable Acquired Entity good and marketable fee simple or leasehold title, as the case may be, to such Real Property, subject only to the (i) Permitted Encumbrances and (ii) taxes for the current and subsequent years "not yet due and payable." The Title Policy shall have all standard and general exceptions deleted so as to afford full "extended form coverage" as permitted by applicable State title insurance regulations and shall contain such endorsements as Purchaser shall reasonably require in connection with its review of the Title Work and the Surveys, specifically including without limitation, a so-called non-imputation endorsement. HCA and its Affiliates shall execute such certificates and affidavits as may be reasonably necessary in connection with the issuance of the Title Policies as described in this _Section 7.11(d)_. HCA shall pay all premiums, costs and expenses of the Title Policies.

 7.14 _Resignations_. HCA will cause to deliver to Purchaser the original resignations set forth in _Section 5.13_ above. 

  

 7.15 _Post-Sigining Breaches of Representations and Warranties_. 

  

 (a) As of the Closing, there shall not be one or more material breaches of representations or warranties of HCA set forth in this Agreement that are not qualified as to "materiality", "Hospital Group Material Adverse Effect" or similar qualifiers for which (i) Purchaser has given HCA 

    ##### 

  

    

written notice, (ii) for which the aggregate amount of Damages resulting from
such breaches exceeds $1,750,000, and (iii) for which HCA has not agreed to
indemnify Purchaser for Damages resulting from such breach from the first
dollar of Damages without regard to the limitations set forth in  _Section
9.4(a)(i)_); provided, however, that in determining the aggregate amount of
the Damages resulting from such breaches, no Damages that arise out of or
relate to any such breach will be included in such calculation to the extent
HCA otherwise has full economic responsibility pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

 (b) As of the Closing, there shall not be any breaches of representations or warranties of HCA set forth in this Agreement that are qualified as to "materiality", "Hospital Group Material Adverse Effect" or similar qualifiers for which (i) Purchaser has given HCA written notice, and (ii) for which HCA either (A) has not agreed to indemnify Purchaser for Damages resulting from such breach from the first dollar of Damages without regard to the limitations set forth in _Section 9.4(a)(i)_ ), or (B) does not otherwise have full economic responsibility pursuant to this Agreement. The parties agree that with respect to non-material damage, destruction or loss with respect to the assets of any Hospital Group known to have occurred prior to the Closing, Purchasers sole remedy with respect to matters governed by _Section 3.8(a)_ will be insurance proceeds available to it under HCAs pre-Effective Time insurance policies; provided, however, that to the extent that such insurance proceeds are limited by a deductible under such policies, Purchaser shall bear the initial $100,000, and HCA shall bear all remaining portions of such deductibles. HCA shall cause any such proceeds pursuant to such insurance policies in respect of such damage, destruction or loss to be paid to Purchaser. 

   

 7.16 _Environmental Inspections_. For a period of 90 days following the execution of this Agreement (the " _Environmental Inspection Period_ "), Purchaser and Purchasers agents, representatives and contractors, shall have the right to enter upon the Real Property for the purpose of conducting, or causing to be conducted, such tests, assessments, studies, reports, evaluations and investigations as Purchaser may determine in its sole discretion, including without limitation Phase I or Phase II environmental reports in order to evaluate and determine the environmental condition of the Real Property (" _Purchaser s Environmental Inspections_"). During the Environmental Inspection Period, HCA and its Affiliates will make available to Purchaser and its agents, representatives and contractors conducting Purchasers Environmental Inspections copies of any prior environmental investigations, reports, studies, tests, assessments and other documentation prepared by or for HCA and its Affiliates and in their possession, custody or control (" _Seller s Environmental Information_"). On or before the expiration of the Environmental Inspection Period, Purchaser shall give written notice to HCA if Purchaser has identified any breach of _Section 3.19_ (" _Environmental Conditions_ "). Purchaser shall provide HCA with a copy of Purchasers Environmental Inspections. If Purchaser gives notice of any Environmental Conditions (" _Purchaser s Environmental Notice_") to HCA, and if such Environmental Conditions constitute a breach of _Section 3.19_, then HCA (i) shall at its sole cost and expense, cure or remedy such Environmental Conditions to Purchasers reasonable satisfaction on or before Closing (which cure or remedy may include an agreement by HCA that is reasonably acceptable to Purchaser to indemnify Purchaser from any Damages resulting from such Environmental Conditions from the first dollar of Damages without regard to the limitations set forth in _Section 9.4(a)(i)_) or (ii) may elect not to cure or remedy such Environmental Conditions, and shall give written notice to Purchaser within twenty (20) days after Purchasers Environmental Notice of its election (" _Seller s Election Notice_"). Within twenty (20) days of Purchasers receipt of Sellers Election Notice that HCA has elected not to cure or remedy any Environmental Conditions, Purchaser may elect to waive such Environmental Conditions and close or, subject to _Section 2.6_, may elect to terminate this Agreement as if it were a termination pursuant to _Section 10.1(c)_. If HCA fails to timely give Sellers Election Notice, HCA shall be deemed to have elected not to cure or remedy the Environmental Conditions, whereupon Purchaser may elect as provided in the immediately preceding sentence. 

   ##### 

  

  

 7.17 _Waiver of Conditions_. Purchaser may waive any conditions in writing of this  _Article VII_ to the extent permitted by applicable law. Except as otherwise provided herein or agreed to by the parties prior to the Closing, the consequences of any knowing written waiver shall be (a) the elimination of the waived condition as a valid basis for Purchaser to refuse to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) the release of HCA from any claim by Purchaser for resulting injuries and Damages with respect to that waived condition. 

  

ARTICLE VIII 
 CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATIONS OF HCA 

   

 Except as may be waived in writing by HCA, the obligations of HCA to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on the Closing Date shall be subject to the satisfaction on or prior to the Closing Date of the following conditions: 

  

 8.1 _Representations and Warranties_. All representations and warranties of Purchaser set forth in this Agreement shall be true and correct as of the Closing Date in each case as if made on and as of the Closing Date (except to the extent such representations and warranties specifically speak as of an earlier date, in which case as of such date); provided, however, that this condition will be deemed to be satisfied so long as the failure of such representations and warranties to be true and correct (without regard to any qualifiers with respect to materiality contained in such representations and warranties) as of the Closing Date would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Purchasers ability to perform its obligations under and consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 8.2 _Compliance with Agreement_. On and as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall have performed and complied with each covenant and agreement required by this Agreement to be performed and complied with by it on or before the Closing Date; provided that this condition will be deemed to be satisfied unless both (a) HCA shall have given Purchaser written notice of such failure to perform or comply and Purchaser shall not have cured such failure to perform or comply within 30 days after receipt of such notice and (b) the respects in which such covenants and obligations have not been performed would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Purchasers ability to perform its obligations under and consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 (b) the signature and incumbency of the officers of Purchaser authorized to execute and deliver this Agreement and the other agreements and certificates that Purchaser is required to deliver on or before the Closing Date pursuant to this Agreement.

Such opinion may include qualifications and assumptions that are customary and appropriate with respect to the substance of such opinion. 

  

 8.6 _Consent, Authorizations, Etc._. HCA shall have obtained documentation or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to HCA that: 

  

 (a) HCA has received all required Permits of Governmental Authorities that HCA must, as a matter of Law, receive prior to the Closing in order to consummate the transactions herein contemplated; and 

   

 (b) all waiting periods under the HSR Act and any similar state Law shall have expired or been terminated. 

   

 8.7 _No Action or Proceeding_. On the Closing Date, (a) no valid judgment, order or decree of any court or other Governmental Authority restraining, enjoining or otherwise preventing the consummation of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be outstanding, and (b) no action, suit, investigation or proceeding brought by any Governmental Authority shall be pending before any court or other Governmental Authority or threatened in writing by any Governmental Authority to restrain, enjoin or otherwise prevent the consummation of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, which action, suit, investigation or proceeding, in the reasonable opinion of HCA, may result in a decision, ruling or finding that has or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or on the ability of Purchaser to perform its obligations under this Agreement. 

  

 8.8 _Good Standing Certificate_. At the Closing, Purchaser shall have delivered to HCA a good standing certificate issued with respect to Purchaser by the Secretary of State of Purchasers state of incorporation. Such good standing certificate shall be dated as of a date that is not more than 60 days prior to the Closing Date. 

  

 8.9 _Constituent Documents_. Purchaser shall have delivered to HCA true and complete copies of Purchasers Constituent Documents. 

  

 8.10 _Service Agreements_. Purchaser shall have delivered to HCA executed originals of the Services Agreements with terms and conditions consistent with Exhibit M, and an executed original of the Computer and Data Processing Agreement, each in form and substance satisfactory to HCA.

 8.12 _Waiver of Conditions_. HCA may waive any conditions in writing of this  _Article VIII_ to the extent permitted by applicable law. Except as otherwise provided herein or agreed to by the parties prior to the Closing, the consequences of any knowing written waiver shall be (a) the elimination of the waived condition as a valid basis for HCA to refuse to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) the release of Purchaser from any claim by HCA for resulting injuries and Damages with respect to that waived condition.

 (a) the Excluded Assets, Excluded Liabilities and Excluded Contracts; 

   

 (b) any inaccuracy in any of the representations and warranties made herein by HCA;

 (e) any Encumbrance of any landlord, carrier, warehouseman, mechanic or materialman and any like Encumbrance existing at the Closing and arising in the ordinary course of business for sums that are not delinquent or which are being contested in good faith through appropriate proceedings. 

  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the sole recourse of a Purchaser Indemnitee for
any and all Damages relating to or arising from a breach of any of the
covenants or agreements contained in  _Sections 3.15_ or _6.7_ , to the
extent that they relate to Taxes, shall be controlled by the provisions of
_Section 9.5_. 

   

 9.3 _Indemnification by Purchaser_. Subject to the provisions of this Article IX, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless HCA, Seller Group, any Affiliate of HCA or Seller Group, and the respective officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents and representatives of HCA, Seller Group and their respective Affiliates (each a " _Seller Indemnitee_ ") from and after the Effective Time from and against any Damages actually incurred by such Seller Indemnitee as a result of: 

  

 (a) the Contributed Assets; Assumed Contracts or Assumed Liabilities; 

     ##### 

  

     

 (b) any inaccuracy in any of the representations and warranties made herein by Purchaser;

covenants or agreements contained in  _Sections 3.15_ or _6.7_ , to the
extent that they relate to Taxes, shall be controlled by the provisions of

 (ii) The maximum aggregate liability of HCA for Claims pursuant to _Sections 9.2(b)_ and  _(c)_ shall be limited to the Purchase Price; and

 (b) The liability of a party with respect to any claim for indemnity by an Indemnitee pursuant to this _Article IX_ shall be offset dollar for dollar by (i) any insurance proceeds received by such Indemnitee after the Effective Time in respect of the Damages involved, (ii) any positive Tax effect actually recognized by the Indemnitee in respect of the Damages involved, and (iii) any other recovery made by such Indemnitee from any third party on account of the Damages involved. 

      ##### 

  

     

 9.5 _Tax Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) HCA shall indemnify, defend and hold Purchaser and the Acquired Entities harmless from and against any and all Damages for Taxes imposed on or with respect to any Acquired Entity for a Pre-Closing Period (including, without limitation, any Taxes imposed on any Acquired Entity as a result of having been a member of the HCA Affiliated Group under Treas. Reg. Section 1.1502-6 or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law, and also including any Tax liability for a Pre-Closing Period with respect to any Acquired Entity as a transferee or successor, by contract, law or equity). Notwithstanding the foregoing, HCA shall not indemnify, defend or hold harmless Purchaser and the Acquired Entities from and against any and all Damages for Taxes attributable to any action taken (which would otherwise give rise to an Tax indemnity payment by HCA or its Affiliates) after the Effective Time by Purchaser or the Acquired Entities (other than any such action expressly required or otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement or with the written consent of HCA) (a " _Purchaser Tax Act_ "). 

   

 (b) Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold HCA and the HCA Affiliated Group harmless from and against any and all Damages for (i) Taxes of any of the Acquired Entities, except to the extent HCA is otherwise required to indemnify Purchaser for such Taxes pursuant to _Section 9.5(a)_, and (ii) Taxes attributable to a Purchaser Tax Act. 

   

 (c) The amount of any Taxes for which indemnification is provided under this _Section 9.5_ shall not be (A) increased to take account of any net Tax cost incurred by the Indemnitee arising from the receipt of indemnity payments hereunder or (B) reduced to take account of any net Tax benefit realized by the Indemnitee arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Taxes. Any indemnity payment under this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for United States federal Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law. 

   

 (d) Any indemnity payment required to be made pursuant to this _Section 9.5_ shall be paid within 30 days after the Indemnitee makes written demand upon the indemnifying party, but in no case earlier than five Business Days prior to the date on which the relevant Taxes are required to be paid to the relevant Governmental Authority (including estimated Tax payments). 

   

 (e) In no event shall the indemnities provided for in this _Section 9.5_ be subject to the provisions of _Section 9.4_ of this Agreement. 

   

 9.6 _Claims Procedures_. 

  

 (a) If a party seeks indemnification for Damages hereunder, the party seeking indemnification (the " _Indemnitee_ ") shall promptly notify the party from whom indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of the existence and nature of such Damages (a " _Claim_ "), and shall include in the Claim a reasonably detailed description of all related claims, demands, actions or proceedings, if any, out of which the Damages arise; provided, however, that so long as a Claim is delivered within the applicable Survival Period, failure or delay by the Indemnitee to deliver a Claim in compliance with this provision shall only reduce the obligation of the Indemnifying Party to the extent that such failure impairs the Indemnifying Partys ability to defend the claim or mitigate Damages, in which case the Indemnifying Party shall have no obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee to the extent of Damages, caused by such failure. 

   

 (b) In the event of a Claim related to a claim by a third party, the Indemnifying Party may elect to retain counsel of its choice to represent the Indemnitee in connection with such Claim and shall pay the fees, charges and disbursements of such counsel. The Indemnitee may participate, at its own expense and through legal counsel of its choice, provided that (i) the Indemnifying Party may elect to 

     ##### 

  

    

control the defense of the Indemnitee in connection with such Claim and (ii)
the Indemnitee and their counsel shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party
and its counsel in connection with such Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall
not settle any such Proceeding without the relevant Indemnitees prior
written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), unless the terms
of such settlement provide for no relief other than the payment of monetary
damages. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Indemnifying Party elects not
to retain counsel and assume control of such defense or if both the
Indemnifying Party and any Indemnitee are parties to or subjects of such
proceeding and conflicts of interests exist between the Indemnifying Party
and such Indemnitee, then the Indemnitee shall retain counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnifying Party in connection with such proceeding and
assume control of the defense in connection therewith, and the fees, charges
and disbursements of no more than one such counsel per jurisdiction
selected by the Indemnitee shall be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party. 

   

 (c) If the Indemnifying Party shall, within a reasonable time after said notice, fail to defend, the Indemnitee shall have the right, but not the obligation, and without waiving any rights against the Indemnifying Party, to undertake the defense of, and with the consent of the Indemnifying Party (such consent not to be withheld unreasonably), to compromise or settle the Claim on behalf, for the account, and at the risk and expense, of the Indemnifying Party and shall be entitled to collect the amount of any settlement or judgment or decree and all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees) in connection therewith from the Indemnifying Party. Under no circumstances will the Indemnifying Party have any liability in connection with any settlement of any Proceeding that is entered into without its prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld). Except as provided in this _Section 9.6(c)_ , the Indemnitee shall not compromise or settle any Claim. 

   

 (d) From and after the delivery of a Claim, at the reasonable request of the Indemnifying Party, each Indemnitee shall grant the Indemnifying Party and its counsel, experts and representatives full access, during normal business hours, to the books, records, personnel and properties of the Indemnitee to the extent reasonably related to the Claim at no cost to the Indemnifying Party. 

   

 (e) If the Indemnitee or its Affiliates subsequently recover all or part of a third-party claim from any other Person legally obligated to pay the claim, the Indemnitee shall repay to the Indemnifying Party the amounts recovered up to an amount not exceeding the payment made by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnitee by way of indemnity. 

   

 9.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing, the exclusive remedy of each party in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be as provided in this _Article IX_ other than as provided in _Section 6.11_.

 10.1 _Termination Events_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to Closing upon prior written notice by the party electing to terminate this Agreement to the other party: 

  

 (a) by mutual agreement of HCA and Purchaser (expressed in writing); 

   

 (b) by either HCA or Purchaser if any permanent injunction, Court Order or other order, decree or ruling of any court or other Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall have been issued and become final and non-appealable; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any such injunction, Court Order or other order, decree or ruling that affects only a portion of the Acquired Entities (or the transactions contemplated hereby with respect to only a portion of the Acquired 

     ##### 

  

    

Entities) will not enable HCA or Purchaser to terminate this Agreement with
respect to the other Acquired Entities if and to the extent a Closing on
a portion of the Acquired Entities would still be possible under _Section
2.6_; 

   

 (c) by either HCA or Purchaser if the Closing shall not have occurred by the Optional Termination Date; provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this  _Section 10.1(c)_ shall not be available to any party whose breach of its representations and warranties in this Agreement or whose failure to perform any of its covenants and agreements under this Agreement shall have been a contributing cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before the Optional Termination Date; and provided further that the Optional Termination Date shall be extended through March 31, 2006 for any party who has complied with or performed, or who is in a position to comply with or perform, all conditions to the other partys obligations other than receipt of the certificates of need required for the consummation of the transaction and if the required certificates of need have not been received by March 31, 2006 the parties will work together in good faith to determine whether to further extend the Optional Termination Date to a later time. 

   

 (d) by HCA upon a breach in any material respect of any covenant or agreement on the part of the Purchaser set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of the Purchaser shall have been breached or shall have become untrue, in any such case that the conditions set forth in _Sections 8.1_ and _8.2_ would be incapable of being satisfied by the Optional Termination Date (or any later termination date specified in this Agreement or as may be otherwise extended by mutual agreement of the parties).

contemplated hereby initiated by the United States Federal Trade Commission,
the United States Department of Justice or the Attorney General of any state

transactions contemplated hereby. Purchaser shall also pay all fees and
expenses in connection with the filing of any applicable certificates of need

 12.2 _Entire Agreement_. Except for documents and agreements executed pursuant hereto, and except for the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement (which Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the parties execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other documents and agreements contemplated hereby until the Closing shall have occurred, except to the extent otherwise provided in Section 6.1), this Agreement supersedes all prior oral discussions and written agreements between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement (including any term sheet or similar agreement or document relating to the transactions contemplated hereby). Except for the Confidentiality Agreement, this Agreement, including the exhibits and schedules hereto and other documents delivered in connection herewith, contains the sole and entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. 

  

 12.3 _Waiver_. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at any time by the party which is entitled to the benefit thereof. Any such waiver must be in writing and must be duly executed by such party.

 12.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be modified or amended only by a written instrument duly executed by each of the parties hereto. 

  

 12.5 _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures; Reproductions_.

HCA and Purchaser agree and stipulate that any such reproduction shall be admissible in evidence as the original itself in any judicial, arbitral or administrative proceeding (whether or not the original is in existence and whether or not such reproduction was made by HCA or Purchaser in the regular course of business) and that any enlargement, facsimile or further reproduction of such reproduction shall likewise be admissible in evidence. 

  

 12.6 _No Third Party Beneficiary_. The terms and provisions of this Agreement are intended solely for the benefit of HCA, Purchaser and their respective successors or assigns, and it is not the intention of the parties to confer third party beneficiary rights upon any other Person. 

  

 12.7 _GOVERNING LAW, CONSTRUCTION_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE APPLICABLE TO A CONTRACT EXECUTED AND PERFORMED IN SUCH STATE. The parties hereto agree that no provisions of this Agreement or any related document shall be construed for or against or interpreted to the advantage or disadvantage of any party hereto by any court or other 

   ##### 

  

 

Governmental Authority by reason of any partys having or being deemed to
have structured or drafted such provision, each party having participated
equally in the structuring and drafting hereof. 

   

 12.8 _Binding Effect_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns, including successors by merger or otherwise. 

  

 12.9 _No Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any right hereunder or part hereof may be assigned by any party hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto; provided, however, that HCA, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, may assign some or all of their respective rights and obligations under this Agreement to other Persons who (a) are wholly-owned (directly or indirectly) by HCA or Purchaser, respectively, and (b) agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the assignment of this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder, the assignor shall be jointly and severally liable with its assignee for its obligations hereunder. 

  

 12.10 _Headings, Gender, Etc_. The headings used in this Agreement have been inserted for convenience and do not constitute provisions to be construed or interpreted in connection with this Agreement. Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise requires, (a) words of any gender will be deemed to include each other gender, (b) words using the singular or plural number also will include the plural or singular number, respectively, (c) the terms "hereof", "herein", "hereby" and derivative or similar words will refer to this entire Agreement, (d) the terms "Article," "Section," "Schedule" and "Exhibit" will refer to the specified Article or Section of this Agreement or the specified Schedule or Exhibit to this Agreement, and (e) the terms "material contract," "material permit," "material assets," "material increase," "material taxes," "material default," "substantially all" and phrases of similar import will be deemed to be measured with respect to the Hospital Group to which it relates against their effect on the financial condition and operations of such Hospital Group. 

  

 12.11 _Public Announcement_. On or before the Closing, the parties hereto will each consult with one another prior to making or issuing public statements or announcements with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and will use good faith efforts to agree on the text of a joint public statement or announcement and/or will use good faith efforts to obtain the other parties approval of the text of any public statement or announcement to be made solely on behalf of a party; provided that the foregoing shall not preclude any party from making such disclosure as may be required by applicable Law or the rules of any securities exchange or market on which securities of such party are listed or quoted. 

  

 12.12 _Access to Information_. HCA and Purchaser agree that, from time to time after the Closing, upon the reasonable request of another party hereto, they will cooperate and will cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate with each other to effect the orderly transition of the business, operations and affairs of the Acquired Entities. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) HCA will give and will cause its Affiliates to give representatives of the Acquired Entities reasonable access to all Books and Records of HCA reasonably requested by Purchaser in the preparation of any post-Closing financial statements, reports or Returns of the Acquired Entities with the reasonable cost thereof to be borne by Purchaser; and (b) Purchaser will give and will cause the Acquired Entities to give representatives of HCA reasonable access to all pre-Closing Books and Records of the Acquired Entities reasonably requested by HCA in the preparation of any post-Closing financial statements, reports or Returns of HCA with the reasonable cost thereof to be borne by HCA. The rights of access granted in this Agreement shall be exercised in such a manner as not to cause unreasonable expense or interfere unreasonably with the operation of the business of the Person granting access. 

   ##### 

  

  

 12.13 _Severability; Invalid Provisions_. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Law, (a) such provisions will be fully severable; (b) this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof; (c) the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its severance herefrom; and (d) in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there will be added automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms and effect to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible. 

  

 12.14 _Cooperation_. Upon request, each of the parties hereto shall cooperate with the other in good faith, at the requesting partys expense, in furnishing information, testimony and other assistance in connection with any actions, proceedings, arrangements, or disputes involving any of the parties hereto (other than in a dispute among such parties or entities) and based upon contracts, arrangements or acts of the Acquired Entities which were in effect or occurred prior to the Effective Time and which relate to the business of the Acquired Entities. Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Entities to provide any information or documents reasonably requested by HCA in connection with Tax or other disputes, settlements, investigations, proceeding or other matters in respect of any period ending at or prior to the Effective Time. The party requesting documents or information pursuant to this Section shall pay all fees and expenses paid to unaffiliated third parties by the party providing such documents or information in connection with providing such information or document. In addition, following the Closing, the parties hereto shall cooperate fully with each other and make available to the other, as reasonably requested, and to any taxing authority, all information, records, documents relating to Tax liabilities or potential Tax liabilities and tax bases of the Acquired Entities, and shall preserve all such information, records and documents at least until the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations or extension thereof. At or prior to Closing, Purchaser shall provide HCA any reasonable certificate or other document from any governmental authority or any other person that may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 12.15 _Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial_. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each party hereto (a) agrees that any claim, action or proceeding by such party seeking any relief whatsoever arising out of, or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought only in any Tennessee State court located in Davidson County and not in any other State or Federal court in the United States of America or any court in any other country, (ii) agrees to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts located in Davidson County for purposes of all legal proceedings arising out of, or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) waives and agrees not to assert any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such proceeding brought in such a court or any claim that any such proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum, and (iv) agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law. EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN CONNECTION WITH ANY LITIGATION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. 

  

 12.16 _Damages_. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, NEITHER PARTY NOR ANY AFFILIATE THEREOF SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. 

  

 12.17 _No Inferences_. Inasmuch as this Agreement is the result of negotiations between sophisticated parties of equal bargaining power represented by counsel, no inference in favor of, or 

   ##### 

  

 

against, either party shall be drawn from the fact that any portion of this
Agreement has been drafted by or on behalf of such party. 

   

 12.18 _Tax and Medicare Advice and Reliance_. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, none of the parties (nor any of the parties respective counsel, accountants or other representatives) has made or is making any representations to any other party (or to any other partys counsel, accountants or other representatives) concerning the consequences of the transactions contemplated hereby under applicable tax laws or under the laws governing the Medicare program. Each party has relied solely upon the tax and Medicare advice of its own employees or of representatives engaged by such party and not on any such advice provided by any other party hereto. 

  

 12.19 _Post-Closing Operations_. Purchaser acknowledges that it is an experienced and knowledgeable owner and operator of facilities and assets similar to the Acquired Entities and the Facilities and will rely on its own expertise in operating the Facilities from and after the Closing. Purchaser covenants for the benefit of HCA to operate the Facilities in material compliance with all applicable Laws, including Laws relating to the regulation of the Facilities and operation of the Business and all Environmental Laws, from and after the Closing. 

  

 12.20 _Capital Expenditures_. This Agreement shall not be deemed to be an acquisition or obligation of a capital expenditure or of funds within the meaning of the certificate of need statute of any state, until the appropriate Governmental Authority shall have granted a certificate of need or the appropriate approval or ruled that no certificate of need or other approval is required. 

  

 12.21 _Reasonable Access_. In each instance where a party is granted access pursuant to this Agreement, such access shall be reasonable and shall be granted during normal business hours and shall be coordinated through persons as may be designated in writing by the granting party for such purpose. The right of access and inspection shall be made in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the operation of the granting party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party understands that (a) with respect to documents and information deemed by the granting party in good faith to be market sensitive or competitive in nature (other than with respect to an obligation to indemnify), (i) the party granting access will identify such documents and information, (ii) if requested by the party seeking access, the granting party will provide such documents and information to the other partys outside attorneys and accountants (who will be bound by confidentiality agreements) for their review, and (ii) any report by such attorneys and accountants to the accessing party with respect to such documents and information will be in writing and subject to prior review and reasonable approval by the granting party to confirm that any market sensitive or competitive information is not made available to the requesting party, (b) litigation and other materials (including internal/external legal audit letters or reviews, patient records and similar patient information, PRO information, National Data Bank reports, peer and quality review information and other physician-specific confidential information) that are deemed privileged or confidential and materials which may not be disclosed without violating confidentiality agreements with third parties will not be made available except to the extent permitted by law, and (c) no party shall be obligated to generate or produce information in any prescribed format not customarily produced by such party. 

  

 12.22 _Schedules, Exhibits, Etc_. 

  

 (a) The parties agree that the Schedules and Exhibits listed in _Schedule 12.22_ will be the only Schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement. Schedules and Exhibits designated as "final and approved" in _Schedule 12.22_ (the " _Final Schedules_ ") have been approved by both parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Exhibits and Schedules designated in _Schedule 12.22_ as "open schedules" (the " _Open Schedules_ ") either (i) have been delivered on or before the date of execution of this Agreement and remain subject to review by Purchaser in 

     ##### 

  

    

accordance with clause (b) below, or (ii) to the extent specified below (but
only to the extent specified below), must be delivered by HCA or Purchaser and
will be subject to review by Purchaser or HCA, as applicable, in accordance
with clauses (b) and (c) below. 

   

 (b) HCA shall deliver _Schedules 3.21(i)_ and _3.21(ii)_ within five business days. With respect to the Open Schedules (other than _Schedule 5.14)_ Purchaser shall have the right to make reasonable inquiries with respect to information contained in the Open Schedules, and deliver to HCA any reasonable objection to such Open Schedules, within 20 days after delivery. If Purchaser does not raise a reasonable objection to any such Open Schedules within such period, such Open Schedules shall become additional Final Schedules. The parties shall use their best efforts to resolve such objections raised in respect of the Open Schedules. If, within the time periods specified above the parties have not resolved all such objections, the chief executive officers of HCA and Purchaser shall meet in order to resolve any outstanding issues. If, within three days of the meeting of the chief executive officers the parties have not resolved the remaining issues, either Purchaser or HCA shall have the right to terminate this Agreement until the parties have agreed upon such Open Schedules. 

   

 (c) Purchaser shall deliver _Schedule 5.14_ within five business days. With respect to the Open Schedules (other than _Schedules 3.21(i)_ and _3.21(ii)_ ) HCA shall have the right to make reasonable inquiries with respect to information contained such Open Schedules, and deliver to Purchaser any reasonable objection to such Open Schedules, within 20 days after delivery. If HCA does not raise a reasonable objection to any such Open Schedules within such period, such Open Schedules shall become additional Final Schedules. The parties shall use their best efforts to resolve such objections raised in respect of such Open Schedules. If, within the time periods specified above the parties have not resolved all such objections, the chief executive officers of HCA and Purchaser shall meet in order to resolve any outstanding issues. If, within three days of the meeting of the chief executive officers the parties have not resolved the remaining issues, either Purchaser or HCA shall have the right to terminate this Agreement until the parties have agreed upon such Open Schedules. 

   

 (d) The parties agree that there shall be no changes to the Schedules (other than  _Schedules 3.21(i)_ , _3.21(ii)_ and _5.14_ ) other than in response to objections raised pursuant to this _Section 12.22_ and the resolution thereof in accordance with this  _Section 12.22_. The schedules and exhibits as finally agreed pursuant to this _Section 12.22_ shall become the final schedules and exhibits applicable to this Agreement. 

   

 12.23 _Further Assurance Clause_. 

  

 (a) On and after the Closing Date, HCA, the Acquired Entities and Purchaser will take all appropriate action and execute all documents, instruments or conveyances of any kind which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to carry out any of the provisions hereof, including, without limitation, putting Purchaser in possession and operation control of the Business and the Facilities. 

   

 (b) The parties acknowledge and agree that it is their intent that HCA and its Affiliates transfer to the Acquired Entities all Real Property held by HCA and its Affiliates that is used or held for use in the operation of the Business other than the Excluded Assets. To the extent any Real Property (or building, improvements and fixtures on or forming a part of the Real Property or any appurtenances or rights pertaining thereto) identified on any Exhibit or Schedule (or which should have been identified on such Exhibit or Schedule) is (1) misidentified, incorrectly described, or incorrectly identified as being owned or leased by a particular entity, or (2) any such Real Property which should have been included on any Exhibit or Schedule is inadvertently not included on such Exhibit or Schedule and such errors are discovered subsequent to execution of this Agreement, the parties agree that the applicable Exhibit or Schedule shall be amended by mutual written agreement prior to Closing to correct 

     ##### 

  

    

such errors. In the event that any such errors are discovered subsequent to
the Closing, to the extent necessary to effect the intent of this Agreement,
the parties agree that such Exhibit or Schedule shall be amended by a
written post-Closing addendum to this Agreement to correct such errors and
HCA and its Affiliates shall execute and deliver or cause to be executed and
delivered, deeds, assignments, instruments of correction, or such other
instruments or documents of transfer or conveyance, and to take or cause to
be taken, such other steps as may be necessary, to correctly vest or convey
such real property in or to the applicable Acquired Entity in accordance with
the intent of this Agreement. The obligations pursuant to this paragraph
shall survive the Closing.
