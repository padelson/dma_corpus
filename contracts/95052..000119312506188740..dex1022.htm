that litigation may arise at some time in the future relating to the Seller,
the Buyer, or the Subject Assets which may be related directly or indirectly
to the period prior to the Closing or the period subsequent to the Closing, or

the Closing Date. The Buyer shall give written notice to the Seller before
December 1, 2006 if the Buyer needs to use the Facility for January 2007 and
its intended requirements for that month and the Seller will provide a budget
of the Reimbursable Costs (as defined in this Section 11.4(a) relating
thereto. The Buyer and the Seller shall repeat this process for each month
after January 2007, with the Buyer providing notice of its requirements at the
Facility at least 30 days before the first day of the applicable month and
the Seller providing a budget of Reimbursable Costs relating thereto. To the
extent the Buyer is using the Facility for the Subject Assets during a month,
the Buyer and the Seller shall reasonably agree on an operating budget, which
shall include, to the extent applicable and related to the performance of
services for the Buyer, the categories of costs to be reimbursed as set forth
in Schedule 11.4(a) (the "Reimbursable Costs") and estimates of the

Seller written notice at least 30 days before the date it will cease its use
of the Facility (the "Facility Use Termination Date"). The Buyer shall
undertake commercially reasonable efforts to give Seller written notice
earlier than the 30-day period if Buyer has determined earlier that it will
not need the Facility. Before the first day of each month starting January 1,
2007 during which the Buyer is using the Facility for the Subject Assets, the
Buyer agrees to pay the monthly estimate of the Reimbursable Costs on the
first business day of such month. If the Seller or any third party is also
using the Facility for revenue generating activities and other than any
reasonable winding down of its investment in the Business, the Seller shall
deduct the pro rata portion of the Reimbursable Costs corresponding to such
use and operation of the Facility from amounts charged to the Buyer. The

due the Seller. Prior to the last day of each month starting with January 31,
2007, the Seller and the Buyer shall reconcile the actual Reimbursable Costs
incurred by the Seller against the estimates paid to the Seller for those
periods. The Seller shall remit any overpayment of such costs to the Buyer,
and the Buyer shall remit any underpayment of such costs to Seller, in either
case within 3 business days of the date of reconciliation.

(c) The Buyer shall give written notice to the Seller at least 10 days before
the start of each calendar month following the Closing Date during which the
Facility and Sellers employees are being used for manufacturing,
customization and other product-related services on behalf of the Buyer. The
notice shall set forth the Buyers intended requirements for that month and
the Seller will provide a budget of the Manufacturing Costs (as defined
in this Section 11.4(c) relating thereto on or before the start of the month.
To the extent that the Seller incurs any costs in providing product assembly,
customization or other services, including receiving and shipping costs
associated therewith all as listed in Schedule 11.4(c) and that are not
already  



 

18  in the cost of the Inventory acquired at the Closing ("Manufacturing
Costs"), the Buyer shall reimburse the Seller for such Manufacturing Costs
to the extent paid by the Seller. The Buyer shall make a payment to the
Seller, at such times that enable the Seller to pay bills without the Seller
having to advance any amounts for or on behalf of the Buyer (provided that the
Buyer agrees to pay any open vendor commitments of the Seller assumed by the
Buyer pursuant to this Agreement on timely basis consistent with Sellers past
practice), of the estimate of the Manufacturing Costs to be incurred during
such month and the parties shall reconcile such payments against amounts paid
by the Seller at the end of each month, with supporting documentation, so that
if the Manufacturing Costs exceed the amounts previously received by the
Seller, the Buyer remits the difference to the Seller within 3 business days
of the reconciliation date and if the amounts previously received by the
Seller exceed the Manufacturing Costs, the Seller remits the difference to the
Buyer within 3 business days of the reconciliation date. 

(d) The Buyer agrees to pay for fifty percent (50%) of any rent payments and
associated Facility maintenance, insurance, taxes and utilities costs (if not
already included in the rent payments and excluding any (i) late charges, or
(ii) amounts due as a result of a default in the Lease)(the "Post Termination
Facility Expenses"), which become due under the Lease during a period from
the Facility Use Termination Date until the end of the current lease term;
provided, that the Seller shall undertake commercially reasonable efforts to
return the Facility to the landlord or sublet the Facility or assign the
Lease as soon as practicable but no later than four (4) months after the
Facility Use Termination Date, in each case subject to the prior written
consent of the Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the event
of a return of the Facility to the landlord, the Buyer will only be
responsible for one-half of the termination fee paid to the landlord that
gives effect to the early return by the Seller. In the event of a sublease of
the Facility or assignment of the Lease, the Buyer shall only be responsible
for fifty percent (50%) of any amount by which the payments due under the
Lease exceed the amount received by the Seller or the payments due under the
Lease exceed the amount received by the landlord under the assigned Lease.
The Buyers portion of the Post Termination Facility Expenses shall be paid at
the end of each month following the Facility Use Termination Date within ten
(10) days of receipt of supporting documentation from the
Seller demonstrating the amounts and payment by the Seller of the Post
Termination Facility Expenses. The Facility shall not be used for any business
purpose by the Seller or the Buyer from the Facility Use Termination Date
through the expiration of the Lease, other than the reasonable winding down
operations of the Seller prior to any sublease of the Facility to a third-
party or the return of possession of the Facility to the landlord, but in any
case no later than four (4) months following the Facility Use Termination
Date unless the Buyer consents in writing.

Section 11.5 _Payment of Creditors of the Seller_. From and after the Closing
Date, the Seller agrees to pay and be liable for, and shall assume, indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Buyer from and against and in respect of, any

through or under such creditor, including, but not limited to, any bankruptcy
trustee or debtor-in-possession.



 

19 Section 11.6 _Landlord Waiver of Lien_. The Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to deliver to the Buyer an executed landlord waiver of
lien in the form set forth in Exhibit E, which is attached hereto and made a
part hereof with respect to the landlord of the Facility and the landlord of
the public warehouse where part of the Inventory is held. The Seller shall
also use commercially reasonable efforts to assist the Company in obtaining
consent subordination agreements substantially in the form set forth in
Exhibit D from any co-packers where the Inventory is located. 

Section 11.7 _Auditor Fees_. BDO Seidman, LLP, the Sellers independent public
accountants, has agreed to perform a review of Sellers Financial Statements

Buyer Indemnitees or any of them arising from, in connection with or as a
result of (a) any false or inaccurate representation or warranty made by or

Seller. For this purpose, "Liabilities" incurred by the Seller means all
suits, proceedings, claims, expenses, losses, costs, liabilities, judgments,
deficiencies, assessments, actions, investigations, penalties,
fines, settlements, interest and damages (including reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses), whether suit is instituted or not and, if instituted,
whether at any trial or appellate level, and whether raised by the parties
hereto or a third party, incurred or suffered by the Seller, arising from, in
connection with or as a result of (a) any false or inaccurate representation
or warranty made by or on behalf of the Buyer in or pursuant to this
Agreement; (b) any default or breach in the performance of any of the
covenants or agreements made by the Buyer in this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements; (c) the operation of the Subject Assets and the Business after the
Closing Time by the Buyer; or (d) the Assumed Liabilities.



 

20 Section 12.3 _Indemnification Limitations_

(a) Notwithstanding the general provisions of this Article 12, and absent
intentional misrepresentation (as distinguished from negligent or
reckless misrepresentation) and common law fraud, the Seller shall have no
obligation to provide indemnification for matters arising under Section 12.1
above:

(1) unless and until the aggregate of all claims made with respect to matters
arising under Section 12.1 above is more than One Hundred Twenty Five Thousand
Dollars ($125,000) (the "Threshold Amount") after which point (i.e. when the
aggregate amount of all such indemnification claims hereunder equals or
exceeds the Threshold Amount), the Buyer Indemnities will be entitled to
indemnification of all claims or portion thereof in excess of Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($50,000);

(2) to the extent the aggregate amount of all indemnification claims hereunder
exceeds (i) $20,000,000 plus (ii) the Inventory Value plus (iii) amounts paid
to the Seller under the Note (the "Maximum Amount") (after which point the
Seller will have no obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnities from and
against further claims arising under Section 12.1(a) above in excess of the
Maximum Amount).

(b) Buyer Indemnities may not assert any claim for indemnification under this
Article 12 if Buyer had actual knowledge of the specific breach or
misrepresentation on or prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that the
Seller shall have the burden of proof with respect to such actual
knowledge by the Buyer.

(c) The amount of any loss suffered by an indemnified party under this
Agreement shall be determined after taking into account all amounts to which
the indemnified party is entitled and actually receives under the provisions
of any applicable insurance policies ( _i.e._ , actual insurance policies, and
not self-insurance or retention programs). The parties agree to use
reasonable efforts to collect amounts available under any such insurance
policy.

(d) The amount of any loss suffered by an indemnified party under this
Agreement shall be determined after deduction of any net, actual tax benefit
(measured, in all cases by the net, actual tax benefit to the indemnified
parties and their subsidiaries, if any, on a consolidated basis) which may
accrue to the indemnified party after giving effect to (i) the loss giving
rise to the claim for indemnification, (ii) the payment by such party of any
such loss, and (iii) the receipt by such party of any indemnity or damage
payment pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 12.4 _Procedure for Indemnification_.

(a) In the event any person or entity not a party to this Agreement shall make
any demand or claim or file or threaten to file or continue any
lawsuit, which demand, claim or lawsuit may result in Liabilities, the
indemnified party shall give written notice to such effect to the indemnifying
party promptly upon becoming aware thereof. In such event, within 20 days
after written notice by the indemnified party (the "Notice") of such demand,
claim or lawsuit, the indemnifying party shall have the right, at its sole
cost and expense, to take and assume full  



 

21  control of the defense thereof and to hire counsel (which counsel shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party) to defend any such demand,
claim or lawsuit (provided, however, that the failure to give such Notice
shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations hereunder unless,
and only to the extent that, such failure caused the damages for which the
indemnifying party is obligated to be greater than they would otherwise have
been had the indemnified party given prompt notice hereunder). Thereafter, the
indemnified party shall be permitted to participate in such defense at its
sole cost and expense, provided that, if the named parties to any such
proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying
party and the indemnified party or if the indemnifying party proposes that the
same counsel represent both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party
and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate
due to actual or potential differing interests between them, then the
indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel at the cost
and expense of the indemnifying party. In the event that the indemnifying
party shall fail to respond within 20 days after receipt of the Notice from
the indemnified party of any such demand, claim or lawsuit, then the
indemnified party may retain counsel and conduct the defense of such demand,
claim or lawsuit, as it may in its sole discretion deem proper, at the sole
cost and expense of the indemnifying party.

(b) To the extent that the Seller fails to indemnify the Buyer for any
Liabilities, the Buyer shall have the right to set off the Liabilitites
against the unpaid principal amount of the Note; provided that if it
is determined by a court or mutually acceptable arbitrator that the amount
set off by the Buyer was not appropriate and payment on amount set off under
the Note was due, the portion of the amount that was not appropriate shall be
paid by the Buyer to the Seller along with interest at the current rate under
the Buyers revolving credit facility from the date the payment under the Note
was due.

Section 12.5 _Limitations; Survival_. The representations, warranties and
covenants of the parties shall survive the Closing for a period of twenty (20)
months from the Closing Date, in each such case notwithstanding any
investigation made by or on behalf of the Buyer, provided that the
representations and warranties as to Tax Claims (as hereinafter defined) shall
survive for a period of the statute of limitations relating thereto from
the Closing Date. For purposes hereof, Tax Claims means any claim based upon,
arising out of, or otherwise in respect of, any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Seller contained in
this Agreement relating to taxes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, these limited survival periods shall not apply to
a fraudulent act or omission. No action or proceeding may be brought with
respect to any of the representations and warranties unless written notice
thereof shall have been delivered to the Buyer or the Seller, as the case may
be, prior to the expiration of such applicable survival period.

RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS

Section 14.1 _Covenant Not to Compete, Solicit or Interfere_.
In consideration of the purchase price paid to the Seller, the Seller, for
itself and on behalf of its members and affiliates (Sovereign Management,
Inc., SDC Enterprises, Inc., Bruce H. Rosen and Richard A. Lewis, but not
Elias Khouri), hereby covenants and agrees to the terms and conditions of the
restrictive covenants and agreements set forth in this Section 14.1 as set
forth below:

(a) During the period commencing on the date hereof and ending three (3) years
from the Closing Date, the Seller, its members will not, directly, indirectly
or through an affiliate:

(i) as an individual proprietor, owner, partner, stockholder, officer,
employee, director, consultant, agent, joint venture partner, investor,
lender, or in any other capacity whatsoever (other than as the holder of not
more than five percent of the total outstanding stock of any company the
securities of which are traded on a regular basis on recognized securities
exchanges or any national over-the-counter market), alone or in association
with others, or in any capacity, own, manage, operate, control, consult with,
provide financing to, be employed by, or invest in, any business that is
engaged in the development, manufacture, distribution, sale, marketing and
licensing of fragrances, or department store-sold cosmetics or department
store-sold skin care products in the United States and Canada;

(ii) recruit or otherwise solicit or induce any person who is or becomes an
employee or consultant of the Buyer or any of its affiliates to terminate his
or her employment with, or otherwise cease his or her relationship with, the
Buyer or any of its affiliates, or hire any such employee or consultant who
has left the employ of the Buyer or its affiliates within one year after
termination of such employees or consultants employment with the Buyer or
its affiliates; or

(iii) solicit or attempt to solicit any licensors, licensees, suppliers,
manufacturers, customers or clients of the Buyer or its affiliates, in each
case only with respect to their manufacturing, marketing, purchase and sale of
fragrances, department store-sold cosmetics and department-store sold skin
care products in the United States and Canada; 

(b) The Seller acknowledges and agrees that the obligations set forth in this
Section 14.1 are necessary and desirable to ensure that the Buyer obtains the
benefit of its bargain under this Agreement and that the covenants contained
therein are a material and integral part of this Agreement and necessary and
reasonable to protect the legitimate business interest of the Buyer.
The Seller further acknowledges and agrees that, due to its knowledge of the
Business and the Buyers business, any subsequent competition would
irreparably harm the Buyer and that the only effective way of protecting the
Buyer is to enter into the non-competition and non-solicitation agreements on
the terms and conditions contained herein. In view of the substantial harm,
which would result from a breach or threatened breach by the Seller, its
members or affiliates of the covenants contained in this Section 14.1, the
parties agree that such covenants shall be enforced to the maximum extent
permitted by law. In the event of a breach or threatened breach of the
covenants of this Section 14.1, the parties acknowledge and agree that the
Buyer would suffer irreparable harm and that monetary damages would be
inadequate.  



 

23  Accordingly, in addition to all other remedies to which the Buyer may be
entitled, at law or in equity, the Buyer shall be entitled to seek
specific performance and/or injunctive relief without the necessity of
posting a bond in the event of any such breach or threatened breach by the
Seller, its members or affiliates.

(c) The three-year period set forth in this Section 14.1 shall be tolled for
any period(s) of time as to which the Seller was adjudicated to have been
violating the covenants herein in the event a preliminary injunction is not
issued against the Seller, its members or affiliates and the Buyer is the
prevailing party. If any covenant or portion thereof is found by any court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable because it
extends for too long a period of time or over too broad a range of activities
or in too large a geographic area or for any other reason, then such
restriction shall be interpreted to extend only over the maximum period of
time, range of activities or geographic area as to which it may be enforceable
or otherwise so as to render the covenant enforceable.
