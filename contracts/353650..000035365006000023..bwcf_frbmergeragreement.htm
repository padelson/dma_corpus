(b) _Conversion of Company Shares_. Subject to the other provisions
of this Article III, each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Company Merger Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Company
Merger, be converted into the right to receive a number of Acquiror Shares
equal to the Exchange Ratio (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

  

(c) _Outstanding Acquiror Shares Unaffected_. Each outstanding
Acquiror Share shall remain an outstanding share of Acquiror capital stock and
shall not be converted or otherwise affected by the Company Merger.

  

(d) _Treasury Stock_. All Company Shares that are held by the
Company as treasury stock shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no
Acquiror Shares, cash or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

  

Section 3.2 Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision
hereof, no fractional Acquiror Shares shall be issued to holders of Company
Shares in the Company Merger. In lieu thereof, each such holder entitled to a
fraction of an Acquiror Share (after taking into account all certificates
delivered by such holder and the aggregate number of Company Shares
represented thereby) shall receive, at the time of surrender of the
certificate or certificates representing such holders Company Shares, an
amount in cash equal to the Exchange Ratio _multiplied by_ Merger
Consideration Per Acquiror Share Value _multiplied by_ the fraction of an
Acquiror Share to which such holder otherwise would be entitled. No such
holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights, interest on the value
of, or any other rights in respect of a fractional share. Fractional shares
shall be determined on an aggregate basis for each holder of Company Shares
and not on a per share or per certificate basis.

in this Agreement to the contrary but only to the extent required by the CGCL,
Company Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately before the Company
Merger Effective Time and that are held by Company Shareholders who have voted
against the Company Merger and who comply with all provisions of the CGCL
concerning the right of Company Shareholders to dissent from the Company
Merger and require appraisal of their Company Shares (the " _Dissenting
Shareholders_ " with the Company Shares held by such Dissenting Shareholders
being referred to as the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration but shall only be entitled to
such rights as are granted to them pursuant to Sections 1300-1312 of the CGCL;
_provided, however_ , that any Dissenting Shares which, at any time after the
Company Merger Effective Time, lose their status as Dissenting Shares under
the CGCL shall forfeit the right to appraisal and all such Dissenting Shares
shall then be deemed to have been converted into the right to receive, as of
the Company Merger Effective Time, the Merger Consideration without interest.
Prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company shall give Acquiror
prompt notice of any such demands for appraisal, withdrawals of demands for
appraisal and any other related instruments received by the Company and the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Acquiror, voluntarily make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for
payment, or waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal
or the taking of any other action by such Dissenting Shareholder as may be
necessary to perfect appraisal rights under the CGCL.

Section 3.4

  |  

Surrender and Exchange of Certificates. 

---|---|--- 
  

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, Acquiror
shall designate an exchange agent, bank or trust company (the " _Exchange
Agent_ ") and deposit with the Exchange Agent such certificates of Acquiror
Shares (the " _Acquiror Stock Certificates_ ") representing the number of
whole Acquiror Shares issuable in the Company Merger pursuant to Section 3.1
and Acquiror shall also make available to the Exchange Agent sufficient cash
to make all cash payments in lieu of fractional Acquiror Shares pursuant to
Section 3.2 (together with the Acquiror Stock Certificates, the " _Exchange
Fund_ ").

  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Acquiror shall cause the Exchange Agent,
promptly after the Company Merger Effective Time (and in no event later than
five (5) Business Days following the Company Merger Effective Time), to mail
to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately
prior to the Company Merger Effective Time represented outstanding Company
Shares (the " _Company Stock Certificates_ ") that were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(b), (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected and
risk of loss and title to the Company Stock Certificates shall pass only upon
delivery of the Company Stock Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be
in such form and have such other customary provisions as Acquiror and the
Company may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for completion and use
in effecting the surrender of the Company Stock Certificates in exchange for
the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal
duly executed in accordance with the instructions contained therein, the
holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor an Acquiror Stock Certificate representing the number of
whole shares of Acquiror Shares that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to this Article III (together with payment of cash in lieu of
fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 3.2) and the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith
be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Shares that
is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger
Consideration may be issued to a transferee of the record holder of such
Company Shares if the Company Stock Certificate representing such Company
Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 3.4, each Company Stock Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Company Merger Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration provided for
in Section 3.1(b).

  

(c) _Return of Merger Consideration_. Any portion of the Merger
Consideration which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Shares for
six (6) months after the Company Merger Effective Time shall be delivered to
Acquiror, and any holders of Company Shares who have not theretofore
surrendered their Company Stock Certificates, or any of them, as provided in
this Section 3.4, shall thereafter look only to Acquiror for the Merger
Consideration to which they are entitled, without any interest thereon.

  

(d) _Distributions and Voting with Respect to Unexchanged Company
Shares_. Until surrendered for exchange in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 3.4, each

certificate theretofore representing Company Shares shall from and after the
Company Merger Effective Time represent for all purposes only the right to

this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no
dividends or other distributions in respect of Acquiror Shares with a record
date after the Company Merger Effective Time shall be paid to any Person
holding a Company Stock Certificate until such Company Stock Certificate has
been surrendered for exchange as provided for in this Section 3.4. Subject to
applicable Laws and the immediately preceding sentence, following surrender of
any such Company Stock Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the
Acquiror Stock Certificate issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at
the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date on or after the Company Merger Effective
Time theretofore payable with respect to the Acquiror Shares represented
thereby. Former shareholders of record of the Company shall not be entitled to
vote after the Company Merger Effective Time at any meeting of Acquiror
Shareholders until such holders have exchanged their certificates representing
Company Shares for certificates representing Acquiror Shares in accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement.

  

(e) _Transfers_. On or after the Company Merger Effective Time,
there shall be no transfers of Company Shares on the stock transfer books of
the Company.

  

(f) _No Liability_. None of Surviving Corporation, the Exchange
Agent or the Company shall be liable to any holder of Company Shares for any
Merger Consideration deposited with the Exchange Agent which is properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

  

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Company Stock Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Company Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if reasonably required by Acquiror, the posting by such Person
of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Acquiror may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Company

to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Shares such amounts as
Acquiror or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold under

amounts are so withheld by Acquiror or the Exchange Agent, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of Company Shares in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding was made by Acquiror or the Exchange Agent.

actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise the
Surviving Corporation and all right title and interest in, to and under any of
the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Company Merger or the
Bank Merger.

  

Section 3.5 Stock Options. Immediately prior to the Company Merger
Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof)
shall take all actions and shall obtain all necessary consents and releases
from all of the holders of all the outstanding stock options and other rights
to purchase Company Shares (the " _Company Options_ ") heretofore granted
under any stock option plan of the Company or otherwise (the " _Stock Plans_
") to: (a) provide for the cancellation, effective at the Company Merger
Effective Time, subject to the payment provided for in the next sentence being
made, of all Company Options, (b) terminate, as of the Company Merger
Effective Time, the Stock Plans and any other plan, program or arrangement
providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the
capital stock of the Company, the Bank or any Affiliate respectively thereof
(collectively with the Stock Plans, referred to as the " _Stock Incentive
Plans_ ") and (c) amend, as of the Company Merger Effective Time, the

Bank or any such Affiliate, to provide no continuing rights to acquire, hold,
transfer or grant any capital stock of the Company, the Bank or any such
Affiliate or any interest in the capital stock of the Company, the Bank or any
such Affiliate. Immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, each
Company Option, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall no longer be
exercisable for the purchase of Company Shares but shall entitle each holder
thereof, in cancellation and settlement therefor, to payments by the Company
in cash, without interest (the " _Cash Payment_ "), at the Company Merger
Effective Time, equal to the product of:

  

(i) the total number of Company Shares subject to such Company
Option, whether or not then vested or exercisable, and

  

(ii) the amount, if any, by which the product of the Exchange Ratio
_multiplied by_ Merger Consideration Value Per Acquiror Share exceeds the
exercise price per Company Share subject to such Company Option.

  

Prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, the Company will deposit with the
Exchange Agent an amount in cash sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of all
Cash Payments. Each such Cash Payment will be paid by the Exchange Agent on
behalf of the Company to each holder of an outstanding Company Option at the
Company Merger Effective Time and reduced by any required withholding Taxes.
Except as otherwise contemplated herein, any then outstanding stock
appreciation rights or limited stock appreciation rights issued by the
Company, the Bank or any Affiliate of either thereof shall be canceled
immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time without any payment
therefor. The Company and the Bank shall take all steps necessary to ensure
that neither the Company nor the Bank nor any of their respective Affiliates
is or will be bound by any Options, other options, warrants, rights or
agreements which would entitle any Person, other than Acquiror or its
Affiliates, to own any capital stock of the Company, Bank or any such
Affiliate or to receive any payment in respect thereof. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Section 3.5 to the contrary, payment of the Cash

places), equal to (x) the Revised Number of Acquiror Shares _divided by_ (y)
the Number of Company Shares and Company Options.

  

(b) If the Adjusted BWC Real Estate Sale Purchase Price exceeds the
BWC Real Estate Book Value (the amount of such excess, the " _BWC Real Estate

Effective Time, by virtue of the Bank Merger and without any action on the

investigation pending or, to the knowledge of Acquiror, threatened against the
Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries that, as of the date hereof, challenges
the validity or propriety, or seeks to prevent consummation of, the Company
Merger, the Bank Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as to which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse
determination which, if adversely determined would, individually or in the

with respect to Acquiror.

Acquiror Permits and all such Acquiror Permits are valid and in full force and
effect and, to the knowledge of the Acquiror, no suspension or cancellation of
any of them is threatened, except where the failure to have, or the suspension
or cancellation of, or failure to be valid or in full force and effect of, any
of the Acquiror Permits would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Acquiror.

  

(b) None of Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries is in default or
violation of any Acquiror Permits or any Laws applicable to Acquiror or any of
its Subsidiaries or by which any property or asset of Acquiror or any of its

forms, and other documents and filings required to be filed by it under the
Exchange Act since January 1, 2004 (collectively, including those filed or
furnished subsequent to the date of this Agreement, the " _Acquiror FDIC

in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the
regulations promulgated thereunder and (ii) did not at the time it was filed
(or if subsequently amended or

superseded by an Acquiror FDIC Filings then on the date of such subsequent
filing), contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.

  

(b) Acquirors consolidated financial statements (including, in each
case, any notes thereto) contained in the Acquiror FDIC Filings were prepared
in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) or, in the case of
interim consolidated financial statements, where information and footnotes
contained in such financial statements are not required to be in compliance
with GAAP), and in each case such consolidated financial statements fairly
presented, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position,
results of operations and cash flows of Acquiror and the consolidated
Subsidiaries of Acquiror as of the respective dates thereof and for the
respective periods covered thereby (subject, in the case of unaudited
statements, to normal year-end adjustments which were not and which are not
expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to Acquiror and its
consolidated Subsidiaries taken as a whole).

  

(c) Except as and to the extent set forth on the consolidated balance
sheet of Acquiror and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005
(the " _Acquiror Balance Sheet_ "), since January 1, 2006 neither Acquiror nor
any of its consolidated Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any
nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would be
required to be reflected on a balance sheet or in notes thereto prepared in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied, except for liabilities or
obligations (i) that, in the aggregate, are adequately provided for in the
Acquiror Balance Sheet, (ii) incurred in the ordinary course of business since
January 1, 2006 that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect with respect to Acquiror, or (iii) incurred or
provided for in this Agreement.

  

(d) Acquiror is in compliance with the applicable listing and
corporate governance rules and regulations of the NYSE, except where the
failure to be in such compliance would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Acquiror. Except as
permitted by the Exchange Act, including Sections 13(k)(2) and (3) or rules of
the SEC (including extensions of credit pursuant to Regulation O), since the
enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, neither Acquiror nor any of its
Affiliates has made, arranged or modified (in any material way) any extensions
of credit in the form of a personal loan to any executive officer or director
of Acquiror.

  

(e) Each required form, report and document containing financial
statements that Acquiror has filed with or furnished to the FDIC since January
1, 2004 was accompanied by the certifications required to be filed or
furnished by Acquirors chief executive officer and chief financial officer
pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and at the time of filing or submission of
each such certification, such certification (i) was true and accurate and
complied in all material respects with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) did not
contain any qualifications or exceptions to the matters certified therein,
except as otherwise permitted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (iii) has not
been modified or withdrawn. Neither Acquiror nor any of its officers has
received notice from any Governmental Entity questioning or challenging the
accuracy, completeness, content, form or manner of filing or furnishing of
such certifications. As of the end of the period covered by the most recently
filed periodic report under the Exchange Act, Acquirors disclosure

controls and procedures (as defined in Sections 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the
Exchange Act) were effective to provide reasonable assurance that material
information, relating to Acquiror and its consolidated Subsidiaries, required
to be included in any of the Acquiror FDIC Filings, were made known to
Acquiror management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, respectively, on a timely basis.

  

(f) Each of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries has filed all material
documents and reports relating to each of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries
required to be filed with Regulatory Authorities. All such reports conform in
all material respects with the requirements promulgated by such Regulatory
Authorities and as of their respective dates, such documents and reports did
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.

understanding or similar arrangement with, or a commitment letter or similar
submission to, or extraordinary supervisory letter from, any Regulatory
Authority or (ii) has been advised by, or has any knowledge of facts which are
reasonably expected to give rise to an advisory notice by, any Regulatory
Authority that such Regulatory Authority is contemplating issuing or
requesting (or is considering the appropriateness of issuing or requesting)
any order, decree, agreement, memorandum of understanding, commitment letter,
supervisory letter or similar submission. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.9
of the Acquiror Disclosure Schedule or as set forth in the Acquiror FDIC
Filings, all compliance or corrective action relating to Acquiror or any of
its Subsidiaries required by Regulatory Authorities having jurisdiction over
Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries has been taken, except where the failure
to have taken any such action is not expected to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Acquiror. Each of
Acquiror and its Subsidiaries has paid all assessments made or imposed by and
required to have been heretofore paid to any Regulatory Authority.

  

Section 5.10 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since January 1, 2006,
except as specifically contemplated by, or as disclosed in, this Agreement or

Section 5.12 Derivative Transactions. Subject to such exceptions as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect with
respect to Acquiror, all Derivative Transactions to which Acquiror or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party were entered into in the ordinary course of
business, consistent with safe and sound banking practices and regulatory
guidance, and in accordance with the investment, securities, commodities, risk
management and other policies, practices and procedures employed by Acquiror
and its Subsidiaries, as applicable. All of such Derivatives Transactions are
legal, valid and binding obligations of Acquiror or a Subsidiary of Acquiror,
as the case may be, enforceable in accordance with their terms (except as
enforcement may be limited by general principles of equity whether applied in
a court of law or a court of equity and by bankruptcy, insolvency and similar
laws affecting creditors rights and remedies generally), and are in full

such Derivative Transaction has duly performed in all material respects all of
their material obligations thereunder to the extent that such obligations to
perform have accrued; and, there are no breaches, violations or defaults or
allegations or assertions of such by any party thereunder which, individually
or in the aggregate, have had or could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect with respect to Acquiror.

Company Shareholders, (ii) at the time or times when the Company Shareholders
Meeting are held, and (iii) at the Company Merger Effective Time, contain any

shall be made, is false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein not false or misleading, or omit to state
any

material fact necessary to correct any statement in an earlier communication

(a) The Company shall and shall cause the Bank and any of its or
their Affiliates and any of its and their respective officers, directors,
employees, representatives, consultants, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants and other agents immediately to, cease any discussions or
negotiations with any other Person or Persons that may be ongoing with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company will not and will cause the Bank and
its and their Affiliates, and any of its or their respective officers,
directors or employees, representatives, consultants, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants or other agents not to take, any action (i) to
encourage, solicit, initiate or facilitate, directly or indirectly, the making
or submission of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) to enter into any agreement,
arrangement or understanding with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or to

agreement, arrangement or understanding that would require the Company or the
Bank to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Company Merger, the Bank
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) to
initiate or participate in any way in any discussions or negotiations with, or
furnish or disclose any information to, any Person (other than Acquiror) in

Company Vote), the Company, in response to an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal
that did not result from a breach of this Section 7.3(a) and otherwise in
compliance with its obligations under Section 7.3(c), may participate in
discussions with or furnish information to, any Person (other than Acquiror)
which makes such unsolicited Acquisition Proposal if (A) such action is taken
subject to a confidentiality agreement with terms taken as a whole not more
favorable to such third party than the terms of the Company Confidentiality
Agreement (as in effect on the date hereof) and (B) after consultation with
independent financial advisors, and after receiving written advice from
outside nationally recognized legal counsel to the Company, a majority of the
members of the entire Company Board reasonably determines in good faith by

is necessary to take such actions in order to comply with the fiduciary duties
of the Company Board under applicable Law. Without limiting the foregoing,
Acquiror and the Company agree that any violation of the restrictions set
forth in this Section 7.3(a) by any Affiliate, officer, director, employee,
representative, consultant, investment banker, attorney, accountant or other
agent of the Company, the Bank or any of their Affiliates, whether or not such
Person is purporting to act on behalf of the Company, the Bank or any of their

withdraw, modify or amend, or propose to withdraw, modify or amend, in a
manner adverse to Acquiror, the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) approve or
recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or
(iii) resolve to do any of the foregoing; _provided, however_ , that the
Company may recommend to the Company Shareholders an Acquisition Proposal and,
in connection therewith, withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation of
the Company Merger or Bank Merger if (w) the Company has complied with its
obligations under Section 7.3(a) and (c), (x) the Acquisition Proposal is a
Superior Proposal, (y) all the conditions to the Companys right to terminate
this Agreement in accordance with Section 10.1(e)(i) have been satisfied
(including the expiration of the five (5) Business Day period described
therein and the payment of all amounts required pursuant to Section 10.2) and
(z) simultaneously with such withdrawal, modification or recommendation, this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 10.1(e)(i). Nothing in this
Section 7.3 shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from taking a
position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal by a third party and
disclosing it to the Company Shareholders to the extent required under Rule
14e-2 of the Exchange Act.

  

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in

Proposal or of any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry, proposal, discussions
or negotiation with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, the terms and
conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal,
discussion or negotiation and the Company shall, within one (1) day of the
receipt thereof, promptly provide to Acquiror copies of any written materials
received by the Company in connection with any of the foregoing, and the
identity of the Person making any such Acquisition Proposal or such request,
inquiry or proposal or with whom any discussion or negotiation are taking

received by the Company with respect thereto. The Company shall promptly
provide to Acquiror any non-public information concerning the Company, the
Bank or any of their Subsidiaries provided to any other Person in connection
with any Acquisition Proposal which was not previously provided to Acquiror.

purpose of voting to adopt this Agreement (the " _Company Shareholders

"), subject to Section 7.3. Notwithstanding any Change in Company Board
Recommendation, this Agreement shall be submitted to the Company Shareholders
at the Company Shareholders Meeting for the purpose of approving this
Agreement, the Company Merger and the Bank Merger and nothing contained in
Section 7.3 or this Section 7.4 shall relieve the Company of such obligation.
Subject to Section 6.2, the Company shall use its best efforts to cause the
Company Shareholders Meeting to be held on the first date as is reasonably
practicable after the date hereof or such other date as the parties shall
mutually agree. In addition, during the term of this Agreement, the Company

following the Closing or to reflect expenses and costs related to the Company
Merger and the Bank Merger; _provided, however,_ that unless the adjustment
would otherwise be required by applicable Law, or by regulatory accounting
principles (" _RAP_ ") and GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the
financial statements of the Company and the Bank (as the case may be), (a)
the Company shall not be required to take such actions more than one (1) day

agrees in writing that all of the conditions to its obligation to effect the
consummation of the Company Merger and the Bank Merger as set forth in
Articles IX have been satisfied or waived and each of the approvals in Section
9.1(e) have been received, and (b) no such adjustment shall (i) violate any
Law applicable to the Company, the Bank or Acquiror, (iii) be materially
disadvantageous to the Company or the Bank if the Company Merger and the Bank
Merger were not consummated or (iv) constitute or be deemed to be a breach,
violation of or failure to satisfy any representation, warranty, covenant,
condition or other provision of this Agreement or otherwise be considered in
determining whether any such breach, violation or failure to satisfy shall
have occurred. The recording of any such adjustments shall not be deemed to
imply any misstatement of previously furnished Company Financial Statements or
information and shall not be construed as a concurrence of the Company or its
management with any such adjustments.

exculpation from liability set forth in the Company Certificate and Company
Bylaws as in effect on the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from

the rights thereunder of individuals who on or prior to the Company Merger
Effective Time were directors or officers of the Company, unless such
modification is required by Law.

  

(b) For a period of six (6) years from the Company Merger Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall either (i) maintain in effect the

fifty percent (150%) of the cost currently paid by the Company for
such insurance, which the Company represents and warrants to be $32,808 for
the twelve (12) month period ending on June 1, 2006; _provided, further,
however_ , that if the cost of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount; (ii) the Surviving
Corporation may substitute for such Company policies other policies with at
least the same coverage containing terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous, and provided that said substitution does not result in any gaps
or lapses in coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the Company
Merger Effective Time; or (iii) cause the Acquirors, directors and officers
liability insurance then in effect to cover the Indemnified Parties with
respect to those matters covered by the Companys directors and officers
liability insurance policy. The Company shall cooperate with and assist the
Surviving Corporation in purchasing such policy, including without limitation,
by obtaining pricing quotes from the Companys current insurance carrier.

  

(c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
paragraph (a) of this Section 8.3, upon learning of any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify the Surviving

written consent; _provided, however,_ that the Surviving Corporation shall not
have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of
competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination
shall have become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in
the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.

  

Section 8.4 Advisory Board. Acquiror will establish, after the
Effective Time, an Advisory Board that will advise solely on the expansion of
business (and not on loan approval, audit reports or any other transactional

incurred by Acquiror in connection with the negotiating, drafting and carrying
out the terms of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, in
the manner and at the time set forth in Section 10.2(c) in the event that the
Acquiror terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(f)(iii).

  

The termination fees described above in this Section 10.2(b) are herein
referred to as the " _Termination Fee_ ". Payment of the Termination Fee to
Acquiror, pursuant to this Section 10.2(b), shall be the sole and exclusive
liability of the Company to and the sole remedy of Acquiror for any

material breach of Section 7.3 in which case the Company Termination Fee shall

Days after the consummation of the Acquisition Transaction in the case of a

this Agreement in the case of a termination described in paragraph of
10.2(b)(ii). The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 10.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that without such agreements Acquiror would not have entered
into this Agreement, and that such amounts are liquidated damages and do not
constitute a penalty. If the Company fails to promptly pay Acquiror the
amounts due under this Section 10.2 within the time period specified herein,
the Company shall pay all costs and expenses (including attorneys fees)
incurred by Acquiror in connection with any action, including the filing of
any lawsuit, taken to collect payment of such amounts, together with the
interest as required under Section 10.2(f).

  

(d) _Effect of Termination pursuant to Section 10.1(e) or 10.1(f)_.

10.2(b), if this Agreement is terminated by Acquiror as provided in Section
10.1(f)(iii) or by the Company as provided in Section 10.1(e)(ii), and the
event that entitled such party (the " _Terminating Party_ ") to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(f)(iii) or 10.1(e)(ii), as the case may be,
was a willful and material breach by the other party (a " _Breaching Party_ ")
of any representation, warranty or covenant of such Breaching Party set forth
in this Agreement, the Terminating Party

(e) _Effect of Other Terminations_. No party shall have any
liability of any kind or nature to the other parties by reason of any
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1 or the action, events,
occurrences or circumstances that caused this Agreement to be terminated,
except as and to the extent provided in this Article X. In no event and under
no circumstance shall any officer, director, shareholder, employee or
independent contractor of any party have any liability whatsoever to the other
parties by reason of any termination of this Agreement or the action, events,
occurrences or circumstances that caused this Agreement to be terminated.

to the other party pursuant to Section 10.2(b) or 10.2(d) shall be made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Acquiror or the Company, as applicable, when due. If a party obligated to make
such payment (a " _Payor Party_ ") fails to pay any such amount when payment
thereof is due to the other party, the unpaid amount shall bear interest at
the prime rate of interest printed in _The Wall Street Journal_ on the date
such payment was required to be made until it is paid in full and the other
party shall be entitled to recover such accrued interest and its costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in its

Section 6.6 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any Law

agreement governing such information to which such Company Affiliated
Shareholder is a party.

  

Section 6.16 _Action in Shareholder Capacity Only_. The parties
acknowledge that the covenants and agreements set forth in Articles I and III

and agrees with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

  

Section 6.18 _Waiver_. No failure or delay on the part of any
party in the exercise of any right hereunder will impair such right or be
construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any
representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor will any single or partial
exercise of any such right preclude any other or future exercise thereof or of
any other right.
