PURCHASE AND SALE



   2.1 | Purchase and Sale. On the terms and subject to the conditions of

Buyer 2 at the Closing, the QSSI Shares, free and clear of any Liens, (ii)
Parent agrees to sell, assign, transfer and deliver to Buyer 1 at the Closing,

free and clear of any Liens. On the terms and subject to the conditions of

Parent at the Closing, the Wavemaker Shares, free and clear of any Liens, and
(c) Buyer 1 agrees to purchase from GmbH at the Closing, the QSSC Shares, free
and clear of any Liens.  
---|--- 



   2.2 | Purchase Price. The purchase price for the Shares payable by the
Buyers to the Sellers for the Shares shall be equal to $200,000,000 (two
hundred million United States Dollars) subject to the adjustment provided for
in Section 2.4 (the "Purchase Price") and shall be allocated among the Sellers
in the percentages set forth in Schedule 2.2 of the Disclosure Letter. Any
adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.4 shall be allocated
to the Seller selling the Shares of the Company to which such adjustment

---|--- 



   2.3 | Payment at the Closing. At the Closing, the Buyers shall pay to
the Sellers the Purchase Price by wire transfer in accordance with Schedule
2.2 of the Disclosure Letter. No amount shall be deducted or withheld
pursuant to Section 116 of the Tax Act from the Purchase Price or any other

---|--- 
 



   2.4 | Payment of Adjustment Amount. 
---|--- 



     | (a) |

As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, and in any event no later
than twenty (20) Business Days after the Closing Date, the Buyers shall cause
to be prepared and deliver to the Sellers the Closing Date Financial
Statements with a 

---|---|--- 
 



 

\- 17 - Financial Statements shall be accompanied by working papers and other
supporting documentation, to be supplemented as necessary by such additional
documentation as the Sellers may reasonably request following delivery of the
Closing Date Financial Statements. The Sellers shall have fifteen (15)
Business Days (the "Review Period") following receipt of the Closing Date
Financial Statements in which to review the Closing Date Financial Statements,
and the Buyers shall provide Parent and its independent accountants reasonable
access during normal business hours to the personnel, properties, books
and records of the Business and the QNX Entities for such purpose. The Buyers
agree that, following the Closing Time through the date that the Closing Date
Working Capital Amount and the Adjustment Amount become final and binding,
they will not take any actions with respect to any accounting books, records,
policies or procedures on which the Closing Date Financial Statements or the
Estimated Working Capital Amount are based that would impact the determination
of the Closing Date Working Capital Amount or the Adjustment Amount or the
preparation of calculations included in the WC Objection Notice. If at any
time during the Review Period, the Sellers determine that they have any
objection to the Closing Date Financial Statements or any aspect of the
calculation of Closing Date Working Capital Amount, the Sellers may send a
written notice (the "WC Objection Notice") explaining in reasonable detail
such objection(s); provided, that the WC Objection Notice shall be delivered
to the Buyers no later than five (5) Business Days following the last day of
the Review Period. The Buyers and the Sellers shall endeavour, in good faith,
to resolve the matters described in the WC Objection Notice. If the Buyers
and the Sellers are unable to resolve any of the matters described in the WC
Objection Notice and agree in writing to that resolution within twenty (20)
days after the Sellers receipt thereof, the Buyers and the Sellers shall
promptly submit those items then remaining unresolved to
PricewaterhouseCoopers, or if they refuse or are unable to act, a nationally
recognized United States accounting firm which shall be independent of the
Buyers and the Sellers and their respective Affiliates ("Independent") and
reasonably acceptable to the Sellers and the Buyers. If the Buyers and the
Sellers cannot agree to the selection of such an accounting firm within a
further period of five (5) days, an accounting firm that is Independent shall
be selected by two nationally recognized United States accounting firms, one
of which shall be nominated by the Buyers and the other of which shall be
nominated by the Sellers. The accounting firm so determined in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.4 shall hereinafter be
referred to as the "Independent Auditor". The Independent Auditor shall
determine the Closing Date Working Capital Amount and the Adjustment Amount.
With respect to each disputed line item, such determination, if not in
accordance with the position of either the Buyers or the Sellers, shall not be
in excess of the higher, nor less than the lower, of the amounts advocated by
the Sellers in the WC Objection Notice or by the Buyers in the Closing Date
Financial Statements with respect to such disputed line item. During the
review by the Independent Auditor, the Buyers and the Sellers and their
accountants will each make available to the Independent Auditor interviews
with such individuals, and such information, 
---|--- 



 

\- 18 - required by the Independent Auditor to fulfill its obligations under this
Section 2.4; provided, however, that the accountants of the Sellers or the
Buyers shall not be obliged to make any work papers available to the
Independent Auditor except in accordance with such accountants normal
disclosure procedures and then only after such firm has signed a customary
agreement relating to such access to work papers in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to such accountant. The Sellers on the one hand, and the
Buyers on the other hand, shall each bear one-half of the fees, costs and
expenses of the Independent Auditor; provided, however, that if the
Independent Auditor determines that one party to the dispute is the prevailing
party, then the non-prevailing party shall alone be responsible for the fees,
costs and expenses of dispute resolution incurred by all parties. 
---|--- 



     | (b) | If the Closing Date Working Capital Amount is greater than
the Estimated Working Capital Amount, the Buyers shall promptly pay the
Sellers the Adjustment Amount by wire transfer to the account of the Sellers
as the Sellers shall notify the Buyers in writing, together with interest at
the Prime Rate from the Closing Date until the date of payment. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | If the Closing Date Working Capital Amount is less than the
Estimated Working Capital Amount, the Sellers shall promptly pay to the Buyers
the Adjustment Amount by wire transfer to the account of the Buyers as the
Buyers shall notify the Sellers in writing, together with interest at the
Prime Rate from the Closing Date until the date of payment. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) | The Buyers and the Sellers will execute, if requested by the
Independent Auditor, a reasonable engagement letter, including customary
indemnities. The Independent Auditor shall act as an expert and not an
arbitrator to determine, based solely on the provisions of this Section 2.4
and the representations by the Buyers and the Sellers, only on those issues
still in dispute and only as to whether such amounts were arrived at in
conformity with this Agreement. The Independent Auditors determination shall
be made within thirty (30) days of its selection, or such other period as
mutually agreed to by the Buyers and the Sellers, and shall be set forth in a
written statement delivered to the Buyers and the Sellers. The information and
the occurrence of the proceedings under this Section 2.4 shall be treated as
confidential information. The Independent Auditor shall be bound by
a mutually agreeable confidentiality agreement. The procedures of this
Section 2.4 are exclusive and, except as set forth below, the determination of
the Independent Auditor shall be final and binding on the parties hereto
absent an error in calculation, which the parties shall draw to the attention
of the Independent Auditor for correction. The decision rendered pursuant to
this Section 2.4 may be filed as a judgment in any court of competent
jurisdiction. Either the Buyers or the Sellers may seek specific enforcement
or take other necessary legal action to enforce any decision under this
Section 2.4. The other partys only defense to such a request for specific
enforcement or other legal action shall be fraud by or on the part of the
Independent Auditor. Absent such fraud, such other party shall reimburse the
party seeking enforcement for its expenses related to such enforcement. 
---|---|--- 
 



 

\- 19 - in accordance with the provisions of this Article II shall not limit or affect
any other rights or causes of action the Buyers or Sellers may have with
respect to the representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities in their
favor contained in this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
 



   2.5 | Closing. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, the closing (the "Closing") of the purchase and sale of the
Shares hereunder shall take place at 10:00 a.m. (Toronto time), on the second
Business Day after the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Applicable
Law) waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those
conditions to be satisfied or waived by action taken at the Closing, but
subject to satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), at the offices of the
Buyers counsel in Toronto, Ontario or at such other time or place as the
Buyers and the Sellers may agree in writing. At the Closing:

execute and deliver any other instruments, documents and certificates that are
required to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement.

or subsection of the Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be disclosed with
respect to any other Section or subsection of this Agreement only to the

information is applicable to such other Section or subsection of this
Agreement), each of the Sellers hereby jointly and severally represent and
warrant to the Buyers as follows and acknowledge that the Buyers are relying
upon the following representations and warranties in connection with the
purchase of the Shares:

 

 _Authorization, Execution and Approvals_



   3.1 | Each of the Sellers is duly incorporated or duly formed and
validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or
formation, as the case may be. Schedule 3.1 of the Disclosure Letter sets out
the name and jurisdiction of incorporation or formation, as the case may be,

and capacity to own the Shares and enter into and perform its obligations
under this Agreement and each of the Transaction Documents to which it is a

the name and jurisdiction of incorporation or formation, as the case may be,
of each of the QNX Entities. Each of the QNX Entities has all requisite power,
authority and capacity to own, lease and operate its properties and assets
and to carry on its business as now conducted. The Sellers have made available
to the Buyers true, correct and complete copies of the certificate of
incorporation, articles of incorporation, articles of association, by-laws,
partnership agreements and all other similar applicable organizational
documents of each of the QNX Entities, as amended and in effect on the date

of any of the Companies. 
---|--- 
 



   3.3 | Each of the QNX Entities is duly registered, licensed, or
qualified to carry on business and is in good standing (where applicable) in
each jurisdiction in which the character of its properties and assets owned
or leased or the nature of its business makes such registration, licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so registered,
licensed or qualified or in good standing has not had or would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse
effect on the QNX Entities, taken as a whole, the Business or the results of
operations of the Business. 
---|--- 
 



   3.4 | This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of
the Sellers and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each of
the Sellers, enforceable against each of the Sellers in accordance with its
terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium and other similar laws
relating to or affecting creditors rights generally, and the fact that
equitable remedies, including the remedies of specific performance and
injunction, may only be granted in the discretion of a court of competent
jurisdiction. At the Closing Time, each of the Transaction Documents to which
a Seller or a QNX Entity is a party will be duly executed and delivered by
such Seller or QNX Entity and will constitute, when executed, a legal, valid
and binding obligation of each Seller and QNX Entity that is a party thereto,
enforceable against each such Seller or QNX Entity in accordance with its
terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium and other similar laws
relating to or affecting creditors rights generally, and the fact that
equitable remedies, including the remedies of specific performance and
injunction, may only be granted in the discretion of a court of competent
jurisdiction. 
---|--- 



 

\- 21 - the Transaction Documents and the completion of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Transaction Documents have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of each of the
Sellers and no other corporate proceedings or approvals are required on the
part of any of the Sellers to authorize this Agreement or the Transaction
Documents or to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Transaction Documents. 
---|--- 



   3.6 | Except as set forth in Schedule 3.6 of the Disclosure Letter,
except as otherwise provided in Sections 3.7, 3.8, 4.4, 4.5 or 4.6 and except
(in the case of clause (v)) as may result from any facts or circumstances
relating to the Buyers or their Affiliates, the execution, delivery and

construed as requiring the Buyers and their Affiliates to continue any
specific Benefit Arrangement or as preventing the Buyer and its Affiliates
from terminating (or modifying the terms of) the employment of any specific
Employee. Nothing contained in this Section 5.13 shall constitute an amendment
to any Benefit Arrangement or other employee benefit plan, create any third
party beneficiary rights or be enforceable by any employee of Sellers or
Buyers or their respective Affiliates.

$300,000 and any additional cash and cash equivalents, in the event that
Parent is unable to remove all cash and cash equivalents in excess of
$300,000 from the QNX Entities in accordance with the preceding sentence, or

agreement of each of the Buyers pursuant to this Agreement and pursuant to any
of the Transaction Documents to which such Buyer is a party, including the
payment of the Purchase Price and other amounts under Article II and any

Upon the failure of any Buyer to pay any amounts due by it under Article II

TAX MATTERS



   6.1 | Election under Section 56.4 of the _Tax Act_. The Sellers and
Buyer 1 agree to elect in prescribed form, or to the extent no such form has
been prescribed, in any form required by the applicable Tax Authority, to
apply proposed paragraphs 56.4(3)(c) and 56.4(7)(h) of the _Tax Act_ (and any
corresponding provincial elections that may be applicable) in respect of this
Agreement. Each of the Sellers and Buyer 1 shall make such election in a
timely manner consistent with this Agreement. Buyer 1 and the Sellers agree,
including for purposes of the elections referred to herein, that no portion of
the Purchase Price for the QSSC Shares and the Wavemaker Shares is allocated
to the covenants of the Sellers in the Mutual Non-Solicitation Agreement
referred to herein. 
---|--- 



   6.2 | Liability for Taxes. 
---|--- 



     | (a) |

Parent shall be responsible for, pay or cause to be paid, indemnify the Buyers
and each of their subsidiaries and Affiliates (including the QNX Entities
after the Closing Date) (each a "Buyer Tax Indemnitee"), and hold each Buyer
Tax Indemnitee harmless from and against, any and all Taxes (i) of, or imposed
on, the QNX Entities in respect of any Pre-Closing Period; (ii) imposed upon
QSSI for any taxable period that ends on or before or includes the Closing
Date pursuant to Section 1.1502-6 of the United States Treasury Regulations or
any similar provision of state or local law; (iii) of another person imposed
on any of the QNX Entities under any Tax sharing or Tax allocation agreement
in respect of 

---|---|--- 

  

 

\- 63 - Buyer 1 pursuant to subsection 116(5) of the Tax Act (together with any
interest and penalties related thereto), in respect of the acquisition by
Buyer 1 of the QSSC Shares and the Wavemaker Shares pursuant to this
Agreement, or (v) attributable to any breach by Parent or any of its
Affiliates of any covenant contained in this Agreement, in each case to the
extent any such Taxes are due or payable to any Tax Authority by the Buyer
Tax Indemnitees under Applicable Law (collectively, "Parent Taxes"); provided,
however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be responsible
for, and Parent Taxes shall not include, any Taxes to the extent that such
Taxes are specifically included as a Current Liability on the Closing Date
Balance Sheet or the Closing Date Working Capital Statement (or the applicable
worksheets thereto) ("WC Taxes") or result from (x) any breach by the Buyers
or any of their Affiliates of any covenant contained in this Agreement; (y)
any actions taken by any QNX Entity outside the ordinary course of business on
the Closing Date after the Closing Time; or (z) any Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization (collectively, such Taxes referred to in clauses (x), (y) and
(z), and any WC Taxes, "Buyer Taxes", in each case whether or not such Buyer
Taxes would have been Parent Taxes but for the proviso contained in this
Section 6.2(a)). For the avoidance of doubt, Taxes which Parent shall be
responsible for pursuant to this Section 6.2(a) shall include all Taxes for
any Pre-Closing Period of or attributable to any QNX Entity in respect of
income reported on or required to be shown in any Combined Tax Return that
Parent is responsible for filing pursuant to Section 6.3(a) of this Agreement,
other than any Buyer Taxes. Any indemnity payment required to be made by
Parent pursuant to this Section 6.2(a) (other than any indemnity payment for
Taxes shown on a Specified Section 6.3(b) Return, which shall be dealt with in
Section 6.3(b)) shall be made within thirty (30) days of written notice from
the Buyers, which notice shall not be delivered to Parent prior to a final
determination with respect to the issue to which such indemnity relates. 
---|--- 
 



     | (b) |

The Buyers shall be responsible for, pay or cause to be paid, indemnify Parent
and its subsidiaries and Affiliates (other than the QNX Entities) (each a
"Seller Tax Indemnitee"), and hold each Seller Tax Indemnitee harmless from
and against, (i) any Buyer Taxes and (ii) all Taxes of, or imposed on, the QNX
Entities (and any Taxes of another person in respect of any Post-Closing
Period imposed on any of the QNX Entities under any Tax sharing or Tax
allocation agreement) in respect of any Post-Closing Period, except to the
extent that such Taxes are the responsibility of Parent under Section 6.2(a),
in each case to the extent any such Taxes are due or payable to any Tax
Authority by the Seller Tax Indemnitees under Applicable Law. In the case of
Taxes shown on a Tax Return, any indemnity payment required to be made by
Buyers pursuant to this Section 6.2(b) shall be made no later than two (2)
Business Days prior to the Tax Return Due Date, _provided_ , _however_ , that
with respect to any such indemnity payment for Taxes shown on a Tax Return for
which Parent has the filing responsibility under Section 6.3(a), Parent shall
deliver to Buyers no later than twenty (20) days prior to the Tax Return Due
Date a notice setting forth the amount of such indemnity payment and a
description of the basis for such indemnity payment pursuant to 

---|---|--- 



 

\- 64 - any indemnity payment requirement to be made by Buyers pursuant to this
Section 6.2(b) shall be made within thirty (30) days of written notice from
Parent, which notice shall not be delivered to Buyers prior to a final
determination with respect to the issue to which such tax indemnity relates. 
---|--- 
 



     | (c) | For purposes of this Agreement, in determining the Taxes
attributable to the Pre-Closing Period included in any Straddle Period, (i)
Property Taxes shall be equal to the amount of such Property Taxes for the
entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of calendar days during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing
Period and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the
entire Straddle Period and (ii) Taxes (other than Property Taxes) shall be
computed as if such taxable period ended as of the end of the day on the
Closing Date (and for such purpose, the taxable period of any partnership or
pass-through entity (including any of the Subsidiaries) in which any of the
QNX Entities hold a beneficial interest will be treated as if such taxable
period terminated at such time). 
---|---|--- 
 



   6.3 | Filing Responsibility. 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Parent shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and
filed, when due: (i) all Tax Returns for any affiliated group of which Parent
is the common parent, (ii) any Tax Return which includes Parent or any other
member of the Seller Group, (iii) all Combined Tax Returns, which shall
include the QNX Entities to the extent required under Applicable Law or
consistent with past practice, and (iv) any other Tax Return of any of the
QNX Entities required to be filed on or prior to the Closing Date. Parent
shall pay all Taxes due in respect of the Tax Returns described in this
Section 6.3(a), subject to Parents right of indemnification or reimbursement
for any such Taxes pursuant to Section 6.3(b). 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

The Buyers shall, except to the extent that filing such Tax Returns is the
responsibility of Parent under Section 6.3(a), prepare and file, or cause to
be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns with respect to each of the QNX
Entities, provided, however, that with respect to any Straddle Period Tax
Returns and any other Tax Returns of any of the QNX Entities that includes the
Pre-Closing Period and for which Buyers have a filing responsibility pursuant
to this Section 6.3(b) (a "Specified Section 6.3(b) Return"): (i) Buyers shall
furnish such Tax Returns to Parent for Parents review and comment at least
thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return, including
extensions (the "Tax Return Due Date"), (ii) Buyer shall not file such Tax
Returns without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and (iii) such Tax Returns
shall be prepared and filed in a manner consistent with past practice for the
entity to which each such Tax Return relates, unless Buyers deliver
to Parent, or Parent delivers to Buyers, as the case may be, no later than
the Opinion Due Date an Impermissible Past Practice Opinion, as defined below,
provided, however, that, in the case of an Impermissible Past Practice, as
defined below, if there is more than one alternative practice permitted 

---|---|--- 



 

\- 65 - alternative practice shall apply to the preparation and filing of such Tax
Return. With respect to each Specified Section 6.3(b) Return, no later than
fifteen (15) days prior to the Tax Return Due Date, Parent shall provide to
Buyers comments on such Tax Return and Buyers shall incorporate all reasonable
comments of Parent (provided that to the extent a past practice exists with
respect to the aspect of the preparation and filing of such Tax Return that is
subject to Parents comments, such comments are consistent with past practice,
unless otherwise required by an intervening change in Applicable Laws,
or unless Parent delivers to Buyers no later than the Opinion Due Date, an
Impermissible Past Practice Opinion). With respect to any Specified Section
6.3(b) Return, Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Buyers or its
Affiliates (including the QNX Entities), as applicable, the amount for which
Parent is responsible under Section 6.2(a) no later than two (2) Business Days
prior to the Tax Return Due Date, _provided_ that Buyers have complied with
their obligations under this Section 6.3(b). For purposes of this Section
6.3(b), an Impermissible Past Practice Opinion shall mean an opinion,
reasonably acceptable to the party receiving such opinion from the Delivering
Party, of a nationally recognized accounting firm at no less than a "should"
level standard to the effect that the past practice from which the party
delivering such opinion (the "Delivering Party") seeks to diverge (an
"Impermissible Past Practice") is not permitted under the requirements of
Applicable Law. The Opinion Due Date shall mean, if a Buyer is the Delivering
Party, no later than thirty (30) days prior to the Tax Return Due Date, and if
Parent is the Delivering Party, no later than fifteen (15) days prior to the
Tax Return Due Date. 
---|--- 



   6.4 | Cooperation and Exchange of Information. From and after the
Closing Date, each party hereto shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
provide the other party hereto with such cooperation, documentation and
information as either of them reasonably may request in connection with (a)
filing any Tax Return or claim for refund, (b) determining a liability for
Taxes, an indemnity or payment obligation under this Article VI or a right to
a refund of Taxes, (c) conducting any Tax Proceeding (which shall include
granting any powers of attorney reasonably requested by the party entitled to
control a Tax Proceeding pursuant to Section 6.3(b)) or (d) determining an
allocation of Taxes between a Pre-Closing Period and a Post-Closing Period.
Such cooperation and information shall include providing copies of all
relevant portions of relevant Tax Returns, together with all relevant
accompanying schedules and work papers (or portions thereof) and other
supporting documentation. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, nothing herein shall require Parent or any of its Affiliates to
provide access to any Tax Returns, information, records or other material of
Parent or any of its Affiliates relating to any Combined Tax Returns. 
---|--- 



   6.5 | Contests. 
---|--- 



     | (a) | If any Taxing Authority asserts a Tax Claim in respect of
any QNX Entity, then the party hereto first receiving notice of such Tax Claim
promptly shall provide written notice thereof to the other party or parties
hereto. Such notice shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for such Tax
Claim and shall include a copy of the relevant portion of any correspondence
received from the Taxing Authority.  
---|---|--- 



 

\- 66 - in respect of any taxable period that ends on or before the Closing Date
Parent shall have the right to control, at its own expense, such Tax
Proceeding; provided, however, that with respect to any Tax Proceeding in
respect solely of a QNX Entity, which Tax Proceeding would reasonably be
expected to have an adverse effect on the Buyers or any of their Affiliates
(including the relevant QNX Entity) (i) Parent shall consult with Buyers
before taking any significant action in connection with such Tax Proceeding,
(ii) the Buyers shall be entitled to participate in such Tax Proceeding
at Buyers expense (along with counsel and other advisors of their choice)
and (iii) Parent shall not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax
Proceeding without obtaining the prior written consent of the Buyers (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to the extent such
settlement or compromise would reasonably be expected to result in an adverse
effect on the Buyers that is material, provided that if such consent is
withheld by Buyers, control of such Tax Proceeding shall be assumed by Buyers
at their own expense and Parents liability for any Taxes (including Parent
Taxes) resulting from such Tax Proceeding shall not exceed the amount that
would have been due under such settlement or compromise (Parents liability
for Taxes in excess of the amount that would so have been due, "Excess Taxes")
(and, notwithstanding any other provision, Buyer shall indemnify Parent
against any such Excess Taxes, to the extent any such Taxes are due or
payable to any Tax Authority by Parent or any of its subsidiaries or
Affiliates (other than any QNX Entity)). 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | In the case of a Tax Proceeding for a Straddle Period of a
QNX Entity, the Buyers shall have the right to control, at their own expense,
such Tax Proceeding; provided, however, that (i) the Buyers shall consult
with Parent before taking any significant action in connection with such Tax
Proceeding, (ii) Parent shall be entitled to participate in such Tax
Proceeding (along with counsel and other advisors of its choice), (iii)
Buyers shall take all actions in connection with such Tax Proceeding that
relate to a Pre-Closing Period no differently than any action in connection
with such Tax Proceeding that relates to a Post-Closing Period, and in all
cases shall treat any such Tax Proceeding as if any and all liability for
Taxes resulting therefrom were the responsibility of Buyers and (iv) the
Buyers shall not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without
obtaining the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, to the extent that such
settlement or compromise would result in an indemnification payment by Parent
for any Parent Taxes or otherwise reasonably be expected to result in an
adverse effect on Parent, provided that if such consent is withheld by Parent
and Buyers have complied with all their covenants hereunder in relation to
such Tax Proceeding, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, Parents liability for Taxes pursuant to Section 6.2(a) shall
include and Parent shall indemnify the Buyers and each of their subsidiaries
and Affiliates (including the QNX Entities) and hold them harmless from and
against the amount of Taxes resulting from such Tax Proceeding that are in
excess of the amount that would have been due under such settlement or
compromise. 
---|---|--- 
 



 

\- 67 - (other than any Tax Proceeding described in Sections 6.5(b) or 6.5(c)) Buyers
shall have the right to control, at their own expense, such Tax Proceeding,
Parent shall not have any right to participate in any such Tax Proceeding and
Section 6.5(a) shall not apply to such a Tax Claim; provided, however, that if
such Tax Proceeding would reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on
Parent or any of its Affiliates, and only at such time when it becomes readily
apparent that such Tax Proceedings would be expected to have such an effect
(the "Contest Relevant Time"), (i) the Buyer shall consult with Parent before
taking any significant action in connection with such Tax Proceeding, (ii)
Parent shall be entitled to participate in such Tax Proceeding (along with
counsel and other advisors of its choice), and (iii) from and after the
Contest Relevant Time, the Buyers shall not settle, compromise or abandon any
such Tax Proceeding without obtaining the prior written consent of Parent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
to the extent that such settlement or compromise would result in an
indemnification payment by Parent for any Parent Taxes or otherwise reasonably
be expected to result in an adverse effect on Parent that is material.  
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | Notwithstanding any other provision, Parent shall have the
exclusive right to control in all respects, including as to settlement, any
Tax Proceeding relating to any Combined Tax Return, the Buyers shall not have
any right to participate in any such Tax Proceeding and Section 6.5(a) shall
not apply to such a Tax Claim. 
---|---|--- 
 



   6.6 | Tax Sharing Agreements. All liabilities and obligations between
Parent or any member of the Seller Group, on the one hand, and the QNX
Entities, on the other hand, under any Tax allocation or Tax sharing
agreement in effect prior to the Closing Date (other than this Agreement)
shall cease and terminate as of the Closing Date. 
---|--- 
 



   6.7 | Tax Benefits. 
---|--- 



     | (a) |

If, as a result of any final determination with respect to any Tax Item for a
Pre-Closing Period, there is an increase (i) in Taxes of any QNX Entity in
respect of which Parent has indemnified a Buyer Tax Indemnitee pursuant to
Section 6.2(a), or (ii) in Taxes for which Parent (or with respect to any
Taxes paid on or prior to the Closing Date, any QNX Entity) is or was
otherwise liable (and, in the case of such Taxes in this clause (ii), which
Parent (or any QNX Entity) has paid on or prior to the Closing Date and which
are not Buyer Taxes), and, solely as a result of such final determination, any
QNX Entity (or Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates) actually
realizes a Tax Benefit for any Post-Closing Period (it being understood that
Buyer agrees to file or cause to be filed (or shall cause the relevant QNX
Entity to file or cause to be filed) all Tax Returns (including amended Tax
Returns) or other documents, to the extent permitted under Applicable Law,
claiming (x) any such Tax Benefit, (y) any refund to which Parent is entitled
under Section 6.7(b) below or (z) any Tax Benefit to which 

---|---|--- 



 

\- 68 - to Parent or as a reduction of an indemnification payment required to be made
by Parent)), then Buyers shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the amount
of such Tax Benefit, provided, however, that any such amount shall not exceed
the amount which Parent has paid to the Buyer Tax Indemnitees in respect of
such final determination (a "Tax Timing Payment"). Any such Tax Timing
Payment shall be paid no later than thirty (30) days of the filing of any Tax
Return in which such Tax Benefit is actually realized. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Buyers shall not be required
to make any Tax Timing Payment under this Section 6.7(a) in respect of any Tax
Benefit that is realized with respect to any taxable period following the
seventh taxable period after the Closing Date. 
---|--- 
 



     | (b) | Parent shall be entitled to any Tax refund (whether paid in
cash or by credit of or against Taxes) of, or attributable to, the QNX
Entities in respect of any Pre-Closing Period (to the extent that such Tax
refund was not specifically included as a Current Asset on the Closing Date
Balance Sheet or the Closing Date Working Capital Statement (or the applicable
worksheets thereto)), and Buyers shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent
any such Tax refund, net of any Taxes on the receipt thereof, within fifteen
(15) calendar days of receipt or entitlement thereto. 
---|---|--- 
 



   6.8 | Transfer Taxes. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the Buyers, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, shall
be responsible for and shall pay 50% of all documentary, registration, value
added, transfer, stamp and similar Taxes, fees and costs (collectively,
"Transfer Taxes") imposed on the sale of the Shares pursuant to this
Agreement, and each shall be entitled to 50% of any refund or reduction in
Transfer Taxes relating thereto. 
---|--- 



   6.9 | Taxes Governed by Article VI. Claims for indemnification with
respect to Taxes shall be governed by this Article VI but not by any other
provision of Article IX. 
---|--- 



   6.10 | Survival. All rights and obligations under this Article VI shall
survive the Closing Date and continue until sixty (60) days following the
expiration of the relevant statutes of limitation (including all periods of
extension). The Tax Representations shall not survive the Closing. 
---|--- 



   6.11 | Post-Closing Dispositions. For the avoidance of doubt, the
covenants of the Buyers and the QNX Entities set forth in this Article VI
shall apply to the Buyers and the QNX Entities regardless of any post-Closing
disposition of the QNX Entities by the Buyers or any of their Subsidiaries. 
---|--- 



   6.12 | Tax Treatment of Payments. Parent, the Buyers, the QNX Entities
and their respective Affiliates shall treat any and all payments under this
Article VI or Section 2.4 or Article IX as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price for Tax purposes unless they are required to treat such payments
otherwise by Applicable Laws. 
---|--- 
 



   6.13 | Section 338 Election. The Buyers covenant that they shall not
make, and shall cause their Affiliates not to make, an election under Section
338(g) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (or
any similar election under state, local or foreign Tax law) with respect to
any of the QNX Entities. 
---|--- 
 



 

\- 69 - Affiliates to treat, for United States Federal income and applicable state and
local Tax purposes, the sale of all of the outstanding shares of QSSC as a
sale and purchase of all the assets of QSSC and its Subsidiaries. 
---|--- 



   6.15 | After-Tax Indemnification. The amount of any indemnification
payment required to be made pursuant to this Agreement shall be (i) reduced by
an amount equal to any resulting actual Tax Benefit realized or to be
realized by the indemnified party with respect to the taxable year in which
the indemnification amount is received (or a prior taxable year), and (ii)
increased by any Taxes attributable to the receipt of such payment. If, as a
result of the incurrence or payment of any indemnified Loss or Tax by an
indemnified party, the indemnified party actually realizes a Tax Benefit with
respect to a taxable year after the taxable year in which the indemnification
amount is received, then the indemnified party shall pay, or cause to be paid,
to the indemnifying party the amount of such Tax Benefit, provided, however,
that any such payment of the amount of a Tax Benefit shall be paid no later
than thirty (30) days of the filing of any Tax Return in which such Tax
Benefit is actually realized and that any such amount to be paid by the
indemnified party shall not exceed the amount which the indemnifying party
paid to the indemnified party and provided further, however, that the
indemnified party shall not be required to make any payment of the amount of a
Tax Benefit in respect of any Tax Benefit that is realized with respect to any
taxable period following the seventh taxable period after the Closing Date.

claiming any such credit against Taxes in a prior year. For purposes of
determining when such a reduction of (or refund of or credit against) Taxes
has actually been realized, such item shall only be considered to have been
applied after all other items of loss, deduction or credit and any other
items which decrease Taxes paid or payable otherwise available to the person
claiming such item, in each case arising in the year with respect to which
such reduction of (or refund of or credit against) Taxes would have been
realized before taking into account this last sentence of Section 6.16(c) (or

---|---

under this Article IX except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is

agreement. Notice of any Claim shall specify with reasonable particularity (to
the extent that the information is available): 
---|--- 



     | (a) | whether the Claim is a Direct Claim or a Third Party Claim; 
---|---|---

faith at such time to quantify such amount.

such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense and (ii)
Section 9.2(a), 9.2(b) or 9.2(c), the Buyers shall assume the defense and
control of such Third Party Claim (with outside legal counsel acceptable to
the Indemnifying Party), but shall allow the Indemnifying Party a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim with its
own counsel and at its own expense (provided that any such expenses shall be
counted as Losses for purposes of calculating the cap on indemnification set
forth in Section 9.8(b)(ii)). 
---|---|--- 
 



 

\- 77 - indemnity is sought pursuant to Section 9.2(a), 9.2(b), 9.2(c), 9.3(a) or
9.3(b) is of a nature such that the Indemnified Person is required by
Applicable Laws to make a payment to any Person (a "Third Party") with respect
to such Third Party Claim before the completion of settlement negotiations or
related legal proceedings, the Indemnified Person may make such payment and
the Indemnifying Person shall, forthwith after demand by the Indemnified
Person, reimburse the Indemnified Person for any such payment. If the amount
of any liability under the Third Party Claim which is indemnifiable hereunder
and in respect of which such a payment was made, as finally determined, is
less than the amount which was paid by the Indemnifying Person to the
Indemnified Person, the Indemnified Person shall, forthwith after receipt of
the difference from the Third Party, pay such difference to the Indemnifying
Person. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | The Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person shall
cooperate fully with each other with respect to Third Party Claims, shall keep
each other fully advised with respect thereto (including supplying copies of
all relevant documentation promptly as it becomes available) and shall each
designate a senior officer who will keep himself or herself informed about and
be prepared to discuss the Third Party Claim with his or her counterpart and
with legal counsel at all reasonable times. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | With respect to any Third Party Claim for which indemnity is
sought pursuant to (i) Section 9.3(a) or 9.3(b) the Indemnifying Party shall
be authorized to consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment
arising from, any Third Party Claim, without the consent of any Indemnified
Person; _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party shall (A) pay or cause to be
paid all amounts in such settlement or judgment and (B) obtain, as a
condition of any settlement or other resolution, a release of the Indemnified
Person affected by such Third Party Claim and (ii) Section 9.2(a), 9.2(b) or
9.2(c), the Buyers shall not consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any
judgment arising from, such Third Party Claim, without the consent of the
Sellers. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | The above provisions of this Section 9.6 shall not apply to
Tax Proceedings. 
---|---|--- 
 



   9.7 | No Right to Set-off. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement or the Transaction Documents to the contrary, no party shall have
any right to off-set or set-off any payment due pursuant to this Article IX
against any other payment to be made pursuant to this Agreement or the
Transaction Documents or otherwise. 
---|---

contrary, Sellers shall not be required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless

States Dollars) (less any amounts paid pursuant to Section 9.2(c)), (iii) with
respect to any claim unless such claim involves Losses (A) pursuant to
9.2(a), and solely in respect of breaches of the representations and
warranties set forth in Sections 3.37(a) (solely with respect to any Claim
related to the infringement, unauthorized use, or violation of any
Intellectual Property Rights), 3.37(e), 3.38(a), 3.38(c), 3.43, 3.47, 3.52,
3.53(a) and 3.64, in excess of $600,000 and (B) in all other cases, in excess
of $25,000 (in the case of clauses (A) and (B), nor shall such claims be

Claims for purposes of the following clause (iv)) and (iv) unless the
aggregate amount of Claims for indemnification pursuant to Sections 9.2(a),
9.2(b) and 9.2(c) are in excess of $6,000,000 (six million United States
Dollars) ( _provided_ , _however_ , that after the aggregate amount of such
Claims are in excess of such amount, the Buyers shall be entitled to receive
the full amount of the Buyers Claims, subject to the other limitations
set forth in this Article IX); and

     | (b) | any Losses pursuant to Section 9.2(c), (i) to the extent

pursuant to Sections 9.2(a), 9.2(b) and 9.2(c) are in excess of $6,000,000
(six million United States Dollars) ( _provided_ , _however_ , that after the
aggregate amount of such Claims are in excess of such amount, the Buyers shall
be entitled to receive the full amount of the Buyers Claims, subject to the
other limitations set forth in this Article IX) and (v) on or following the
date that is twenty one (21) months from the Closing Date ( _provided_ that if
any claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2(c) have been asserted
prior to such date, such claims and the obligations of the Sellers pursuant to
Section 9.2(c) shall continue in effect until final resolution of all such
claims). 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | For the avoidance of doubt, in any case Sellers shall not be
required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless any Buyer Indemnified Person
against, or reimburse any Buyer Indemnified Person for amounts (i) under this

Adjustment Amount procedures set forth in Section 2.4, (b) in excess of
$40,000,000 (forty million United States Dollars), (c) with respect to any
claim unless such claim involves Losses in excess of $25,000 (nor shall such
claims be applied to or considered for purposes of calculating the aggregate
amount of Claims for purposes of the following clause (d)) and (d) unless the
aggregate amount of Claims for indemnification pursuant to Sections 9.3(a) and
9.3(b) are in excess of $6,000,000 (six million United States Dollars) (
_provided_ , _however_ , that after the aggregate amount of such Claims are in

party or any failure by the other party to perform or comply with any covenant
or agreement in this Agreement that, by its terms, was to have been performed,
or complied with, by such other party prior to the Closing. Without limiting

Remedies. The parties acknowledge and agree that an award of damages would be
inadequate for any breach of this Agreement by any party or
its representatives, advisors or agents and that such breach would cause the
non-breaching party irreparable harm. Accordingly, the parties agree that, in
the event of any such breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by one of
the parties, the Sellers (if the Buyers or the Guarantor is the breaching
party) or the Buyers (if the Sellers are the breaching party) will be
entitled, without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, to
equitable relief, including the issuance of injunctive relief by the Ontario
Courts to compel performance of such

\- 82 - or threatened breaches of this Agreement and the granting of specific
performance of such partys obligations hereunder. Except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, such remedies will not be the exclusive remedies
for any breach of this Agreement but will be in addition to all other remedies
available at law or in equity to each of the parties.  
---|--- 



   10.3 | Amendments; No Waivers. 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Except as expressly provided otherwise herein, no amendment
or waiver of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing and
signed, in the case of an amendment, by the Buyers, the Sellers and the
Guarantor or, in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is
to be effective. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall constitute
a waiver of any other provision nor shall any waiver of any provision of this
Agreement constitute a continuing waiver unless expressly provided for herein
or therein. No investigation or waiver made by or on behalf of any party shall
have the effect of waiving, diminishing the scope of or otherwise affecting
any representation or warranty made by any other party pursuant to this
Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | No failure or delay by any party hereto in exercising any
right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor
shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The
rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of
any rights or remedies provided by law.  
---|---|--- 



   10.4 | Expenses. Except as may be otherwise specified in this Agreement
or the Transaction Documents, each party shall be responsible for and bear all
of its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the Transaction Documents, including expenses of its representatives incurred
at any time in connection with pursuing or consummating the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction Documents, whether or not
the Closing shall have occurred. For greater certainty, the Sellers shall be
responsible for and bear all of the costs and expenses, including legal fees,
of the QNX Entities relating to the period up to and including the Closing
Time. 
---|--- 



   10.5 | Benefit of the Agreement. Subject to Section 10.6, the
provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the parties hereto and their respective heirs, executors, successors and
assigns. 
---|--- 



   10.6 | Assignment. No party to this Agreement may assign its rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement (whether by operation of law or
otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any
such purported assignment is void; provided that the Sellers may assign any or
all of their rights and obligations under this Agreement to any subsidiary of
Parent so long as no such assignment shall release the Sellers from any
liability or obligation under this Agreement. 
---|--- 



 

\- 83 - ---|--- 



     | (a) | From time to time after the Closing, each party will, at the
request of any other party and without further consideration, execute and
deliver to the requesting party such other documents, and take such other
action, as such requesting party may reasonably request in order to vest in
the Buyers good, valid and marketable title to the Shares and the Intellectual
Property Rights owned by each QNX Entity and to give the Buyers contractual
rights to the Intellectual Property Rights licensed to each QNX Entity. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | If, after the Closing, the Sellers or their Affiliates
receive any funds that are the property of the Buyer or its Affiliates
(including the Companies), Parent shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates
to, remit any such funds, and any cash and cash equivalents of the QNX
Entities included in the adjustment to the Purchase Price in accordance with
Section 5.14, promptly to Buyer or such Affiliate. If, after the Closing, the
Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Companies) receive any funds that are
the property of the Sellers or their Affiliates, the Buyer shall, or shall
cause one of its Affiliates to, remit any such funds promptly to such Seller
or such Affiliate. 
---|---|--- 



   10.8 | No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is for the sole
benefit of the parties and their permitted successors and assigns, and nothing
in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon
any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy. No provision
of this Agreement shall create any third party beneficiary or other rights in
any employee or former employee (including any beneficiary or dependent
thereof) of the QNX Entities in respect of continued employment (or resumed
employment) with the QNX Entities, and no provision of this Agreement shall
create any such rights in any such Persons in respect of any benefits that
may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any Benefit Arrangement or any
plan or arrangement that may be established by the Buyers or any of their
Affiliates. 
---|--- 
 



   10.9 | Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance
with and governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario and the laws of
Canada applicable therein, including all matters of construction, validity
and performance, in each case without reference to any conflict of Law rules
that might lead to the application of the Laws of any other jurisdiction. 
---|--- 
 



   10.10 | Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party shall have received a
counterpart hereof signed by the other parties hereto. This Agreement may be
executed and delivered by facsimile transmission and such facsimile copy will
be deemed to be an original. 
---|--- 



   10.11 |

Entire Agreement. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or
the Transaction Documents, this Agreement, the Transaction Documents and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents and supersede all prior agreements, understandings
and negotiations, both written and oral, 

---|--- 



 

\- 84 - No representation, inducement, promise, understanding, condition or warranty
not set forth herein has been made or relied upon by any party with respect
to this Agreement. 
---|--- 



   10.12 | Jurisdiction. Subject to Section 10.13, any suit, action or
proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or arising out of or relating
to, this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents shall be brought in
the courts of the Province of Ontario (the "Ontario Courts"), and each of the
parties hereby consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts) in any such suit, action or proceeding and
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or the
Transaction Documents in any court other than the Ontario Courts. Each of the
parties hereby waives (a) any obligation to forum or venue laid therein, (b)
any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above
named courts for any reason other than failure to serve in accordance with
this Section 10.12 and (c) any claim that it or its property is exempt or
immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced
in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to
judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment
or otherwise). Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on
any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the Province of
Ontario, by means of the notice procedures set forth in Section 10.1 and
each party agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by
registered mail (return receipt requested and first-class postage prepaid) to
the respective addresses set forth in Section 10.1 shall be effective service
of process for any suit or proceeding in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 
---|--- 



   10.13 | Arbitration. Any dispute between or amongst the parties arising
in relation to a Claim pursuant to Section 9.2 or Section 9.3 shall be
resolved through arbitration administered by and in accordance with the
National Arbitration Rules of the ADR Institute of Canada Inc. (the
"Institute") pursuant to the _International Commercial Arbitration Act_
(Ontario) and based upon the following: 
---|--- 



     | (a) | the arbitration tribunal shall consist of one arbitrator
appointed by mutual agreement of the parties, or in the event of failure to
agree on an arbitrator within ten (10) Business Days of the date on which a
dispute is determined to be resolved through arbitration, then either party
may request that the Institute appoint the arbitrator from the list of
qualified arbitrators maintained by the Institute. If the Institute fails to
appoint an arbitrator within fourteen (14) Business Days of being asked to do
so, any party hereto may apply to have the arbitrator appointed by a judge of
the Ontario Superior Court of Justice; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | the seat of the arbitration shall be in Toronto, Ontario and
it shall be conducted in the English language; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | the arbitration award(s) shall be given in writing and shall

of arbitration and all matters related thereto; and 
---|---|--- 



 

\- 85 - court having jurisdiction, or, application may be made to such court for a
judicial recognition of the award or an order of enforcement thereof, as the
case may be. 
---|---|--- 



   10.14 | Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is
declared invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any court of law
having jurisdiction over the parties and this Agreement, the parties shall
engage in good faith negotiations to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable, valid
and enforceable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.
