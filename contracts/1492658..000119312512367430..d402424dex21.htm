vi AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is dated August 23,
2012, by and among TORNIER N.V., a Dutch public company with limited
liability ( _naamloze vennootschap_ ) (" _Parent_ "), OSCAR ACQUISITION CORP.,
a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_
"), ORTHOHELIX SURGICAL DESIGNS, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "
_Company_ "), and, solely in its capacity as representative of the Holders
pursuant to _Article 9_ hereof, the Representative. Capitalized terms used and
not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in _Article 10_
below.

WHEREAS, this Agreement contemplates a transaction in which Parent
shall acquire the Company pursuant to a transaction in which Merger Sub, a
direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, shall merge with and
into the Company, with the Company surviving the merger, in accordance with
the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), and the holders of the
Company Stock, Options and Warrants shall receive cash, and with respect to
such holders that are accredited investors, Parent Shares, as consideration in
such merger;

 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company has, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth herein, (i) approved this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) recommended acceptance of the Merger
and approval of this Agreement by the Holders;

WHEREAS, the board of directors of Parent and Merger Sub, and Parent, in its
capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, have each, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein, approved and consented to the
Merger, the execution by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the
DGCL as well as all other applicable Law;

 

WHEREAS, promptly following the execution of this Agreement, in order to
induce Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, the Company shall
endeavor to obtain and deliver to Parent an executed Action by Written Consent
of the Stockholders adopting this Agreement, executed by Stockholders holding
at least (a) a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock
and Company Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class on an as-
converted to Company Common Stock basis, and (b) at least two-thirds of the
outstanding shares of Company Preferred Stock voting together as a single
class on an as-converted to Company Common Stock basis (the " _Required
Stockholder Approval_ "); and

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, representations and
warranties and mutual covenants contained herein and of other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged and intending to be legally bound, the parties agree as follows: ARTICLE 1

_THE MERGER_

1.01 _The Merger_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, at the Effective
Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company in accordance with
the DGCL (the " _Merger_ "), whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "
_Surviving Corporation_ ").

 

(b) At the Effective Time (as defined below), the effect of the Merger shall
be as provided in this Agreement and the Merger Certificate and as provided
by the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, and subject thereto, upon the consummation of the Merger, all
the property, rights, privileges and powers of the Company and the Merger
Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities,
obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of each of those
corporations shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions,
disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation, all as provided under
the DGCL.

1.02 _Closing; Effective Time_. The closing of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place through the remote
exchange of electronic copies of executed documents (a) on the later of (i)
the second (2nd) Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions to the Closing set forth in _Article 2_ below (other than
conditions which are to be satisfied on the Closing Date which such conditions
shall be satisfied on the Closing Date) or (ii) on the day that the Marketing
Period ends (notwithstanding any earlier satisfaction and/or waiver of the
closing conditions set forth in _Article 2_ ) or such earlier date within the
Marketing Period specified by Parent on not less than two (2) Business Days
written notice to the Company, or (b) at such other place or such other date
as is mutually agreeable to the parties hereto. The date of the Closing is
herein referred to as the " _Closing Date_." At the Closing, Merger Sub and
the Company shall cause a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") to be executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall
become effective as of the date and time of such filing or such other time
after such filing as Merger Sub and the Company shall agree in the Certificate
of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ "). In the event of a conflict between this
Agreement and the Certificate of Merger, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, this Agreement shall govern.

1.03 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws; Directors and Officers_.

(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read as the
certificate of incorporation of the Merger Sub in effect at the Effective Time
(except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "OrthoHelix
Surgical Designs, Inc."), and as so amended and restated shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until amended in
accordance with applicable Law.

 



2 (b) The bylaws of Merger Sub in effect at the Effective Time shall be the
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with
applicable Law (except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be
"OrthoHelix Surgical Designs, Inc.").

 

(c) The officers and directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall become, from and after the Effective Time, the officers
and directors of the Surviving Corporation, until their respective successors
are duly elected or appointed or their earlier resignation or removal.

1.04 _Treatment of Company Stock, Options and Warrants_.

(a) At the Effective Time, except as otherwise provided in _Section 1.04(g)_
and _1.07_ , each share of Company Preferred Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted, without any action on the part
of holders thereof, into the right to receive (i) an amount in cash equal to
(A) for Company Preferred Stock other than Series C Preferred Stock, the
Liquidation Preference for such share and (B) for Series C Preferred Stock,
the Liquidation Preference for such share, _minus_ the value of the Series C
PIK Dividend with respect to such share, _plus_ (ii) consideration with a
value equal to (A) (1) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
issuable upon the conversion of such share of Company Preferred Stock
immediately prior the Effective Time, _plus_ (2) for Series C Preferred Stock,
the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon the
conversion of the Series C PIK Dividend with respect such share into Series C
Preferred Stock, and then the conversion of such resulting shares into Company
Common Stock immediately prior the Effective Time, _multiplied by_ (B) the Per
Share Price (the consideration described in (ii), the " _Closing Preferred
Stock Consideration_ "), _plus_ (iii) the proceeds, if any, distributed
pursuant to _Section 1.05(k)_, _Section 1.10_, and/or from the Escrow
Account in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement.

(b) At the Effective Time, except as otherwise provided in _Sections 1.04(g)_
and _1.07_ , each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted, without any action on the part of
the holders thereof, into the right to receive (i) consideration with a value
equal to the Per Share Price (such amount, the " _Closing Common Stock
Consideration_ "), _plus_ (ii) the proceeds, if any, distributed pursuant to
_Section 1.05(k)_,  _Section 1.10_, and/or from the Escrow Account in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

(c) At the Effective Time, each Option issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, shall be fully vested and cancelled in exchange for the right to
receive (i) consideration with a value equal to (A) the excess, if any, of the
Per Share Price over the applicable exercise price (per share) of such Option,

if any, of (A) (1) the Per Share Price, _multiplied by_ (2) the number of

thereof had such holder exercised such Warrant in full by paying the cash
exercise price thereof and converted the resulting shares of Series C
Preferred Stock or Series D Preferred Stock, as applicable, issued in
connection with such exercise into Company Common Stock over (B) the aggregate
exercise price for all shares of Series C Preferred Stock or Series D
Preferred Stock, as applicable, had the holder thereof exercise such Warrant

(h) At the Effective Time, each share of common stock of Merger Sub

same rights, powers and privileges as existed prior to such conversion. From
and after the Effective Time, the holders of certificates evidencing ownership
of the shares of Company Stock (" _Company Stock Certificates_ ") outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such shares of Company Stock except as otherwise provided for

_Paying Agent_ ") to act as paying agent in connection with the consideration
to be paid to the Holders pursuant to a paying agent agreement between Parent
and the Paying Agent in reasonable form and substance (the " _Paying Agent

Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver (i) a Letter of
Transmittal in substantially the form of _Exhibit A_ hereto to the
Stockholders, and a Letter of Transmittal in substantially the form of

Options who are employees of the Company and entitled to receive a portion of
the Aggregate Merger Consideration in respect of their Options an
Option Cancellation Agreement in the form of _Exhibit D_ hereto (together
with the Non-Employee Option Cancellation Agreements", the " _Option
Cancellation Agreements_ ").

 

(c) At the Closing, Parent shall deliver or pay, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to deliver or pay, in cash by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, the Estimated Aggregate Merger Consideration, the Escrow
Amount, the Representative Amount, the balance of amounts of the Indebtedness
identified on the Indebtedness Pay-Off Schedule and outstanding Holder

(i) (A) the Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be deposited into an escrow account
(the " _Indemnity Escrow Account_ ") and (B) the Working Capital Escrow

which accounts shall be established pursuant to the Escrow Agreement;

 



5 (ii) all amounts necessary to fully discharge the then-outstanding
balances of the Indebtedness identified on the _Indebtedness Pay-Off
Schedule_ shall be paid on behalf of the Company to the applicable creditors
accounts set forth in the Pay-Off Letters or as otherwise advised by such
creditors in writing; 

(iii) the Representative Amount shall be deposited into an account designated

Closing (the " _Representative Fund_ ");

(iv) all amounts necessary to fully discharge the then-outstanding balances

Schedule_ shall be paid on behalf of the Company to the accounts designated by
the Persons owed such amounts as set forth on the _Holder Transaction

(v) the aggregate cash consideration to be paid to Stockholders pursuant to
_Sections 1.04(a)_ , _1.04(b)_ , _1.04(e)_ and _1.04(f)_ shall be paid to the
Paying Agent, for payment, in accordance with such Sections, to each
Stockholder who has completed and returned to the Paying Agent a properly
completed and executed Letter of Transmittal, together with the Company Stock
Certificates (or an affidavit of lost stock certificate in form reasonably
acceptable to Parent) representing such Stockholders outstanding shares of
Company Stock;

(vi) the aggregate cash consideration (other than Option Closing
Consideration to be paid to Optionholders who are, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, employees of the Company) to be paid to Optionholders and
Warrantholders pursuant to _Sections 1.04(c)_ , _1.04(d)_ , _1.04(e)_  and
_1.04(f)_ shall be paid to the Paying Agent, for payment to the Holders (other
than Option Closing Consideration to be paid to Optionholders who are,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, employees of the Company) in
accordance with such Sections; and

(vii) the aggregate Closing Option Consideration to be paid to Optionholders
who are employees of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time and
whose Options represent the right to receive payment in cash pursuant to
_Sections 1.04(c)_ , _1.04(e)_ and _1.04(f)_ shall be paid to the Surviving
Corporation and such proceeds shall then be paid to such Holders of Options
through the Surviving Corporations payroll system as provided in _Section
1.05(g)_ below.

(d) At the Closing, through such mechanics as may be required taking into
account the requirements of applicable Law and accounting and tax
considerations, Parent shall, or shall cause a third party to, deposit with
the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the Accredited Holders, evidence of the
Parent Shares to be issued to the Accredited Holders pursuant to _Section
1.04_ (the " _Parent Share Consideration_ "), in electronic or book-entry
form. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent
to deliver, to each Stockholder and each Warrantholder that is an Accredited
Holder and who has completed a Letter of Transmittal and 

 



6  each holder of Options that is an Accredited Holder and who has completed an
Option Cancellation Agreement and returned them to the Paying Agent, together
with the Company Stock Certificates representing outstanding shares of
Company Stock or an affidavit of lost stock certificate in form reasonably
acceptable to Parent, a number of Parent Shares (rounded down to the nearest
share) issuable pursuant to _Section 1.04_. In lieu of any fractional share
of a Parent Share that a Holder would have received had the number of Parent
Shares not been rounded down, each such Holder shall be paid (and after taking
into account and aggregating shares of Company Stock represented by all
Company Stock Certificates surrendered by, or Options or Warrants held by,
such Holder) cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the fractional share interest to which such Holder
(after taking into account and aggregating all shares of Company Stock
represented by all Company Stock Certificates surrendered by, or Options or
Warrants held by, such Holder) would otherwise be entitled by (y) the Parent
Trading Price.

 

(e) The Parent Shares pursuant to the terms of this Agreement will be issued
in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act by reason
of Section 4(2) thereof and/or Regulation D promulgated under the Securities
Act and may not be re-offered or resold other than in conformity with the
registration requirements of the Securities Act and such other applicable
rules and regulations or pursuant to an exemption therefrom. Until the resale
by the Accredited Holders of their Parent Shares has become registered
(including pursuant to the Registration Statement) under the Securities Act,
or otherwise transferable pursuant to an exemption from such registration
otherwise required thereunder, the Parent Shares issued to the Accredited
Holders hereunder shall be characterized as "restricted securities" under the
Securities Act and, if certificated, shall bear the following legend (or if
held in book entry form, will be noted with a similar restriction):

 

"THE SHARES OF STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR
INVESTMENT PURPOSES ONLY, AND THE RESALE OF SUCH SHARES HAS NOT BEEN
REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933. SUCH SHARES MAY NOT BE RESOLD OR
OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION WITHOUT AN EXEMPTION
UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT."

 

(f) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to deliver to each Stockholder who has completed a
Letter of Transmittal and returned it to the Paying Agent, together with any
applicable Company Stock Certificate (or affidavit of lost stock certificate
in form reasonably acceptable to Parent) and each Warrantholder and each non-
employee holder of Options who has completed and returned to the Paying Agent
a Letter of Transmittal or Option Cancellation Agreement (although no payment
will be withheld from a Warrantholder or non-employee Optionholder for failing
to complete a Letter of Transmittal or Option Cancellation Agreement to the
extent not required by the applicable warrant or option agreement or option
plan) a check (or if elected by such Holder, a wire transfer) representing
that portion of the Closing Cash Consideration to which such Holder is
entitled. The delivery of such checks (or wire transfers, as applicable) by
the Paying Agent shall be deemed, for all purposes, to have satisfied in full
the obligations of Parent to pay the Closing Cash Consideration to such
Holders and Parent shall have no further obligation for such payments. Parent
shall not be required to pay any amount of the Closing Cash Consideration, the

 



7  Parent Share Consideration or any portion of the 2013 Earnout Amount or 2014
Earnout Amount to any Stockholder until receipt from such Stockholder of
properly completed and executed Letters of Transmittal and the applicable
Company Stock Certificate or an affidavit of lost stock certificate in form
reasonably acceptable to Parent.

(g) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to pay, through the Companys payroll system,
to each Holder of Options who is, immediately prior to the Effective Time, an
employee of the Company, that portion of the Closing Cash Consideration to
which such Holder of Options is entitled.

(h) Until surrendered in accordance with this Agreement, each Company Stock
Certificate, each of the Options and each of the Warrants shall represent
after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive payment
as provided in this Agreement.

(i) As promptly as possible, but in any event within sixty (60) days after
the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to the Representative its calculation
of the Aggregate Merger Consideration (the " _Closing Statement_ "). The
Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the Agreed Accounting
Principles. The Closing Statement shall entirely disregard any of the plans,
transactions, or changes which Parent intends to initiate or make or cause to
be initiated or made after the Closing with respect to the Surviving
Corporation and its business and assets, and any facts or circumstances that
are unique or particular to Parent or any of its assets or liabilities.

(j) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) provide
the Representative and its representatives with reasonable access during
normal business hours to the books, records (including work papers,
schedules, memoranda and other documents), supporting data, facilities and
employees of the Surviving Corporation to the extent reasonably necessary for
their review of the Closing Statement, and (ii) cooperate with
the Representative and its representatives in connection with such review,
including providing on a timely basis all other information reasonably
requested by the Representative and its representatives that is to be used in
connection with the review of the Closing Statement. If the Representative
has any objections to the Closing Statement, the Representative shall deliver
to Parent a statement setting forth its objections thereto (an " _Objections
Statement_ "), which statement shall identify in reasonable detail those
items and amounts to which the Representative objects (the " _Disputed Items_
"). If an Objections Statement is not delivered to Parent within 30 days after
delivery of the Closing Statement, the Closing Statement as prepared by
Parent shall be final, binding and non-appealable by the parties; _provided_
that, in the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries does not provide any papers or documents reasonably requested by
the Representative or any of its representatives within five (5) Business Days
of request therefor (or such shorter period as may remain in such 30 day
period), such 30 day period shall be extended by one day for each
additional day required for Parent, the Surviving Corporation or one of its
Subsidiaries to fully respond to such request. The Representative and Parent
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the Disputed Items and all such
discussions shall (unless otherwise agreed by Parent and the Representative)
be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and any applicable
similar state rule, but if they do not reach a final resolution within 30 days
after the delivery of the Objections Statement to Parent, the Representative
and Parent shall submit any unresolved Disputed Items (and only such
unresolved Disputed Items) to an independent

 



8  national accounting firm mutually selected by Parent and the Representative
(the " _Accounting Firm_ "). In the event the parties submit any unresolved
Disputed Items to the Accounting Firm, each party shall submit a Closing
Statement (which in the case of each party may be a Closing Statement that,
with respect to the unresolved Disputed Items (but not, for the avoidance of
doubt, with respect to any other items), is different than the Closing
Statement initially submitted to the Representative, or the Objections
Statement delivered to Parent, as applicable) together with such supporting
documentation as it deems appropriate, to the Accounting Firm within 30 days
after the date on which such unresolved Disputed Items were submitted to the
Accounting Firm for resolution. The Representative and Parent shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to
resolve such dispute as soon as practicable, but in any event within 30 days
after the date on which the Accounting Firm receives the Closing Statements
prepared by the Representative and Parent. In resolving any such dispute, the
Accounting Firm may not assign a value to the any unresolved Disputed Item
greater than the highest amount the Representative or Parent assigns to such
Disputed Item in their respective Closing Statements or less than the lowest
amount the Representative or Parent assigns to such Disputed Item in their
respective Closing Statements. The Representative and Parent shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to
notify them in writing of its resolution of such dispute as soon
as practicable. The Closing Statement that includes the final determination
of the unresolved Disputed Items by the Accounting Firm shall be final,
binding and non-appealable by the parties. Each party shall bear its own costs
and expenses in connection with the resolution of such dispute by the
Accounting Firm. All costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm, if any, shall
be paid by Parent and the Representative, respectively, in the proportion that
the aggregate dollar amount of the unresolved Disputed Items submitted to the
Accounting Firm by such party that are unsuccessfully disputed by such party
(as finally determined by the Accounting Firm) bears to the aggregate dollar
amount of all unresolved Disputed Items submitted by Parent and
Representative. For example, should the items in dispute total in amount to
$1,000 and the Accounting Firm awards $600 in favor of the Representatives
position, 60% of the costs of the Accounting Firms review would be borne
by Parent and 40% of the costs would be borne by Representative.

(k) If the Aggregate Merger Consideration as finally determined after taking
into account the final determination of the Closing Statement pursuant to
_Section 1.05(j)_ (the " _Final Aggregate Merger Consideration_ ") is greater
than the Estimated Aggregate Merger Consideration, then, within five (5)
Business Days after the determination of the Final Aggregate Closing
Consideration:

(i) Parent will pay or will cause the Surviving Corporation to pay by wire
transfer of immediately available funds (A) to the Paying Agent, who will in
turn pay to each Holder that has previously received a payment pursuant to 
_Section 1.05(c)_, _(d)_ or _(e)_ , such Holders Proportionate Share of
such excess (other than the portion of such excess to be paid on account of
any Option held by any Optionholder who was an employee of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) to each Optionholder
that was an employee of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
and that has previously received payment pursuant to _Section 1.05(g)_,
pursuant to the Surviving Corporations payroll system, such Optionholders
Proportionate Share of such excess with respect to such Options; and

 



9 (ii) Parent and Representative will jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to pay,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds, each Holder that received a
payment pursuant to _Section 1.05(c)_, _(d)_ , _(e)_ , or _(f)_ , such
Holders Proportionate Share of the balance of the Working Capital Escrow
Account.

(l) If the Final Aggregate Merger Consideration is less than the Estimated
Aggregate Merger Consideration, then, within five (5) Business Days after the
determination of the Final Aggregate Merger Consideration:

 

(i) Parent and Representative will jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to pay to
Parent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to
such shortfall from the Working Capital Escrow Account and to pay, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, each Holder that received a payment
pursuant to _Section 1.05(c)_, _(d)_ ,  _(e)_ or _(f)_ such Holders
Proportionate Share of the balance, if any, of the Working Capital Escrow
Account after the payment of such shortfall; and

 

(ii) if such shortfall exceeds the balance of the Working Capital Escrow
Account, Parent and Representative will jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to
pay from the Indemnity Escrow Funds to Parent, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, an amount equal to (A) such shortfall, _minus_ (B) the
balance of the Working Capital Escrow Account. 

(m) At any time following the day that is twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any earnings received with
respect thereto) and Parent Shares that had been made available to the Paying
Agent and that have not been disbursed to Holders and thereafter such Holders
shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) and only as general
creditors thereof with respect to the applicable portion of the Aggregate
Merger Consideration payable to them, without any interest thereon.

(n) All payments required pursuant to _Sections 1.05(k)_  and _1.05(l)_ shall
be deemed to be adjustments for Tax purposes to the aggregate purchase price
paid by Parent pursuant to this Agreement (in the case of Parent, in respect
of the shares in the Surviving Corporation held by Parent as a result of the
Merger), unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

(o) The Representative shall deliver to Parent, at least two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, a distribution schedule (the " _Distribution
Schedule_ "), setting forth the Representatives calculation of how the
Aggregate Consideration Amount shall be allocated among the Holders, in
addition to an electronic copy thereof in Microsoft Excel format. Parent shall
be able to rely on, and shall have no liability to any party to this Agreement
or to any Holder for any payment reflected on, the Distribution Schedule.
The Distribution Schedule shall include:

(i) the name, address (as listed in the corporate record books of
the Company) and, the extent provided by such Holder in a Letter of
Transmittal or Option

 



10  Cancellation Agreement, the social security number or tax identification
number of each Holder and an indication for each Optionholder as to whether
such Holder is a former or current employee of the Company;

(ii) each Holders Proportionate Share and Holder Indemnification Percentage
and, if applicable, Accredited Proportionate Share;

(iii) the amount, in dollars, of (A) the amount of cash payable to each such
Holder pursuant to _Section 1.04_ and (B) the amount of Tax withholding and
any payroll Tax deductions in respect of that portion of the aggregate
consideration attributable to the Company Options held by each Company Option
Holder who is a former or current employee of the Company (with Parent Shares
valued at the Parent Trading Price);

(iv) the number of Parent Shares issuable to each Holder pursuant to _Section
1.04_;

(v) the number of (A) shares (separated by class and series) of Company Stock,
(B) Warrants and (C) Options, if any, held by each such Holder; and

 

(vi) certificate prefix(es) and certificate number(s) for the Company Stock.

 

1.06 _Registration Statement_.

(a) Provided that all holders of Registrable Securities have adequately and
timely provided Parent with all selling shareholder information required to be
included in the Registration Statement, Parent shall file a shelf
registration statement on Form S-3 (including any amendments or supplements,
the " _Registration Statement_ ") and the prospectus (including any amendments
or supplements, the " _Prospectus_ ") forming part of the Registration
Statement in compliance with Rule 415 under the Securities Act as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Closing Date (but in no event later than five
Business Days later than the Closing Date) covering the resale on
a continuous basis of the shares of Parent Shares issued in consideration of
the Merger (the " _Registrable Securities_ ") issued as Parent Share
Consideration in connection with the Closing. In connection with the filing of
the Registration Statement, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become effective as soon as
reasonably practicable and to remain effective as provided herein; _provided_
, _however_ , that in either case before filing the Registration Statement,
Parent shall furnish or otherwise make available to the Representative at
least two (2) days prior to filing with the SEC copies of all such documents
proposed to be filed in connection with the Registrable Securities registered
thereby and keep the Representative reasonably apprised of the status of such
Registration Statement.

(b) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and file
with the SEC such amendments and supplements to the Registration Statement as
may be necessary to keep the Registration Statement effective until the
earliest of (i) the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date, (ii) such
time that all Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement
have been sold thereunder or pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated by the

 



11  SEC under the Securities Act ("Rule 144"), or (iii) such time that all
Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement may be sold
without volume or manner-of-sale restrictions pursuant to Rule 144 and
without the requirement for Parent to be in compliance with the current public
information requirement under Rule 144 (the " _Effectiveness Period_ ").

 

(c) Parent shall furnish to each Holder of Registrable Securities such number
of copies, without charge, of such Registration Statement, each amendment and
supplement thereto, and Prospectus included therein, all exhibits and other
documents filed therewith and such other documents as such Holder of
Registrable Securities may reasonably request in order to facilitate the
disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by such Holder of Registrable
Securities.

(d) As a condition precedent to registering Registrable Securities, Parent
may require each Holder of Registrable Securities as to which any registration
is being effected to furnish Parent with such information regarding such
Person that are necessary to satisfy the disclosure requirements relating to
the registration and the distribution of such securities as Parent may from
time to time reasonably request in writing. Each such Holder of Registrable
Securities shall promptly notify Parent in writing of any changes in the
information set forth in the Registration Statement after it is prepared
regarding the Holder of Registrable Securities. For the purposes of this
_Section 1.06_, a " _Holder of Registrable Securities_ " refers solely to a
holder or holders of Registrable Securities as of the Closing Date.

(e) Parent may, by two (2) days prior written notice to all the Holders of
Registrable Securities (each, a " _Blackout Notice_ "), (i) delay the filing
of the Registration Statement or a request for acceleration of the effective
date or (ii) suspend the Registration Statement after effectiveness and
require that the Holders of Registrable Securities immediately cease sales of
shares pursuant to the Registration Statement, in the event that (A) Parent is
engaged in any activity or transaction or preparations or negotiations for
any activity or transaction that Parent desires to keep confidential for
business reasons, if Parent determines in good faith that the public
disclosure requirements imposed on Parent under the Securities Act in
connection with the Registration Statement would require at that time
disclosure of such activity, transaction, preparations or negotiations and
such disclosure could result in imminent and material harm to Parent or (B)
any other event occurs that makes any statement of a material fact made in
the Registration Statement, including any document incorporated by reference
therein, untrue or that requires the making of any additions or changes in the
Registration Statement in order to make the statements therein not
misleading. If Parent suspends the Registration Statement and requires the
Holders of Registrable Securities to cease sales of shares pursuant to this
_Section 1.06(e)_, Parent shall, promptly as reasonably
practicable following the termination of the circumstance which entitled
Parent to do so, take such actions as may be necessary to file or reinstate
the effectiveness of the Registration Statement and give written notice to all
Holders of Registrable Securities authorizing them to resume sales pursuant
to the Registration Statement. If as a result thereof the Prospectus included
in the Registration Statement has been amended to comply with the requirements
of the Securities Act, Parent shall enclose such revised Prospectus with the
notice to Holders of Registrable Securities given pursuant to this _Section
1.06(e)_, and the Holders of Registrable Securities shall make no offers or
sales of shares pursuant to the Registration Statement other than by means of
such revised Prospectus. Parent need not specify the nature of the event
giving rise to any delay or suspension in any notice to Holders of Registrable
Securities and such Holders of Registrable Securities agree to treat and keep
the existence of such delay or suspension, as the case may be, confidential.

 



12 (f) Parent shall cause all Parent Shares received by Holders in connection
with the Closing to be listed on the NASDAQ no later than the first full
trading day on the NASDAQ after the Closing Date.

(g) Parent shall pay all fees and expenses in connection with compliance with
its obligations under this _Section 1.06_, including all fees and expenses in
connection with the filing of the Registration Statement, the registering of
the Registrable Shares, fees and expenses of compliance with securities or
"blue sky" Laws, transfer agent fees, the maintenance of the effectiveness of
the Registration Statement, and the listing of the Parent Shares on the
NASDAQ, including all registration, filing, qualification, printing,
accounting and other fees and expenses except that Parent shall not be
responsible for the fees of the representatives of and counsel to, the Company
and the Holders, including those with respect to any review and preparation
of the Registration Statement (all of which shall be included in the Holder
Transaction Expenses).

1.07  _Treatment of Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Stockholders who have properly demanded appraisal
of their shares of Company Stock pursuant to, and who comply in all respects
with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ")
shall not have such shares converted as provided herein, but instead such
Stockholders shall be entitled to such rights (and only such rights) as are
granted under Section 262 of the DGCL. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
extinguished and shall cease to exist, and except as otherwise provided by
Law, each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto other than the rights granted pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Stockholder shall fail to validly
perfect or shall otherwise waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal
under Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that such Stockholders is not entitled to the relief provided by
Section 262 of the DGCL, then the rights of such Stockholders under Section
262 of the DGCL shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have
been converted at the Effective Time as set forth in _Section 1.04(a)_ or
_1.04(b)_ , as applicable. The Company shall give Parent prompt written
notice of any demands for appraisal with respect to Dissenting Shares, and
Parent shall have the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands, and any settlements with respect
thereto shall not be entered into without the prior written consent of
Representative and Parent (such consents not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). Any payments to be made in respect of Dissenting Shares shall be
made by Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation.

1.08 _No Further Ownership Rights in Capital Stock_. The consideration paid in
accordance with the terms hereof (including the Escrow Funds) shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company

shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Company Stock
Certificates are presented to Parent or the Surviving Corporation for any
reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided and in accordance

1.09 _Lost Certificates_. If any Company Stock Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Company Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed, and an indemnity, reasonably satisfactory to Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and their Affiliates, against any claim that may be made against
any of them with respect to such Company Stock Certificate, the Surviving
Corporation shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company
Stock Certificate, the applicable Per Share Price to be paid in respect of the

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the due date for Parents
filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC for fiscal year 2013 but
no later than ten (10) Business Days after the due date of such filing,
Parent shall provide the Representative its calculation of the 2013 Earnout
Amount, including the Lower Extremity Sales for fiscal year 2013 and
information and data reflecting and demonstrating such sales; provided, that
if the Company is no longer required to file such reports, the due date for
such calculation shall be March 15 of the applicable year.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable following the due date for Parents
filing of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q with the SEC for each of Parents
fiscal quarters during fiscal year 2014 (or Annual Report on Form 10-K with
the SEC for the last fiscal quarter during fiscal 2014) but no later than ten
(10) Business Days after the due date of such filing, Parent shall provide the
Representative its calculation of the 2014 Earnout Amount for such fiscal
quarter, including the Lower Extremity Sales for each such fiscal quarter and
information and data reflecting and demonstrating such sales; provided, that
if the Company is no longer required to file such reports, the due date for
such calculation shall be within 45 days of the close of the applicable fiscal
quarter, except that the due date will be March 15, 2015 with respect to the
last fiscal quarter. Parent shall have no obligation to deliver such
statements after it has paid the Holders an aggregate amount equal to
$20,000,000 pursuant to this _Section 1.10_.

(c) On or before the fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on which the
Representative accepts Parents calculation of the 2013 Earnout Amount (either
by delivering written notice of acceptance to Parent or deemed acceptance
under _Section 1.10(e)_) or the 2013 Earnout Amount is finally determined
under _Section 1.10(e)_, Parent shall, subject to Parents set-off rights
expressly set forth in _Article 8_ , pay each Holder an amount (if any), in
immediately available funds, equal to (i) the 2013 Earnout Amount, _multiplied
by_ (ii) such Holders Proportionate Share.

 



14 (d) On or before the fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on which the
Representative accepts Parents calculation of a 2014 Earnout Amount (either
by delivering written notice of acceptance to Parent or deemed acceptance
under _Section 1.10(e)_) or a 2014 Earnout Amount is finally determined
under  _Section 1.10(e)_ for a particular quarter, Parent shall, subject to
Parents set-off rights expressly set forth in _Article 8_ , pay each Holder
an amount (if any), in immediately available funds, equal to (i) the
2014 Earnout Amount for such quarter, _multiplied by_ (ii) such Holders
Proportionate Share.

(e) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide
Representative and its representatives with reasonable access during normal
business hours to the books, records (including work papers, schedules,
memoranda and other documents), supporting data and employees of the
Surviving Corporation to the extent reasonably necessary to verify the 2013
Earnout Amount and the 2014 Earnout Amount for such fiscal quarter. If the
Representative has any objections to the statements described in
_Sections 1.10(a)_ and _1.10(b)_ (each, an " _Earnout Statement_ "), the
Representative shall deliver to Parent a statement setting forth, in
reasonable detail, its objections thereto (each, an " _Earnout
Objection Statement_ "). If an Earnout Objection Statement is not delivered
to Parent within 30 days after delivery of an Earnout Statement, such Earnout
Statement as prepared by Parent shall be deemed irrevocably accepted by the
Representative on behalf of the Holders and be final, binding and non-
appealable by the parties and the Holders. The Representative and Parent shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve the objections raised in any Earnout
Objection Statement, but if they do not reach a final resolution within 30
days after the delivery of an Earnout Objection Statement to Parent, any
unresolved disputes shall be submitted to an independent national accounting
firm mutually selected by Parent and the Representative (the " _Earnout
Accounting Firm_ "). In the event any such dispute is submitted to the Earnout
Accounting Firm, each party shall be permitted to submit a statement setting
forth its calculation of the applicable earnout amounts, together with such
supporting documentation as it deems appropriate, to the Accounting Firm. The
Representative and Parent shall use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Earnout Accounting Firm to resolve such dispute as soon
as practicable, but in any event within 30 days after the date on which the
Earnout Accounting Firm receives the applicable statements prepared by the
Representative and Parent. The calculation of the 2013 Earnout Amount or the
2014 Earnout Amount for a particular quarter as finally determined by the
Earnout Accounting Firm (which such determination shall be made in a manner
consistent with the terms of this Agreement and shall not, for either earnout,
be less than the amount set forth in the applicable Earnout Statement nor
exceed the amount set forth in the applicable Earnout Objection Statement)
shall be final, binding and non-appealable among the parties. Each party shall
bear its own costs and expenses in connection with the resolution of such
dispute by the Earnout Accounting Firm. All costs and expenses of the Earnout
Accounting Firm, if any, shall be paid by the party whose calculation of the
applicable earnout amount is farthest from the final determination of
the Earnout Accounting Firm.

(f) All payments required pursuant to _Section 1.10(c)_ or _Section
1.10(d)_, shall be deemed to be adjustments for Tax purposes to the aggregate
purchase price paid by Parent pursuant to this Agreement (in the case of
Parent, in respect of the shares in the Surviving Corporation held by Parent
as a result of the Merger), unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

 



15 (g) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, refrain from taking any action the sole purpose of which is
to reduce the amount of the 2013 Earnout Amount or the 2014 Earnout Amounts.

1.11 _Withholding_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Escrow
Agent and the Representative (as applicable) shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the amounts payable under this Agreement such amounts as may be
required to be deducted and withheld under the Code, and any other applicable
Tax Laws, that are set forth on the Distribution Schedule or that the Paying
Agent is entitled to withhold as set forth in the General Instructions in the
Letter of Transmittal. Any such withheld amount shall be timely paid over to
the appropriate Governmental Body and treated as though it had been paid to
the Person in respect of which such withholding was required.

 

1.12 _Interest; No Liability_. All payments made pursuant to this _Article 1_
, whether at the Closing or afterwards, shall be without interest. None of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any Person
in respect of any cash or securities delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

1.13 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. Without limiting the other provisions
of this Agreement, in the event that the Company changes the number of shares
of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as
a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer
tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the consideration paid
in accordance with this Agreement shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such
change.

delivered to Parent concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, which such disclosures shall apply to (a) the representations set
forth in the corresponding Section of this _Article 3_ and (b) all other
representations contained in _Article 3_ to which such disclosure,
qualification or exception is reasonably apparent on its face to be
applicable:

3.01 _Organization and Corporate Power_. The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State
of Delaware. The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and
all authorizations, licenses and permits necessary to own, lease and operate
its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted and
as currently proposed to be conducted, except where the failure to hold such
authorizations, licenses and permits would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
The Company is duly qualified or authorized to do business and is in good
standing in every jurisdiction in which its ownership of property or the
conduct of business as now conducted requires it to qualify, except where the
failure to be so qualified, authorized or in good standing would not have a
Material Adverse Effect, and all such jurisdictions are set forth on the
_Foreign Qualification Schedule_. True and complete copies of the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, as in effect as of the date
hereof, have been heretofore made available to Parent.

3.02 _Authorization; Valid and Binding Agreement_. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and each other agreement, document, or
instrument or certificate contemplated by this Agreement by the Company and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been

Company, and no other proceedings on the Companys part are necessary to
authorize the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement. The

majority of the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock and Company
Preferred Stock voting together as a single class on an as-converted to
Company Common Stock basis and (b) at least two-thirds of the

approval of the Merger are the only votes of the holders of any of the
Companys capital stock necessary in connection with the consummation of the
Merger, and no other corporate proceeding is necessary to authorize the
execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement. Assuming that this
Agreement is a valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub, this
Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be

the knowledge of the Company, threatened) by the FDA or any other Governmental
Body with respect to any of the Products or any facilities where any such
Products are tested, produced, processed, packaged or stored. The FDA has not
mandated that the Company do a recall of any of its Products. There are no

the form of updated disclosure schedules) any development, fact or
circumstance arising after the date hereof causing a breach of any of the
representations and warranties contained in _Article 3_ hereof, or any
covenant hereunder, so as to cause the conditions to Closing set forth in
_Section 2.02_ to fail to be satisfied;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in
either case, no such disclosures shall be deemed to amend and supplement the
disclosure schedules delivered on the date hereof and attached hereto or
otherwise disclose an exception to, or affect in any manner, the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or
remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties or the Holders under this Agreement.

 

5.07 _Stockholder Approval_. Promptly after execution of this Agreement, the

notice and other Disclosure Materials to be transmitted to the Stockholders
pursuant to this _Section 5.07_ prior to delivery thereof to the Stockholders
and shall not transmit to the Stockholders any such notice or Disclosure

The

to the Parent and the Parent Shares as Parent may reasonably request in
writing prior to such delivery in connection with the potential issuance of
Parent Shares pursuant to this Agreement.

5.08 _Company Option Plan; Notice to Holders of Options_. Prior to Closing,
the Companys board of directors shall adopt such resolutions and

transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) notifying each holder of Options that
such Options shall accelerate and shall become exercisable in full, and (iii)
informing such holder that the Options shall terminate upon the Effective
Time, unless exercised prior thereto, in exchange for the payments

Company shall obtain, maintain and fully pay for an extended reporting period
endorsement of the Companys current directors and officers liability
insurance in respect of acts, omissions or other matters occurring or existing
at or prior to the Effective Time (including for acts or omissions occurring
in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby) covering the Indemnified Parties currently
covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy
on terms with respect to such coverage and amount no less favorable than
those of such policy in effect on the date hereof for a period of six (6)
years following the Effective Time. The premium for such policy, to the extent
not paid prior to the Closing, shall be considered a Holder Transaction
Expense.

5.10 _Company Financing Cooperation_. During the period from the date of the
Agreement until the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.01_ hereof, the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to, at Parents cost, cooperate as reasonably requested by
Parent and Merger Sub with respect to matters required to be performed under
the Commitment Letter and related financing or under any replacement
financing, which shall include, without limitation, (i) participation in no
more than two (2) lender and rating agency meetings and presentations, (ii)
the preparation of bank books and related materials (and providing reasonable
and customary authorization letters to the financing sources authorizing the
distribution of information to prospective lenders and containing customary
information) and (iii) the execution of documents and certificates required or
reasonably requested for the closing of the related financing. The Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, as promptly as practicable,
update or correct any information regarding the Company that was provided to
Parent and its financing sources in order to ensure that such information does
not contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements contained therein not
materially misleading.

5.11 _Third Party Consents_. The Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to (a) cause each individual listed on _Schedule 5.11(a)_
to execute, prior to the Effective Time, an Invention Assignment Agreement in
the form attached hereto as _Exhibit F_ and (b) obtain the consents listed on
_Schedule 5.11(b)_ in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent. If
the consents set forth on _Schedule 2.02(e)(viii)_ have not been delivered,
the Company may, in its 

 



47  sole discretion and by notice delivered to Parent at least three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing, elect to increase the Escrow Fund by an
amount equal to $2,000,000 or such lesser or greater amount that the Company
and Parent reasonably agree may be repayable by the Company under the
Government Grants listed on the Government Grants Schedule as a result of not
getting such consents (if so elected, such amount, the " _Additional Escrow
Amount_ " and such funds, the " _Additional Escrow_ ") in order to satisfy any
claim pursuant to _Section 8.02(a)(vii)_. Upon the earlier of (y) the receipt
of the consents set forth on  _Schedule 2.02(e)(viii)_ or (z) the payment of
any amounts that are required to be repaid under any Government Grant set
forth on the _Government Grants Schedule_ received by the Company prior to the
Closing to the extent arising from the termination of such a Government Grant
as a result of the failure to obtain a consent set forth on _Schedule
2.02(e)(viii)_ , the parties shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release to the
Holders the remaining balance, if any, of the Additional Escrow. If the
Company elects to fund the Additional Escrow as provided in this _Section
5.11_, the parties shall negotiate with the Escrow Agent in good faith to
modify the Escrow Agreement to reflect the terms of this  _Section 5.11_.

shall survive the Merger, it being the intent of the parties each Indemnified
Person of the Company shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation,

in the applicable governing documents of the Company on the date of this
Agreement.

Subsidiaries be required to (i) effect any divestiture or license of any
assets or properties of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation), (ii) hold separate any such assets or properties,
(iii) agree to any restrictions on the operations, business or assets
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation),
or (iv) defend any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger,
including seeking to have vacated or reversed any decree, order or judgment
entered by any court or other Governmental Body that would restrain, prevent

(a) From and after the Closing, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or the Surviving Corporations appropriate Subsidiary to,
maintain in effect for each person who is an employee of the Company as of the
Closing, whether or not then actively at work, including any such employees
who are on vacation leave, leave of absence or disability leave (a "
_Continuing Employee_ "), compensation programs, benefits and other terms of
employment that provide compensation and benefits that in the aggregate are
not less favorable than the compensation and benefits that Parent provides to
its similarly situated employees generally except that Parent may, if it so
elects, keep the compensation programs of the Company in effect as of the
Closing and the benefits provided under the employee benefit plans, programs
and arrangements of the Company as of the Closing any keep the Continuing
Employees on such programs, plans and arrangements for such time period as the
Parent may elect.

 



49 (b) To the extent not otherwise required by or resulting from the operation of
Law, Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation) to, recognize the service of each employee of the Company (an "
_Employee_ ") with the Company as of the Closing as service with Parent or its
Affiliates for all purposes under any applicable benefit plan of Parent or
its Affiliates in which such Employee shall be eligible to participate on and
after the Closing Date (but not for purposes of benefit accrual under
applicable defined benefit retirement plans), in each case to the extent such
prior service is credited under the corresponding employee benefit plan,
program or arrangement of the Company as of the Closing.

(c) With respect to any self-insured welfare benefit plans of Parent or any of
its Affiliates, Parent shall cause, and with respect to all other welfare
benefit plans, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause,
any pre-existing conditions, limitations, eligibility waiting periods or

Employees and their eligible dependents. Parent shall take all
actions necessary to ensure that any Continuing Employees (and their
dependents) who were participating in any deductible-based medical, vision
and/or dental benefit plans of the Company or any of its Affiliates
immediately prior to the Closing shall be given credit for deductibles, co-
payments and eligible out-of-pocket expenses incurred toward deductibles, co-
payments and out-of-pocket maximums during the portion of the plan year
preceding the Closing Date in a comparable deductible-based medical, vision
and/or dental benefit plan of Parent or any of its Affiliates for the
corresponding benefit plan year.

(d) No provision in this _Section 6.04_ shall (i) create any third-party
beneficiary or other rights in any employee or former employee (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Company or any other Person other
than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns, (ii) constitute or create or be deemed to constitute or create an
employment agreement or (iii) constitute or be deemed to constitute an
amendment to any employee benefit plan sponsored or maintained by Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates.

6.06 _Financing_. Parent and Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger
Sub to, use their commercially reasonable efforts to arrange and maintain the
financing described in the Commitment Letter on the terms and conditions
described therein (provided, that Parent and Merger Sub may amend, waive,
supplement, modify and/or replace (in whole or in part) the Commitment Letter
so long as the amended terms would not, or would not reasonably be expected
to, materially and adversely impact or delay the ability of Parent and Merger
Sub to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement),
including using their commercially reasonable efforts to (a) (i) maintain in
effect the Commitment Letter, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions
to the transactions contemplated by the Commitment Letter that are in their
respective control and (iii) enter into definitive agreements with respect to
the Commitment Letter on terms and conditions contained therein or consistent
in all material respects with respect thereto such that Parent shall have
proceeds sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement at or prior to the Closing. If the Commitment 

 



50  Letter shall expire or terminate for any reason, Parent and Merger Sub shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and promptly provide the
Company and the Representative with a copy of a new financing commitment that
provides for an amount of financing sufficient to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and other terms and conditions that are not
materially less as favorable to Parent and Merger Sub as compared to those
contained in the Commitment Letter. In the event that all conditions
applicable to the Commitment Letter have been satisfied and the lenders
described therein fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by the
Commitment Letter, Parent and Merger Sub agree to use their commercially
reasonable efforts to enforce their rights under the Commitment Letter
(including their rights to cause the lenders described therein to fund the
transactions described therein), provided that Parent and Merger Sub need not
seek specific performance if they reasonably conclude it is not reasonably
likely to succeed under such circumstances. Parent and Merger Sub shall not
extend the termination date under the Commitment Letter (or any permitted
replacement thereof) without the prior written consent of the Company. Parent
and Merger Sub shall provide Company with weekly updates with respect to the
financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters (including updates with
respect to the progress of such financing and the targeted closing date of
such financing) and shall provide the Company with reasonable access to the
lenders thereunder to provide updates with respect to such financing. Any
reference in this Agreement to the "Commitment Letter" shall include the
financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter in effect on the date hereof,
as permitted to be amended, modified or replaced (in whole or in part) by this
_Section 6.06_. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company with prompt
written notice of any breach by any lender of any obligation under the
Commitment Letter.

6.07 _Registration Statement; Registrable Securities_.

(a) The Registration Statement shall not, during the Effectiveness Period,
except in the case of when a Blackout Notice is issued by Parent, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in
the case of the Prospectus, any form of prospectus or supplement thereto), in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except
for information expressly provided by the Company or any Holder in writing
pursuant to _Section 1.06(d)_ of this Agreement. Any information supplied by
or on behalf of Parent for inclusion in materials provided to the Holders in
connection with _Section 5.07_, shall not, on the date such materials are
first provided to the Holders and at the time of the Stockholder Approval,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein not misleading.

(b) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to remain eligible to use
Form S-3 (or any successor form thereto) under the Securities Act during the
Effectiveness Period. Parent shall pay the filing fee covering the Registrable
Securities at the time the Registration Statement is filed. If at any time
Parent no longer eligible to use Form S-3, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to refile the registration statement on Form S-1 and keep
such registration statement effective during the period during the
Effectiveness Period.

 

(c) Upon reasonable request by a Holder, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to work with Parents transfer agent to assist such Holder
to expedite or

 



51  facilitate the transfer of the Registrable Securities, including removing
any restrictive legends that Parent believes are no longer necessary and
delivering customary opinions to Parents transfer agent.

forth on _Schedule 2.02(e)(viii)_ and (viii) the indemnification matters set
forth on _Schedule 8.02(a)(viii)_.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, each
Parent Indemnitees right to recover a Loss pursuant to this Agreement shall
be limited as follows:

(i) no Parent Indemnitee shall be entitled to any indemnification under
_Section 8.02(a)(i)_ for any individual item unless the Loss relating to such
claim, (or series of claims arising from the same or substantially similar
facts or circumstances) is more than $10,000;

 

(ii) subject to _Section 8.02(b)(iv)_, no Parent Indemnitee shall be entitled
to any indemnification hereunder unless the aggregate of all Losses relating
to all breaches of such representations, warranties and covenants would exceed
on a cumulative basis an amount equal to $500,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), and
then only to the extent such Losses exceed the Deductible;

(iii) subject to _Section 8.02(b)(v)_, the aggregate indemnification of
the Parent Indemnitees hereunder shall not exceed an amount equal to
$20,000,000 (the " _Cap_ ");

 

(iv) the Deductible shall not apply to Losses arising out of (A) the breach of
any Company Fundamental Representation, (B) the breach of the representations
and warranties contained in _Section 3.09_ (Tax Matters), (C) the matters
that are subject to indemnification under clauses (iv), (v), (vi) or (vii)
of  _Section 8.02(a)_ or (D) fraud;

(v) the Cap shall not apply to Losses arising out of (A) the breach of any
Company Fundamental Representations or (B) fraud (collectively, the "
_Uncapped Obligations_ "); and

(vi) the indemnification obligation of each Holder with respect to any Loss
hereunder shall not exceed an amount equal to (A) such Holders
Indemnification Percentage, multiplied by (B) the amount of such Loss.

 



55 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement or
otherwise, from and after the Closing (but subject to the terms and
conditions of this _Article 8_ ), any indemnification of the Parent
Indemnitees for which the Holders are liable hereunder shall be effected
first, until the Indemnity Escrow Funds are exhausted, solely and exclusively
by a payment made from the Indemnity Escrow Funds in accordance with the terms
of the Escrow Agreement, and, only after the Indemnity Escrow Funds have been
exhausted (but, for the avoidance of doubt, subject to the Cap, if
applicable), by setoff against the payment obligations with respect to the
2013 Earnout Amount and the 2014 Earnout Amounts, if any, except that (i) for
Uncapped Obligations, Parent shall only be obligated to use setoff against
the Earnout Amount payment obligations to the extent that such payments are
then due and payable and may otherwise proceed directly against a Holder,
subject to the last sentence of this _Section 8.02(c)_ and _Section
8.02(b)(vi)_ and (ii) indemnification obligations pursuant to _Section
8.02(a)(vii)_ are subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 8.02(i)_.
For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this  _Article 8_ , the Parent Indemnitees sole and exclusive source of
indemnification (other than with respect to indemnification for Losses arising
out of the Uncapped Obligations) shall be by making a claim against the Escrow
Fund or seeking setoff hereunder and no Parent Indemnitee may seek to collect
payment directly from any Holder or the Representative for any Loss hereunder.
In no event shall any Holders liability for any indemnification claims
hereunder exceed the amount such Holder actually received pursuant to this
Agreement (including the value of any Parent Shares received, with any such
value determined based on the Parent Trading Price).

(d) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the Representative (solely
in its capacity as the Representative) is a party to this Agreement solely to
perform certain administrative functions in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby. Accordingly, the parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that Representative shall have no liability to, and
shall not be liable for any Losses of, any party hereto or to any Parent
Indemnitee in connection with any obligations of the Representative under this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement or otherwise in respect of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent such Losses are a
result of gross negligence or willful misconduct by the Representative in
connection with the performance of its obligations hereunder or under the
Escrow Agreement.

(e) Except as provided in the last sentence of this _Section 8.02(e)_, no
claim shall be brought or maintained by any party or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates or their respective successors or
permitted assigns against any officer, director, employee (present or former)
or Affiliate of the Company, Representative or any Holder, or any Affiliate of
any of the above, as applicable (each of whom is deemed a third-party
beneficiary of this _Section 8.02(e)_), which is not otherwise expressly
identified as a party hereto, and no recourse shall be brought or granted
against any of them, by virtue of or based upon any alleged misrepresentation
or inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations, warranties or
covenants of any party hereto set forth or contained in this Agreement or any
exhibit or schedule hereto or any certificate delivered hereunder.
Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, (i) Parent will be
entitled to bring a claim for indemnification directly against a Holder under
_Section 8.02(b)(i) _for any breach of a Company Fundamental Representation,
subject to the last sentence of  _Section 8.02(c)_ hereof and _Section
8.02(b)(vi)_ and (ii) Parent will be entitled to pursue any claim directly
against a Holder under a Letter of Transmittal, Option Cancellation 

 



56  Agreement, Accredited Investor Questionnaire or Lock-Up Agreement (each, a "
_Holder Agreement_ "), but only against the executing Holder, in which case
(y) none of the limitations set forth herein (other than those set forth in
the last sentence of _8.02(c)_ ) will apply with respect to such claim and (z)
with respect to any claim arising under any Holder Agreement, the limitations
set forth therein shall apply.

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
Holders shall have no obligation to indemnify any of the Parent Indemnitees
from and against any Taxes of any Person (i) that are attributable to any
Buyer Tax Act or (ii) to the extent of the amount of such Tax that is
specifically accrued as a liability and reflected in Net Working Capital.

(g) All payments under this _Section 8.02_ shall be treated by the parties as
an adjustment to the proceeds received by Holders pursuant to _Article 1_ ,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

(h) If the Parent Indemnitees set off any Losses against the payment of the
2013 Earnout Amount or any 2014 Earnout Amount and any claim for such Losses
(or any portion thereof) is later found not to be indemnifiable hereunder,
Parent shall pay to the Paying Agent an amount in cash sufficient to pay the
Holders, in accordance with their Proportionate Share, an aggregate amount
equal to the portion of such amount found not to be indemnifiable, plus
interest thereon, from the date such payment was to be made pursuant to
_Section 1.10_, at a rate of six percent (6.0%) per annum.

(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
all claims pursuant to _Section 8.02(a)(vii)_ shall be satisfied solely from
the Additional Escrow and such claims shall be disregarded for purposes of
calculating whether the Deductible or Cap have been satisfied or reached.

8.03 _Indemnification of Holders_. From and after the Closing (but subject to
the provisions of this _Article 8_ ), Parent shall indemnify and hold each
Holder, each Holders Affiliates and each of their respective officers,
directors, managers, employees, stockholders, members, partners, agents,
representatives, successors and assigns (the " _Holder Indemnitees_ ")
harmless from and against, and pay to the applicable Holder Indemnitees the
amount of, any and all Losses based upon, attributable to or resulting from
(a) a breach of any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub set
forth in _Article 4_ this Agreement, and (b) any breach of any covenant of
Parent or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement requiring performance by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation at or after the Closing. All payments
under this _Section 8.03_ shall be treated by the parties as an adjustment to
the proceeds received by the Holders pursuant to _Article 1_.

 

8.04 _Expiration of Claims_. The ability of any Parent Indemnitee or Holder
Indemnitee to receive indemnification pursuant to  _Sections 8.02_ or _8.03_
, respectively, shall terminate on the applicable survival termination date
(as set forth in _Section 8.01_), unless such Parent Indemnitee or Holder
Indemnitee, as applicable, has made, in good faith, a proper claim for
indemnification pursuant to _Sections 8.02_ or _8.03_ , respectively, subject
to the terms and conditions of this _Article 8_ , prior to such termination
date, as applicable. If a Parent Indemnitee or a Holder Indemnitee

 



57  has made, in good faith, a proper claim for indemnification pursuant to
_Sections 8.02_ or _8.03_ , respectively, prior to such termination date, then
such claim, if then unresolved, shall not be extinguished by the passage of
the deadlines set forth in _Section 8.01_.

8.05 _Inter-Party Claims_. In order for a Parent Indemnitee or Holder
Indemnitee to be entitled to seek any indemnification provided for under this
Agreement (such party, the " _Claiming Party_ "), such Claiming Party must
notify the other party or parties from whom such indemnification is sought
(the " _Defending Party_ ") in writing promptly after the Claiming Party
becomes aware of the occurrence of the event giving rise to such Claiming
Partys claim for indemnification, specifying in reasonable detail the basis
and, if available, the amount of Loss with respect to, such claim; _provided_
, that failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification
provided hereunder except to the extent the Defending Party is materially
prejudiced as a result of such failure or the indemnification obligations are
materially increased as a result of such failure. If the Defending Party
disputes its liability with respect to any such claim, the Defending Party
and the Claiming Party shall proceed to negotiate a resolution of such dispute
and, if not resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall, subject to the
terms of this Agreement, be resolved by litigation in an appropriate court
of competent jurisdiction. The Claiming Party shall have the burden of proof
in establishing the amount of Losses it has suffered.

 

8.06 _Third Party Claims_.

(a) In order for a Claiming Party to seek any indemnification provided for
under this Agreement in respect of a claim or demand made by any third party
Person against the Claiming Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such Claiming
Party must notify the Defending Party in writing, specifying in reasonable
detail the basis and, if available, the amount of Loss with respect to, the
Third Party Claim promptly after receipt by such Claiming Party of notice of
the Third Party Claim; _provided_ that failure to give such notification on a
timely basis shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to
the extent the Defending Party is materially prejudiced as a result of such
failure or the indemnification obligations are materially increased as a
result of such failure.

(b) If a Third Party Claim is made against a Claiming Party, the Defending
Party shall, at its expense, be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by
the Defending Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Claiming Party (i) if
within five (5) Business Days of the receipt of notice from the Claiming Party
informing the Defending Party of such Third Party Claim, the Defending Party
gives notice to the Claiming Party stating the Defending Partys intention to
do so and acknowledging that the Defending Party shall indemnify the Claiming
Party from and against all Losses (to the extent required by, and subject to
any applicable limits provided in, this  _Article 8_ ), that the Claiming
Party may suffer resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature
of, or caused by, the Third Party Claim, or (ii) if the Defending Party does
not assume the defense of a Third Party Claim pursuant to clause (i) of this
sentence, at any time that the Defending Party reasonably believes that the
Claiming Party has ceased to actively and diligently prosecute the defense of
such Third Party Claim. Should a Defending Party so elect to assume the
defense of a Third Party Claim, the Defending Party shall not be liable to the
Claiming Party for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Claiming Party
in connection with the defense

  



58  thereof; _provided_ , that in the case that (A) there exists or is
reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest that would make it
inappropriate in the judgment of the Claiming Party, in its reasonable
discretion, for the same counsel to represent both the Claiming Party and the
Defending Party, (B) the Defending Party fails to actively and diligently
prosecute the defense of such Third Party Claim, (C) such Third Party Claim
relates to or otherwise arises in connection with any criminal or regulatory
enforcement action, (D) the settlement of, and adverse judgment with respect
to, or the Defending Partys conduct of the defense of such Third Party Claim
is, in the sole and absolute discretion of the Claiming Party, likely to be
adverse to the Claiming Partys reputation or continuing business interests
(including its relationships with current or potential customers, suppliers
or other parties material to the conduct of its business), or (E) such Third
Party Claim could result in an injunction or other equitable relief against
the Claiming Party or, in the reasonable discretion of the Claiming Party,
result in a Loss in excess of the dollar amount available for indemnification
pursuant to this _Article 8_ (the scenarios described in clauses (A)  (E) are
collectively referred to as " _Conflicts_ "), then the Defending Party
shall continue to be liable to the Claiming Party for reasonable legal
expenses subsequently incurred by the Claiming Party in connection with the
defense thereof. If the Defending Party assumes such defense, the Claiming
Party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to
employ counsel, at its own expense or, in accordance with the previous
sentence, at the Defending Partys expense, separate from the counsel employed
by the Defending Party, it being understood, however, that the Defending
Party shall control such defense so long as the Third Party Claim does not
involve a Conflict, in which case the Claiming Party shall control such
defense. If the Defending Party chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, then
all the parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of such Third
Party Claim, including by retaining and, upon the Defending Partys request,
providing to the Defending Party all records and information which are
reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. If the Defending Party assumes
the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Defending Party shall obtain the
prior written consent of the Claiming Party (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld) before entering into any settlement or consenting to the entry of a
judgment with respect to such claim unless such settlement or judgment (1)
involves no finding or admission of any violation of Law or the rights of any
Person and has no effect on any other claims that may be made against the
Claiming Party, (2) expressly and unconditionally provides a full and general
release of the Claiming Party from all liabilities and obligations with
respect to such claim, and (3) involves no finding or admission of any
violation of Law or the rights of any Person. In addition, whether or not
the Representative shall have assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, if
(i) the Representative has acknowledged that the Holders shall indemnify the
Claiming Party from and against all Losses (to the extent required by, and
subject to any applicable limits provided in, this _Article 8_ ), that the
Parent Indemnitees may suffer resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in
the nature of, or caused by, the Third Party Claim, or (ii) such Third Party
Claim arises under  _Section 8.02(a)(viii)_, then, in either case, neither
Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall admit any liability with respect to, or
settle, compromise or discharge, any Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Representative such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

 



59 8.07 _Determination of Loss Amount; No Circular Recovery_.

 

(a) In no event shall Parent Indemnitees be entitled to recover or make a
claim for any amounts in respect of consequential damages that would not have
been reasonably foreseeable on the date hereof or, except as awarded to any
third party, punitive damages. No indemnifying party shall be liable hereunder
in respect of any claim if such claim would not have arisen but for a
change after the date hereof in legislation or accounting policies or a
change in interpretation of applicable Law as determined by a court or
pursuant to an administration rule-making decision. Attorney, consultant, and
other professional fees and disbursements incurred by an indemnifying party
in connection with this _Article 8_ shall be reasonable and based only on time
actually spent, which shall be charged at no more than such professionals
standard hourly rate.

 

(b) No Parent Indemnitee shall be entitled to any indemnification under this
_Article 8_ to the extent such matter was actually reflected in the
determination of the Final Aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
1.06_ or (ii) was reserved for in the Financial Statements.

8.08 _Materiality_. For purposes of determining the failure of any
representations or warranties to be true and correct, the breach of any
covenants and agreements, and calculating Losses hereunder, any materiality
or Material Adverse Effect qualifications in the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements (other than the Material Adverse Effect qualification
in the first sentence of _Section 3.07_) shall be disregarded. 

8.09 _Exclusive Remedy_. Each of the parties understands, acknowledges and
agrees that except for claims of or arising out of fraud, the indemnification
provisions of _Section 8.02_ and _Section 8.03_ shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy for claims made after the Effective Time with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and
that the parties hereto shall have no other remedy or recourse with respect to
any such claims other than pursuant to, and subject to the terms and
conditions of, _Section 8.02_ and  _Section 8.03_. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that no party hereto may avoid such limitation on
liability by (x) seeking damages for breach of contract, tort or pursuant to
any other theory of liability, all of which are hereby waived or (y)
asserting or threatening any claim against any Person (other than a Holder in
a claim pursuant to _Article 8_ or a Holder Agreement of such Holder, it being
expressly understood and agreed that nothing herein shall prohibit Parent
from bringing a claim directly against a Holder arising out of a Holder
Agreement executed by or on behalf of such Holder) that is not a party (or a
successor to a party) for breaches of the representations, warranties and
covenants contained in this Agreement. EACH OF THE PARENT INDEMNITEES
EXPRESSLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS AFFORDED BY ANY STATUTE WHICH LIMITS THE EFFECT OF
A RELEASE WITH RESPECT TO UNKNOWN CLAIMS. EACH OF THE PARENT INDEMNITEES
UNDERSTANDS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS RELEASE OF UNKNOWN CLAIMS AND WAIVER OF
STATUTORY PROTECTION AGAINST A RELEASE OF UNKNOWN CLAIMS. EACH PARENT
INDEMNITEE ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS WAIVER IS AN ESSENTIAL AND
MATERIAL TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, no term or provision of this Agreement shall limit or reduce
any potential claims or remedies based on fraud and nothing herein shall limit
any claim that a Holder may have as a stockholder of Parent whether or not
the Holders status as a stockholder of Parent arose out of the receipt of
the Parent Shares.

 



60 8.10 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns.

(i) Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or cause to
be timely filed all Tax Returns for the Surviving Corporation that have not
yet been filed as of the Closing Date, in a manner consistent with past
practice, except as otherwise required by applicable Law. Parent shall deliver
to Representative all income Tax Returns for any Pre-Closing Tax Periods that
are to be filed after the Closing Date for review and approval no less than
15 days before the applicable due date. The Surviving Corporation shall not
(and Parent shall not cause it to) waive any carryback of any net operating
loss, capital loss or credit on any such Tax Return. Parent shall not, without
the Representatives prior written consent, cause or permit the Surviving
Corporation to (i) amend any Tax Return that relates in whole or in part to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period or (ii) make any election that has retroactive
effect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period.

(ii) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall (nor shall they cause
any Affiliate to) make any election under Code Section 338 (or any similar
provision under state, local or non-U.S. Law) with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Except to the extent that such refund is
attributable to the carryback of a Tax attribute attributable to a Post-
Closing Tax Period or such refund was included as an asset in Net Working
Capital, the Holders shall be entitled to any Tax refunds that are received by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, and any amounts credited against Tax to
which Parent or the Surviving Corporation become entitled in any Post-Closing
Tax Period of the Company, that relate to any Pre-Closing Tax Period,
including Taxes paid with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company.
Parent shall pay or cause to be paid over to Holders (in accordance with their
Holder Indemnification Percentage) any such refund or the amount of any such
credit within twenty (20) days after receipt of such refund or after
becoming entitled to such credit against Taxes. Any payment under this
paragraph shall be considered a purchase price adjustment.

(b)  _Cooperation_. The parties shall cooperate with each other to provide
each other with such assistance as may be reasonably requested by them in
connection with the preparation of any Tax Returns, any Tax audit or other
examination in connection with an administrative or judicial proceeding
involving a taxing authority relating to Taxes, and the enforcement of the
provisions of this _Section 8.10(b)_. Such cooperation shall include,
including upon Representatives request, providing records and information
that are reasonably relevant to any such matters and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information.

 

(c) _Transfer Taxes_. Parent will pay any real property transfer or gains tax,
stamp tax, stock transfer tax, or other similar Tax imposed on the Surviving
Corporation or any

 



61  Holder as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ "), and any penalties or interest with
respect to the Transfer Taxes. Parent shall file all necessary Tax Returns
and other documentation with respect to Transfer Taxes (except to the extent
such Tax Returns are required by Law to be filed by a Holder), and
Representative agrees to cooperate with Parent in the filing of any such Tax
Returns, including promptly supplying any information in its possession that
is reasonably necessary to complete such returns.

(d) _Further Assurances_. From time to time, as and when requested by any
party and at such requesting partys expense, any other party shall execute
and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and
instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other
actions as the requesting party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to
evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

8.11 _Holder Financing Claims_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto: (i) agrees that it
will not bring or support any Person, or permit any of its Affiliates to bring
or support any Person, in any action, suit, proceeding, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether
in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any
of the lenders referenced in the Commitment Letter (including any lenders that
join the Commitment Letter after the date hereof), their successors and
assigns, and their respective Affiliates, equityholders, members, partners,
officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors, controlling persons and
representatives involved in the financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letter (collectively, the "Financing Sources") in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including, but not limited to, any dispute arising out of or relating in any
way to the Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the financings
contemplated thereby, in any forum other than the federal and New York State
courts located in the Borough of Manhattan within the City of New York; (ii)
agrees that, except as specifically set forth in the Commitment Letter, all
claims or causes of action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) against any of the Financing Sources in any way relating to the
Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated
thereby, shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the internal laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to
principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules
would require or permit the application of laws of another jurisdiction; and
(iii) hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such party may
have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation (whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise) directly or indirectly
arising out of or relating in any way to the Commitment Letter or the
performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (a) the Company, the
Holders, the Representative and their respective subsidiaries, Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers, members or
stockholders shall not have any rights or claims against any Financing
Source, in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or in respect of any oral representations made
or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or therewith, including
any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Commitment Letter or
the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, whether at law
or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise and (b) no Financing Source shall
have any liability (whether in contract, in tort or otherwise) to any of the
Company, the Holders, the Representative and their respective subsidiaries,
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents,

 



62  partners, managers, members or stockholders for any obligations or
liabilities of any party hereto under this Agreement or for any claim based
on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to have been
made in connection herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of
or relating in any way to the Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or
the financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Financing Sources are intended third-party beneficiaries of,
and shall be entitled to the protections of this _Section 8.11_ and are
beneficiaries of any liability cap or other limitation on remedies or damages
set forth in this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE 9

 

 _REPRESENTATIVE_

9.01 _Representative_.

(a) Effective upon and by virtue of the Required Stockholder Approval, and
without any further act of any of the Stockholders, the Representative shall
be hereby appointed as the representative of the Holders and as the attorney-
in-fact and agent for and on behalf of each Holder for purposes of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and any other agreements and documents
executed or delivered in connection with this Agreement and shall take such
actions to be taken by the Representative under this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement and any other agreements and documents executed or delivered in
connection with this Agreement and such other actions on behalf of such
Holders as it may deem necessary or appropriate in connection with or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including (i)
executing and delivering this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and any other
ancillary documents and negotiating and executing such amendments,
modifications, waivers or changes thereto as to which the Representative, in
its sole discretion, shall have consented ( _provided_ that any waiver or
amendment that shall adversely and disproportionately affect the rights or
obligations of any Holder as compared to other Holders shall require
the prior written consent of such Holder), (ii) taking all actions and making
all filings on behalf of such Holders with any Governmental Body or other
Person necessary to effect the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (iii) agreeing to, negotiating, entering into settlements
and compromises of, complying with orders of courts with respect to, and
otherwise administering and handling any claims under this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement on behalf of such Holders, (iv) satisfying from the
Indemnity Escrow Account and Working Capital Escrow Account costs, expenses
and/or liabilities incurred by the Representative in its capacity as the
Representative and otherwise in accordance with this Agreement and/or the
Escrow Agreement, and (v) taking all other actions that are either necessary
or appropriate in the judgment of the Representative for the accomplishment of
the foregoing or contemplated by the terms of this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement. The Representative hereby accepts such appointment. The appointment
of the Representative as each Holders attorney-in-fact revokes any power of
attorney heretofore granted that authorized any other Person to represent
such Holder with regard to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and any
other agreements or documents executed or delivered in connection with this
Agreement. The Representative is the sole and exclusive representative of each
of the Holders for any purpose provided for by this

 



63  Agreement. Representative shall be bound by the same confidentiality
restrictions binding Company pursuant to _Section 11.01_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts
based on contact information available to the Representative to keep the
Holders reasonably informed with respect to actions of Representative pursuant
to the authority granted Representative under this Agreement which actions
have a material impact on the amounts payable to the Holders. Each Holder
shall promptly provide written notice to the Representative of any change of
address of such Holder.

 

(b) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Representative hereunder
shall constitute a decision, act, consent or instruction of all Holders and
shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each such Holder, and Parent and
the Surviving Corporation may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Representative as being the decision, act, consent
or instruction of each and every such Holder. Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and the Escrow Agent shall be relieved from any liability to any
Person for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Representative.

(c) The Representative shall incur no liability with respect to any action
taken or suffered by any Holder in reliance upon any notice, direction,
instruction, consent, statement or other document believed by such
Representative to be genuine and to have been signed by such Holder (and shall
have no responsibility to determine the authenticity thereof), nor for any
other action or inaction, except the gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct of the Representative. In all questions arising under this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, the Representative may rely on the advice
of outside counsel, and the Representative shall not be liable to any Holder
for anything done, omitted or suffered in good faith by Representative based
on such advice.

(d) The Holders shall severally (each based on its Holder Indemnification
Percentage) but not jointly indemnify the Representative and hold the
Representative harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred
without gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the
Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of the Representatives duties hereunder, including
the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel or other advisors
reasonably retained by the Representative. All fees and expenses incurred by
the Representative in performing its duties shall be borne by the Holders in
accordance with their respective Holder Indemnification Percentage;
_provided_ , _however_ , before seeking reimbursement of such fees and
expenses directly from the Holders, the Representative shall deplete the
Representative Fund. In addition to the foregoing, the Representative shall
be entitled to a fee of $70,000 for the provision of its services provided
hereunder, which such fee shall be paid from the Representative Fund at the
Representatives discretion. The Representative Fund shall be available to
reimburse the Representative for any expenses incurred or anticipated to be
incurred on the part of the Representative and arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of the Representatives

Subsidiaries) hereby (i) waive any claim they have or may have that Jones Day
has a conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited from engaging in such
representation except for any claims related to the violation of attorney-
client privilege by Jones Day and (ii) agree that, in the event that a
dispute arises after the Closing between Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of its Subsidiaries and any Holder, the Representative or any of their
respective Affiliates, Jones Day may represent any Holder, the Representative
or any of their respective Affiliates in such dispute even though the
interests of such Person(s) may be directly adverse to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries and even though Jones Day may
have represented the Company in a matter substantially related to such
dispute. Parent and the Surviving Corporation (on behalf of itself and its
Subsidiaries) also further agree that, as to all communications among Jones
Day and the Company, any Holder, the Representative or Affiliates and
representatives of any Holder or Representative, that directly relate to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney-client privilege and
the expectation of client confidence belongs to the applicable Holder and may
be controlled by the applicable Holder and shall not pass to or be claimed by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries and a third party other than
a party to this Agreement after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure
of confidential communications by Jones Day to such third party.

or relating to the failure to obtain any consent or any such default,
acceleration or termination.

instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments
hereto or thereto, to the extent delivered by means of a facsimile machine or
electronic mail (any such delivery, an " _Electronic Delivery_ "), shall be
treated in all manner and respects as an original agreement or

 



87  instrument and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as
if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the
request of any party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument, each
other party hereto or thereto shall re execute original forms thereof and
deliver them to all other parties. No party hereto or to any such agreement or
instrument shall raise the use of Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature
or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or
communicated through the use of Electronic Delivery as a defense to the
formation of a contract, and each such party forever waives any such defense,
except to the extent such defense related to lack of authenticity.
