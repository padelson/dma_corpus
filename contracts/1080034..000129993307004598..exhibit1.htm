Company or Merger Sub, the Companys Articles of Incorporation shall be
amended and restated as set forth as Exhibit A to the Agreement of Merger,
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or applicable Law.

(b) The directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors and officers, respectively, of the

Section 2.6 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Closing, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the aggregate maximum
consideration to be paid to the Shareholders and the Optionholders by Parent

paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(c) At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock outstanding

_divided by_ the number of Fully Diluted Shares (the " _Per Share Closing
Consideration_ "). In addition, the Shareholders shall be entitled to receive

2.8_.   

(d) Each Company Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
having an exercise price less than the Per Share Closing Consideration (the "

Closing Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.7_) and (ii) the right to
receive the Earnout Consideration as and to the extent provided in _Section
2.8_. Each outstanding Company Option having an exercise price greater than
or equal to the Per Share Closing Consideration shall be automatically
cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Earnout Consideration

(i) The amount of Closing Consideration shall be adjusted downward, on a
dollar for dollar basis, (A) to the extent that the cash balance on the
Closing Date Balance Sheet is less than $800,000, by an amount equal to such
shortfall and (B) to the extent that Non-Cash Working Capital calculated from
the Closing Balance Sheet is less than $4,500,000, by an amount equal to one-
half of any such shortfall.   

(ii) The amount of Closing Consideration shall be adjusted upward, on a dollar
for dollar basis, (A) to the extent that the cash balance on the Closing Date
Balance Sheet is greater than $800,000, by an amount equal to such excess,
and (B) to the extent that Non-Cash Working Capital calculated from the
Closing Date Balance Sheet is greater than $4,500,000, by an amount equal
to one-half of any such excess.   

(iii) For purposes of this Agreement, (A) " _Non-Cash Working Capital_ " is
defined as (1) total current assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries
defined by GAAP (other than cash),  _less_ (2) total current liabilities of
the Company and its Subsidiaries defined by GAAP (but excluding any unpaid
Third Party Expenses or Indebtedness resulting in a reduction in the
Closing Consideration under _Section 2.6_). " _Closing Date Balance Sheet_ "
is defined as the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing
Date.   

(f) To facilitate and expedite the calculation of any necessary adjustments to
the Closing Consideration, the Company has prepared in good faith and
delivered to Parent a calculation of the amount of the Companys cash
balance, Non-Cash Working Capital, unpaid Indebtedness and unpaid Third Party
Transaction Expenses as of May 31, 2007 (a copy of which is attached hereto
as  _Section 2.6(f)_ of the Disclosure Schedule), and five (5) Business Days
prior to the Closing, an update of such calculation showing the Companys
best estimate of the Closing Balance Sheet as of the Closing Date and, based
thereon, the estimated cash balance, Non-Cash Working Capital, unpaid
Indebtedness and unpaid Third Party Transaction Expenses as of the
Closing.   

Section 2.7 _Escrow Agreement; Escrow Fund; Retention of Optionholder
Consideration_.

_Article II_ to the contrary, Parent, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the " _Escrow
Agent_ ") and the Shareholders Representative shall execute the escrow
agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as  _Exhibit D_ (the "
_Escrow Agreement_ ") and Parent shall deposit with the Escrow Agent, for the
benefit and on behalf of the Shareholders (other than Dissenting Shares), a
portion of the Closing Consideration in cash equal to $10,000,000.00
_multiplied_ by the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the portion of the
Closing Consideration received by Shareholders by (ii) the Closing
Consideration (the " _Indemnification Escrow Amount_ ") to be held in escrow
in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow Agreement. The portion of the
Indemnification Escrow Amount deposited on behalf of each Shareholder
pursuant to this _Section 2.7(a)_ shall be the Escrow Pro Rata Portion (as
defined below). The term " _Escrow Pro Rata Portion_ " for each holder of
record of a Certificate (as defined in _Section 3.1(a)_) means an amount
equal to the product of (i) the amount of the Indemnification Escrow Amount
and (ii) the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the aggregate amount of cash
otherwise payable to such holder of such Certificate pursuant to _Section

Indemnification Escrow Amount) by (B) the aggregate amount of the Closing
Consideration paid to all Shareholders.   

(b) On the Closing Date, notwithstanding any foregoing provisions of this
_Article II_ to the contrary, Parent shall withhold and retain, for the

Options, a portion of the Closing Consideration in cash equal to
$10,000,000.00 _minus_ the Indemnification Escrow Amount (the " _Closing
Option Indemnity Holdback_ ") as security for any claims for Losses pursuant
to and in accordance with  _Article VIII_. The portion of the Closing Option
Indemnity Holdback withheld and retained by Parent pursuant to this _Section
2.7(b)_ shall be the Holdback Pro Rata Portion (as defined below). The term "
_Holdback Pro Rata Portion_ " for each holder of record of an Initial In-the-
Money Option means an amount equal to the product of (i) the amount of the
Closing Option Indemnity Holdback and (ii) the quotient obtained by dividing
(A) the aggregate amount of cash otherwise payable to such Optionholder
pursuant to _Section 2.6(d)_ (without regard to any reduction of that amount
on account of the Closing Option Indemnity Holdback) by (B) the aggregate
amount of the Closing Consideration paid to all Optionholders holding
Initial In-the-Money Options.   

(c) On the date that any 2007 Earnout Consideration (as defined in _Section

to the contrary, Parent shall deposit with the Escrow Agent, for the benefit
and on behalf of the Shareholders (other than Dissenting Shares), a portion
of the 2007 Earnout Consideration, if any, in cash equal to 10% of the
aggregate 2007 Earnout Consideration payable to the Shareholders (the "
_Earnout Escrow Amount_ " and together with the Indemnification Escrow
Amount, the " _Escrow Amount_ " and such cash deposit, as increased and
decreased by deposits (including interest and dividends) and withdrawals
pursuant to this Agreement from time to time, the " _Escrow Fund_ ") to be
held in escrow in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow Agreement. Any
interest or other income earned on the Escrow Amount will be included in the
gross income of Parent in accordance with Proposed Treasury Regulations under
Section 468B(g) of the Internal Revenue Code. The portion of the Earnout
Escrow Amount deposited on behalf of each Shareholder pursuant to this 
_Section 2.7(b)_ shall be the Escrow Pro Rata Portion; provided that a
portion of the Escrow Amount shall be distributed from the Escrow Account to
Parent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement in order to
enable Parent to pay Taxes resulting from income or earnings with respect to
the Escrow Amount.   

(d) On the date that any 2007 Earnout Consideration is paid, notwithstanding
any foregoing provisions of this _Article II_ to the contrary, Parent shall
withhold and retain, for the benefit and on behalf of the Optionholders, a
portion of the 2007 Earnout Consideration, if any, in cash equal to 10% of
the aggregate 2007 Earnout Consideration payable to the Optionholders (the "
_Additional Option Indemnity Holdback_ " and together with the Closing Option
Indemnity Holdback, the " _Option Indemnity Holdback_ ") as security for any
claims for Losses pursuant to and in accordance with _Article VIII_.   

(e) Any interest accruing on the Escrow Amount shall be held in the Escrow
Fund and be available to cover claims for Losses until distributed upon
termination of the Escrow Fund, as provided in _Article VIII_ and the Escrow
Agreement. Any such interest shall be distributed to Parent (to the extent
earned or paid with respect to cash in the Escrow Fund distributed to Parent
to cover Losses pursuant to _Article VIII_) or pro rata to the respective
Shareholders on whose behalf cash was deposited in the Escrow Fund (to the
extent earned or paid with respect to cash ultimately distributed to such
respective shareholders upon termination of the Escrow Fund), such that any
interest earned on any cash in the Escrow Fund generally follows the
ultimate recipient of the cash on which such interest was earned.   

(f) Interest will accrue on the Option Indemnity Holdback at the same rate as
interest accrues on the Escrow Amount and shall be available to cover claims
for Losses until distributed upon termination of the Option Indemnity
Holdback, as provided in _Article VIII_. Any such interest shall be retained
by Parent (to the extent earned with respect to any portion of the Option
Indemnity Holdback retained by Parent to cover Losses pursuant to _Article
VIII_) or pro rata to the respective optionholders on whose behalf the Option
Indemnity Holdback was retained (to the extent earned with respect to cash
ultimately distributed to such respective optionholders upon termination of
the Option Indemnity Holdback), such that any interest earned on the
Option Indemnity Holdback generally follows the ultimate recipient of the
cash on which such interest was earned.   

(g) All fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent shall be borne equally by the
Shareholders, on the one hand, and by Parent, on the other hand.   

Section 2.8 _Earnout Consideration_. In addition to the Closing Consideration,
the Shareholders and the Optionholders will receive earnout payments if
certain EBITDA and/or Net Revenue targets of the Company Business are
achieved in any one or more of the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008, and
2009 (such payments, subject to adjustment and offset, if applicable, as
provided in _Section 2.7_, this _Section 2.8_ and _Article VIII_, the "
_Earnout Consideration_ "). The Earnout Consideration payable to the
Shareholders pursuant to this _Section 2.8_ is not compensation for services
but constitutes consideration payable in the Merger and shall be treated as
such for all Tax purposes, including for purposes of withholding. The Earnout
Consideration payable to Optionholders shall be treated as compensation for
federal income tax purposes and shall be subject to applicable withholding
taxes. All Earnout Consideration that is not earned by the Shareholders and
the Optionholders pursuant to this  _Section 2.8_ will be forfeited. No
Shareholder or Optionholder may sell, exchange, transfer or otherwise dispose
of his, her or its right to receive any portion of the Earnout Consideration,
other than by the laws of descent and distribution or succession, and any
transfer in violation of this _Section 2.8_ shall be null and void and shall
not be recognized by Parent or the Surviving Corporation.

Per Share 2007 Earnout Consideration _plus_ the Per Share 2008 Earnout
Consideration _plus_  the Per Share 2009 Earnout Consideration (2)
_multiplied_ by the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such
2009 In-the-Money Option (3) _minus_ the aggregate exercise price with
respect to such 2009 In-the-Money Option (subject to any Earnout Indemnity
Holdback pursuant to Article VIII), and (C) a former holder of a Company
Option having an exercise price greater than or equal to the sum of the Per
Share Closing Consideration _plus_ the Per Share 2007 Earnout Consideration
_plus_ the Per Share 2008 Earnout Consideration _plus_ the Per Share 2009
Earnout Consideration shall not be entitled to receive any portion of the
2009 Earnout Consideration.   

(v) If the Company achieves or exceeds the targets at the 100% level for both
Net Revenue and EBITDA in 2009, an amount equal to 1.147325% of the 2009
Earnout Consideration (as finally determined) will be deducted from the 2009
Earnout Consideration otherwise payable to Shareholders and Optionholders
pursuant to this _Section 2.8_ and will be payable to certain United States-
based employees of the Company pursuant to _Section 6.9(b)(iii)_ (the " _2009
US Bonus Pool_ "); and an amount equal to 0.6% of the 2009 Earnout
Consideration (as finally determined) will be deducted from the 2009 Earnout
Consideration otherwise payable to Shareholders and Optionholders pursuant to
this _Section 2.8_ and will be payable to certain China-based employees of
the Company pursuant to _Section 6.9(b)(iii)_ (the " _2009 China Bonus Pool_
").   

(vi) _Section 2.8_ of the Disclosure Schedule illustrates an example of the
2007 Earnout Consideration, the 2008 Earnout Consideration and the 2009
Earnout Consideration calculations.   

(d) _Calculation and Payment of Earnout Consideration_.   

(i) Within sixty (60) days after the end of each of December 31, 2007, 2008,
and 2009, as applicable, Parent shall calculate at Parents expense and
deliver to the Shareholders Representative a report (the " _Earnout Report_
"), which shall include (A) the unaudited statement or calculation of EBITDA
and Net Revenue for the Company Business for the year ended December 31,
2007, 2008, or 2009, as applicable, (B) a calculation of the percentage of
the respective EBITDA and Net Revenue targets achieved for the year ended
December 31, 2007, 2008, or 2009, as applicable, and the amount of Earnout
Consideration, if any, payable therefrom, (C) the nature and amount of
Losses, if any, claimed by Parent as an offset from the 2008
Earnout Consideration or the 2009 Earnout Consideration, as the case may be,
as provided in  _Article VIII_, and (D) the amount of Earnout Consideration,
if any, to be paid to the Shareholders and the Optionholders. Each Earnout
Report shall be signed by an executive officer of Parent.   

(ii) Any Earnout Consideration payable as reflected on an Earnout Report shall
be paid by Parent to the Shareholders and the Optionholders, (subject in the
case of Optionholders to Section 2.6(d)) on the same Business Day on which
the applicable Earnout Report is delivered to the Shareholders
Representative; _provided, however_ , that (x) the Earnout Escrow Amount
(which is part of the 2007 Earnout Consideration) shall be deposited into the
Escrow Fund as provided in  _Section 2.7(c)_ and (y) the Additional Option
Indemnity Holdback (which is part of the 2007 Earnout Consideration) shall be
withheld and retained by Parent as provided in  _Section 2.7(d)_.   

(e) _Right to Inspection_. The Shareholders Representative shall be entitled
to inspect the books and records of the Surviving Corporation upon which the
calculations reflected in the Earnout Report were made (the books and records
relating to and used in calculating the amounts reflected in the Earnout
Report, the " _relevant books and records_ "), if the
Shareholder Representative provides written notice to Parent of such request
within thirty (30) days after the Earnout Report is delivered. If the
Shareholders Representative does not deliver such a written request within
such thirty (30) day period, the calculations and facts set forth in the
Earnout Report shall be deemed irrevocably approved by the Shareholders
Representative and shall be conclusive and binding upon the Shareholders
Representative and each Shareholder entitled to share in any Earnout
Consideration. If the Shareholders Representative delivers a written
inspection request within thirty (30) days after the Earnout Report is
delivered, the Company shall provide reasonable access to the relevant books
and records during normal business hours to the Shareholder Representative
and the Shareholder Representatives professional advisors no later than ten
(10) days after the Shareholders Representative delivers the written
inspection request. The Shareholders Representative and the Shareholder
Representatives professional advisors shall have a period of twenty (20)
Business Days after the date access to the relevant books and records
is provided to review and analyze the same, and within five (5) Business Days
after the end of such twenty (20) Business Day inspection period (unless the
Shareholders Representative in good faith requires additional time to
complete the analysis, in which case Parent shall provide no more than five
(5) Business Days additional time to complete the review and analysis) shall
give Parent written notice describing in reasonable detail the nature and
amount of any purported differences between the amounts and facts reflected
in the Earnout Report and those determined in good faith through the
Shareholders Representatives and the Shareholder Representatives
professional advisors review. If the Shareholders Representative fails to
give written notice to Parent of any purported differences within the
required period, the calculations and facts set forth in the applicable
Earnout Notice shall be deemed irrevocably and unconditionally approved by
the Shareholders Representative and shall be conclusive and binding upon the
Shareholders Representative and each Shareholder entitled to share in any
Earnout Consideration. If the Shareholders Representative provides written
notice of purported differences within the required period, the Shareholders
Representative and an authorized representative of Parent shall promptly seek
in good faith to resolve any purported differences and agree to the
appropriate amount of Earnout Consideration payable to the Shareholders and
the Optionholders. If the parties are unable to come to a good faith
resolution within ten (10) Business Days after commencing such good
faith discussions, the dispute will be resolved in accordance with _Section
10.14_. In any such dispute resolution process, Parent will have the right to
assert any arguments and/or evidence that it may have to the effect that the
calculation of the Earnout Consideration or any portion or component thereof
as originally reflected on the Earnout Report was overstated (based upon
any information that, as of such time, has come to the attention of Parent),
and, if it is finally resolved that the Earnout Consideration was overstated,
the Shareholders and Optionholders, ratably based on the portion of the
Earnout Consideration they received, shall be required to repay such overage
to Parent. Parent shall be entitled to withhold payment of the portion of the
Earnout Consideration that is in dispute during the pendency of such dispute.
Any additional Earnout Consideration payable to the Shareholders and
Optionholders or any amounts payable by the Shareholders and Optionholders to
Parent after the resolution of any dispute in accordance with this
_subsection 2.8(e)_ (which amounts, if any, shall be offset against each
other) shall be paid by Parent or by the Shareholders and Optionholders, as
applicable, within ten (10) Business Days after the date any such dispute is
finally resolved.   

(f) _Support for Earnout Consideration_. Parent shall provide the Surviving
Corporation or the resulting business group reasonably adequate resources and
reasonable support through December 31, 2009 to allow it a reasonable
opportunity to achieve the EBITDA and Net Revenue targets as set forth in
this _Section 2.8_.   

(g) _Affect of Change in Control on Earnout Consideration_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if a Change of Control is
consummated prior to December 31, 2009 and there is an adverse effect or
adverse effects on the Company Business resulting from such Change of
Control, then, upon written notice from the Shareholders Representative to
Parent identifying in reasonable detail the Change of Control and the adverse
effect or adverse effects resulting from such Change of Control (which such
notice must be delivered prior to December 31 of any year in which any such
adverse effect occurs), the calculation of Earnout Consideration, if any, and
the payment of Earnout Consideration will be affected as follows:   

(i) If the adverse effect caused by the Change of Control has resulted or is
reasonably likely to result in a reduction of either Net Revenue or EBITDA of
at least 2%, but less than 15%, from the 100% targets for Net Revenue or
EBITDA, respectively, for the year in which the Change in Control occurs or
any subsequent calendar year ending on or prior to December 31, 2009, then
the Earnout Consideration for each such year will be calculated after adding
back any such reductions in Net Revenue or EBITDA, as applicable, caused by
the Change of Control. In the circumstances described in this clause (i), the
Earnout Consideration will be calculated and paid pursuant to the normal
schedule for payment of the Earnout Consideration otherwise provided for in
_Section 2.8_.   

(ii) If (A) the adverse effect caused by the Change of Control has resulted or
is reasonably likely to result in a reduction in EBITDA of more than 15% from
the 100% target for EBITDA in the year in which the Change in Control occurs
or any subsequent year ending on or prior to December 31, 2009, and (B) the
EBITDA achieved by the Company in the latest six full calendar months
prior to the Change in Control _times_ two (2) is at least 85% of the 100%
EBITDA target for the year in which the Change in Control occurs, then the
aggregate amount of Earnout Consideration payable to the Shareholders and the
Optionholders (for the year in which the Change of Control occurs and any
subsequent year ending in or prior to December 31, 2009) shall be calculated
based upon the assumption that 100% of the EBITDA and 100% of the Net Revenue
targets through December 31, 2009 were achieved pursuant to this _Section
2.8_; and the full amount of such Earnout Consideration shall become due and
payable to the Shareholders and the Optionholders within ten (10) Business
Days of the date the financial effect of such adverse effect has been
determined (subject to extension for any period during which any dispute
regarding the Earnout Consideration is being resolved pursuant to _Section
10.14_).   

(h) _Affect of Insolvency on Earnout Consideration_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, if an Insolvency Event occurs prior to
December 31, 2009 and the EBITDA achieved by the Company in the latest six
full calendar months prior to the Insolvency Event  _times_ two (2) is at
least 85% of the 100% EBITDA target for the year in which the Insolvency
Event occurs, then the aggregate amount of Earnout Consideration payable to
the Shareholders and the Optionholders (for the year in which the Insolvency
Event occurs and any subsequent year ending on or prior to December 31, 2009)
shall be calculated based upon the assumption that 100% of the EBITDA and
100% of the Net Revenue targets were achieved pursuant to this _Section
2.8_; and the full amount of such Earnout Consideration shall become due
and payable to the Shareholders and the Optionholders within ten (10)
Business Days of the date of such Insolvency Event (subject to extension for
any period during which any dispute regarding the Earnout Consideration is
being resolved pursuant to _Section 10.14_).   

ARTICLE III.    

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES    

Section 3.1 _Exchange of Certificates_.   

(a) _Parent to Provide Funds_. On the Closing Date, Parent shall have
available in immediately available cash the cash representing the Closing
Consideration ( _less_ the Indemnification Escrow Amount and _less_ any
amounts otherwise payable with respect to any Dissenting Shares) for payment
to the respective Shareholders and Optionholders entitled thereto as
provided below. In addition, at the Effective Time, Parent shall separately
deposit the Indemnification Escrow Amount into the Escrow Fund on behalf of
the Shareholders otherwise entitled thereto, as provided in _Section
2.7(a)_.   

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. The Company shall cause to be delivered, within
five (5) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, to each holder of record
of a certificate or certificates representing any shares of Company Common
Stock and Company Options to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 2.7(d)_ (the
" _Certificates_ "), other than Certificates to be cancelled or retired
pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)_, (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon actual delivery of the Certificates to
Parent and shall be in a form and have such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates in exchange for the Closing Consideration issuable in
respect of the shares represented by such Certificates, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein. Upon surrender of a Certificate
for cancellation to Parent (but no earlier of the Effective Time) or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by the Surviving
Corporation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and
such other documents as may reasonably be required by Parent, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, the Per
Share Closing Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock
theretofore represented by such Certificate pursuant to _Section 2.6(c)_,
and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. The amount
of Closing Consideration to be received by any Shareholder or Optionholder in
accordance with the preceding sentence shall be reduced by such holders
Escrow Pro Rata Portion or Holdback Pro Rata Portion, as the case may be. No
interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon the surrender
of any Certificate. If payment is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, it shall
be a condition of payment that such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting
such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation
that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 3.1(b)_, each Certificate (other
than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares and Certificates
representing any shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled or retired
pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)_) shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive in accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement, upon such surrender, the amount of cash,
without interest, into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore
represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to
_Section 2.6(c)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any party to this Agreement shall be liable to a
former shareholder of the Company for any cash or interest delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws.   

(c) _Letter of Transmittal_. As provided in the letter of transmittal, by
executing and delivering the same, each Shareholder and Optionholder will (i)
acknowledge and agree to (A) the Earnout Consideration provisions and
obligations set forth in _Section 2.9_, (B) the indemnification and other
obligations set forth in _Article VIII_, and (C) Parents and any other
Parent Indemnified Persons right to recover any Losses out of the Escrow Fund
or the Option Indemnity Holdback or by way of offset against any 2008 Earnout
Consideration or 2009 Earnout Consideration as set forth in _Article VIII_,
and (ii) shall approve and confirm the appointment of the Shareholders
Representative.   

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent shall issue, in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the amount of cash,
without interest, that such Persons would have been entitled to receive had
such Person surrendered such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate to Parent
pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_; _provided, however,_ that Parent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to such payment or issuance require
the purported owner of any such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to
deliver a bond (at such owners sole cost and expense) in such sum as Parent
may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to the Certificates alleged
to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.   

Section 3.2 _Dissenting Shares_.   

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if
required by California Law, but only to the extent required thereby, shares
of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and that are held by holders of such shares of Company
Common Stock, who have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect
thereto in accordance with California Law (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall
not be exchangeable for the right to receive the consideration issuable
pursuant to _Section 2.6(c)_, and holders of such shares of Company Common
Stock shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of
such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of
California Law unless and until such holders fail to perfect or effectively
withdraw or lose their rights to appraisal and payment under California Law.
If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively
withdraws or loses such right, such shares of Company Common Stock shall
thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and to have become
exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the
consideration issuable pursuant to _Section 2.6(c)_, in accordance with and
subject to the provisions of this Agreement, without any interest thereon.
The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal, withdrawals of demands for appraisal and any other related
instruments received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal.
The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or
settle or offer to settle any such demand.   

(b) To the extent that Parent or the Company makes any payment in respect of
any Dissenting Shares, Parent shall be entitled to recover such amounts as
set forth in _Article VIII_.   

Section 3.3 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code, or any applicable
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law; _provided, however_ , that the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall notify all holders
of shares of Company Common Stock from whom funds are so withheld of the
respective amounts of such withholding, except to the extent such amounts are
set forth on the Spreadsheet. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as
the case may be.   

Section 3.4 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub,
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in
the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and
things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the
rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.   

ARTICLE IV.

Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company, the Company shall deliver to Parent and Merger Sub a disclosure

of any item or other matter in the Disclosure Schedule shall be construed as
an admission or indication that such item or other matter is material or that
such item or other matter is required to be referred to or disclosed in the
Disclosure Schedule. No disclosure in the Disclosure Schedule relating to any
possible breach or violation of any agreement, law or regulation shall be

_Article IV_ to the extent it is reasonably apparent from reading the
disclosures that such disclosure is applicable to such other Sections
or subsections. Nothing in the Disclosure Schedule is intended to broaden the
scope of any representation, warranty or covenant of the Company contained in
this Agreement. Subject to the exceptions and qualifications set forth in the
Disclosure Schedule, the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and
Merger Sub as follows:   

Section 4.1 _Authority_. The Company has all requisite corporate power and
authority to enter into this Agreement and any other agreements or

any applicable Law of general application relating to bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors
rights and relief of debtors generally and (ii) the effect of rules of law
and general principles of equity, including rules of law and general

Parent of any proposed changes. If the parties cannot agree on the
Allocation, the dispute will be resolved by an independent accounting firm

tax periods beginning before the Closing Date, the preparing party shall
provide to the other party a draft of such Tax Returns at least twenty (20)
days prior to the filing date, provided that the Parents obligation to
provide a draft to the Shareholder Representative shall apply only if such
Tax Return reflects a Tax liability for which the Indemnifying Shareholders
are or may be liable under this Agreement. The reviewing party shall have the
right to review and provide comments on any such Tax Return during the five
day period following the receipt of such Tax Returns. The Shareholder
Representative shall not be required to accept comments of the Parent with
respect to Tax Returns pursuant to _Section 6.5(c)(i)_ , provided however,
that the Shareholder Representative shall consider all comments provided by
Parent in good faith. Parent and the Shareholder Representative shall attempt
in good faith mutually to resolve any disagreement regarding Tax Returns
prepared pursuant to _Section 6.15(c)(ii)_ prior to the due date of filing
thereof. If the parties are unable to resolve such dispute, the dispute shall
be resolved by an independent public accounting firm. Any finding by the
independent accounting firm shall be final and binding upon the parties. The
costs and expenses relating to the dispute resolution shall be borne equally
by Indemnifying Shareholders and Parent.

Shareholders Representative, or in a Claim Notice (as defined below)
delivered to Parent, in each case prior to the applicable Expiration Date
with respect to the representation or warranty in respect of which the claim
for indemnification is made hereunder, shall be affected by the expiration of
such representations and warranties. No Person indemnified under this

seeks indemnification hereunder. Each Claim Notice shall include the amount
claimed, to the extent such amount is known, and a detailed description of
the circumstances surrounding the Losses in respect of which indemnification

Section 8.2 _Indemnification_.   

(a) Subject to the limitations in this _Article VIII_, the holders of shares
of the Company Common Stock and Company Options outstanding immediately prior

after the Effective Time, indemnify and hold harmless Parent and the
Surviving Corporation and their respective officers, directors, agents
and employees, Subsidiaries, directors and employees of Subsidiaries, and
each Person, if any, who controls or may control Parent or the Surviving

arising out of, related to or by virtue of:   

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company in this
Agreement;   

(ii) any breach of any of the covenants or agreements made by the Company in
this Agreement;   

(iii) any amount due to Parent under Section 2.6(e) (as to which Parent has

Capital as of the Closing Date;   

(iv) any unpaid Indebtedness of the Company or unpaid Third Party Transaction
Expenses not deducted from the Closing Consideration;

its Subsidiaries with respect to any period ending on or prior to the Closing
Date that is not encompassed by Section 4.9(a);   

(vi) any Taxes imposed on the Company and its Subsidiaries under Section 1374
of the Code (and comparable provisions of state and local law) as a result of
the Section 338(h)(10) Election; and   

(vii) any per share amounts required to be paid with respect to Dissenting
Shares to the extent greater than the amounts such dissenting shareholders
would be entitled pursuant to the Merger (and including any Losses associated
with any proceedings or settlement entered into to determine or settle the
amount payable to dissenting shareholders).   

In determining the amount of any Losses in respect of any inaccuracy in or any
breach of any representation and warranty (except for the representations and
warranties in _Section 4.6_ (relating to financial statements), (x) any
materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualification contained in such
representation or warranty will in all respects be ignored and (y) in the case
of  _Section 4.9_ (relating to Tax matters) and disclosure in the Disclosure
Schedule as to such Tax matters shall be ignored. Notwithstanding any other
provision in the Agreement to the contrary, (a) if the Company does not
qualify as an S corporation as of the Closing Date, the Indemnifying
Shareholders shall not be required to indemnify the Parent Indemnified
Persons pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i) and (ii) for any Taxes incurred by any
Person for the period after Closing, including as a result of the failure to
obtain a step up in the tax basis of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, due to an invalid election under Section 338(h)(10) of the
Code, and (b) Indemnifying Shareholders shall not be required to indemnify
the Parent Indemnified Persons for any Taxes of the Company or its
Subsidiaries imposed under state and local law as a result of an election

local law.   

(b) With respect to Losses to be paid from the Escrow Fund or the Option
Indemnity Holdback or to be offset against the 2008 Earnout Consideration or
the 2009 Earnout Consideration, as the case may be, pursuant to _Section
8.3_, the proportion of Losses for which each Indemnifying Shareholder shall
be responsible under this _Article VIII_ shall be based on such Indemnifying
Shareholders Escrow Pro Rata Portion or Holdback Pro Rata Portion, as the
case may be.   

(c) Subject to the limitations in this _Article VIII_, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation, jointly and severally (the " _Parent Indemnifying
Parties_ "), shall, from and after the Effective Time, indemnify and hold
harmless each of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and their respective
officers, directors, agents and employees, Subsidiaries, directors and
employees of Subsidiaries, and each Person, if any, who controls or may
control, within the meaning of the Securities Act, any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
(each of the foregoing, a " _Shareholder Indemnified Person_ ") from and
against: any and all Losses arising out of, related to or by virtue of (i)
any breach of any representation or warranty made by Parent or Merger Sub in
this Agreement, or any other document required to be delivered by Parent or
Merger Sub in accordance with any provision of this Agreement, (ii) any
breach of any of the covenants or agreements made by Parent or Merger Sub in
this Agreement, (iii) any amount otherwise payable that was not added to the
Closing Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.6(e)(ii)_ and; (iv) any amount
due to the Shareholders and Optionholders under Section 2.6(e) (as to which
the Shareholders and Optionholders have note been compensated under Section
2.6(e)) caused by any inaccuracy in the calculation, or the actual amount, of
the cash balance or Non-Cash Working Capital as of the Closing Date.   

(d) Parent may hold back up to ten percent (10%) of any 2008 Earnout
Consideration or 2009 Earnout Consideration, as the case may be (the "
_Earnout Indemnity Holdback_ "), that would otherwise be payable to the
Shareholders and the Optionholders pursuant to _Section 2.8_ as security for
any pending claim for Losses for which Parent has delivered an Officers
Certificate in accordance with _Section 8.5_ prior to the applicable Earnout
Report. All or any portion of the Earnout Indemnity Holdback will be retained
by Parent or paid to the Shareholders and the Optionholders, as the case may
be, as and when the applicable claim for Losses is resolved in accordance
with this _Article VIII_.   

Section 8.3 _Limitations on Indemnification; Exclusive Remedy_.   

(a) The Parent Indemnified Persons may not recover from the Escrow Fund, the
Option Indemnity Holdback or the Earnout Indemnity Holdback in respect of any
claim for indemnification under  _Section 8.2(a)(i)_, and the Shareholder
Indemnified Persons may not recover Losses in respect of any claim for
indemnification under _Section 8.2(c)(i)_, unless and until Losses in
accordance with _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ or _Section 8.2(c)(i)_, as the case may
be, have been incurred, paid or properly accrued in an aggregate amount
greater than $1,000,000 (the " _Indemnification Threshold Amount_ "). Once
the Indemnification Threshold Amount has been exceeded, the Parent
Indemnified Persons or the Shareholder Indemnified Persons, as the case
may be, shall be entitled to recover all Losses in excess of the
Indemnification Threshold Amount, subject to the limitations set forth in
this _Article VIII_. For purposes of the preceding sentences of this
_Section 8.3(a)_, in each instance where a Loss is less than $25,000,
such Loss shall not be considered in determining whether the Parent
Indemnified Persons or the Shareholder Indemnified Persons, as the case may
be, have sustained Losses in excess of the Indemnification Threshold Amount,
and the Indemnifying Shareholders or the Parent Indemnifying Parties, as the
case may be, shall not be liable for such Loss. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no Threshold Amount shall apply to Losses resulting from a breach of
representations and warranties relating to tax matters, including Section
4.9.   

(b) Except in the case of fraud, the remedies provided in this _Article VIII_
shall, after the Closing, be the sole and exclusive remedy available to the
Parent Indemnified Persons and the Shareholder Indemnified Persons for any
claim or cause of action arising out of, in connection with or under this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.   

(c) Subject to the next sentence and _Section 8.3(d)_, recovery from the
Escrow Fund, the Option Indemnity Holdback and the Earnout Indemnity Holdback
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
and any Parent Indemnified Persons after the Effective Time for any Losses
pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_ other than Losses resulting from a breach
of the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.3_ (relating
to the Companys capital stock) and Losses resulting from a breach of
representations, warranties, and covenants relating to tax matters, including
Sections 4.9, 6.1(b)(xxi), and 6.16 or Losses referred to in Sections
8.2(a)(v) and (vi) (collectively, " _Tax Losses_ "). With respect to such
Losses, each Indemnifying Shareholder shall be severally liable for Losses
for which any Parent Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this _Article VIII_, _provided_ , _however_ , in no event shall
any Indemnifying Shareholder be liable for any Tax Losses in excess of
such Indemnifying Shareholders pro rata portion of the consideration
actually received by such Person pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Article VIII_,
any indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying Shareholders for
any Losses pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_ (other than Tax Losses) shall first
be drawn from the Escrow Fund, the Option Indemnity Holdback and the Earnout
Indemnity Holdback, if any.   

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing herein shall prevent Parent or any Shareholder Indemnified Person, as
the case may be, from bringing an action for fraud against any Person in
accordance with applicable Law.   

(e) Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, the parties shall treat
any indemnification payments made hereunder as an adjustment to the Closing
Consideration as specified in _Section 2.6(c)_ for accounting and tax
purposes.   

(f) Losses for which any of the Parent Indemnified Persons are entitled to
recovery shall be reduced by (i) the amount of any insurance proceeds
actually recovered by the Parent Indemnified Persons with respect to such
Losses or right of indemnification reduced by the present value of
any increases in insurance premiums which Parent reasonably estimates to
result from such recoveries, and (ii) any indemnity, contribution or other
similar payment actually recovered by the Parent Indemnified Persons from any
third party with respect to such Losses (other than those covered by clause
(i) of this sentence). To the extent that any amounts are recovered by a
Parent Indemnified Person following the payment of any Losses that would have
reduced the amount of Losses pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii) of the
immediately preceding sentence, such recovered amounts shall be
promptly delivered to the Indemnifying Stockholders in accordance with
_Section 8.4_.   

(g) No Indemnifying Shareholder shall have any right of contribution, right of
indemnity or other right or remedy against Parent or the Surviving
Corporation in connection with any indemnification obligation or any other
liability to which such Indemnifying Shareholder may become subject under or
in connection with this Agreement. No Parent Indemnifying Party shall have
any right of contribution, right of indemnity or other right or remedy
against any holder of shares of Company Common Stock in connection with any
indemnification obligation or any other liability to which such Parent
Indemnifying Party may become subject under or in connection with this
Agreement.   

Section 8.4 _Claim Period for Escrow Fund and Option Indemnity Holdback_. The
period during which claims for indemnification from the Escrow Fund or the
Option Indemnity Holdback may be initiated (the " _Escrow Claims Period_ ")
shall commence at the Effective Time and terminate on the date that is
eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date (the " _Escrow Claim Period
Expiration Date_ "). Within five (5) Business Days following the Escrow
Claims Period Expiration Date, (a) the cash held in the Escrow Fund and (b)
any amount of the Option Indemnity Holdback remaining, in each case less
amounts necessary in the reasonable judgment of Parent to satisfy any
unresolved or unsatisfied claims for Losses specified in any
Officers Certificate delivered to the Escrow Agent and the Shareholders
Representative prior to the Escrow Claim Period Expiration Date (such amount
to be set forth in a certificate signed by an officer of Parent and delivered
to the Escrow Agent and the Shareholders Representative prior to the
Escrow Claim Period Expiration Date, or, if no such certificate is delivered,
the aggregate amounts set forth in any unresolved or unsettled claims for
Losses set forth in Officers Certificates delivered to the Escrow Agent and
the Shareholders Representative prior to the Escrow Claim Period Expiration
Date), shall be released and paid to the Indemnifying Shareholders.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, at the
conclusion of the Escrow Claims Period, such portion of the Escrow Fund and
the Option Indemnity Holdback as may be necessary in the reasonable judgment
of Parent to satisfy any unresolved or unsatisfied claims for
Losses specified in any Officers Certificate delivered to the Escrow Agent
and the Shareholders Representative prior to expiration of the Escrow Claims
Period shall remain in the Escrow Fund or retained by Parent, as the case may
be, until such claims for Losses have been resolved or satisfied, whereupon
such portion of the Escrow Fund and the Option Indemnity Holdback so
retained in respect of the claim for Losses so resolved or satisfied shall be
released to the Indemnifying Shareholders to the extent not applied to the
satisfaction of such claim within five (5) Business Days following the final
resolution of claim.   

Section 8.5 _Claims Procedure_. As soon as reasonably practicable after Parent
becomes aware of any claim that might result in an Loss that the Parent
Indemnified Persons have under  _Section 8.2(a)_, or any Shareholder
Indemnified Person becomes aware of any claim that might result in an Loss
that any Shareholder Indemnified Person has under _Section 8.2(b)_,
Parent shall deliver to the Shareholders Representative (and, if cash remains
in the Escrow Fund and it is prior to the Escrow Claim Period Expiration
Date, to the Escrow Agent) a certificate signed by any officer of Parent (an
" _Officer s Certificate_"), or the Shareholders Representative
shall deliver to the Parent a certificate signed by the Shareholders
Representative (a " _Claim Certificate_ "):   

(a) stating that an Indemnified Person or Shareholder Indemnified Person, as
the case may be, has incurred, paid or properly accrued, or reasonably
anticipates that it may incur, pay or properly accrue, Losses;   

(b) stating the amount of such Losses (which, in the case of Losses not yet
incurred, paid or properly accrued, may be the maximum amount in good faith
anticipated to be incurred, paid or properly accrued); and   

(c) specifying in reasonable detail (based upon the information then possessed
by Parent or the Shareholders Representative, as the case may be) the
individual items of such Losses included in the amount so stated and the
nature of the claim to which such Losses are related.   

No delay in or failure to give an Officers Certificate by Parent to the
Shareholders Representative or the Escrow Agent, if applicable, or a Claim
Certificate by the Shareholders Representative to the Parent, pursuant to
this _Section 8.5_ will adversely affect any of the other rights or remedies
that Parent or any Shareholder Indemnified Person has under this Agreement or
alter or relieve the Indemnifying Shareholders or the Parent Indemnifying
Parties of their obligations to indemnify the Parent Indemnified Persons or
the Shareholder Indemnified Persons, except and to the extent that such delay
or failure has materially prejudiced the Indemnifying Shareholders or Parent
Indemnifying Parties, unless Parent shall have failed to deliver
the Officers Certificate to the Shareholders Representative, or the
Shareholders Representative shall have failed to deliver the Claim
Certificate to the Parent, in each case prior to the applicable Expiration
Date for the representation or warranty, the breach of which gives rise to the
claim of an Loss, as provided in _Section 8.1_.   

Section 8.6 _Objections to Claims_. The Shareholders Representative may object
to any claim set forth in such Officers Certificate, and the Parent may
object to any claim set forth in such Claim Certificate, by delivering
written notice to Parent (and, if cash remains in the Escrow Fund and it is
prior to the Escrow Claim Period Expiration Date, to the Escrow Agent) of
the Shareholders Representatives objection or by delivering written notice
to the Shareholders Representative of the Parents objection, as the case may
be (an " _Objection Notice_ "). The person delivering the Objection Notice is
referred to herein as the " _Objecting Party_ " and the person submitting the
Officers Certificate or the Claim Certificate in respect of which
the Objection Notice is delivered is referred to herein as the " _Claiming
Party_." Such Objection Notice must describe the grounds for such objection
in reasonable detail. If an Objection Notice is not delivered by the
Shareholders Representative to Parent, or by the Parent to the Shareholders
Representative, within thirty (30) days after delivery by Parent of the
Officers Certificate or delivery by the Shareholders Representative of the
Claim Certificate, as the case may be (the " _Objection Period_ "), such
failure to so object shall be an irrevocable acknowledgment by the
Shareholders Representative or the Parent, as the case may be, that
the Parent Indemnified Persons or the Shareholder Indemnified Persons, as the
case may be, are entitled to indemnification under _Section 8.2_ for the
full amount of the Losses set forth in such Officers Certificate or Claim
Certificate.   

Section 8.7 _Resolution of Objections to Claims_. If an Objecting Party shall
deliver an Objection Notice, the Claiming Party shall have thirty (30) days
after its receipt of the Objection Notice to respond in a written statement
to such objection.   

(a) If after such 30-day period there remains a dispute as to any claims, the
Objecting Party and Claiming Party shall attempt in good faith for twenty
(20) days thereafter to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with
respect to each of such claims.   

(b) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation, the
Objecting Party and Claiming Party shall appoint within ten (10) days after
the expiration of such 20-day period an impartial mediator to hold a one-day
mediation in Los Angeles, California as soon as practicable. The Company and
Parent shall each bear one half of the cost of the mediator. In the event that
the parties cannot mutually agree within ten (10) days on a mutual mediator,
any party may seek appointment of a mediator by a court of competent
jurisdiction.   

(c) If no agreement can be reached after good faith mediation, the Objecting
Party shall have the option of demanding arbitration under _Section 10.14_
within sixty (60) days after the delivery of the Objection Notice, and if
such option is so exercised within such 60-day period, the arbitration
provisions of _Section 10.14_ shall be followed and the decision of
the arbitrator regarding such claim shall be binding and conclusive upon the
parties to this Agreement; it being understood that, if no such agreement can
be reached after good faith mediation and the Objecting Party fails to demand
arbitration under _Section 10.14_ with respect to such claims within such
60-day period, then the Objection Notice and all claims thereunder shall be
deemed to be withdrawn by the Objecting Party and the Objecting Party shall
not thereafter assert any such claims that are mentioned in whole or in part
within the Objection Notice.   

Section 8.8 _Payment of Claims_.   

(a) If no Objection Notice is delivered by the Shareholders Representative or
Parent, as the case may be, within the Objection Period, or if an Objection
Notice is delivered by the Shareholders Representative or Parent, as the case
may be, within the Objection Period, but such Objection Notice is only with
respect to a portion of the Losses stated in the applicable
Officers Certificate or Claim Notice:   

(i) On the 31st day following the Escrow Agents and the Shareholders
Representatives receipt of an Officers Certificate, (A) the Escrow Agent
shall release to Parent as soon as practicable out of the Escrow Fund, to the
extent cash remains therein, and (B) Parent shall permanently retain for its
own benefit out of the Option Indemnity Holdback, to the extent any portion
remains, together, pro rata as between the Escrow Fund and the Option
Indemnity Holdback, an amount of cash equal to (I) the amount of the Losses
set forth in the Officers Certificate, if no Objection Notice was delivered
by the Shareholders Representative or (II) the amount of the portion of
the Losses set forth in such Officers Certificate to which no objection was
made, if an Objection Notice was delivered by the Shareholders
Representative; _provided_ , _however_ , that, to the extent that such Losses
have not then been incurred or paid by such Parent Indemnified Person, Parent
(on behalf of itself or any other Parent Indemnified Person) shall not be so
entitled to receive, and the Escrow Agent shall not deliver, and Parent shall
not permanently retain, funds in respect thereof unless and until such Losses
are actually incurred or paid by such Parent Indemnified Person.   

(ii) On the 31st day following the Parents receipt of a Claim Certificate,
the Shareholders Representative shall deliver a notice to Parent notifying
the Parent of Parents obligation under this Agreement to pay to the
Shareholder Indemnified Person or Persons in cash an amount equal to (A) the
amount of the Losses set forth in the Claim Certificate, if no Objection
Notice was delivered by the Parent or (B) the amount of the portion of the
Losses set forth in the Claim Certificate to which no objection was made, if
an Objection Notice was delivered by the Parent, and the Parent shall deliver
such amount of cash to the Shareholders Representative within seven (7) days
of receipt of such notice.   

(b) If an Objection Notice is delivered by the Shareholders Representative
within the Objection Period or an Objection Notice is delivered by the Parent
within the Objection Period:   

(i) If an agreement between the Objecting Party and the Claiming Party is
reached in accordance with _Section 8.7(a)_, the Shareholders Representative
and Parent shall each execute a memorandum setting forth their agreement,
which, if Parent is the Claiming Party, shall be furnished to the Escrow
Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and
shall distribute any cash then remaining in the Escrow Fund in accordance with
the terms thereof and Parent shall permanently retain for its own benefit any
portion of the Option Indemnity Holdback in accordance with the terms
thereof. If the Claiming Party is the Shareholders Representative, the Parent
Indemnifying Parties shall make payments in accordance with the terms of the
memorandum.   

(ii) If an agreement is reached through mediation in accordance with _Section
8.7(b)_, the Shareholders Representative and Parent shall each execute a
memorandum setting forth their agreement, which, if the Parent is the
Claiming Party, shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent
shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and shall distribute any cash
then remaining in the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms thereof and
Parent shall permanently retain for its own benefit any portion of the Option
Indemnity Holdback in accordance with the terms thereof. If the Claiming
Party is the Shareholders Representative, the Parent Indemnifying Parties
shall make payments in accordance with the terms of the memorandum.   

(iii) If a determination is made through arbitration in accordance with 
_Section 8.7(c)_, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act in accordance
with the decision of the arbitrator, and make or withhold payments out of the
Escrow Fund in accordance therewith (and Parent shall permanently retain for
its own benefit or make payments of any portion of the Option Indemnity
Holdback in accordance with the terms thereof), and the Parent
Indemnifying Parties shall make payments in accordance with the decision of
the arbitrator, as the case may be.   

Section 8.9 _Third Party Claims_. If Parent becomes aware of a third-party
claim which Parent believes may result in a claim for indemnification in
accordance with _Section 8.2(a)_ by or on behalf of a Parent Indemnified
Person, Parent shall promptly notify the Shareholders Representative of such
third-party claim, and provide the Shareholders Representative
the opportunity to participate, subject to the control of Parent, at its own
cost in any defense of such claim. Parent shall not settle any such claim
without the prior written consent of the Shareholders Representative, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If the
Shareholders Representative consents to any such settlement, neither the
Shareholders Representative nor any shareholder of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall have any power or authority to object to
the amount or validity of any claim by or on behalf of any Parent Indemnified
Person for indemnity with respect to such settlement.   

ARTICLE IX.    

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER    

Section 9.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior

(a) by the mutual written consent of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company;   

(b) by either the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, by written notice to the other party if any Governmental
Authority with jurisdiction over such matters shall have issued a
Governmental Order permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and such Governmental Order shall have become final and
unappealable; _provided, however_ , that the terms of this  _Section 9.1(b)_
shall not be available to any party unless such party shall have
complied with its obligations pursuant to _Section 6.5_; and   

(c) by either the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, by written notice to the other party if the Merger shall not have
been consummated on or before September 30, 2007, unless the failure to
consummate the Merger on or prior to such date is the result of any action or
inaction under this Agreement by the party seeking to terminate the Agreement
pursuant to the terms of this _Section 9.1(c)_.   

(d) by Parent, if the Company shall have breached any representation, warranty
or covenant contained herein and (i) such breach shall not have been cured
within thirty days after receipt by the Company of written notice of such
breach (provided, however, that no such cure period shall be available or
applicable to any such breach which by its nature cannot be cured) and (ii) if
not cured at or prior to the Closing, such breach would result in the failure
of any of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _(e)_ to be
satisfied (provided, however, that the termination right under this Section
ý9.1(d) shall not be available to Parent if Parent is at that time in
material breach of this Agreement); or   

(e) by the Company, if Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached any
representation, warranty or covenant contained herein and (i) such breach
shall not have been cured within thirty days after receipt by Parent of
written notice of such breach (provided, however, that no such cure
period shall be available or applicable to any such breach which by its
nature cannot be cured) and (ii) if not cured at or prior to the Closing,
such breach would result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in
_Section ý7.1(a)_ to be satisfied; provided, however, that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section ý9.1(e)_ shall not be available
to the Company if the Company is at that time in material breach of this
Agreement).   

Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement and abandonment of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with _Section
9.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and of no further force or
effect whatsoever and there shall be no liability on the part of any party to
this Agreement or any of their respective officers, directors, shareholders
or Affiliates; _provided, however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any party to this Agreement
from any liability resulting from or arising out of any intentional, material
breach of any agreement or covenant hereunder that occurred prior to the
termination of this Agreement; and _provided_ , _further_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms of  _Section 6.4_, this _Section
9.2_ and _Article X_ shall survive any termination of this Agreement,
whether in accordance with _Section 9.1_ or otherwise.

Section 10.5 _Interpretation_. The Article and Section headings in this
Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to
alter or affect the meaning or interpretation of any provision of this
Agreement. References to Articles or Sections in this Agreement, unless
otherwise indicated, are references to Articles or Sections of this
Agreement. The parties to this Agreement have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises with respect to any term or
provision of this Agreement, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties to this Agreement, and no presumption or burden of
proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party to this Agreement by
virtue of the authorship of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement.
Any reference to any federal, state, county, local or foreign statute or Law
shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. For all purposes of and
under this Agreement, (i) the word "including" shall be deemed to be
immediately followed by the words "without limitation;" (ii) words (including
defined terms) in the singular shall be deemed to include the plural and
vice versa; (iii) words of one gender shall be deemed to include the other
gender as the context requires; and (iv) the terms "hereof," "herein,"
"hereto," "herewith" and any other words of similar import shall, unless
otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a
whole (including all of the Schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement) and not
to any particular term or provision of this Agreement, unless otherwise
specified.   

Section 10.6 _Severability_. In the event that any one or more of the terms
or provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other certificate,
instrument or other document referred to in this Agreement, shall, for any
reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or
provision of this Agreement or any other such certificate, instrument or
other document referred to in this Agreement, and the parties to this
Agreement shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to substitute one
or more valid, legal and enforceable terms or provisions into this Agreement
which, insofar as practicable, implement the purposes and intent of this
Agreement. Any term or provision of this Agreement held invalid or
unenforceable only in part, degree or within certain jurisdictions shall
remain in full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or
unenforceable to the extent consistent with the intent of the parties
as reflected by this Agreement. To the extent permitted by applicable Law,
each party waives any term or provision of Law which renders any term or
provision of this Agreement to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect.   

Section 10.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Disclosure
Schedule and the Exhibits to this Agreement) and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties to this Agreement
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, and supersede all prior
agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties to
this Agreement with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, except
as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement.   

Section 10.8 _Assignment_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties to this Agreement (whether
by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the
other parties to this Agreement, and any purported assignment or other
transfer without such consent shall be void and unenforceable. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the parties to this Agreement and their
respective successors and assigns.   

Section 10.9 _Waivers and Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended or
modified only by a written instrument executed by all of the parties to this
Agreement. Any failure of the parties to this Agreement to comply with any
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition in this Agreement may be waived
by the party entitled to the benefits thereof only by a written
instrument signed by the party granting such waiver. No delay on the part of
any party to this Agreement in exercising any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part
of any party to this Agreement of any right, power or privilege
hereunder operate as a waiver of any other right, power or privilege
hereunder, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or
privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder. Unless
otherwise provided, the rights and remedies provided for in this Agreement
are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies which the
parties to this Agreement may otherwise have at law or in equity. Whenever
this Agreement requires or permits consent by or on behalf of a party,
such consent shall be given in writing in a manner consistent with the
requirements for a waiver of compliance as set forth in this _Section
10.9_.   

Section 10.10 _Equitable Remedies_. Each of the parties to this Agreement
acknowledges and agrees that the other parties to this Agreement would be
irreparably damaged in the event that any of the terms or provisions of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
otherwise are breached. Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties to this Agreement hereby
agrees that the other parties to this Agreement shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement, and to enforce specifically the performance by
such first party under this Agreement, and each party to this Agreement
hereby agrees to waive the defense in any such suit that the other parties to
this Agreement have an adequate remedy at law and to interpose no opposition,
legal or otherwise, as to the propriety of injunction or specific performance
as a remedy, and hereby agrees to waive any requirement to post any bond in
connection with obtaining such relief. The equitable remedies described in
this _Section 10.10_ shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other
remedies at law or in equity that the parties to this Agreement may elect to
pursue. The parties to this Agreement hereby agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event any of the terms or provision of this Agreement
required to be performed prior to the Effective Time are not performed in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and that, prior to the Effective
Time, the parties to this Agreement shall be entitled to specific performance
of the terms of this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy at law or
in equity.   

Section 10.11 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall
be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
California applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed entirely
within such State without regard to its conflicts of laws provisions. Each of
the parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its assets and properties, to the exclusive jurisdiction
of any California State court, or federal court of the United States of
America, sitting within the State of California, and any appellate court from
any thereof, in any action or proceeding initiated prior to the Effective
Time (or after the Effective Time if specific performance is sought) arising
out of or relating to this Agreement, the agreements delivered in connection
with this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or
for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of
the parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i)
agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding prior to the Effective
Time (or after the Effective Time if specific performance is sought) except in
such courts; (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such action or
proceeding prior to the Effective Time (or after the Effective Time if
specific performance is sought) may be heard and determined in such
California State court or, to the extent permitted by Law, in such
Federal court; (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such action or proceeding prior to the Effective Time
(or after the Effective Time if specific performance is sought) in any
such California State or Federal court; and (iv) waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding prior to the Effective Time (or
after the Effective Time if specific performance is sought) in any
such California State or Federal court. Each of the parties to this Agreement
hereby agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding prior to
the Effective Time (or after the Effective Time if specific performance is
sought) shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.   

Section 10.12 _Exclusivity of Representations and Warranties_. It is the
explicit intent and understanding of each of the parties to this Agreement
that no party to this Agreement, nor any of their respective Affiliates,
representatives or agents, is making any representation or warranty
whatsoever, oral or written, express or implied, other than those set forth in
this Agreement (as qualified by the Disclosure Schedule).   

Section 10.13 _Shareholders Representative_.   

(a) _Appointment_. The parties have agreed that it is desirable to designate
a representative to act on behalf of the holders of Company Common Stock for
certain limited purposes (the " _Shareholders Representative_ "). The parties
have designated Talmadge ONeill as the initial Shareholders Representative,
and approval of this Agreement by the holders of Company Common Stock shall
constitute ratification and approval of such designation by the holders
of Company Common Stock, and agreement by the holders of Company Common Stock
to reimburse the Shareholders Representative for all reasonable expenses,
disbursements and advances (including fees and disbursements of his counsel,
experts and other agents and consultants) incurred by the Shareholders
Representative in such capacity, and to indemnify the Shareholders
Representative against any loss arising out of any actions taken or omitted
to be taken in his capacity as Shareholders Representative (except for those
arising out of the Shareholders Representatives gross negligence or willful
misconduct) including the costs and expenses of investigation and defense of
claims. The Shareholders Representative hereby accepts such appointment.
The Shareholders Representative may resign at any time, and the Shareholders
Representative may be removed by the vote of Persons that collectively held
shares constituting more than a majority of the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Majority Holders_
"). In the event that the Shareholders Representative has resigned or been
removed, a new Shareholders Representative shall be appointed by the Majority
Holders, such appointment to become effective upon the written acceptance
thereof by the new Shareholders Representative.   

(b) _Authority and Liability_. The Shareholders Representative shall have
such powers and authority as are necessary to carry out the functions
assigned to the Shareholders Representative under this Agreement; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Shareholders Representative shall have no obligation
to act on behalf of the holders of Company Common Stock except as
expressly provided herein. Without limiting the foregoing, the Shareholders
Representative shall be the exclusive agent for and on behalf of the
shareholders of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time to:   

(i) give and receive notices and communications to or from Parent (on behalf
of itself or any other Parent Indemnified Person) and/or the Escrow Agent
relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any of the transactions
and other matters contemplated hereby or thereby, including with respect to
matters relating to Earnout Consideration;   

(ii) authorize deliveries to Parent of cash or other property from the Escrow
Fund and the Option Indemnity Holdback in satisfaction of claims asserted by
Parent (on behalf of itself or any other Parent Indemnified Person, including
by not objecting to such claims);   

(iii) object to such claims in accordance with _Section 8.6_;   

(iv) consent or agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises
of, and demand mediation and arbitration and comply with orders of courts and
awards of arbitrators with respect to, such claims;   

(v) consent or agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of,
and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts with respect to,
disputes; and   

(vi) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Shareholders Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing,
including retaining counsel, accountants and other advisors, in each case
without having to seek or obtain the consent of any Person under any
circumstance.   

The Shareholders Representative shall be the sole and exclusive means of
asserting or addressing any of the above and no former shareholder shall have
any right to act on its own behalf with respect to any such matters, other
than any claim or dispute against the Shareholders Representative. The
Shareholders Representative shall have no liability to Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the holders of Company Common Stock
with respect to actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as
Shareholders Representative, except with respect to the Shareholders
Representatives gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Shareholders Representative shall at all times be entitled to rely on any
directions received from the Majority Holders; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Shareholders Representative shall not be required to follow any such
direction, and shall be under no obligation to take any action in its capacity
as Shareholders Representative, unless the Shareholders Representative is
holding funds delivered to him under this _Section 10.13(b)_ and/or has been
provided with other funds, security or indemnities which, in the sole
determination of the Shareholders Representative, are sufficient to protect
the Shareholders Representative against the Losses which may be incurred by
the Shareholders Representative in responding to such direction or taking
such action. The Shareholders Representative shall be entitled to engage such
counsel, experts and other agents and consultants as he shall deem necessary
in connection with exercising his powers and performing his function
hereunder and (in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Shareholders
Representative) shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and
advice of such Persons.   

Section 10.14 _Binding Arbitration_. Except as provided in _Sections 2.8(e),
8.6, 8.7_, _10.11_ , _10.12_ and the second sentence of _10.13(a)_ , all
disputes, controversies or claims (whether in contract, tort or otherwise)
arising out of, relating to or otherwise by virtue of the negotiation or
performance of this Agreement, breach of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement subsequent to the Effective Time shall
be resolved as follows:   

(a) Any disputes shall be settled under the applicable rules of arbitration
(except as set forth below) of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services as
amended from time to time and as modified in this _Section 10.15_. Within
ten (10) days after filing demand for arbitration, the parties shall agree on
one neutral arbitrator. If the parties cannot agree within such time then any
party may seek an order from a court of competent jurisdiction in California
appointing such an arbitrator.   

(b) The arbitration shall take place in Los Angeles, California and shall be
the exclusive forum for resolving such disputes, controversies or claims. The
arbitrator shall have the power to order hearings and meetings to be held in
such place or places as he or she deems in the interests of reducing the
total cost to the parties of the arbitration.   

(c) The arbitration shall be held before a single arbitrator, who shall be
required to issue a written decision which decides the issues brought before
the arbitrator in accordance with the law governing this Agreement. The
arbitrator shall have the power to order equitable remedies. The arbitrator
may hear and rule on dispositive motions as part of the arbitration proceeding
(e.g. motions for summary disposition).   

(d) The arbitrator may appoint an expert only with the consent of all of the
parties to the arbitration.   

(e) The arbitrators fees and the administrative expenses of the arbitration
shall be paid equally by the parties. Each party to the arbitration shall pay
its own costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with the
arbitration.   

(f) The award rendered by the arbitrator shall be executory, final and binding
on the parties. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered into any
court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for
judicial acceptance of the award and an order of enforcement, as the case may
be. Such court proceeding shall disclose only the minimum amount
of information concerning the arbitration as is required to obtain such
acceptance or order.   

(g) Except as required by law, the arbitration proceedings and decision shall
be confidential. Neither any party nor the arbitrator may disclose the
existence, content or results of an arbitration brought in accordance with
this Agreement, or any portion of the record, or any evidence or
pleadings.   

(h) Each party to this Agreement hereby agrees that in connection with any
such action process may be served in the same manner as notices may be
delivered under _Section 10.4_ and irrevocably waives any defenses it may
have to service in such manner.   

Section 10.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of
which together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall
become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties
hereto and delivered to the other parties hereto, it being understood
that all parties hereto need not sign the same counterpart. The exchange of a
fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by facsimile or by
electronic delivery in PDF format shall be sufficient to bind the parties to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
