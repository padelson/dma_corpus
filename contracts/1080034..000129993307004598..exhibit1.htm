<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><B>THE MERGER</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;2.1 <U>The Merger</U>. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, the Agreement of Merger, in substantially the form attached hereto as <U>Exhibit&nbsp;C</U>
(the &#147;<U>Agreement of Merger</U>&#148;), and in accordance with California Law, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time. Following the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation (the &#147;<U>Surviving Corporation</U>&#148;) and shall succeed to and assume all the rights
and obligations of Merger Sub in accordance with California Law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;2.2 <U>Closing</U>. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to
<U>Section&nbsp;9.1</U>, the closing of the Merger (the &#147;<U>Closing</U>&#148;) shall take place at the
offices of Jones Day, 1755 Embarcadero Road, Palo Alto, California on August&nbsp;15, 2007 or if the
conditions set forth in <U>Article&nbsp;VII</U> shall not have been fulfilled or waived by such date,
as soon as practicable (but in no event no more than two (2)&nbsp;Business Days) after such conditions
shall have been satisfied or waived (such date hereinafter, the &#147;<U>Closing Date</U>&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;2.3 <U>Effective Time</U>. The Merger shall become effective when the Agreement of
Merger, together with the related officers&#146; certificates, executed in accordance with the relevant
provisions of California Law and to be filed if, as and when the Closing occurs, is accepted for
record by the Secretary of State of the State of California. When used in this Agreement, the term
&#147;<U>Effective Time</U>&#148; shall mean the later of the date and time at which the Agreement of Merger
is accepted for record or the date and time established by the Agreement of Merger.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;2.4 <U>Effects of the Merger</U>. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in this Agreement, the Agreement of Merger and the applicable provisions
of California Law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;2.5 <U>Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;At the Effective Time and without any further action on the part of the Company or Merger
Sub, the Company&#146;s Articles of Incorporation shall be amended and restated as set forth as
Exhibit&nbsp;A to the Agreement of Merger, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or
applicable Law. The Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided
therein or in the Company Articles of Incorporation and applicable Law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;The directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the directors and officers, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time,
until the earlier of their resignation or removal or otherwise ceasing to be a director or officer
or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;2.6 <U>Conversion of Securities</U>. At the Closing, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, the aggregate maximum consideration to be paid to the
Shareholders and the Optionholders by Parent for all the outstanding Company Common Stock and
Company Options shall be $103,300,000.00 in cash <U>minus</U> any unpaid Indebtedness and unpaid
Third Party Transaction Expenses, in each case as set forth on the Closing Date Balance Sheet (as
defined in <U>subparagraph&nbsp;(e)</U> below), <U>minus</U> an amount equal to the China Closing
Bonus Amount and subject to further adjustment as provided in <U>subparagraph&nbsp;(e)</U> below (such
amount, as adjusted, the &#147;<U>Closing Consideration</U>&#148;), subject to the deposit of a portion of
the Closing Consideration into the Escrow Fund as provided in <U>Section&nbsp;2.7</U>. In addition,
the Shareholders and the Optionholders shall receive the Earnout Consideration, if any, payable as
provided in <U>Section&nbsp;2.8</U>. By virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any
Shareholder or Optionholder or the holder of any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries shall be canceled and shall cease to exist without any conversion thereof,

Corporation. Each certificate evidencing ownership of Merger Sub Common Stock shall evidence
ownership of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

the Effective Time (excluding shares of Company Common Stock described in <U>subparagraph&nbsp;(a)</U>
above and any Dissenting Shares) automatically will be converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to the aggregate amount of the Closing Consideration (subject to the escrow of
a portion of the Closing Consideration pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;2.7</U>) <I>divided by </I>the number of
Fully Diluted Shares (the &#147;<U>Per Share Closing Consideration</U>&#148;). In addition, the

an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Closing Consideration <U>multiplied</U> by the number of
shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Initial In-the-Money Option, <U>minus</U> the
aggregate exercise price with respect to such Initial In-the-Money Option (subject to the retention
by Parent of a portion of the Closing Consideration pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;2.7</U>) and (ii)&nbsp;the
right to receive the Earnout Consideration as and to the extent provided in <U>Section&nbsp;2.8</U>.
Each outstanding Company Option having an exercise price greater than or equal to the Per Share
Closing Consideration shall be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive the
Earnout Consideration as and to the extent provided in <U>Section&nbsp;2.8</U> and shall not be
entitled to receive any portion of the Closing Consideration. The amounts payable to Optionholders
pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;2.6(d)</U> shall be reduced by applicable withholding taxes.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(e)&nbsp;The amount of Closing Consideration paid to the Shareholders and the Optionholders, if
any, shall be adjusted as set forth in this <U>subclause&nbsp;(e)</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(i)&nbsp;The amount of Closing Consideration shall be adjusted downward, on a dollar for dollar

$800,000, by an amount equal to such shortfall and (B)&nbsp;to the extent that Non-Cash Working Capital
calculated from the Closing Balance Sheet is less than $4,500,000, by an amount equal to one-half

excluding any unpaid Third Party Expenses or Indebtedness resulting in a reduction in the Closing
Consideration under <U>Section&nbsp;2.6</U>). &#147;<U>Closing Date Balance Sheet</U>&#148; is defined as the

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;On the Closing Date, notwithstanding any foregoing provisions of this <U>Article&nbsp;II</U>
to the contrary, Parent, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the &#147;<U>Escrow Agent</U>&#148;) and the Shareholders
Representative shall execute the escrow agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as
<U>Exhibit&nbsp;D</U> (the &#147;<U>Escrow Agreement</U>&#148;) and Parent shall deposit with the Escrow Agent,
for the benefit and on behalf of the Shareholders (other than Dissenting Shares), a portion of the
Closing Consideration in cash equal to $10,000,000.00 <U>multiplied</U> by the quotient obtained
by dividing (i)&nbsp;the portion of the Closing Consideration received by Shareholders by (ii)&nbsp;the
Closing Consideration (the &#147;<U>Indemnification Escrow Amount</U>&#148;) to be held in escrow in
accordance with the provisions of the Escrow Agreement. The portion of the Indemnification Escrow
Amount deposited on behalf of each Shareholder pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;2.7(a)</U> shall be the
Escrow Pro Rata Portion (as defined below). The term &#147;<U>Escrow Pro Rata Portion</U>&#148; for each
holder of record of a Certificate (as defined in <U>Section&nbsp;3.1(a)</U>) means an amount equal to
the product of (i)&nbsp;the amount of the Indemnification Escrow Amount and (ii)&nbsp;the quotient obtained
by dividing (A)&nbsp;the aggregate amount of cash otherwise payable to such holder of such Certificate
pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;2.6(c)</U> (without regard to any reduction of that amount on account of
the Indemnification Escrow Amount) by (B)&nbsp;the aggregate amount of the Closing Consideration paid to
all Shareholders.

to the contrary, Parent shall withhold and retain, for the benefit and on behalf of the
Optionholders holding Initial In-the-Money Options, a portion of the Closing Consideration in cash
equal to $10,000,000.00 <U>minus</U> the Indemnification Escrow Amount (the &#147;<U>Closing Option
Indemnity Holdback</U>&#148;) as security for any claims for Losses pursuant to and in accordance with
<U>Article&nbsp;VIII</U>. The portion of the Closing Option Indemnity Holdback withheld and retained
by Parent pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;2.7(b)</U> shall be the Holdback Pro Rata Portion (as
defined below). The term &#147;<U>Holdback Pro Rata Portion</U>&#148; for each holder of record of an
Initial In-the-Money Option means an amount equal to the product of (i)&nbsp;the amount of the Closing
Option Indemnity Holdback and (ii)&nbsp;the quotient obtained by dividing (A)&nbsp;the aggregate amount of
cash otherwise payable to such Optionholder pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;2.6(d)</U> (without regard to
any reduction of that amount on account of the Closing Option Indemnity Holdback) by (B)&nbsp;the

escrow in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow Agreement. Any interest or other income
earned on the Escrow Amount will be included in the gross income of Parent in accordance with
Proposed Treasury Regulations under Section&nbsp;468B(g) of the Internal Revenue Code. The portion of
the Earnout Escrow Amount deposited on behalf of each Shareholder pursuant to this
<U>Section&nbsp;2.7(b)</U> shall be the Escrow Pro Rata Portion; provided that a portion of the Escrow
Amount shall be distributed from the Escrow Account to Parent in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement in order to enable Parent to pay Taxes resulting from income or earnings with

Holdback, the &#147;<U>Option Indemnity Holdback</U>&#148;) as security for any claims for Losses pursuant
to and in accordance with <U>Article&nbsp;VIII</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(e)&nbsp;Any interest accruing on the Escrow Amount shall be held in the Escrow Fund and be
available to cover claims for Losses until distributed upon termination of the Escrow Fund, as
provided in <U>Article&nbsp;VIII</U> and the Escrow Agreement. Any such interest shall be distributed
to Parent (to the extent earned or paid with respect to cash in the Escrow Fund distributed to
Parent to cover Losses pursuant to <U>Article&nbsp;VIII</U>) or pro rata to the respective Shareholders
on whose behalf cash was deposited in the Escrow Fund (to the extent earned or paid with respect to
cash ultimately distributed to such respective shareholders upon termination of the Escrow Fund),
such that any interest earned on any cash in the Escrow Fund generally follows the ultimate
recipient of the cash on which such interest was earned.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(f)&nbsp;Interest will accrue on the Option Indemnity Holdback at the same rate as interest accrues
on the Escrow Amount and shall be available to cover claims for Losses until distributed upon
termination of the Option Indemnity Holdback, as provided in <U>Article&nbsp;VIII</U>. Any such
interest shall be retained by Parent (to the extent earned with respect to any portion of the
Option Indemnity Holdback retained by Parent to cover Losses pursuant to <U>Article&nbsp;VIII</U>) or
pro rata to the respective optionholders on whose behalf the Option Indemnity Holdback was retained
(to the extent earned with respect to cash ultimately distributed to such respective optionholders
upon termination of the Option Indemnity Holdback), such that any interest earned on the Option
Indemnity Holdback generally follows the ultimate recipient of the cash on which such interest was
earned.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(g)&nbsp;All fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent shall be borne equally by the Shareholders, on
the one hand, and by Parent, on the other hand.

as provided in <U>Section&nbsp;2.7</U>, this <U>Section&nbsp;2.8</U> and <U>Article&nbsp;VIII</U>, the
&#147;<U>Earnout Consideration</U>&#148;). The Earnout Consideration payable to the Shareholders pursuant
to this <U>Section&nbsp;2.8</U> is not compensation for services but constitutes consideration payable
in the Merger and shall be treated as such for all Tax purposes, including for purposes of
withholding. The Earnout Consideration payable to Optionholders shall be treated as compensation
for federal income tax purposes and shall be subject to applicable withholding taxes. All Earnout
Consideration that is not earned by the Shareholders and the Optionholders pursuant to this
<U>Section&nbsp;2.8</U> will be forfeited. No Shareholder or Optionholder may sell, exchange,
transfer or otherwise dispose of his, her or its right to receive any portion of the Earnout
Consideration, other than by the laws of descent and distribution or succession, and any transfer
in violation of this <U>Section&nbsp;2.8</U> shall be null and void and shall not be recognized by

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(i)&nbsp;Within sixty (60)&nbsp;days after the end of each of December&nbsp;31, 2007, 2008, and 2009, as
applicable, Parent shall calculate at Parent&#146;s expense and deliver to the Shareholders
Representative a report (the &#147;<U>Earnout Report</U>&#148;), which shall include (A)&nbsp;the unaudited
statement or calculation of EBITDA and Net Revenue for the Company Business for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2007, 2008, or 2009, as applicable, (B)&nbsp;a calculation of the percentage of the
respective EBITDA and Net Revenue targets achieved for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007, 2008, or
2009, as applicable, and the amount of Earnout Consideration, if any, payable therefrom, (C)&nbsp;the
nature and amount of Losses, if any, claimed by Parent as an offset from the 2008 Earnout
Consideration or the 2009 Earnout Consideration, as the case may be, as provided in
<U>Article&nbsp;VIII</U>, and (D)&nbsp;the amount of Earnout Consideration, if any, to be paid to the
Shareholders and the Optionholders. Each Earnout Report shall be signed by an executive officer of
Parent.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(ii)&nbsp;Any Earnout Consideration payable as reflected on an Earnout Report shall be paid by
Parent to the Shareholders and the Optionholders, (subject in the case of Optionholders to Section
2.6(d)) on the same Business Day on which the applicable Earnout Report is delivered to the
Shareholders Representative; <I>provided, however</I>, that (x)&nbsp;the Earnout Escrow Amount (which is part
of the 2007 Earnout Consideration) shall be deposited into the Escrow Fund as provided in
<U>Section&nbsp;2.7(c)</U> and (y)&nbsp;the Additional Option Indemnity Holdback (which is part of the 2007
Earnout Consideration) shall be withheld and retained by Parent as provided in
<U>Section&nbsp;2.7(d)</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(e)&nbsp;<U>Right to Inspection</U>. The Shareholders Representative shall be entitled to inspect
the books and records of the Surviving Corporation upon which the calculations reflected in the
Earnout Report were made (the books and records relating to and used in calculating the amounts
reflected in the Earnout Report, the &#147;<U>relevant books and records</U>&#148;), if the Shareholder
Representative provides written notice to Parent of such request within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after the
Earnout Report is delivered. If the Shareholders Representative does not deliver such a written
request within such thirty (30)&nbsp;day period, the calculations and facts set forth in the Earnout
Report shall be deemed irrevocably approved by the Shareholders Representative and shall be
conclusive and binding upon the Shareholders Representative and each Shareholder entitled to share
in any Earnout Consideration. If the Shareholders Representative delivers a written inspection
request within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after the Earnout Report is delivered, the Company shall provide
reasonable access to the relevant books and records during normal business hours to the Shareholder
Representative and the Shareholder Representative&#146;s professional advisors no later than ten (10)
days after the Shareholders Representative delivers the written inspection request. The
Shareholders Representative and the Shareholder Representative&#146;s professional advisors shall have a
period of twenty (20)&nbsp;Business Days after the date access to the relevant books and records is
provided to review and analyze the same, and within five (5)&nbsp;Business Days after the end of such
twenty (20)&nbsp;Business Day inspection period (unless the Shareholders Representative in good faith
requires additional time to complete the analysis, in which case Parent shall provide no more than
five (5)&nbsp;Business Days additional time to complete the review and analysis) shall give Parent
written notice describing in reasonable detail the nature and amount of any purported differences
between the amounts and facts reflected in the Earnout Report and those determined in good faith
through the Shareholders Representative&#146;s and the Shareholder Representative&#146;s professional
advisors review. If the Shareholders Representative fails to give written notice to Parent of any
purported differences within the required period, the calculations and facts set forth in the
applicable Earnout Notice shall be deemed irrevocably and unconditionally approved by the
Shareholders Representative and shall be conclusive and binding upon the Shareholders
Representative and each Shareholder entitled to share in any Earnout Consideration. If the
Shareholders Representative provides written notice of purported differences within the required
period, the Shareholders Representative and an authorized representative of Parent shall promptly
seek in good faith to resolve any purported differences and agree to the appropriate amount of
Earnout Consideration payable to the Shareholders and the Optionholders. If the parties are unable
to come to a good faith resolution within ten (10)&nbsp;Business Days after commencing such good faith
discussions, the dispute will be resolved in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;10.14</U>. In any such
dispute resolution process, Parent will have the right to assert any arguments and/or evidence that
it may have to the effect that the calculation of the Earnout Consideration or any portion or
component thereof as originally reflected on the Earnout Report was overstated (based upon any
information that, as of such time, has come to the attention of Parent), and, if it is finally
resolved that the Earnout Consideration was overstated, the Shareholders and Optionholders, ratably
based on the portion of the Earnout Consideration they received, shall be required to repay such
overage to Parent. Parent shall be entitled to withhold payment of the portion of the Earnout
Consideration that is in dispute during the pendency of such dispute. Any additional Earnout
Consideration payable to the Shareholders and Optionholders or any amounts payable by the
Shareholders and Optionholders to Parent after the resolution of any dispute in accordance with
this <U>subsection 2.8(e)</U> (which amounts, if any, shall be offset against each other) shall be
paid by Parent or by the Shareholders and Optionholders, as applicable, within ten (10)&nbsp;Business
Days after the date any such dispute is finally resolved.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(f)&nbsp;<U>Support for Earnout Consideration</U>. Parent shall provide the Surviving Corporation
or the resulting business group reasonably adequate resources and reasonable support through
December&nbsp;31, 2009 to allow it a reasonable opportunity to achieve the EBITDA and Net Revenue
targets as set forth in this <U>Section&nbsp;2.8</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(g)&nbsp;<U>Affect of Change in Control on Earnout Consideration</U>. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, if a Change of Control is consummated prior to December&nbsp;31, 2009
and there is an adverse effect or adverse effects on the Company Business resulting from such
Change of Control, then, upon written notice from the Shareholders Representative to Parent
identifying in reasonable detail the Change of Control and the adverse effect or adverse effects
resulting from such Change of Control (which such notice must be delivered prior to December&nbsp;31 of
any year in which any such adverse effect occurs), the calculation of Earnout Consideration, if
any, and the payment of Earnout Consideration will be affected as follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(i)&nbsp;If the adverse effect caused by the Change of Control has resulted or is reasonably likely
to result in a reduction of either Net Revenue or EBITDA of at least 2%, but less than 15%, from
the 100% targets for Net Revenue or EBITDA, respectively, for the year in which the Change in
Control occurs or any subsequent calendar year ending on or prior to December&nbsp;31, 2009, then the
Earnout Consideration for each such year will be calculated after adding back any such reductions
in Net Revenue or EBITDA, as applicable, caused by the Change of Control. In the circumstances
described in this clause (i), the Earnout Consideration will be calculated and paid pursuant to the
normal schedule for payment of the Earnout Consideration otherwise provided for in <U>Section
2.8</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(ii)&nbsp;If (A)&nbsp;the adverse effect caused by the Change of Control has resulted or is reasonably
likely to result in a reduction in EBITDA of more than 15% from the 100% target for EBITDA in the
year in which the Change in Control occurs or any subsequent year ending on or prior to December
31, 2009, and (B)&nbsp;the EBITDA achieved by the Company in the latest six full calendar months prior
to the Change in Control <U>times</U> two (2)&nbsp;is at least 85% of the 100% EBITDA target for the
year in which the Change in Control occurs, then the aggregate amount of Earnout Consideration
payable to the Shareholders and the Optionholders (for the year in which the Change of Control
occurs and any subsequent year ending in or prior to December&nbsp;31, 2009) shall be calculated based
upon the assumption that 100% of the EBITDA and 100% of the Net Revenue targets through December
31, 2009 were achieved pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;2.8</U>; and the full amount of such Earnout
Consideration shall become due and payable to the Shareholders and the Optionholders within ten
(10)&nbsp;Business Days of the date the financial effect of such adverse effect has been determined
(subject to extension for any period during which any dispute regarding the Earnout Consideration
is being resolved pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;10.14</U>).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(h)&nbsp;<U>Affect of Insolvency on Earnout Consideration</U>. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, if an Insolvency Event occurs prior to December&nbsp;31, 2009 and the EBITDA
achieved by the Company in the latest six full calendar months prior to the Insolvency Event
<U>times</U> two (2)&nbsp;is at least 85% of the 100% EBITDA target for the year in which the
Insolvency Event occurs, then the aggregate amount of Earnout Consideration payable to the
Shareholders and the Optionholders (for the year in which the Insolvency Event occurs and any
subsequent year ending on or prior to December&nbsp;31, 2009) shall be calculated based upon the
assumption that 100% of the EBITDA and 100% of the Net Revenue targets were achieved pursuant to
this <U>Section&nbsp;2.8</U>; and the full amount of such Earnout Consideration shall become due and
payable to the Shareholders and the Optionholders within ten (10)&nbsp;Business Days of the date of such
Insolvency Event (subject to extension for any period during which any dispute regarding the
Earnout Consideration is being resolved pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;10.14</U>).

<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><B>EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;3.1 <U>Exchange of Certificates</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;<U>Parent to Provide Funds</U>. On the Closing Date, Parent shall have available in
immediately available cash the cash representing the Closing Consideration (<I>less </I>the
Indemnification Escrow Amount and <I>less </I>any amounts otherwise payable with respect to any Dissenting
Shares) for payment to the respective Shareholders and Optionholders entitled thereto as provided
below. In addition, at the Effective Time, Parent shall separately deposit the Indemnification
Escrow Amount into the Escrow Fund on behalf of the Shareholders otherwise entitled thereto, as
provided in <U>Section&nbsp;2.7(a)</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;<U>Exchange Procedures</U>. The Company shall cause to be delivered, within five (5)
Business Days prior to the Effective Time, to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates representing any shares of Company Common Stock and Company Options to be cancelled
pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;2.7(d)</U> (the &#147;<U>Certificates</U>&#148;), other than Certificates to be
cancelled or retired pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;2.6(a)</U>, (i)&nbsp;a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon actual delivery of the Certificates to Parent and shall be in a form and have such other
provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii)&nbsp;instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Closing Consideration issuable in respect of the
shares represented by such Certificates, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to Parent (but no earlier of the
Effective Time) or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by the Surviving Corporation,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably
be required by Parent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, the Per Share Closing Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock theretofore
represented by such Certificate pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;2.6(c)</U>, and the Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. The amount of Closing Consideration to be received by
any Shareholder or Optionholder in accordance with the preceding sentence shall be reduced by such
holder&#146;s Escrow Pro Rata Portion or Holdback Pro Rata Portion, as the case may be. No interest
shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon the surrender of any Certificate. If
payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of such Certificate or establish
to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this <U>Section&nbsp;3.1(b)</U>, each Certificate (other than
Certificates representing Dissenting Shares and Certificates representing any shares of Company
Common Stock to be cancelled or retired pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;2.6(a)</U>) shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement, upon such surrender, the amount of cash, without interest, into which
the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have been
converted pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;2.6(c)</U>. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any party to this Agreement shall be liable to a former shareholder of the
Company for any cash or interest delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;<U>Letter of Transmittal</U>. As provided in the letter of transmittal, by executing and
delivering the same, each Shareholder and Optionholder will (i)&nbsp;acknowledge and agree to (A)&nbsp;the
Earnout Consideration provisions and obligations set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;2.9</U>, (B)&nbsp;the
indemnification and other obligations set forth in <U>Article&nbsp;VIII</U>, and (C)&nbsp;Parent&#146;s and any
other Parent Indemnified Person&#146;s right to recover any Losses out of the Escrow Fund or the Option
Indemnity Holdback or by way of offset against any 2008 Earnout Consideration or 2009 Earnout
Consideration as set forth in <U>Article&nbsp;VIII</U>, and (ii)&nbsp;shall approve and confirm the
appointment of the Shareholders Representative.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;<U>Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates</U>. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent shall
issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the amount of cash, without
interest, that such Persons would have been entitled to receive had such Person surrendered such
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate to Parent pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;3.1(b)</U>; <I>provided,
however, </I>that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to such payment or
issuance require the purported owner of any such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver
a bond (at such owner&#146;s sole cost and expense) in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent or the Surviving Corporation with
respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if required by California
Law, but only to the extent required thereby, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by holders of such shares of
Company Common Stock, who have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto in
accordance with California Law (the &#147;<U>Dissenting Shares</U>&#148;) shall not be exchangeable for the
right to receive the consideration issuable pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;2.6(c)</U>, and holders of such
shares of Company Common Stock shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of California Law unless and until
such holders fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or lose their rights to appraisal and payment
under California Law. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or
effectively withdraws or loses such right, such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be
treated as if they had been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, at the Effective
Time, the right to receive the consideration issuable pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;2.6(c)</U>, in
accordance with and subject to the provisions of this Agreement, without any interest thereon. The
Company shall give Parent (i)&nbsp;prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, withdrawals of
demands for appraisal and any other related instruments received by the Company and (ii)&nbsp;the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demand.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;To the extent that Parent or the Company makes any payment in respect of any Dissenting
Shares, Parent shall be entitled to recover such amounts as set forth in <U>Article&nbsp;VIII</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;3.3 <U>Withholding Rights</U>. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code, or any
applicable provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law; <I>provided, however</I>, that the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall notify all holders of shares of Company Common
Stock from whom funds are so withheld of the respective amounts of such withholding, except to the
extent such amounts are set forth on the Spreadsheet. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company
Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;3.4 <U>Further Assurances</U>. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and
on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to
take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things
to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right,
title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be
acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

Company shall deliver to Parent and Merger Sub a disclosure schedule with numbered sections
corresponding to the relevant sections in this Agreement (the &#147;<U>Disclosure Schedule</U>&#148;). No
reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter in the Disclosure Schedule shall be
construed as an admission or indication that such item or other matter is material or that such

disclosure in the Disclosure Schedule relating to any possible breach or violation of any

Schedule shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment by the Company, in and of itself,
that such information is material to or outside the ordinary course of the business of the Company

shall delineate the Section or subsection to which it applies but shall also be deemed to qualify

business, free and clear of any Encumbrances, except (i)&nbsp;as reflected in the Balance Sheet,
(ii)&nbsp;Permitted Encumbrances, and (iii)&nbsp;such imperfections of title and encumbrances, if any, which
do not detract materially from the value or interfere materially with the present use of the
property subject thereto or affected thereby. The assets and properties owned, leased or licensed
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are in good condition and repair (subject to normal wear
and tear consistent with the age of the assets and properties).

Certificate</U>&#148;):


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;stating that an Indemnified Person or Shareholder Indemnified Person, as the case may be,
has incurred, paid or properly accrued, or reasonably anticipates that it may incur, pay or
properly accrue, Losses;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;stating the amount of such Losses (which, in the case of Losses not yet incurred, paid or
properly accrued, may be the maximum amount in good faith anticipated to be incurred, paid or
properly accrued); and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;specifying in reasonable detail (based upon the information then possessed by Parent or
the Shareholders Representative, as the case may be) the individual items of such Losses included
in the amount so stated and the nature of the claim to which such Losses are related.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">No delay in or failure to give an Officer&#146;s Certificate by Parent to the Shareholders
Representative or the Escrow Agent, if applicable, or a Claim Certificate by the Shareholders
Representative to the Parent, pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;8.5</U> will adversely affect any of the
other rights or remedies that Parent or any Shareholder Indemnified Person has under this Agreement
or alter or relieve the Indemnifying Shareholders or the Parent Indemnifying Parties of their
obligations to indemnify the Parent Indemnified Persons or the Shareholder Indemnified Persons,
except and to the extent that such delay or failure has materially prejudiced the Indemnifying
Shareholders or Parent Indemnifying Parties, unless Parent shall have failed to deliver the
Officer&#146;s Certificate to the Shareholders Representative, or the Shareholders Representative shall
have failed to deliver the Claim Certificate to the Parent, in each case prior to the applicable
Expiration Date for the representation or warranty, the breach of which gives rise to the claim of
an Loss, as provided in <U>Section&nbsp;8.1</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;8.6 <U>Objections to Claims</U>. The Shareholders Representative may object to any
claim set forth in such Officer&#146;s Certificate, and the Parent may object to any claim set forth in
such Claim Certificate, by delivering written notice to Parent (and, if cash remains in the Escrow
Fund and it is prior to the Escrow Claim Period Expiration Date, to the Escrow Agent) of the
Shareholders Representative&#146;s objection or by delivering written notice to the Shareholders
Representative of the Parent&#146;s objection, as the case may be (an &#147;<U>Objection Notice</U>&#148;). The
person delivering the Objection Notice is referred to herein as the &#147;<U>Objecting Party</U>&#148; and
the person submitting the Officer&#146;s Certificate or the Claim Certificate in respect of which the
Objection Notice is delivered is referred to herein as the &#147;<U>Claiming Party</U>.&#148; Such
Objection Notice must describe the grounds for such objection in reasonable detail. If an
Objection Notice is not delivered by the Shareholders Representative to Parent, or by the Parent to
the Shareholders Representative, within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after delivery by Parent of the Officer&#146;s
Certificate or delivery by the Shareholders Representative of the Claim Certificate, as the case
may be (the &#147;<U>Objection Period</U>&#148;), such failure to so object shall be an irrevocable
acknowledgment by the Shareholders Representative or the Parent, as the case may be, that the
Parent Indemnified Persons or the Shareholder Indemnified Persons, as the case may be, are entitled
to indemnification under <U>Section&nbsp;8.2</U> for the full amount of the Losses set forth in such
Officer&#146;s Certificate or Claim Certificate.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;8.7 <U>Resolution of Objections to Claims</U>. If an Objecting Party shall deliver
an Objection Notice, the Claiming Party shall have thirty (30)&nbsp;days after its receipt of the
Objection Notice to respond in a written statement to such objection.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;If after such 30-day period there remains a dispute as to any claims, the Objecting Party
and Claiming Party shall attempt in good faith for twenty (20)&nbsp;days thereafter to agree upon the
rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation, the Objecting Party and
Claiming Party shall appoint within ten (10)&nbsp;days after the expiration of such 20-day period an
impartial mediator to hold a one-day mediation in Los Angeles, California as soon as practicable.
The Company and Parent shall each bear one half of the cost of the mediator. In the event that the
parties cannot mutually agree within ten (10)&nbsp;days on a mutual mediator, any party may seek
appointment of a mediator by a court of competent jurisdiction.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;If no agreement can be reached after good faith mediation, the Objecting Party shall have
the option of demanding arbitration under <U>Section&nbsp;10.14</U> within sixty (60)&nbsp;days after the
delivery of the Objection Notice, and if such option is so exercised within such 60-day period, the
arbitration provisions of <U>Section&nbsp;10.14</U> shall be followed and the decision of the
arbitrator regarding such claim shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement;
it being understood that, if no such agreement can be reached after good faith mediation and the
Objecting Party fails to demand arbitration under <U>Section&nbsp;10.14</U> with respect to such claims
within such 60-day period, then the Objection Notice and all claims thereunder shall be deemed to
be withdrawn by the Objecting Party and the Objecting Party shall not thereafter assert any such
claims that are mentioned in whole or in part within the Objection Notice.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;8.8 <U>Payment of Claims</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;If no Objection Notice is delivered by the Shareholders Representative or Parent, as the
case may be, within the Objection Period, or if an Objection Notice is delivered by the
Shareholders Representative or Parent, as the case may be, within the Objection Period, but such
Objection Notice is only with respect to a portion of the Losses stated in the applicable Officer&#146;s
Certificate or Claim Notice:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(i)&nbsp;On the 31st day following the Escrow Agent&#146;s and the Shareholders Representative&#146;s receipt
of an Officer&#146;s Certificate, (A)&nbsp;the Escrow Agent shall release to Parent as soon as practicable
out of the Escrow Fund, to the extent cash remains therein, and (B)&nbsp;Parent shall permanently retain
for its own benefit out of the Option Indemnity Holdback, to the extent any portion remains,
together, pro rata as between the Escrow Fund and the Option Indemnity Holdback, an amount of cash
equal to (I)&nbsp;the amount of the Losses set forth in the Officer&#146;s Certificate, if no Objection
Notice was delivered by the Shareholders Representative or (II)&nbsp;the amount of the portion of the
Losses set forth in such Officer&#146;s Certificate to which no objection was made, if an Objection
Notice was delivered by the Shareholders Representative; <I>provided</I>, <I>however</I>, that, to the extent
that such Losses have not then been incurred or paid by such Parent Indemnified Person, Parent (on
behalf of itself or any other Parent Indemnified Person) shall not be so entitled to receive, and
the Escrow Agent shall not deliver, and Parent shall not permanently retain, funds in respect
thereof unless and until such Losses are actually incurred or paid by such Parent Indemnified
Person.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(ii)&nbsp;On the 31st day following the Parent&#146;s receipt of a Claim Certificate, the Shareholders
Representative shall deliver a notice to Parent notifying the Parent of Parent&#146;s obligation under
this Agreement to pay to the Shareholder Indemnified Person or Persons in cash an amount equal to
(A)&nbsp;the amount of the Losses set forth in the Claim Certificate, if no Objection Notice was
delivered by the Parent or (B)&nbsp;the amount of the portion of the Losses set forth in the Claim
Certificate to which no objection was made, if an Objection Notice was delivered by the Parent, and
the Parent shall deliver such amount of cash to the Shareholders Representative within seven (7)
days of receipt of such notice.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;If an Objection Notice is delivered by the Shareholders Representative within the
Objection Period or an Objection Notice is delivered by the Parent within the Objection Period:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(i)&nbsp;If an agreement between the Objecting Party and the Claiming Party is reached in
accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;8.7(a)</U>, the Shareholders Representative and Parent shall each
execute a memorandum setting forth their agreement, which, if Parent is the Claiming Party, shall
be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such
memorandum and shall distribute any cash then remaining in the Escrow Fund in accordance with the
terms thereof and Parent shall permanently retain for its own benefit any portion of the Option
Indemnity Holdback in accordance with the terms thereof. If the Claiming Party is the Shareholders
Representative, the Parent Indemnifying Parties shall make payments in accordance with the terms of
the memorandum.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(ii)&nbsp;If an agreement is reached through mediation in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;8.7(b)</U>,
the Shareholders Representative and Parent shall each execute a memorandum setting forth their
agreement, which, if the Parent is the Claiming Party, shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and shall distribute any cash then
remaining in the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms thereof and Parent shall permanently
retain for its own benefit any portion of the Option Indemnity Holdback in accordance with the
terms thereof. If the Claiming Party is the Shareholders Representative, the Parent Indemnifying
Parties shall make payments in accordance with the terms of the memorandum.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(iii)&nbsp;If a determination is made through arbitration in accordance with
<U>Section&nbsp;8.7(c)</U>, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act in accordance with the decision
of the arbitrator, and make or withhold payments out of the Escrow Fund in accordance therewith
(and Parent shall permanently retain for its own benefit or make payments of any portion of the
Option Indemnity Holdback in accordance with the terms thereof), and the Parent Indemnifying
Parties shall make payments in accordance with the decision of the arbitrator, as the case may be.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;8.9 <U>Third Party Claims</U>. If Parent becomes aware of a third-party claim which
Parent believes may result in a claim for indemnification in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;8.2(a)</U>
by or on behalf of a Parent Indemnified Person, Parent shall promptly notify the Shareholders
Representative of such third-party claim, and provide the Shareholders Representative the
opportunity to participate, subject to the control of Parent, at its own cost in any defense of
such claim. Parent shall not settle any such claim without the prior written consent of the
Shareholders Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If the Shareholders
Representative consents to any such settlement, neither the Shareholders Representative nor any
shareholder of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall have any power or
authority to object to the amount or validity of any claim by or on behalf of any Parent
Indemnified Person for indemnity with respect to such settlement.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;10.8 <U>Assignment</U>. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
parties to this Agreement (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties to this Agreement, and any purported assignment or other transfer
without such consent shall be void and unenforceable. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties to this
Agreement and their respective successors and assigns.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;10.9 <U>Waivers and Amendments</U>. This Agreement may be amended or modified only
by a written instrument executed by all of the parties to this Agreement. Any failure of the
parties to this Agreement to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition in this
Agreement may be waived by the party entitled to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument
signed by the party granting such waiver. No delay on the part of any party to this Agreement in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
waiver on the part of any party to this Agreement of any right, power or privilege hereunder
operate as a waiver of any other right, power or privilege hereunder, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder. Unless otherwise
provided, the rights and remedies provided for in this Agreement are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies which the parties to this Agreement may otherwise have at law
or in equity. Whenever this Agreement requires or permits consent by or on behalf of a party, such
consent shall be given in writing in a manner consistent with the requirements for a waiver of
compliance as set forth in this <U>Section&nbsp;10.9</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;10.10 <U>Equitable Remedies</U>. Each of the parties to this Agreement acknowledges
and agrees that the other parties to this Agreement would be irreparably damaged in the event that
any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or otherwise are breached. Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, each of the parties to this Agreement hereby agrees that the other parties
to this Agreement shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of any of
the terms or provisions of this Agreement, and to enforce specifically the performance by such
first party under this Agreement, and each party to this Agreement hereby agrees to waive the
defense in any such suit that the other parties to this Agreement have an adequate remedy at law
and to interpose no opposition, legal or otherwise, as to the propriety of injunction or specific
performance as a remedy, and hereby agrees to waive any requirement to post any bond in connection
with obtaining such relief. The equitable remedies described in this <U>Section&nbsp;10.10</U> shall
be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies at law or in equity that the parties to
this Agreement may elect to pursue. The parties to this Agreement hereby agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event any of the terms or provision of this Agreement required to be
performed prior to the Effective Time are not performed in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and that, prior to the Effective Time, the parties to this Agreement shall be entitled to
specific performance of the terms of this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy at law or in
equity.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;10.11 <U>Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction</U>. This Agreement shall be

conflicts of laws provisions. Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submits, for itself and its assets and properties, to the exclusive jurisdiction of
any California State court, or federal court of the United States of America, sitting within the
State of California, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding

this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or for recognition or
enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the parties to this Agreement hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally (i)&nbsp;agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding prior to
the Effective Time (or after the Effective Time if specific performance is sought) except in such
courts; (ii)&nbsp;agrees that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding prior to the
Effective Time (or after the Effective Time if specific performance is sought) may be heard and
determined in such California State court or, to the extent permitted by Law, in such Federal

which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding prior to
the Effective Time (or after the Effective Time if specific performance is sought) in any such
California State or Federal court; and (iv)&nbsp;waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding prior to the

representative to act on behalf of the holders of Company Common Stock for certain limited purposes
(the &#147;<U>Shareholders Representative</U>&#148;). The parties have designated Talmadge O&#146;Neill as the
initial Shareholders Representative, and approval of this Agreement by the holders of Company
Common Stock shall constitute ratification and approval of such designation by the holders of
Company Common Stock, and agreement by the holders of Company Common Stock to reimburse the
Shareholders Representative for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances (including fees
and disbursements of his counsel, experts and other agents and consultants) incurred by the

defense of claims. The Shareholders Representative hereby accepts such appointment. The
Shareholders Representative may resign at any time, and the Shareholders Representative may be
removed by the vote of Persons that collectively held shares constituting more than a majority of
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time
(&#147;<U>Majority Holders</U>&#148;). In the event that the Shareholders Representative has resigned or
been removed, a new Shareholders Representative shall be appointed by the Majority Holders, such
appointment to become effective upon the written acceptance thereof by the new Shareholders
Representative.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;<U>Authority and Liability</U>. The Shareholders Representative shall have such powers
and authority as are necessary to carry out the functions assigned to the Shareholders
Representative under this Agreement; <I>provided</I>, <I>however</I>, that the Shareholders Representative shall

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(ii)&nbsp;authorize deliveries to Parent of cash or other property from the Escrow Fund and the
Option Indemnity Holdback in satisfaction of claims asserted by Parent (on behalf of itself or any
other Parent Indemnified Person, including by not objecting to such claims);


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(iii)&nbsp;object to such claims in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;8.6</U>;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(iv)&nbsp;consent or agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand

to, such claims;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(v)&nbsp;consent or agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand
arbitration and comply with orders of courts with respect to, disputes; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(vi)&nbsp;take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Shareholders
Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing, including retaining counsel, accountants
and other advisors, in each case without having to seek or obtain the consent of any Person under
any circumstance.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">The Shareholders Representative shall be the sole and exclusive means of asserting or addressing
any of the above and no former shareholder shall have any right to act on its own behalf with
respect to any such matters, other than any claim or dispute against the Shareholders
Representative. The Shareholders Representative shall have no liability to Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or the holders of Company Common Stock with respect to actions
taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as Shareholders Representative, except with respect to
the Shareholders Representative&#146;s gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Shareholders
Representative shall at all times be entitled to rely on any directions received from the Majority
Holders; <I>provided</I>, <I>however</I>, that the Shareholders Representative shall not be required to follow
any such direction, and shall be under no obligation to take any action in its capacity as
Shareholders Representative, unless the Shareholders Representative is holding funds delivered to
him under this <U>Section&nbsp;10.13(b)</U> and/or has been provided with other funds, security or
indemnities which, in the sole determination of the Shareholders Representative, are sufficient to
protect the Shareholders Representative against the Losses which may be incurred by the
Shareholders Representative in responding to such direction or taking such action. The
Shareholders Representative shall be entitled to engage such counsel, experts and other agents and
consultants as he shall deem necessary in connection with exercising his powers and performing his
function hereunder and (in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Shareholders Representative)

forth below) of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services as amended from time to time and as
modified in this <U>Section&nbsp;10.15</U>. Within ten (10)&nbsp;days after filing demand for arbitration,
the parties shall agree on one neutral arbitrator. If the parties cannot agree within such time
then any party may seek an order from a court of competent jurisdiction in California appointing
such an arbitrator.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;The arbitration shall take place in Los Angeles, California and shall be the exclusive
forum for resolving such disputes, controversies or claims. The arbitrator shall have the power to
order hearings and meetings to be held in such place or places as he or she deems in the interests
of reducing the total cost to the parties of the arbitration.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;The arbitration shall be held before a single arbitrator, who shall be required to issue a
written decision which decides the issues brought before the arbitrator in accordance with the law
governing this Agreement. The arbitrator shall have the power to order equitable remedies. The
arbitrator may hear and rule on dispositive motions as part of the arbitration proceeding (e.g.
motions for summary disposition).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;The arbitrator may appoint an expert only with the consent of all of the parties to the
arbitration.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(e)&nbsp;The arbitrator&#146;s fees and the administrative expenses of the arbitration shall be paid
equally by the parties. Each party to the arbitration shall pay its own costs and expenses
(including attorney&#146;s fees) in connection with the arbitration.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(f)&nbsp;The award rendered by the arbitrator shall be executory, final and binding on the parties.
The award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered into any court having jurisdiction, or
application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of the award and an order of
enforcement, as the case may be. Such court proceeding shall disclose only the minimum amount of
information concerning the arbitration as is required to obtain such acceptance or order.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(g)&nbsp;Except as required by law, the arbitration proceedings and decision shall be confidential.
Neither any party nor the arbitrator may disclose the existence, content or results of an
arbitration brought in accordance with this Agreement, or any portion of the record, or any
evidence or pleadings.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(h)&nbsp;Each party to this Agreement hereby agrees that in connection with any such action process
may be served in the same manner as notices may be delivered under <U>Section&nbsp;10.4</U> and
irrevocably waives any defenses it may have to service in such manner.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;10.15 <U>Counterparts</U>. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall be
considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed
by each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties hereto, it being understood that
all parties hereto need not sign the same counterpart. The exchange of a fully executed Agreement
(in counterparts or otherwise) by facsimile or by electronic delivery in PDF format shall be
sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
