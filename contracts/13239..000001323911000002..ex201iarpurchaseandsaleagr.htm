1.7 Assignment of Contracts and Rights.



(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Agreement shall not
constitute an agreement to assign any Purchased Asset or any rights thereunder if (a) an attempted assignment,
without the consent of a third party (each, an "Assignment Consent"), would
constitute a breach or adversely affect the rights of the Buyer, the Seller or
any Selling Subsidiary thereunder, and (b) the Seller has failed to obtain
such Assignment Consent, despite commercially reasonable efforts to do so
(each such Purchased Asset or right, a "Non-Assignable Asset"). For a period
of up to twelve (12) months after the Closing, the Seller shall continue to
use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all Assignment Consents
necessary to transfer all Non-Assignable Assets as soon as practicable, and to
the extent that and as long as an Assignment Consent cannot be obtained, the
Seller or the Selling Subsidiary, as applicable, will retain the relevant Non-
Assignable Asset and all associated Liabilities; provided, that the Seller,
the Selling Subsidiaries and the Buyer will otherwise behave and treat each
other as if the transfer or assignment had effectively taken place on the
Closing Date. In particular, (i) the Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries will
follow the Buyer\'s reasonable instructions regarding the exercise of any
rights with respect to each Non-Assignable Asset, (ii) the Buyer shall
indemnify the Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries against any and all
Liabilities associated with each Non-Assignable Asset, (iii) the Seller and
the Selling Subsidiaries shall apply the standard of care of a prudent
businessman with respect to each Non-Assignable Asset, (iv) the Buyer shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to assist the Seller and the Selling
Subsidiaries in performance of any obligations arising from each Non-
Assignable Asset if such assistance is requested by the Seller or the Selling
Subsidiaries, and (v) the Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries shall pass on to
the Buyer all net benefits arising from each Non-Assignable Asset.



(b) Subject to Section 1.7(a), the Parties recognize and acknowledge that
certain Business Contracts relate to both the supply of raw materials and
supplies to the Business and the supply of raw materials and supplies to other
businesses of the Seller and its Affiliates. The Seller will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to amend any such Business Contract to
delineate the rights and obligations related to the Business and to provide
for assignment of those rights to the Buyer or, in the event that the Seller
is unable to amend any such Business Contract prior to the Closing, the Seller
shall assign such Business Contract to Holdco at Closing and then Holdco
shall, and the Buyer shall cause Holdco to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to make the components of such Business Contract that are not related
to the Business available to the Seller and its Affiliates following the
Closing for the duration of such Business Contract (including any extensions
of the term thereof).



1.8 Subsidiary Involvement. It is understood by the Parties that the Seller
conducts a portion of the Business through and in conjunction with the Selling
Subsidiaries. To the extent any of the Purchased Assets are owned by or in the
possession of a Selling Subsidiary, then the Seller, on behalf of itself and
the appropriate Selling Subsidiary, shall take or cause to be taken all such
actions as may be necessary to cause such Purchased Assets to be conveyed to
the applicable Acquired Subsidiary prior to the Closing.



Article II

Purchase Price

2.1 Purchase Price. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
(including adjustments to the Purchase Price described in this Article II),
the aggregate purchase price for the capital stock of Holdco shall be an
amount equal to (a) the Initial Consideration, plus or minus (b) the Final
Working Capital Adjustment Amount, if any, plus (c) the Final Transferred
Cash, if any, minus (d) the Final Transferred Indebtedness, if any, minus (e)
the Final Transferred Plan Liability, in each case as determined pursuant to
Section 2.5 (the "Purchase Price"). The Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the Purchase Price such amounts, if any, as may be required to
be deducted or withheld therefrom under any applicable provision of U.S.
federal, state, local or foreign Tax law, and such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Seller
as part of the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the
Parties acknowledge that no amount of Tax is expected to be withheld from the
Purchase Price based upon the facts and Law as in effect on the date of this
Agreement. In the event the Buyer shall determine that Tax withholding is
required based upon a change in Law or facts occurring subsequent to the date
of this Agreement, the Buyer shall deliver notice to the Seller of any amounts
the Buyer intends to withhold and the provision of U.S. federal, state or
local or foreign Tax law pursuant to which such withholding is required not
less than ten (10) days before the relevant payment; provided, that any
failure by the Buyer to timely deliver such notice shall in no way limit or
otherwise adversely affect the right of the Buyer to deduct and withhold any
such amounts.



2.2 Closing Date Payments. On the Closing Date, the Buyer shall pay or cause
to be paid to the Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds (in
U.S. dollars) to an account or accounts designated by the Seller to the Buyer
at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, an amount (the
"Closing Date Payment") equal to: (a) the Initial Consideration; plus or minus
(b) the Preliminary Adjustment Amount (as defined below); plus (c) $500,000 as
reimbursement for the Seller\'s costs and expenses in connection with the Pre-
Closing Restructuring payable at the Closing pursuant to Section 6.4; plus (d)
$750,000 as payment of the initial set-up fee in connection with the IT
Services (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall satisfy the Buyer\'s
obligation to pay such amount under the Transitional Services Agreement).



2.3 Preliminary Adjustment Statement and Preliminary Purchase Price
Adjustment.

(o)The Seller shall prepare and deliver to the Buyer no earlier than ten (10)
calendar days, and no later than five (5) Business Days, prior to the Closing
Date, estimates of each of (i) the Transferred Working Capital, (ii) the
Transferred Cash and Transferred Indebtedness, and (iii) the Transferred Plan Liability
(the "Preliminary Working Capital Statement", the "Preliminary
Cash/Indebtedness Statement" and the "Preliminary Plan Liability Statement",
respectively, and together, the "Preliminary Adjustment Statement"). Each of
the Preliminary Working Capital Statement, the Preliminary Cash/Indebtedness
Statement and the Preliminary Plan Liability Statement shall be prepared in
accordance with the Financial Statements and with accounting policies,
principles, practices and procedures used in the preparation thereof. The
Preliminary Adjustment Statement shall be used solely to compute the Closing
Date Payment. "Preliminary Adjustment Amount" means an amount equal to (i) the
Estimated Working Capital Adjustment Amount, minus (ii) the Estimated
Transferred Indebtedness, plus (iii) the Estimated Transferred Cash, minus
(iv) the Estimated Transferred Plan Liability. If the Preliminary Adjustment
Amount is a positive number, the Closing Date Payment shall be increased by
such amount, and if the Preliminary Adjustment Amount is a negative number,
the Closing Date Payment shall be decreased by the absolute value of such
amount.



2.4 Final Purchase Price Adjustment. After the Closing, the Seller shall
prepare the Final Adjustment Statement and the Parties shall determine the
Final Transferred Working Capital, the Final Transferred Cash, the Final
Transferred Indebtedness and the Final Transferred Plan Liability in
accordance with Section 2.5. If, pursuant to the Final Adjustment Statement:



(a) the Final Adjustment Amount is a negative number, the Seller shall pay the
absolute value of the Final Adjustment Amount to the Buyer within five (5)
Business Days after and excluding the day on which the Final Adjustment Amount
has been agreed or determined in accordance with Section 2.5, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds pursuant to written instructions delivered by
the Buyer to the Seller in writing not less than three (3) Business Days prior
to the expiration of the before-mentioned five (5) Business Day period; and



(p)the Final Adjustment Amount is a positive number, the Buyer shall pay the
Final Adjustment Amount to the Seller within five (5) Business Days after and
excluding the day on which the Final Adjustment Amount has been agreed or
determined in accordance with Section 2.5, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds pursuant to written instructions delivered by the Seller to
the Buyer in writing not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the
expiration of the before-mentioned five (5) Business Day period.



2.5 Final Adjustment Statement.



(a) The Seller shall prepare and deliver to the Buyer promptly after the
Closing, and in any event within sixty (60) calendar days after and excluding
the Closing Date, statements of each of (i) the Transferred Working Capital,
(ii) the Transferred Cash and Transferred Indebtedness, and (iii) the
Transferred Plan Liability (as such statements may be adjusted following
resolution of any disputes in accordance with this Section 2.5, the "Final
Working Capital Statement", the "Final Cash/Indebtedness Statement" and the
"Final Plan Liability Statement", respectively, and together, the "Final
Adjustment Statement").



(b) Each of the Final Working Capital Statement, the Final Cash/Indebtedness
Statement and the Final Plan Liability Statement shall be prepared in
accordance with the Financial Statements and with accounting policies,
principles, practices and procedures used in the preparation thereof. Upon the
Seller\'s reasonable request, the Buyer shall authorize and permit the Seller
to have reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable
notice, to (i) the Purchased Assets, (ii) the properties, books and records
relating to the Business and transferred pursuant to this Agreement, and (iii)
the officers and other employees of the Buyer and its Affiliates, in each
case, to the extent reasonably necessary or appropriate for the preparation of
the Final Adjustment Statement or relating to any dispute regarding the Final
Adjustment Statement or any component thereof. In preparing the inventory
component of the Final Working Capital Statement, the Buyer and the Seller
shall each cause its Representatives to jointly take a physical inventory of
the Business (including consigned and off-site inventory) at a time to be
mutually agreed between the Parties not less than five (5) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date.



(c) The Buyer shall be entitled to review, and/or have reviewed by its
advisors, the Final Adjustment Statement, and the Seller shall respond to any
reasonable inquiries from the Buyer and its advisors with respect to the Final
Adjustment Statement and its preparation and shall promptly provide any
supporting documentation used in the preparation of the Final Adjustment
Statement that is reasonably requested by the Buyer and its advisors. Within
twenty (20) Business Days following and excluding the date of submission of
the Final Adjustment Statement, the Buyer may elect to:

(i)confirm in writing to the Seller that it agrees that (i) the Final Working
Capital Statement identifies correctly the Transferred Working Capital, (ii)
the Final Cash/Indebtedness Statement identifies correctly the Transferred
Cash and Transferred Indebtedness and (iii) the Final Plan Liability Statement
identifies correctly the Transferred Plan Liability; or

(ii)give notice to the Seller ("Disagreement Notice") setting out in
reasonable detail any item that the Buyer wishes to dispute (together, the
"Disputed Items") and the reasons for the dispute and the Buyer\'s proposed
adjustment to each Disputed Item; provided, that the Buyer may serve a
Disagreement Notice only if the aggregate amount of the proposed adjustments
would result in a change to the Final Adjustment Amount equal to or more than
$50,000. (d) If the Buyer confirms in writing in accordance with Section 2.5(c)(i) that
it agrees with the Final Adjustment Statement, or if the Buyer fails to give a
Disagreement Notice as set forth above within the twenty (20) Business Day
period referred to in Section 2.5(c)(ii), the Final Adjustment Statement shall
be final and binding on the Parties for the purpose of this Agreement;
provided, that any such amounts not specifically disputed in the Disagreement
Notice shall be deemed final and binding upon the Parties for purposes of this
Agreement upon the delivery of the Disagreement Notice.



(e) If the Buyer serves a Disagreement Notice, the Parties shall resolve the
Disputed Items as follows:

(i)The Seller and the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
attempt to resolve the Disputed Items by negotiation between their
Representatives within sixty (60) calendar days after and excluding the date
of receipt of the Disagreement Notice ("Resolution Period") by the Seller.



(ii) If the Seller and the Buyer fail to agree upon the Disputed Items raised
in the Disagreement Notice within the Resolution Period, either the Seller or
the Buyer may demand within a period of ten (10) Business Days following the
expiration of the Resolution Period that Deloitte and Touche LLP ("Final
Auditor") determine, with binding effect for the Parties, how the Disputed
Items not already agreed upon between the Seller and the Buyer shall be
settled in accordance with the Financial Statements and with accounting
policies, principles, practices and procedures consistent with past practice
as employed by the Selling Parties.

(iii) The Final Auditor shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator.
The Final Auditor shall determine any dispute to the extent relevant to
resolving the Disputed Items which may include any issue involving the
interpretation of any provision of this Agreement or the Final Auditor\'s
terms of reference. The Final Auditor\'s activities and jurisdiction shall be
limited to the Disputed Items. The Final Auditor\'s written decision on the
matters shall be final and binding on the Parties in the absence of manifest
error or fraud.



(iv) Seller and the Buyer shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Final Auditor to resolve the Disputed Items as promptly as
practicable, but in any event within a period of thirty (30) Business Days
following the date on which the Final Auditor was appointed. The Buyer shall
authorize and permit the Final Auditor to have reasonable access during normal
business hours, upon reasonable notice, to (A) the Purchased Assets, (B) the

and other employees of the Buyer and its Affiliates, in each case, to the
extent reasonably necessary or appropriate in connection with the resolution
of the Disputed Items. The Seller and its Affiliates shall authorize and
permit the Final Auditor to have reasonable access during normal business
hours, upon reasonable notice, to (x) the properties, books and records
relating to the Business and transferred pursuant to this Agreement and (y)

case, to the extent reasonably necessary or appropriate in connection with the
resolution of the Disputed Items.



(v) The terms "Final Transferred Working Capital", "Final Transferred
Cash", "Final Transferred Indebtedness" and "Final Transferred Plan Liability"
shall mean the Transferred Working Capital, Transferred Cash, Transferred
Indebtedness and Transferred Plan Liability, in each case, as agreed to (or
deemed to be agreed to) by the Seller and the Buyer in accordance with the
terms of Section 2.5(d) or resulting from the determinations made by the Final
Auditor in accordance with this Section 2.5(e) (in addition to those items
theretofore agreed to by the Seller and the Buyer).



(f) The Seller and the Buyer shall each bear its own costs in relation to the
Final Auditor. The Final Auditor\'s fees and any costs properly incurred in

appointed by the Final Auditor) shall be borne by the Parties in inverse
proportion to their respective gain and loss positions relative to the
Disputed Items.



(g) The "Final Adjustment Amount" shall mean an amount equal to (i) the Final
Transferred Working Capital (as determined above) less the Estimated
Transferred Working Capital, minus (ii) the Final Transferred Indebtedness (as

allocation on the basis of the Adjustment Statement promptly upon it becoming

and as of the Closing Date that:

the extent such concepts are recognized in the applicable jurisdiction) under
the Laws of the jurisdiction in which it was incorporated or formed and has
(or, in the case of the New Subsidiaries, will have as of the Closing Date)
all requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
to carry on, in all material respects, the Business as now being (or, in the
case of the New Subsidiaries, as will be as of the Closing Date) conducted by
it. No bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings are pending with respect to any
Selling Party, nor are, to the Knowledge of the Seller, such proceedings
threatened with respect to Holdco, any Selling Party or any Acquired
Subsidiary.



4.2 Corporate Authorization. The Seller and each Selling Subsidiary have all
requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and each
other Transaction Document to be executed by the Seller, and, if applicable,
by such Selling Subsidiary, and to perform its and their obligations
contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution, delivery and performance by
the Seller of this Agreement and each other Transaction Document to which it
is a party, and the execution, delivery and performance by each other Selling
Party of each of the Transaction Documents to which they will be a party, have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the
Seller and by the equivalent thereof on the part of each other Selling Party.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Seller and
(assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the Buyer)
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Seller, enforceable

principles of general applicability (the "Enforceability Exceptions"). Each of
the Transaction Documents will be, on or prior to the Closing Date, duly
executed and delivered by, as applicable, the Seller and/or the other Selling
Party(ies) thereto and (assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery
thereof by the Buyer), each of the Transaction Documents when so executed and
delivered will constitute, legal, valid and binding obligations of, as

enforceable against them in accordance with their respective terms, subject to
the Enforceability Exceptions.

and the Selling Subsidiaries of the other Transaction Documents to which they

(or, in the case of the New Subsidiaries, will not as of the Closing Date),

Subsidiaries, will not as of the Closing Date) or (z) result in a violation or
breach of any of the provisions of any Business Contract, give any Person the
right to declare a default or exercise any remedy under any Business Contract,
give any Person the right to accelerate the maturity or performance of any
Business Contract or give any Person the right to cancel, terminate or modify

Contract which would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

(q)The Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries have as of the date hereof and will
have as of immediately prior to the consummation of the Pre-Closing
Restructuring good and valid title to, and the valid and enforceable power and
full right to use and transfer to one or more of the Acquired Subsidiaries, as
applicable, each of the Purchased Assets, and the Purchased Assets are free
and clear of all Liens of any kind or nature whatsoever, except for Permitted
Liens. The delivery by the Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries to the Acquired
Subsidiaries of the instruments of transfer of ownership contemplated by this
Agreement will vest in the Acquired Subsidiaries good and valid title to the
Purchased Assets, free and clear of all Liens of any kind or nature
whatsoever, except for Permitted Liens.

(r)As of the Closing, the Acquired Subsidiaries will have good and valid title
to, and the valid and enforceable power and right to use, each of the

Purchased Assets, which list is true, correct and complete in all material
respects. All fixed assets included in the Purchased Assets are in good
working order, repair and condition for their use in the Business, ordinary
wear and tear excepted, and have been properly maintained for such use. None
of such fixed assets have any material defects or are in need of maintenance
or repair, except for ordinary wear and tear and routine maintenance and
repairs.



4.5 Capitalization; Equity Structure.



(a) As of the Closing, all of the authorized and outstanding capital stock of
Holdco shall have been duly authorized and validly issued and will be fully

Holdco; or (ii) options, rights of first offer or refusal, redemption or
repurchase rights, or other rights in favor of third parties to acquire any

each of the Acquired Subsidiaries (or, in the case of the New Subsidiaries,
the capital stock that will be authorized and outstanding as of the Closing
Date). All of the issued and outstanding shares of each of the Acquired
Subsidiaries have been (or, in the case of the New Subsidiaries, will be as of
the Closing Date) duly authorized and validly issued and are (or, in the case
of the New Subsidiaries, will be as of the Closing Date) fully paid and
nonassessable and are owned of record by Holdco or a direct or indirect
Subsidiary of Holdco as indicated on Schedule 4.5(b). There are no outstanding
(i) securities of any of the Acquired Subsidiaries convertible into or

acquire any securities from any of the Acquired Subsidiaries, and there is no
obligation of any of the Acquired Subsidiaries to issue any capital stock,

an equity interest in any other Person.



4.6 Third Party Consents. Schedule 4.6 sets forth each agreement or other
instrument binding upon the Selling Parties requiring a consent or other
action by any Person as a result of the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement, the failure of which to obtain would be reasonably likely to
result in the termination or modification of such agreement or instrument or
any material obligation or Liability being imposed on the Buyer, Holdco or any
Acquired Subsidiary, except such consent or actions that would not be
reasonably expected to be material to the Business if not received or taken by
the Closing Date.

understood that (x) the Due Diligence Materials made available to the Buyer or
its Affiliates or their respective Representatives and (y) the Due Diligence
Recordings do not, directly or indirectly, and shall not be deemed to,
directly or indirectly, contain any representations or warranties of the
Selling Parties or any of their respective Affiliates.







 Article V

Representations and Warranties of the Buyer

The Buyer hereby represents and warrants to the Seller as of the date hereof
and as of the Closing Date that:

5.1 Corporate Existence and Power. The Buyer is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing (to the extent such concepts are recognized in
the applicable jurisdiction) under the Laws of the jurisdiction in which it
was incorporated or formed. No bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings are
pending with respect to the Buyer, nor are, to the Knowledge of the Buyer,
such proceedings threatened with respect to the Buyer.



5.2 Corporate Authorization. The Buyer has all requisite power and authority
to execute and deliver this Agreement and each other Transaction Document to
be executed by the Buyer and to perform its obligations contemplated hereby
and thereby. The execution, delivery and performance by the Buyer of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Transaction have been duly authorized by
all necessary action on the part of the Buyer. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Buyer and (assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery hereof by the Seller) constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Buyer, enforceable against the Buyer in accordance
with its terms, except as limited by the Enforceability Exceptions. Each of
the Transaction Documents will be, on or prior to the Closing Date, duly
executed and delivered by the Buyer and (assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery thereof by the Seller), each of the Transaction
Documents when so executed and delivered will constitute, legal, valid and
binding obligations of the Buyer, enforceable against the Buyer in accordance
with their respective terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.



5.3 No Conflicts. The (i) execution, delivery and performance by the Buyer of
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party, and
(ii) the consummation of the Transaction do not and will not (x) violate the
organizational documents of the Buyer, or (y) violate in any material respect
any applicable Law or Order, subject to receipt of any approvals that are
conditions to Closing.



5.4 Financing. As of the Closing, the Buyer will have sufficient cash,
available lines of credit or other sources of immediately available funds to
enable it to make payment of the Purchase Price and any other amounts to be
paid by it hereunder, and the Buyer\'s commitment hereunder is not subject to
the obtaining of any third party financing.



5.5 Litigation. There is no action, suit, investigation or proceeding pending
against or threatened in writing against or affecting the Buyer before any
court or arbitrator or any Governmental Entity, agency or official which in
any manner challenges or seeks to prevent, enjoin, alter or materially delay
the Transaction.



5.6 HSR Act. Pursuant to the HSR Act, the Ultimate Parent Entity (as defined
in the HSR Act) of the Buyer has determined, or shall have determined by a
date that is not more than sixty (60) days prior to the Closing Date, that the
fair market value of the non-exempt HSR reportable assets to be acquired in
connection with the Transaction does not exceed $63.4 million. This
representation and warranty is made solely for the purpose of determining the
applicability of the HSR Act to the Transaction.



5.7 Brokers. There is no investment banker, broker, finder or other
intermediary which has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of
the Buyer who is entitled to any fee or commission from the Buyer or any of
its Affiliates upon consummation of the Transaction.



5.8 Inspections; No Other Representations. The Buyer is an informed and
sophisticated purchaser, and has engaged expert advisors, experienced in the
evaluation and purchase of property and assets such as the Purchased Assets as
contemplated hereunder. The Buyer has undertaken such investigation and has
been provided with and has evaluated such documents and information as it has
deemed necessary to enable it to make an informed and intelligent decision
with respect to the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement. The
Buyer acknowledges that the Seller has given the Buyer access to the key
Business Employees and key documents and facilities of the Business. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Buyer acknowledges that the
Seller makes no representation or warranty with respect to any projections,
estimates or budgets delivered to or made available to the Buyer of future
revenues, future results of operations (or any component thereof), future cash
flows or future financial condition (or any component thereof) of the Business
or the future business and operations of the Business.



5.9 Investment Intent. The Buyer is acquiring the Purchased Assets hereunder
for its own account (or for the account of designated Subsidiaries of the
Buyer), not as a nominee or agent, for investment and not with a view to the
distribution thereof in violation of any applicable securities Law.



5.10 Arm\'s Length Negotiations. Before executing this Agreement,



(ab)the Buyer has fully informed itself of the terms, contents, conditions and
effects of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents;



(ac)the Buyer has relied solely and completely upon its own judgment in
executing this Agreement; and



(ad)the Buyer has had the opportunity to seek and has obtained the advice of
counsel before executing this Agreement.



Article VI

Covenants and Agreements

6.1 Access. Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, subject to
applicable Laws and as reasonably necessary to preserve attorney-client
privilege, the Seller shall authorize and permit the Buyer and its

reasonable notice and in such manner as will not unreasonably interfere with
the conduct of the Business or the other businesses of the Seller or the
Selling Subsidiaries, to (i) properties, books and records relating to the
Business as the Buyer may from time to time reasonably request (including any
Tax Returns and related records relating to Holdco or the Acquired
Subsidiaries and any non-income Tax Returns and related records otherwise

the Business, in each case, to the extent reasonably necessary or appropriate
for the purpose of (x) fulfilling the conditions of purchase set forth in

Buyer\'s operations, and (z) conducting a Phase I Environmental Site
Assessment (ASTM 1527-05) of the Owned Real Property in the United States.

Closing Date, the Seller shall, and shall cause the other Selling Parties to,
conduct the Business in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve intact the
business organizations and relationships with third parties and to keep
available the services of the present Business Employees. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, except as disclosed on Schedule 6.2 or as
expressly contemplated by the Pre-Closing Restructuring, from the date hereof
until the Closing Date, with respect to the Business, the Seller shall not and
shall ensure that the other Selling Parties do not, without the prior written
consent of the Buyer, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld:



(ae)acquire any assets in excess of $250,000 from any other Person;



(af)sell, lease, license or otherwise dispose of any Purchased Assets in
excess of $250,000 except (i) pursuant to existing Contracts, (ii) capital

the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice;

Acquired Subsidiaries to amend their organizational documents;

acquire any shares of its capital stock or issue any capital stock or any
option, warrant or right relating thereto or any securities convertible into

arrangement or understanding to do any of the foregoing.

For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall
prohibit any of the Selling Parties from declaring, setting aside, making or
paying any dividend or other distribution, payable in cash or otherwise, with
respect to any of its capital stock.

 6.3 Efforts; No Inconsistent Actions.



(a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Seller and the Buyer
shall, and the Seller shall cause each other Selling Party to, cooperate and
use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective the Transaction and to cause the conditions to
each other\'s obligation to close the Transaction as set forth in Article VII
to be satisfied. The Selling Parties and the Buyer shall cooperate with each
other to the extent reasonable in connection with the foregoing.



(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, except for the
filings and notifications made pursuant to applicable Antitrust Laws to which
Section 6.3(c), and not this Section 6.3(b), shall apply, the Seller and the
Buyer shall use their reasonable best efforts to file applications with any
applicable Governmental Entity whose waiver, consent, authorization or
approval is required in connection with the consummation of the Transaction as
promptly as practicable following the date hereof and in any event no later
than ten (10) Business Days following the date hereof. The Seller and the
Buyer shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to obtain any
waiver, consent, authorization or approval required for the Closing, to
respond to any requests for information from a Governmental Entity, and to
contest and resist any Litigation and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that
restricts, prevents or prohibits the consummation of the Transaction. To the
extent permitted by applicable Law, the Seller and the Buyer shall provide the
other the opportunity to make copies of all material correspondence, filings
or communications (or memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between
such Party or its Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental
Entity, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement or the Transaction.
The Selling Parties and the Buyer shall notify and keep the other advised as
to (i) any material communication from any Governmental Entity regarding the
Transaction and (ii) any Litigation pending and known to such Party or, to its
knowledge, threatened, which challenges the Transaction.



(c) As promptly as practicable following the date hereof, the Parties shall
make all filings required under any Antitrust Law. The Buyer and the Seller
shall: (i) cooperate fully with each other and shall furnish to the other such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably
request in connection with its preparation of any filings required under any
Antitrust Law; (ii) keep the other Party reasonably informed of any
communication received by such Party from, or given by such Party to any
Antitrust Authority, and of any communication received or given in connection
with any proceeding by a private party regarding the Transaction; and (iii)
permit the other Party to review and incorporate the other Party\'s reasonable
comments in any communication given by it to any Antitrust Authority or in
connection with any proceeding by a private party related to Antitrust Laws.



(d) The Buyer and the Seller shall each use its reasonable best efforts to
ensure the prompt expiration of any applicable waiting period under any
applicable Antitrust Law and the approval by any relevant Antitrust Authority.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Buyer shall take any and
all action necessary, including (i) selling or otherwise disposing of, or
holding separate and agreeing to sell or otherwise dispose of, assets,
categories of assets or businesses of the Acquired Subsidiaries or the Buyer
or their respective Subsidiaries; (ii) terminating existing relationships,
contractual rights or obligations of the Acquired Subsidiaries or the Buyer or
their respective Subsidiaries; (iii) terminating any venture or other
arrangement; (iv) creating any relationship, contractual rights or obligations
of the Acquired Subsidiaries or the Buyer or their respective Subsidiaries;
(v) effecting any other change or restructuring of the Acquired Subsidiaries
or the Buyer or their respective Subsidiaries; or (vi) any obligation to
undertake, or to refrain from taking, any action (each a "Remedy") to ensure
that no Governmental Entity enters any order, decision, judgment, decree,
ruling, injunction (preliminary or permanent), or establishes any Law, rule,
regulation or other action preliminarily or permanently restraining, enjoining
or prohibiting the consummation of the Transaction (an "Antitrust
Prohibition") or to ensure that no Antitrust Authority with the authority to
clear, authorize or otherwise approve the consummation of the Transaction,
fails to do so by the Expiration Date.



(e) Prior to the Closing, the Seller shall, and shall cause each other Selling
Party to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain (and cooperate with
the Buyer in obtaining) all waivers, consents, Permits, authorizations,
approvals of, and exemptions by, any third party necessary for the
consummation of the Transaction and the satisfaction of conditions set forth
in Sections 7.2(c) and (d), and the Buyer shall provide its reasonable
cooperation in connection with the foregoing.



(f) All documents required to be filed by either of the Parties with any
Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement or the Transaction will
comply in all material respects with the provisions of applicable Law.



6.4 Expenses of Sale. Each of the Selling Parties and the Buyer agree that,
except with respect to the expenses incurred in connection with the Pre-
Closing Restructuring, each of them shall bear its and their own direct and
indirect expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation and preparation
of the Transaction Documents and the consummation and performance of the
Transaction. All transfer, documentary, gross receipts, sales and use Taxes
(collectively, "Transfer Taxes"), other Taxes and similar Liabilities, if any,
resulting from the Transaction and the Closing shall be paid by the Seller.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the Closing, the Buyer shall pay the Seller $500,000 as reimbursement for the
direct and indirect expenses incurred by the Selling Parties in connection
with the preparation of the documents and agreements related to, and the
consummation and performance of, the Pre-Closing Restructuring; provided, that
in the event that this Agreement is terminated for any reason (other than a
termination by the Buyer due to the Seller\'s material breach of this
Agreement), promptly following such termination, the Buyer shall reimburse the
Seller upon the Seller\'s written request (which written request shall include
supporting documentation, such as invoices and receipts) for any direct or
indirect expenses incurred by the Selling Parties prior to the date of such
termination in connection with the preparation of the documents and agreements
related to, and the consummation and performance of, the Pre-Closing
Restructuring and any Transfer Taxes resulting from the Pre-Closing
Restructuring up to an amount not to exceed $500,000. All charges, costs and
fees which result from the filings under applicable Antitrust Laws and in
compliance with other regulatory requirements, including the charges, costs
and fees of the Antitrust Authorities, shall be borne equally by the Seller
and the Buyer.



6.5 Maintenance of Records. The Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries undertake
(i) for a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date (or such longer
periods as may be required by Law), to retain all records (including Tax
Returns) and documents relating to the Business that have not been transferred
at Closing to the Buyer and (ii) to make available to the Buyer for inspection
and copying, at the Buyer\'s sole expense, at reasonable times and upon
request therefor, all such records to the extent not so disposed of. The Buyer
undertakes (i) for a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date (or such
longer periods as may be required by Law), to retain all records and documents
relating to the Business that have been transferred at Closing to the Buyer
and (ii) to make available to the Seller for inspection and copying, at the
Seller\'s sole expense, at reasonable times and upon request therefor, all
such records to the extent not so disposed of.



6.6 Notification of Certain Matters; Supplemental Information.



(a) Each Party shall give prompt notice to the other of (i) the occurrence, or
failure to occur, of any event or the existence of any condition that has
caused or could reasonably be expected to cause any of its representations or
warranties contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect at any time after the date hereof, up to and including the
Closing Date, that reasonably could be expected to prevent the Closing from
occurring and (ii) any failure on its part to comply with or satisfy, in any
material respect, any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement, which failure reasonably could be
expected to prevent the Closing from occurring.



(b) The Seller shall have the right from time to time prior to the Closing to
supplement the Schedules prepared by it with respect to any matter not
existing or, to the extent that a representation or warranty is qualified by a
reference to the Knowledge of the Seller, known as of the date of this
Agreement which, if existing or known by the Seller as of the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in such
Schedule. The Seller shall provide any such supplemental disclosure as
promptly as practicable. In the event that the Seller delivers a supplemental
disclosure within five (5) Business Days of a date which otherwise would have
been the Closing Date, the Buyer shall have the right to delay the Closing in
order to consider and evaluate the impact of such disclosed matter, provided,
however, that unless such disclosure renders a condition set forth in Section
7.2, other than Section 7.2(a), unsatisfied, the Closing shall occur five (5)
Business Days after such date which otherwise would have been the Closing
Date. Any such supplemental disclosure will be deemed to have cured any breach
of any representation or warranty made in this Agreement for purposes of
determining whether or not the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) have
been satisfied as of the Closing Date, but not for purposes of determining
whether or not other conditions set forth in Section 7.2 have been satisfied.
Moreover, such supplemental disclosures will be deemed not to have been
disclosed for purposes of qualifying any of the representations and warranties
made in this Agreement as of the Closing Date for purposes of determining
whether the Buyer and the Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Section 11.1(a) (it being understood that all such
representations and warranties set forth in Article IV (other than any that,
by their terms, are being made as of the date hereof only) are being remade as
of the Closing Date for purposes of Section 11.1(a)).



6.7 Confidentiality; Publicity.



(a) Prior to the Closing Date and after any termination of this Agreement,
each Party (the "Receiving Party") and its Affiliates will hold, and will use
their best efforts to cause their respective Representatives to hold, in
confidence, unless compelled to disclose by judicial or administrative process
or by other requirements of Law, all confidential documents and information
concerning the Business or the other Party or its Affiliates furnished to the
Receiving Party or its Affiliates by the other Party (the "Disclosing Party")
in connection with the Transaction, except to the extent that such information
can be shown to have been (i) previously known on a non-confidential basis by
the Receiving Party, (ii) in the public domain through no fault of the
Receiving Party or (iii) later lawfully acquired by the Receiving Party from
sources other than the Disclosing Party; provided, that the Receiving Party
may disclose such information to its Representatives in connection with the
Transaction so long as such Representatives are informed by the Receiving
Party of the confidential nature of such information and are directed by the
Receiving Party to treat such information confidentially. The Receiving Party
shall be responsible for any failure to treat such information confidentially
by such Persons. If this Agreement is terminated, each Receiving Party and its
Affiliates will, and will use their reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives to, destroy
or deliver to the Disclosing Party all documents and other materials, and all
copies thereof, obtained by the Receiving Party or its Affiliates or on their
behalf from the Disclosing Party or its Affiliates in connection with this
Agreement that are subject to such confidence; provided, that each Receiving
Party may retain one set of such documents and other materials for archival
purposes and use in connection with any dispute arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby.



(b) Except as may be required by Law or by the final decision of a stock
exchange, regulatory agency or other authority, no press or publicity release
or other announcement concerning this Agreement or the Transaction shall be
issued without advance approval of the form and substance thereof by the
Seller and the Buyer; provided, that from and after the date hereof,
discussions may be held with financial institutions for the purpose of opening
bank accounts for the use of the Business following the Closing, customers,
suppliers, employees and other business partners of the Business in accordance
with a communication plan to be separately agreed between the Parties;
provided, further, that the Seller or its Representatives may participate in
any such discussions at the Seller\'s election.



6.8 Further Assurances. From time to time following the Closing, each of the
Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute,
acknowledge and deliver such conveyances, notices, assumptions, releases,
consents, documents and other instruments and papers, and perform such further
acts as may be reasonably required or desirable to carry out the provisions
hereof and the Transaction, including obtaining any Permits, consents,
authorizations, approvals of, or effecting the notification of or filing with,
each Person, whether private or governmental, whose consent or approval is
required in order to permit the consummation of, and to give full effect to,
the Transaction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, in the event that any of the Excluded Assets physically remain at
the Owned Real Property or the Leased Real Property from and after the Closing
(such assets the "Remaining Assets"), then the Buyer shall (i) refrain from
using the Remaining Assets in any manner in connection with the operation of
the Business or for any other purpose (except as contemplated by the
Transaction Documents); (ii) to the extent applicable, treat such Remaining
Assets as "confidential documents and information" subject to Section 6.7
(without giving effect to the first clause of the first sentence thereof); and
(iii) notify the Seller of the Remaining Assets and promptly, at the Seller\'s
election and expense, either (x) destroy such Remaining Assets or (y) at the
Seller\'s sole expense, return such Remaining Assets to the Seller as directed
by the Seller.



6.9 WARN Act. Since January 1, 2008, neither the Seller nor any Selling Party
has taken any action, or series of actions, with respect to the Business
Employees, which action or series of actions constitute, individually or in
the aggregate, a "Plant Closing" or "Mass Layoff" under the Worker Adjustment
and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 2101 et seq. (the "WARN Act") or
any similar local Law. Except as set forth on Schedule 6.9, neither the Seller
nor any Selling Party has involuntarily terminated or reduced by more than
fifty percent (50%) in hours or work the employment of any employee of the
Business during the two (2) full calendar months and the partial month
preceding the date hereof. The Buyer hereby indemnifies the Seller and their
respective Affiliates against, and agrees to hold each of them harmless from,
any and all Liabilities incurred or suffered by the Seller or any of their
respective Affiliates with respect to the WARN Act or any similar state or
local Law arising as a direct result of the Transaction and without regard to
any other employees of Seller not constituting Business Employees. During the
sixty (60) calendar days following the Closing Date, the Buyer shall not take
any action, or series of actions, with respect to the Business Employees,
which action or series of actions constitute, individually or in the
aggregate, a "Plant Closing" or "Mass Layoff" under the WARN Act.



6.10 IT Systems.



(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Seller hereby
grants to the Buyer a non-exclusive, non-transferable (except as set forth in
Section 13.6), perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free (other than as provided
below), fully paid-up (other than as provided below), irrevocable right and
license, under the Seller\'s Intellectual Property, effective as of the
Closing Date, to use, copy, reproduce, modify, perform, display and create
derivative works based on the Custom IT System Components solely for the
internal use of the Buyer, Holdco and the Acquired Subsidiaries in connection
with (i) the conduct of the Business by the Buyer at any of (A) the Owned Real
Properties, (B) the Leased Real Properties, or (C) any other real property
location acquired or leased by Holdco or any Acquired Subsidiary for the
purpose of constructing new facilities or relocating facilities that are
subject to the license granted hereunder immediately prior to such relocation
(collectively, the "Licensed Properties") or (ii) the organic evolution of the
Business following the Closing at the Licensed Properties, in each case,
specifically excluding the conduct of any legacy businesses of the Buyer or
any businesses acquired through acquisition. In full consideration of the
right and license granted under this Section 6.10, in connection with or
promptly following the termination of the IT Services pursuant to the
Transitional Services Agreement, and in any event within five (5) Business
Days of such termination, the Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to the
Seller or its designee, without any right to offset, an amount equal to $1.0
million (which for the avoidance of doubt will be in addition to, and not
included in, the Purchase Price). The right and license granted hereunder
includes the right of the Buyer to have such right and license exercised by a
third party on behalf of and for the sole benefit of the Buyer but is
otherwise non-sub-licensable. The Seller shall deliver the Custom IT System
Components (including (i) the source code of any software included in the Custom IT System Components and all
existing documentation, developers\' notes and similar information relating
thereto and (ii) all tangible embodiments of the Custom IT System Components)
to the Buyer at or prior to the termination of the IT Services provided
pursuant to the Transitional Services Agreement. No fewer than thirty (30)
days prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall also disclose in writing to
the Buyer in reasonable detail the environment required to run the Custom IT
System Components (as currently run by the Seller), including any and all
hardware, software and network requirements. Except as expressly provided in
this Section 6.10, the licenses granted in this Section 6.10 do not permit
Buyer to, and Buyer will not, and will not permit any third parties to: (a)
translate, disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer the Custom IT System
Components; (b) rent, lease, loan, sell, transfer, license, sublicense,
distribute or use the Custom IT System Components in any manner to provide
service bureau or time-sharing services to third parties; (c) alter, remove or
obscure any copyright or other proprietary notices on or in the Custom IT
System Components; and (d) use the Custom IT System Components for any purpose
outside of the Licensed Properties, or with respect to either (x) legacy
businesses of the Buyer or its Affiliates (other than Holdco and the Acquired
Subsidiaries) or (y) businesses of the Buyer or its Affiliates acquired
through acquisition, in each case even if such business operates at the
Licensed Properties. Except for the license and rights expressly granted with
respect to the Custom IT System Components in this Section 6.10, the Seller
owns the entire right, title and interest in and to the Custom IT System
Components, and no other license or right is granted to Buyer, by implication,
estoppel or otherwise under any of Seller\'s Intellectual Property. All source
code and documentation or specifications relating to the Custom IT System
Components will be treated as confidential information of the Seller under
this Agreement, and Buyer\'s obligation to treat the source code as
confidential and not disclose such source code to any third parties will
survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement in perpetuity. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Buyer is required to obtain its own license directly
from SAP or any other third party in order to use any SAP software or any
other third party software to receive the benefits of the Custom IT System
Components, and nothing contained in this Section 6.10 shall be deemed to
require or impose any obligation on the Seller to license to the Buyer or
obtain any license from SAP or any other third party for the Buyer. For
clarity, the Buyer and/or its Affiliates shall own all right, title and
interest (including all Intellectual Property) in and to any and all
modifications and derivatives based on the Custom IP System Components
authored, created or developed by Buyer, Holdco or the Acquired Subsidiaries
hereunder.



(b) From the date hereof until and including the Closing Date, the Parties
shall cooperate and assist each other in good faith to ensure that all
requirements necessary for the performance of the IT Services by the Seller to
the Buyer are met in accordance with the specifications and principles set
forth on Schedule 6.10(b).



6.11 Insurance Coverage. The Buyer is aware that the Business is covered by
group umbrella insurance policies taken out by the Seller and its Affiliates
and that the Business will not be covered by such umbrella insurance policies
after Closing. The Buyer shall undertake measures so that the current umbrella
insurance policies are replaced by other insurance policies for the Business
as per the Closing Date at the latest if and to the extent such umbrella
insurance policies cover the Business. The Seller, the Buyer and the Buyer\'s
insurance broker shall reasonably cooperate to identify such umbrella
insurance policies and to facilitate a smooth replacement thereof on the
Closing Date.



6.12 Intercompany Receivables and Payables. Except as expressly provided in
this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, all receivables or
payables, and any other obligation or agreement of the Business from or to, as
applicable, the Seller, any of the Selling Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Affiliates (other than Holdco and the Acquired Subsidiaries),
including any guarantee by the Seller or any of the Selling Subsidiaries or
their respective Affiliates of any obligations of Holdco or any of the
Acquired Subsidiaries, shall be terminated not later than the Closing.



6.13 Use of the Seller\'s Name and Marks. The Buyer agrees that, as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Closing and, in any event, not later than
six (6) months after the Closing Date: (a) the Buyer shall change the names of
each of the Acquired Subsidiaries listed on Schedule 6.13 to a name that is
not confusingly similar to or containing any of the foregoing names, and
specifically removing the names "Hexion" and/or "Momentive" from the entity\'s
name; (b) the Buyer shall, and shall cause Holdco and the Acquired
Subsidiaries to, cease to use, distribute, display or market any article or
instrument of any kind, including signs, invoices, labels, letterhead,
business cards, packaging, advertisement or websites, that reflects or
includes any logo, trademark, trade name, trade dress, service mark, domain
name or website that is confusingly similar to or containing any name, mark or
logo of the Seller or the Selling Subsidiaries that is not included in
Purchased Assets; and (c) the Buyer shall return or destroy any and all such
articles or instruments in the possession of the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including Holdco and the Acquired Subsidiaries), and (d) the Buyer
shall modify any web site or web page regarding the Business to remove any
such logo, trademark, trade name, trade dress, service mark or domain name.
The Buyer agrees that, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing,
the Buyer shall mark products and other property acquired hereunder, both
internally and externally, with a name and mark that is not confusingly
similar to or containing any name, mark or logo of the Seller or the Selling
Subsidiaries that is not included in the Purchased Assets. The Buyer agrees
that none of the Buyer or any Affiliate of the Buyer shall advertise or hold
itself out as the Seller or an Affiliate thereof. The Buyer agrees that any
use of the Seller\'s names and marks during the transition period provided
under this Section 6.13 shall be substantially consistent with the trademark
practices and quality standards of Seller in its use of such names and marks.
Such use, and all goodwill associated with such use, shall inure to the
benefit of the Seller. The Seller will have the right to monitor the quality of the products, services
and any promotional materials bearing the Seller\'s names and marks. The
Seller\'s names and marks will remain the exclusive property of the Seller.



6.14 VAT Receivables.



(a) From and after the Closing, the Buyer and the Seller shall, and the Buyer
shall cause the Acquired Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts
to collect the full amount of each VAT Receivable as promptly as practicable.
None of the Buyer, the Seller, nor any of their respective Affiliates shall
compromise the right of the Acquired Subsidiaries to any such VAT Receivable.
The Seller shall have the exclusive right to conduct and control (as it may
decide in its sole discretion and at its sole expense) any legal proceeding
and negotiations, including audits, with respect to any VAT Receivable. The
Seller shall consult with the Buyer, as reasonably requested from time to
time, in respect of any such legal proceedings or negotiations. The Buyer
shall promptly deliver to the Seller any correspondence received by it or any
of its Affiliates (including, from and after the Closing, the Acquired
Subsidiaries) with respect to any VAT Receivable.



(b) From and after the Closing, the Buyer shall pay to the Seller the amount
of any moneys received by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the
Acquired Subsidiaries) with respect to any VAT Receivable within ten (10)
calendar days of receipt thereof without set-off or deduction.



6.15 Definitive Documentation of Pre-Closing Restructuring. The Seller shall
give the Buyer a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
definitive documentation governing the Pre-Closing Restructuring, and all such
documentation shall be subject to the Buyer\'s prior written consent, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.



6.16 Guarantees. The Buyer agrees and acknowledges that the Seller and its
Affiliates (other than the Acquired Subsidiaries) intend to seek the release
of the guarantees, indemnities, surety bonds, letters of credit, letters of
comfort or other similar instrument that survive beyond the Closing for the
benefit of the Business or any Acquired Subsidiary (collectively, the
"Business Guarantees") listed on Schedule 6.16. The Buyer shall use its best
efforts to cause the Buyer or one or more of its Subsidiaries to be
substituted as soon as reasonably practicable (with effect from and after the
Closing) in all respects for the Seller and/or its Affiliates (other than the
Acquired Subsidiaries) with respect to any Business Guarantee, and to cause
the Seller and/or such Affiliate to be released in respect of, all obligations
of any Acquired Subsidiary and any obligations related to any Purchased Asset
or any Assumed Liability, under any Business Guarantee; provided, that such
substitution, removal, release or termination shall be in a form and substance
satisfactory to the Seller in its sole discretion.



6.17 Tax Matters.



(a) The Seller shall timely prepare and file or cause to be timely prepared
and filed all Tax Returns of or with respect to Holdco or the Acquired
Subsidiaries that are required to be filed after the Closing Date but that
relate to a taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date. To the
extent relating to Holdco or the Acquired Subsidiaries, all such Tax Returns
shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past practice. The Buyer shall
timely prepare and file or cause to be timely prepared and filed all Tax
Returns of or with respect to Holdco or the Acquired Subsidiaries that relate
to a taxable period beginning prior to the Closing Date and ending after the
Closing Date. Prior to the filing of any such Tax Return prepared by the
Buyer, the Buyer shall provide the Seller with a substantially final draft of
such Tax Return at least fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the due date for
such Tax Return (or, if required to be filed within thirty (30) calendar days
after the Closing Date or the end of the taxable period to which such Tax
Return relates, as soon as reasonably possible following the Closing Date or
the end of such taxable period, as the case may be) for the Seller\'s review
and approval. The Seller shall notify the Buyer of any objections that the
Seller may have to any items set forth in any such draft Tax Return, and the
Buyer and the Seller agree to consult and attempt to resolve in good faith any
such objection and to mutually consent to the filing of such Tax Return. If
the Seller and the Buyer cannot reach complete agreement within fifteen (15)
days (or by the due date of such Tax Return, if earlier), an accounting firm
that is mutually selected by the parties shall resolve such dispute. Such Tax
Returns shall be prepared or completed in a manner consistent with prior
practice of the applicable Acquired Subsidiary unless otherwise required by
Law. Without the prior written consent of the Seller or unless otherwise
required by Law, the Buyer shall not amend any Tax Return of any of the
Acquired Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period.



(b) After the Closing Date, the Buyer and the Seller shall provide each other
with such cooperation and information relating to the Business, Holdco or any
Acquired Subsidiary as the other Party may reasonably request in (i) filing
any Tax Return or other Tax filing or claim for refund of Taxes, (ii)
determining any Tax liability or right to refund of Taxes or (iii) conducting
or defending any audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes.



(c) Any Tax refund (including any interest with respect thereto), and any
equivalent benefit through a reduction in Tax liability for a post-Closing
Date period, relating to Holdco or any of the Acquired Subsidiaries for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be the property of the Seller, and, if received by the Buyer,
Holdco or any of the Acquired Subsidiaries, shall be paid to the Seller
promptly following receipt less any costs or expenses incurred by the Buyer,
Holdco or an Acquired Subsidiary in connection therewith. The Buyer shall, if
the Seller so requests and at Seller\'s expense, cause the relevant entity to
file for and obtain any refunds or equivalent amounts to which the Seller is
entitled under this Section 6.17(c) unless the Buyer determines in good faith
that it would be adversely affected by such filing; provided, that the Buyer
shall not be considered adversely affected by such a filing merely because the
filing results in a reduction or elimination of a net operating loss, Tax
basis, Tax credit or similar Tax item of Holdco or any of the Acquired
Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period. In the event the Buyer or the
Selling Parties, as the case may be, shall receive a refund of any Tax the
liability for which was the subject of apportionment under Section 6.17(d) or
(e) below, the amount of that refund shall be prorated between the parties in
accordance with the manner in which the related Tax liability was apportioned.
In the case of a Tax that is not subject to apportionment under Sections
6.17(d) or (e) below, if the Selling Parties on the one hand, or the Buyer on
the other hand, shall receive a refund of such Tax and such Tax has been paid
by the other party, the party receiving the refund shall promptly remit such
refund to the other party less any costs or expenses incurred by the receiving
party in connection therewith.



(d) The Buyer and the Selling Parties shall apportion all real property,
personal property, intangibles and other similar ad valorem Taxes (excluding,
for the avoidance of doubt, any Transfer Taxes) paid or payable in connection
with any of the Purchased Assets for the ad valorem Tax period in which the
Closing occurs, such apportionments to be made as of the Closing Date, to be
based upon the ad valorem Tax period for which such Taxes are assessed and to
be apportioned on per diem basis as of the completion of the Closing. Such
apportionment shall be made at or prior to the Closing to the extent
practicable. In the event that the applicable Tax bill or other information
reasonably necessary for computing any such apportionment is not available on
the Closing Date, the proration shall be based upon the actual amount of such
Taxes or fees for the preceding year (or appropriate period) for which such
actual Taxes or fees are available, provided that the Buyer and the Seller
shall recalculate and re-prorate said Taxes and payments and make the
necessary cash adjustments promptly upon the issuance, and on the basis of,
the actual Tax bills received for any such ad valorem Tax period; provided,
however, that any increase in the per diem rate in a Tax period beginning
after the Closing Date shall not be taken into account in such allocation. The
Selling Parties and the Buyer agree to furnish each other with such documents
and other records as may be reasonably requested in order to confirm all
adjustment and proration calculations made pursuant to this Section 6.17(d).
The Selling Parties, on the one hand, and the Buyer on the other hand, shall
make reconciliation payments to the other to effect the above proration,
giving credit to the Selling Parties for any prepayment of such Taxes with
respect to periods (or portions thereof) after the Closing Date.



(e) Except as provided in Section 6.4, Taxes not described in Section 6.17(d)
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any ad valorem Taxes imposed for a
taxable period that ends prior to the Closing Date and any other Tax of the
Selling Parties imposed for any taxable period) shall be apportioned to the
Pre-Closing Tax Period on the basis of an interim closing of the books as of
the completion of the Closing.



6.18 Non-Compete. For five (5) years following the Closing Date (or if such
period is in excess of that allowed by applicable Law in any specific
jurisdiction, then with respect to such jurisdiction only, the maximum period
allowed under the applicable Law of such jurisdiction that is less than five
(5) years following the Closing Date), the Seller shall not, and shall cause
its direct and indirect Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, own,
manage, operate or control, or engage, join or participate in the ownership,
management, operation or control of, any Person that is engaged in, or owns,
operates, manages or controls any venture or enterprise which directly or
indirectly engages in a Restricted Business; provided, that nothing contained
in this Section 6.18 shall (i) preclude the Seller or any of its Affiliates
from acquiring, owning or operating any Person, or the business of any Person,
who is, directly or indirectly through its controlled Affiliates, engaged in a
Restricted Business (such Person acquired, an "Acquired Competitor") by means
of (A) any merger, consolidation, joint venture, or other business combination
pursuant to which the business of an Acquired Competitor is combined with the
business of Seller or its Affiliates, (B) the acquisition by any of Seller or
its Affiliates, directly or indirectly through its controlled Affiliates, of
the capital stock of an Acquired Competitor, by way of tender or exchange
offer, negotiated purchase or other means, or (C) the acquisition by any of
Seller or its Affiliates, directly or indirectly through its controlled
Affiliates, of the assets, properties, or business of an Acquired Competitor,
by way of a direct or indirect (through its controlled Affiliates) purchase,
exchange, joint venture, or other means, in each case so long as the revenues
for such Acquired Competitor from its competitive activities for the four full
fiscal quarters immediately preceding the date that the definitive agreements
for such transaction are executed do not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of
the total revenues for such Acquired Competitor for the four full fiscal
quarters immediately preceding the date that the definitive agreements for
such transaction are executed; or (ii) prohibit or otherwise restrict Seller
or any of its Affiliates from developing or manufacturing any products for its
own internal use or any other use not involving a sale or transfer to an
unaffiliated third party for value.



6.19 Due Diligence Recordings. No later than the earlier to occur of (a) ten
(10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date and (b) three Business Days
following the termination of this Agreement, the Buyer shall destroy all Due
Diligence Recordings and, following such destruction, the Buyer shall promptly
deliver to the Seller a certificate, signed by a duly authorized officer of
the Buyer, to the effect that the Buyer has satisfied its obligations under
this Section 6.19. 6.20 Transferred Cash. The Seller and the Buyer shall cooperate in an effort
to identify, promptly after the date hereof, an amount of Transferred Cash to
be retained by the Acquired Subsidiaries at the time of Closing (the Parties
intend such amount to broadly reflect past practice for the Acquired
Subsidiaries, giving effect to seasonality), subject to the purchase price
adjustment for Transferred Cash contained in Article II. The Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Acquired Subsidiaries to have
such agreed amount of Transferred Cash at Closing.

EMPLOYEE PROVISIONS

(bd)The Buyer shall, within fifteen (15) Business Days after the date hereof,
make offers of employment to each Specified Employee, which offers are valid
under the applicable Laws of the jurisdictions where each such Specified
Employee resides, with such offers of employment subject to the consummation
of the Closing. Each such offer will expire as of the Closing Date and any
acceptance of such offer shall become effective upon (and not prior to) the
Closing Date. The Seller shall provide the Buyer, at least two (2) Business
Days prior to Closing, with an updated list of the Specified Employees.



(be)All Specified Employees who are subject to any collective bargaining
agreement with the Seller or any Selling Subsidiary (collectively, the "Union
Employees") shall be offered employment in their current positions, current
location of employment, and upon the terms and conditions set forth in such
collective bargaining agreement. The Buyer shall recognize any union
representing such Union Employees as the exclusive bargaining representative
and shall have assumed any collective bargaining agreement covering such Union
Employees in its entirety as of the Closing Date, including all existing
letters of agreement.



(bf)All Specified Employees who are not "Union Employees" shall be offered
employment in comparable positions, at the same location of employment (except
as to those operational employees of the Seller who may be relocated to the
Chicago area following the Closing), and on terms and conditions that are
substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the terms and conditions of
employment as currently provided by the Seller or its Affiliates to such
Specified Employees commencing on the Closing Date or upon the return of any
such Specified Employee to active employment; provided, that such offers of
employment shall be at a per annum base salary or regular hourly wage rate, as
applicable, no less favorable than each such Specified Employee\'s current
salary or regular hourly wage rate, as applicable.



9.2 Transferred Employees.



(a) The Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, provide each
Transferred Employee (who is not a Union Employee), during the twelve (12)
month period following Closing, with compensation and benefits that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits provided to such
Transferred Employee by the Seller and its Affiliates immediately prior to the
Closing Date. To the extent allowed by insurance providers, each Transferred
Employee who becomes a participant in any benefit plan or program of the Buyer
or any of its Affiliates shall be given credit under such plans and programs,
for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual thereunder, for all
services recognized by the Seller or its Affiliates (except to the extent that
such credit would result in duplication of accrual of benefits). The Buyer
agrees to recognize and credit each Transferred Employee with any accrued but
unused vacation, sick or personal leave recorded on the books of the Seller or
its Affiliates as of the Closing Date. Furthermore, to the extent allowed by
insurance providers, the Buyer shall cause there to be waived any pre-existing
condition, actively at work requirement and waiting period(s) applicable to
any Transferred Employee in connection with any benefit plan maintained by the
Buyer and its Affiliates. To the extent allowed by insurance providers, the
Buyer shall cause any such benefit plan to honor any expenses incurred by each
Transferred Employee and its beneficiaries under any Benefit Plan during the
portion of the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs for purposes of
satisfying applicable deductible, co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket
expenses.



(b) The Buyer shall assume all Liabilities and obligations to provide
severance to (i) any Specified Employee who is not offered employment on the
terms contemplated by Section 9.1 and (ii) any Transferred Employee whose
employment is involuntarily terminated after the Closing Date. The Buyer
agrees to provide severance pay and benefits to Transferred Employees
equivalent to that offered by the Seller and its Affiliates to similarly
situated employees for a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing
Date.



9.3 The Seller and Employees. The Seller or applicable Selling Subsidiary
shall terminate the employment of all Specified Employees effective as of the
Closing Date. Neither the Seller nor any of its Affiliates will contribute to
any benefit plan of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates. As of the Closing
Date, the Seller or applicable Selling Subsidiary shall cease to be the
employer of each Specified Employee. The Seller agrees to waive any non-
compete with respect to any Transferred Employee or any individual who is
seconded to an Acquired Subsidiary that would otherwise prohibit such
Transferred Employee or individual from accepting a position with the
applicable Acquired Subsidiary.



9.4 Post-Closing Payments Related to Retention Bonus Liabilities. Following
the Closing, the Buyer agrees to make any payments to the Transferred
Employees with respect to those specific amounts relating to retention bonuses
to be paid to Business Employees that the Seller, the Selling Subsidiaries or
the Acquired Subsidiaries have agreed to pay as set forth on Schedule 9.4 (the
"Retention Bonus Liabilities") (and solely to the extent in accordance with
the terms and conditions thereof). The Seller shall reimburse the Buyer for
such payments within ten (10) Business Days after the receipt by the Seller of
written notice and reasonably satisfactory evidence of such payments by the
Buyer. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Seller be required to
reimburse the Buyer for any "gross up" payments or other payments made to the
Transferred Employees in excess of the aggregate amount of the Retention Bonus
Liabilities set forth on Schedule 9.4.



9.5 COBRA. The Seller shall be responsible for providing continuation coverage
to the extent required by Section 4980B of the Code or similar state law
("COBRA") to those employees of the Seller, and other qualified beneficiaries
under COBRA with respect to such employees, who have a COBRA qualifying event
(due to termination of employment with the Seller or otherwise) prior to or in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except as
required by law, neither the Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall be
responsible for the failure of the Seller to comply with any of the
requirements of COBRA, including applicable notice requirements.



9.6 Non-Solicitation.



(a) Except as specifically contemplated hereby with respect to the Business
Employees, for a period from the date hereof through the period ending
eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date, neither the Buyer nor any of
its Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly, without the prior written
consent of the Seller, (i) contact for solicitation, solicit, encourage, or
induce any person who is an officer, employee or consultant of the Seller\'s
retained businesses to terminate their employment or consulting engagement
with the Seller, or (ii) contact for solicitation, encourage, induce, hire,
engage, or employ any person who is an officer, employee or consultant of the
Seller\'s retained businesses to become an officer, employee or consultant of
the Buyer or any of its Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in
this Section 9.6(a) shall be construed to prohibit the Buyer from (w)
advertising open positions, participating in job fairs and comparable
activities or conducting other forms of soliciting candidates for employment
or contract opportunities that are general in nature, (x) responding to
unsolicited inquiries about employment or contract opportunities or
possibilities from recruiters or other agents, (y) responding to unsolicited
inquiries about employment or contract opportunities from any individual or
(z) hiring an officer, employee or consultant of the Seller\'s retained
businesses who has responded to a general solicitation of employment not
specifically directed at such officer, employee or consultant.



(b) From the date hereof through the period ending eighteen (18) months
following the Closing Date, neither the Seller nor any of its Affiliates
shall, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of the Buyer,
(i) contact for solicitation, solicit, encourage, or induce any person who is an officer,
employee or consultant of the Buyer (including, from and after the Closing,
the Transferred Employees) to terminate their employment or consulting
engagement with the Buyer, or (ii) contact for solicitation, encourage,
induce, hire, engage, or employ any person who is an officer, employee or
consultant of the Buyer (including, from and after the Closing, the
Transferred Employees) to become an officer, employee or consultant of the
Seller or any of its Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, general
advertisements with respect to a position that are not directed to officers,
employees or consultants of the Buyer will not, in and of itself, constitute
contact for solicitation, encouragement or inducement in violation of this
Section 9.6(b).



9.7 No Third Party Beneficiaries. The provisions contained in this Article IX
are included for the sole benefit of the Parties hereto and shall not create
any right in any other Person, including any employees, former employees, any
participant in any Benefit Plan or any beneficiary thereof or any right to
continued employment with Buyer or its Affiliates.

written notice to the other Party(ies), if the Closing has not taken place on
or before March 31, 2011 (the "Expiration Date"), or such later date as the
Seller and the Buyer may agree to in writing; provided, however, that if the
Pre-Closing Restructuring shall not have been consummated by such date other

to the terminating Party\'s obligations to consummate the Transaction, and
such event, fact or condition shall not have been cured or waived by the non-
terminating Party within fifteen (15) Business Days of notice thereof from the
terminating Party, unless the occurrence or existence of such event, fact or
condition shall be due to the failure of the terminating Party to perform or
comply with any of the agreements or covenants in this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents to be performed or complied with by such Party prior to
the Closing.



10.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination by the Seller or the

herein:



(a) The Seller, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand, shall
return to the other, or destroy, all documents and other materials received

electronic copies, or materials developed from any such documents or other
materials) relating to the Transaction, whether obtained before or after the
date hereof; and

(b) If this Agreement is terminated as provided in this Article X, this

as otherwise provided in this Article X); provided, that the provisions of
this Section 10.2 ("Effect of Termination"), Section 6.4 ("Expenses of Sale"),
Section 6.7 ("Confidentiality; Publicity"), Section 9.6 ("Non-Solicitation")
and Article XIII ("Miscellaneous") shall survive any termination hereof.

of, any Party from any Liability for any intentional breach by such Party of
any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement.

(a) Whenever a claim shall arise for indemnification under Sections 11.1(a) or
11.1(b), the Person entitled to indemnification (the "Indemnitee") shall
promptly notify the Party from which indemnification is sought (the

for such claim; provided, that after receipt by an Indemnitee of written
notice of the assertion or the commencement of any Litigation by a third party
with respect to any matter referred to in Sections 11.1(a) or 11.1(b), the
Indemnitee shall give prompt written notice thereof to the Indemnitor, which
notice shall include a description of the claim or Litigation, the amount thereof (if known and quantifiable) and
the basis for the claim or Litigation, and thereafter shall keep the
Indemnitor reasonably informed with respect thereto; provided, further, that
failure of the Indemnitee to give the Indemnitor notice as provided herein
shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder except to the
extent that the Indemnitor is prejudiced thereby.



(b) Any Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such
action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim giving rise to an
Indemnitee\'s claim for indemnification at such Indemnitor\'s expense, and at
its option (subject to the limitations set forth below) shall be entitled to
assume the defense thereof by appointing a nationally recognized and reputable
counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee to be the lead counsel in
connection with such defense; provided, however, that:



(i) the Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such
claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose; provided, that the
fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the Indemnitee;



(ii) if the Indemnitor shall control the defense of any such claim, the
Indemnitor shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnitee before
entering into any settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend such claim if,
pursuant to or as a result of such settlement or cessation, injunctive or
other equitable relief will be imposed against the Indemnitee or if such
settlement does not expressly and unconditionally release the Indemnitee from
all Liabilities with respect to such claim, without prejudice;



(iii) the Indemnitor has not failed or is not failing to use reasonable
efforts to defend such claim or with respect to such Litigation; and



(iv) notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) the Seller shall have control over
the resolution of all Liabilities specified in Section 1.5(b) but shall allow
the Buyer to control communications related thereto with any ongoing customer
of the Business; provided, that the Buyer shall keep the Seller apprised of
the content of any such communications with such customer and the Seller shall
have the right to participate in any such communications; and (B) the Seller
shall consult with the Buyer, and shall take under advisement and consider in
good faith input from the Buyer, regarding the resolution of such Liabilities.



(f)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 11.5, the
applicable Selling Parties and the Buyer shall jointly control, each at its
own expense, the resolution of any third party claims concerning Taxes that
are apportioned pursuant to Sections 6.17(d) or (e).



11.6 Calculation of Damages.



(a) The amount of any Damages payable under this Article XI by the Indemnitor
shall be adjusted for any (i) amounts recovered or recoverable by the
Indemnitee under applicable insurance policies or from recoveries from third
parties pursuant to indemnification or otherwise, (ii) Tax cost incurred by
the Indemnitee arising from the receipt of indemnity payments, and (iii) Tax
benefit actually realized by the Indemnitee arising from the incurrence or
payment of any such Damages. Indemnity payments made hereunder shall be
treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes unless
otherwise required by applicable Law.



(b) The Indemnitor shall not be liable under this Article XI for any (i)
indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, consequential or punitive Damages or
(ii) Damages for, measured by or based on lost profits, diminution in value,
multiple of earnings or other similar measure.



(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if on the Closing Date
the Buyer has Knowledge (as defined in Section 12.4(b)) of any information
that would cause one or more of the representations and warranties made by the
Seller to be inaccurate as of the date made, the Buyer shall have no right or
remedy after the Closing with respect to such inaccuracy and shall be deemed
to have waived its rights to indemnification under Section 11.1(a)(i) in
respect thereof.



11.7 Remedies. It is specifically understood and agreed that, except as
specifically set forth in this Agreement, the Buyer waives any rights and
claims that the Buyer may have against the Seller, whether in law or in
equity, relating to the Business or the Transaction. The rights and claims
waived by the Buyer include, claims for contribution or other rights of
recovery arising out of or relating to any Environmental Law, claims for
breach of contract, breach of representation or warranty, negligent
misrepresentation and all other claims for breach of duty. After the Closing,
Article XI shall provide the exclusive remedy for monetary damages for any
misrepresentation, breach of warranty, covenant or other agreement or other
claim arising out of this Agreement or the Transaction. 11.8 Environmental. The Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify the Buyer
Indemnified Parties with respect to any Buyer Damages related to or in
connection with any environmental investigation, monitoring, remediation,
containment, restoration, removal or other corrective or response action
arising from (a) any conditions of contamination identified through any
environmental sampling or analysis, or (b) any report to any Governmental
Entity, in either case, unless such sampling, analysis or report is required
by a Governmental Entity or by Environmental Laws.



11.9 Akzo Indemnity. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to the
extent that any Buyer Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnification for
any Damages for which it (in its capacity as successor-in-interest to the
Seller under the Akzo Agreement) is entitled to indemnification in accordance
with the terms and provisions of the Akzo Agreement, and only to the extent
that the indemnification to which such Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled
under the Akzo Agreement is sufficient to cover such Damages:



(a) such Buyer Indemnified Party (in its capacity as successor-in-interest to
the Seller under the Akzo Agreement) shall seek indemnification for such
Damages from Akzo in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Akzo
Agreement (and not from the Seller); provided, that such Buyer Indemnified
Party shall provide prompt written notice to Seller of any claim for such
Damages made against Akzo (an "Akzo Claim Notice"); and



(b) the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to indemnification
for such Damages from the Seller in accordance with this Article XI in the
event that it is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that
the Buyer Indemnified Parties are not entitled to indemnification for such
Damages from Akzo by reason of the invalidity of the assignment of the Akzo
Agreement by the Seller to the applicable Acquired Subsidiary; provided, that
in such event, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall cooperate with the Seller
in the event that the Seller seeks indemnification from Akzo pursuant to the
terms of the Akzo Agreement; provided, further, that the date of the
applicable Akzo Claim Notice shall be deemed to be the date on which such
claim was asserted against the Seller for purposes of Sections 11.2 and 11.3
in connection with any later claim for such Damages against the Seller.

courts of or in the State of New York other than for such purpose. Each Party
hereby irrevocably waives defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance
of any such action or proceeding.
