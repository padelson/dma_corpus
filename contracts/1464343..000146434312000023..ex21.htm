Purchase Price, Buyer (or its designee) shall make payment by wire transfer of
the amount of such difference to Seller. If the Initial Purchase Price (as

Increase Termination Date, no Earnout Payment will be earned or owed under

hundred and twenty (120) days following the completion of such Measurement
Period), Buyer shall deliver to Seller a copy of such financial statements
together with a certificate executed by the chief executive officer or chief
financial officer of Buyer (or other officer of Buyer with similar duties and

paid, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such bank account as
shall be designated in writing by Seller, within fifteen (15) days following
the delivery of the applicable Earnout Certificate. On or prior to the

Seller may give Buyer a written notice stating in reasonable detail its
objections to the calculation thereof in accordance with the procedures set
forth in Section 2.07 below. During such sixty (60) day period following
receipt of Buyer's certification, Seller and its accountants and
representatives shall have the right to inspect the books and records of the
Measured Persons used to calculate the applicable Earnout Amount during normal
business hours at the offices of such Measured Persons, upon reasonable prior
notice and for purposes reasonably related to the determination of Adjusted
EBITDA and the resulting Earnout Payment. Any disputed amounts to be paid
pursuant to Section 2.07 shall be paid within fifteen (15) days following the
determination of Adjusted EBITDA for such Measurement Period being deemed
final in accordance with such provisions. In the event that Seller does not
deliver to Buyer an Objection Notice with respect to the calculation of
Adjusted EBITDA for such Measurement Period by the sixtieth (60th) day
following Buyer's delivery of the applicable Earnout Certificate to Seller,
the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA for such Measurement Period and the
resulting Earnout Payment as set forth in such Earnout Certificate shall be
deemed final and binding on Buyer and Seller.

  

  

(iii) Buyer agrees (A) to maintain separate books and financial statements
with respect to the Measured Persons, permitting a full and accurate
determination of any Earnout Payment, (B) not to, directly or indirectly,
divert any business normally conducted by a Measured Person to any other
Person not included within the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, and (C) not to
take any action or omission (or allow any Measured Person to take any action
with the primary purpose of reducing or decreasing any potential Earnout
Payment; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
construed to restrict in any way Buyer's management from operating the Buyer's
business (including the business of the Acquired Companies) in the manner
which the Buyer's management and board of directors deem most beneficial for
the Buyer and the holders of Buyer's membership interests.

  

  

(iv) Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Seller and Buyer, all financial
statements of the Measured Persons for purposes of determining Adjusted EBITDA
shall be prepared in accordance with the Effective Yield Financial Statements
as described in Section 3.06 and, subject to subsection (vi) below, any
contribution (whether positive or negative) from operations of the Measured
Persons in the United Kingdom (without duplication). The parties agree that
any changes in any accounting rules or the effective yield methodology from
and after the date hereof shall not affect the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA
and that the parties shall prepare the financial statements on a basis
consistent with the determinations used to prepare the Effective Yield
Financial Statements and the methodology set forth on Section 3.06(a) of the
Disclosure Schedules.

  

  

(v) In the event that all or substantially all of either the assets or equity
of any of the Measured Persons are sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of
to an unaffiliated third party in a transaction or series of related
transactions (except for asset sales or dispositions in the ordinary course of
business) (a "Sale Transaction") prior to December 31, 2014 and Flexpoint Fund
II, L.P. receives in cash at the consummation of such Sale Transaction (net of
any Earnout Payments payable of a result of such Sale Transaction) an amount
equal to (A) 1.5 multiplied by (B) Flexpoint Fund II, L.P.' s aggregate equity
investments in JCAP Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries prior to such date,
then, within fifteen (15) days following the consummation of such Sale
Transaction, Buyer shall pay to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to such bank account as shall be designated in writing by
Seller, an amount equal to the Maximum Earnout Amount less any Earnout
Payments previously paid hereunder.

  

  

(vi) For purposes of this Section 2.05(b), "Adjusted EBITDA" shall mean, with
respect to any specified period, the consolidated net income of JCAP Holdings,
LLC, its subsidiaries (including Buyer and the Acquired Companies), and each
of their successors (collectively, the "Measured Persons"), for such period,
determined before deduction of interest expense, income taxes, depreciation
expense and amortization expense of the Measured Persons for such period
calculated in accordance with the methodology set forth in Section 2.05(b)(iv)
above and after adding back (to the extent deducted in determining
consolidated net income for such period): (A) the fees and expenses incurred
by any Measured Person in connection with the closing of the transactions
contemplated hereby; (B) all management fees, consultant fees or similar fees
paid or payable to Flexpoint Fund II, L.P. or its Affiliates (other than the
Measured Persons) or any employee of Flexpoint Fund II, L.P. or its Affiliates
(other than an employee of a Measured Person); (C) director's or similar fees
paid to any member of a Measured Person's board of directors or board of
managers, other than normal and customary payments to outside directors or
outside members of a Measured Person's board of directors or board of managers
that are consistent with amounts paid by companies of the size and type of the
Measured Persons, (D) all fees and expenses incurred by a Measured Person to
Flexpoint Fund II, L.P. or any of its Affiliates (other than a Measured
Person) on terms that are less favourable to such Measured Person than arms'
length terms (excluding any transactions or arrangements among the Measured
Persons), (E) any other extraordinary gains or losses or one-time gains or
losses, including gains or losses associated with a Sale Transaction that any
Measured Person may pursue, and (F) any purchase accounting or write up of an
intangible asset due to the acquisition transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. If the Acquired Companies engage in a Material Disposition, the
Adjusted EBITDA will be adjusted to exclude the effect of any gain or loss
resulting from such Material Disposition. In the event that any Affiliate of
Buyer (other than any Measured Person) diverts from any Measured Person any
business opportunity of such Measured Person that (x) is within such Measured
Person's line of business on the date hereof, (y) is generated by and known to
the employees of such Measured Person and (z) such Measured Person has the
ability and practical experience to pursue, such business opportunity shall be
deemed business of such Measured Person for purposes of calculating the
Adjusted EBITDA.

  

  

(vii) If any Measured Person sells or disposes of a material division or
business to an unaffiliated third party in a single transaction or series of
related transaction (a "Material Disposition"), the EBITDA Target for the
remaining Measurement Periods (and on a pro rata basis for the Measurement
Period in which such Material Disposition occurs) will be adjusted to an
amount equal to the product of (1) (A) the result of (I) the Flexpoint Deemed
Equity Investment Amount minus (II) 50% of the cash proceeds, net of
transaction expenses, received by any Measured Person in connection with such
Material Disposition, divided by (B) the amount of the investment by Flexpoint
Fund II, L.P. in JCAP Holdings, LLC as of the Closing Date (the "Initial
Flexpoint Investment Amount"), multiplied by (2) $33,000,000. In the event
that Flexpoint Fund II, L.P. makes a new equity investment in any Measured
Person or any Measured Person reinvests cash proceeds, net of transaction
expenses, from any Material Disposition, the EBITDA Target for the remaining
Measurement Periods (and on a pro rata basis for the Measurement Period in
which such investment occurs) will be adjusted to an amount equal to the
product of (1) (A) the sum of (I) the Flexpoint Deemed Equity Investment
Amount plus (II) (a) the amount of such new equity investment by Flexpoint
Fund II, L.P. or (b) 50% of the cash proceeds, net of transaction expenses, of
a Material Disposition reinvested by a Measured Person within 90 days of the
closing of such Material Disposition ("Reinvestment Period"), as applicable,
divided by (B) the Initial Flexpoint Investment Amount, multiplied by (2)
$33,000,000. For purposes of this Section 2.05(b)(vii), the "Flexpoint Deemed
Equity Investment Amount" means, as of the date of determination, an amount
equal to (i) the Initial Flexpoint Investment Amount, plus (ii) the aggregate
amount of additional equity investments by Flexpoint Fund II, L.P. in JCAP
Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries following the Closing Date, plus (iii) 50%
of the aggregate cash proceeds, net of transaction expenses, received by the
Measured Persons in connection with Material Dispositions reinvested by
Measured Persons during the applicable Reinvestment Periods, less (iv) 50% of
the aggregate cash proceeds, net of transaction expenses, received by the
Measured Persons in connection with the Material Dispositions, in the case of
clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) excluding the proceeds from a Material
Disposition, the new equity investment by Flexpoint Fund II, L.P. or the
reinvestment of proceeds of a Material Disposition, as applicable, occurring
on such date of determination.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

10  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(viii) Until the earlier to occur of (A) the date on which the Maximum Earnout
Payment has been paid and (B) delivery to Seller of the unaudited financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2014, Buyer shall provide to Seller
quarterly financial statements of the Acquired Companies at the same time and
in the same manner as provided to Buyer and its Affiliates or pursuant to the
Buyer Debt Facility.

  

  

(c) To the extent any Earnout Payment is not paid by Buyer to Seller when due
hereunder, such amount shall bear interest from and including the date such
payment was due to the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to 8%. Such
interest shall be calculated daily on the basis of a 365 day year and the
actual number of days elapsed.

  

  

(d) The right to receive any of the Earnout Payments (if any) is solely a
contractual right and is not a security for any purpose. The express
obligations of Buyer set forth in this Section 2.05 are the sole obligations,
express or implied, relating to the efforts of Buyer and the Acquired
Companies and their respective Affiliates regarding the Earnout Payments. For
the avoidance of doubt, (x) Buyer and its Affiliates have no obligation to use
efforts to cause any portion of the Earnout Payments to be earned and (y) any
implied duty or covenant of good faith and fair dealing shall not be deemed to
impose any obligation on Buyer or the Acquired Companies or any of their
respective Affiliates to cause any portion of the Earnout Payments to be
earned.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the maximum
aggregate Earnout Payments owed pursuant to this Section 2.05 shall not exceed
the Maximum Earnout Amount.

  

  

Section 2.06 Net Charge-Offs.

  

  

(a) In the event that during the period beginning on July 1, 2012 and ending
on June 30, 2013 (the "Net Charge-Off Period"), Net Charge-Off (as defined
below) of principal receivables of utilization balances relating to the Emblem
accounts that had outstanding balances as of September 30, 2011 and identified
on Section 2.06 of the Disclosure Schedules (the "Emblem Accounts") exceeds
20% of the outstanding balance of utilization receivables on the Emblem
Accounts as of June 30, 2012, Seller shall pay to Buyer or its designee in
cash an amount equal to the Net Charge-Off of principal receivables of
utilization balances of the Emblem Accounts during the Net Charge-Off Period,
less 18% of the outstanding balance of utilization receivables on the Emblem
Accounts as of June 30, 2012 (such amount, the "Net Charge-Off
Reimbursement"). An illustrative example of the calculation of the Net Charge-
Off Reimbursement is set forth on Section 2.06 of the Disclosure Schedules.

  

  

(b) Promptly following each month of the Net Charge-Off Period, Buyer shall
provide to Seller the calculation of Net Charge-Offs for principal receivables
of utilization balances relating to the Emblem Accounts. Promptly following
completion of the Net Charge-Off Period (but in no event later than sixty (60)
days following the completion thereof), Buyer shall deliver to Seller a copy
of a statement setting forth the calculation of the Net Charge-Offs for the
Net Charge-Off Period together with reasonable supporting documentation
evidencing the same and a certificate executed by the chief executive officer
or chief financial officer (or any other officer with similar duties and
responsibilities) of the Buyer certifying the calculation of any Net Charge-
Off Reimbursement. On or prior to the sixtieth (60th) day after Seller's
receipt of such statement setting forth the Net Charge-Off Reimbursement,
Seller may give Buyer a written notice stating in reasonable detail its
objections to the calculation thereof in accordance with the procedures set
forth in Section 2.07. During such sixty (60) day period following receipt of
Buyer's certification, Seller and its accountants and representatives shall
have the right to inspect Buyer's and its subsidiaries' books and records
during normal business hours at Buyer's and its subsidiaries' offices, upon
reasonable prior notice and for purposes reasonably related to the
determination of Net Charge-Offs and the resulting Net Charge-Off
Reimbursement. If Seller does not deliver to Buyer an Objection Notice in
accordance with Section 2.07(a) prior to the expiration of the sixty (60) day
period, the calculation of the Net Charge-Off Reimbursement shall be deemed
final and binding on the Parties.

  

  

(c) For purposes of determining Net Charge-Offs, Buyer agrees that it and its
Affiliates will continue to (i) use the same policies and procedures as it
relates to delinquencies, charging off accounts, and recoveries, and (ii)
pursue collections on both delinquent and charged-off accounts, in each case
consistent with the manner in which Buyer and its subsidiaries manage its
other accounts.

  

  

(d) For purposes of this Section 2.06, "Net Charge-Off" shall mean an amount
equal to the principal charge-off of the utilization balance on the Emblem
Accounts, minus all recoveries on all accounts during the Net Charge-Off
Period.

  

  

Section 2.07 Purchase Price Disputes.

  

  

(a) To the extent Seller delivers a written notice of any objection in
accordance with the terms of Section 2.02(b), Section 2.05(b)(ii) or Section
2.06(b) (each an "Objection Notice"), such Objection Notice shall specify in
reasonable detail the dollar amount (if determinable) of any objection and the
basis therefor. Any determination set forth in the Closing Date Calculation,
calculation of Adjusted EBITDA or calculation of Net Charge-Off Reimbursement,
as applicable, which is not specifically objected to in an Objection Notice
shall be deemed final and binding upon the parties hereto. Except to the
extent Seller makes an objection to a specific determination set forth in the
Closing Date Calculation, calculation of Adjusted EBITDA or calculation of Net
Charge-Off Reimbursement, as applicable, pursuant to an Objection Notice
delivered to Buyer within such thirty (30) day or sixty (60) day period, as
applicable, the Closing Date Calculation, calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, or
calculation of Net Charge-Off Reimbursement, as applicable, will be final and
binding upon the parties hereto. If Seller gives a timely Objection Notice,
then Buyer and Seller will negotiate to resolve their disputes (and all such
discussions related thereto shall, unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and
Seller, be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence (and any
applicable similar state rule)). If Buyer and the Seller are unable to resolve
all disputes regarding the Closing Date Calculation, the calculation of
Adjusted EBITDA, or the calculation of Net Charge-Off Reimbursement, as
applicable, on or prior to the thirtieth (30th) day after the delivery of the
Objection Notice, then Buyer and the Seller will retain Duff and Phelps (the
"Independent Firm"), and shall instruct the Independent Firm to resolve the
dispute as soon as practicable, and in any event within thirty (30) days, and
Buyer and Seller and their respective agents shall cooperate with the
Independent Firm during its engagement. The Independent Firm shall only decide
the specific items under dispute by the parties (the "Disputed Items"), solely
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In resolving any Disputed
Item, the Independent Firm may not assign a value to any item greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest
value for such item claimed by either party. The Independent Firm's
determination shall be based solely on written submissions by Buyer and Seller
(i.e., not on independent review) and the definitions and other terms included
herein. In resolving any Disputed Items, the parties will not engage in
discovery and no arbitration hearing will be held. The Closing Date
Calculation, the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA or the calculation of Net
Charge-Off Reimbursement, as applicable, as determined by the Independent Firm
will, absent manifest error, be final and binding upon the parties hereto and
will constitute the Closing Date Calculation, the calculation of Adjusted
EBITDA or the calculation of Net Charge-Off Reimbursement, as applicable, for
all purposes of this ARTICLE II. The fees and expenses of the Independent Firm
(i) shall be borne by the Seller, in the proportion that the aggregate dollar
amount of Disputed Items submitted thereto for resolution that are
unsuccessfully disputed by Seller (as finally determined by the Independent
Firm) bears to the aggregate dollar amount of such submitted Disputed Items
and (ii) shall be borne by Buyer, in the proportion that the aggregate dollar
amount of Disputed Items submitted thereto for resolution that are
successfully disputed by Seller (as finally determined by the Independent
Firm) bears to the aggregate dollar amount of such submitted Disputed Items.
Buyer and Seller agree to execute, if requested by the Independent Firm, a
reasonable engagement letter, including customary indemnification provisions
in favor of the Independent Firm, which Buyer and Seller shall each be
responsible for 50% of any such indemnification obligations.

Section 2.08 Purchase Price Allocation. Buyer and Seller shall allocate the
purchase price (and all other capitalized costs) for Tax purposes among the
assets of CL Holdings as determined in accordance with this Section 2.08.
Buyer shall propose a written allocation within ninety (90) days following the
Closing Date. Seller shall provide written comments on the proposed allocation
within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the proposed allocation. If the
parties cannot come to mutual agreement on the allocation, the matter shall be
resolved in accordance with substantially identical procedures as set forth
for the resolution of disputes in Section 2.07, except that the cost
associated with the Independent Firm shall be borne 50% by Buyer and 50% by
Seller. Buyer and Seller and their respective Affiliates shall report, act and
file Tax Returns in all respects and for all purposes consistent with such
agreed (or resolved) allocation, unless otherwise required by Law. In the
event of an Earnout Payment, Buyer shall propose successor purchase price
allocations in accordance with the foregoing procedures, except that in each
case such successor purchase price allocation shall be proposed within ninety
(90) days of such payment.

  

  

Section 2.09 Withholding. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
are required to be withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
any provision of U.S. federal, state, local, or other Tax Law, and to request
any necessary Tax forms, including Form W-9 or the appropriate series of Form
W-8, as applicable, or any similar information; provided that prior to making
any such deduction and withholding, Buyer shall, to the extent reasonably
practicable, provide notice to the recipient of the amounts subject to
withholding and a reasonable opportunity for such recipient to provide forms
or other evidence that would exempt such amounts from withholding Tax. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom
such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
State of Georgia and has all necessary corporate power and authority to own,
operate or lease the properties and assets now owned, operated or leased by it
and to carry on its business as it is currently conducted, except where the
failure to be validly existing and in good standing or to have such power and
authority would not reasonably be expected to impair or delay Seller's ability
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Seller has all necessary
corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement, to carry out its
obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
The execution and delivery by Seller of this Agreement, the performance by it
of its obligations hereunder and the consummation by it of the transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate
action on the part of Seller. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Seller, and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery
by Buyer) this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Seller, enforceable against Seller in accordance with its terms, except as
such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by
general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a
proceeding at law or in equity).

  

  

Section 3.02 Organization, Authority and Qualification of the Acquired
Companies. Each Acquired Company is organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Law of the State of its incorporation or organization, as

all necessary corporate or company power and authority, as applicable, to own,
operate or lease the properties and assets now owned, operated or leased by it
and to carry on its business as it is currently conducted. Each Acquired
Company is qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which either the ownership or use of the properties owned or
used by it, or the nature of the activities conducted by it, requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing
would not be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each of Seller and
its Affiliates (including any applicable Acquired Company) has all necessary
corporate or company power and authority to effectuate the Pre-Closing
Reorganization, including entering into all of the Pre-Closing Reorganization
Documents and carrying out the obligations thereunder. The execution and
delivery by Seller and its Affiliates, as applicable, of the Pre-Closing
Reorganization Documents, the performance by such Person of its obligations
thereunder and the consummation by such Person of the transactions
contemplated thereby have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate or
company action on the part of such Person. Each of the Pre-Closing
Reorganization Documents will be duly executed and delivered by all of the
parties thereto and each of the Pre-Closing Reorganization Documents will
constitute a legal, valid and binding obligation of such applicable party,
enforceable against such applicable party in accordance with its terms, except
as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors' rights
generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity).

  

  

Section 3.03 Capitalization of Acquired Companies.

  

  

(a) The ownership of each of the Acquired Companies is as set forth on Section
3.03(a) of the Disclosure Schedules.

rights or rights of first refusal or any Laws. No Acquired Company's Capital
Stock is subject to any preemptive rights or rights of first refusal.

  

  

(c) There are no outstanding or authorized options, warrants, purchase rights,
subscription rights, conversion rights, exchange rights or other contracts or
commitments (contingent or otherwise) that could require any Acquired Company
to issue, sell, cause to become outstanding, acquire or retire any Capital
Stock in any Acquired Company. No Acquired Company has any outstanding or
authorized equity appreciation, phantom equity, or similar rights with respect
to such Acquired Company. Except for each Acquired Company's Organizational
Documents, there are no agreements or understandings between the Acquired
Company's members, shareholders or any other Person with respect to the voting
or transfer of such Acquired Company's Capital Stock or with respect to any
other aspect of such Acquired Company's governance.

  

  

(d) Seller has made available to Buyer true, accurate and complete copies of
the stock or unit ledger, as applicable, of each Acquired Company, which such
stock or unit ledger reflects all issuances, transfers, repurchases and
cancellations of the Capital Stock of such Acquired Company.

subsidiaries or other ownership interests of Capital Stock in any Person other

Section 3.05 No Conflicts; Consents. Except as set forth on Section 3.05 of
the Disclosure Schedules, the execution, delivery and performance by Seller of
this Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
do not and will not (whether with or without the passage of time, the giving
of notice or both): (a) result in a violation or breach of any provision of
the Organizational Documents of Seller or any Acquired Company; (b) result in
a violation or breach of any provision of any Law or Governmental Order
applicable to Seller or any Acquired Company; or (c) require the consent,
notice or other action by any Person under, conflict with, result in a

Material Contract or Material Permit; or (d) result in the imposition of any
Encumbrance upon the Interests or any Acquired Company's assets, except in the
cases of clauses (b), (c) and (d), where the violation, breach, conflict,
default, acceleration, right, result or failure to receive consent or provide
notice would not be expected to be material to Seller or any Acquired Company.
Except as set forth on Section 3.05 of the Disclosure Schedules, no consent,
approval, Permit, Governmental Order, declaration or filing with, or notice
to, any Governmental Authority is required by or with respect to Seller or the

"Financial Statements") are attached to Section 3.06(a) of the Disclosure
Schedules. Copies of the (i) unaudited financial statements of JCAP and the
subsidiaries of Majestic consisting of the balance sheets of JCAP and the
subsidiaries of Majestic as of December 31, 2011, and the related statements
of operations for the year then ended determined on the effective yield method
(the "2011 Effective Yield Financial Statements"), and (ii) the unaudited

have been prepared in accordance with the methodology set forth on Section
3.06(a) of the Disclosure Schedules applied on a consistent basis throughout
the periods involved. The Financial Statements have been prepared from, and
are in accordance with, the books and records of JCAP and Majestic, fairly
present in all material respects the combined financial condition, the

Companies properly reflect, in all material respects, the transactions entered
into by the Acquired Companies.

  

  

(b) Seller has established and maintained a system of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act), which
has been applied to the financial reporting of the Acquired Companies. Such
internal controls are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of Seller's financial reporting in accordance with GAAP, one
component of which has been financial reporting for the Acquired Companies.
Since January 1, 2009, Seller's principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer have disclosed to Seller's auditors and Seller's audit
committee (i) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect Seller's ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Seller's internal controls. Seller has made available to Buyer copies
of any material written materials provided to Seller's auditors and audit
committee since January 1, 2009 relating to each of the foregoing to the
extent such materials involved the Acquired Companies.

nor, to Seller's Knowledge, has there been any threat of, any strike,
slowdown, work stoppage, lockout, concerted refusal to work overtime or other
similar labor activity or dispute affecting Employees or an Acquired Company.
To Seller's Knowledge, there are no, and for the past five (5) years have not
been any, pending or threatened, union organization activities relating to any
of the Acquired Companies in which a petition for a union representation was

(b) Except as set forth on Section 3.16(b) of the Disclosure Schedules, there
are, and during the past three (3) year have been, no Proceedings against an
Acquired Company pending, or to the Seller's Knowledge, threatened to be
brought or filed, by or with any Governmental Authority or arbitrator in
connection with the employment of any current or former employee of Seller or
its Affiliates who performed services for an Acquired Company, including,
without limitation, any Proceeding relating to unfair labor practices,
employment discrimination, harassment, retaliation, equal pay or any other
employment related matter arising under applicable Laws. There are no
outstanding Governmental Orders and no unsatisfied judgments, penalties or
awards against the Acquired Companies or any of their properties or assets or,
to Seller's Knowledge, the Employees relating to labor or employment matters.
Each Acquired Company is and for the past three (3) years has been in
compliance in all material respects with all Laws applicable to it and
relating to labor or employment, and, no employee or agent of any of the
Acquired Companies has committed any act or omission giving rise to material
liability with respect to an Acquired Company for any such violation. Except
as set forth on Section 3.16(b) of the Disclosure Schedules, no Acquired
Company has received in the prior three (3) years any written notification
from any Governmental Authority asserting that such Acquired Company is not in
compliance with any Law relating to labor or employment.

  

  

(c) Except as set forth on Section 3.16(c) of the Disclosure Schedule, to
Seller's Knowledge, no member of the senior management of the Acquired
Companies or group of Employees has any intention to terminate his or her
employment within the first twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, or
(B) is a party to any confidentiality, non-competition, proprietary rights or
other such agreement that would materially restrict the performance of such
Employee's employment duties, or the ability of any of the Acquired Companies
to conduct its or their business.

  

  

(d) Within the past three (3) years, none of the Acquired Companies has
implemented any plant closing or layoff of employees that required WARN Act
notification. Section 3.16(d) of the Disclosure Schedules lists, by date and
location, each employee of the Acquired Companies whose employment has
terminated within the 90 days preceding the Closing Date.

  

  

Section 3.17 Taxes.

  

  

(a) Each Acquired Company has filed (taking into account any valid extensions)
all income and other material Tax Returns required to be filed by it. Such Tax
Returns are true, complete and correct in all material respects. No Acquired
Company is currently the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to
file any Tax Return. All Taxes due and owing by the Acquired Companies have
been paid or accrued. No material claim has ever been made by an authority in
a jurisdiction where an Acquired Company does not file Tax Returns that such
Acquired Company is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. There
are no Encumbrances for Taxes (other than Taxes not yet due and payable) upon
any of the assets of the Acquired Companies.

  

  

(b) Except as set forth on Section 3.17(b) of the Disclosure Schedules, no
extensions or waivers of statutes of limitations have been given or requested
with respect to any Taxes of the Acquired Companies.

  

  

(c) Except as set forth on Section 3.17(c) of the Disclosure Schedules, there
are, and during the past three (3) years have been, no pending or, to Seller's
Knowledge, threatened Proceedings by any taxing authority against the Acquired
Companies. No Acquired Company has received from any federal, state, local, or
non-U.S. taxing authority any (i) written notice indicating an intent to open
an audit or other review, (ii) request for information related to Tax matters,
or (iii) notice of deficiency or proposed adjustment for any amount of Tax
proposed, asserted, or assessed by any taxing authority against the Acquired
Companies.

  

  

(d) No Acquired Company is a party to or bound by any Tax-sharing or
allocation agreement that will be in existence as of the Closing Date.

  

  

(e) Except as set forth on Section 3.17(e) of the Disclosure Schedules, each
of the Acquired Companies is properly classified as a disregarded entity for
federal income Tax purposes. No Acquired Company (A) has been a member of an
Affiliated Group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than a
group the common parent of which was an Acquired Company) or (B) has any
liability for the Taxes of any Person (other than an Acquired Company) under
Treas. Reg. Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local, or
non-U.S. law), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise.

  

  

(f) The unpaid Taxes of the Acquired Companies (A) did not, as of the Interim
Balance Sheet Date, exceed the reserve for Tax liability (rather than any
reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between
book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the Interim Balance Sheet
(rather than in any notes thereto) and (B) do not exceed that reserve as
adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing Date in accordance with
the past custom and practice of the Acquired Companies in filing their Tax
Returns. Since the Interim Balance Sheet Date, no Acquired Company has
incurred any liability for Taxes arising from extraordinary gains or losses,
as that term is used in GAAP, outside the ordinary course of business
consistent with past custom and practice.

  

  

(g) All Taxes which an Acquired Company is obligated to withhold from amounts
owing to any employee, shareholder, member, independent contractor, creditor
or third party of an Acquired Company have been timely and properly paid or
accrued.

  

  

(h) No Acquired Company will be required to include any item of income in, or
exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for any taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a result of any: (i) change
in method of accounting for a taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing
Date; (ii) "closing agreement" as described in Code Section 7121 (or any
corresponding or similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S. income Tax
law) executed on or prior to the Closing Date; (iii) intercompany transaction
or excess loss account described in Treasury Regulations under Code Section
1502 (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S.
income Tax law); (iv) installment sale or open transaction disposition made on
or prior to the Closing Date; (v) prepaid amount received on or prior to the
Closing Date; or (vi) election under Code §108(i).

  

  

(i) Each Benefit Plan that is a "non-qualified deferred compensation plan" (as
such term is defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) and not otherwise
exempt from Section 409A of the Code, has been maintained, in form and
operation in compliance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and
applicable guidance issued thereunder, and no amounts under any such Benefit
Plan has been subject to the interest and additional tax set forth under
Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code.

  

  

(j) No Acquired Company is or has been a party to any "reportable
transaction," as defined in Code Section 6707A(c)(1) and Treas. Reg. Section
1.6011-4(b).

  

  

Section 3.18 Brokers. Except for Morgan Keegan and Associates, Inc., no broker,
finder or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finder's or other
fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Seller and all such
fees and expenses and other obligations payable in connection therewith will
be paid by Seller or treated as a Company Transaction Expense.

  

  

Section 3.19 Indebtedness. Except as set forth on Section 3.19 of the
Disclosure Schedules, no Acquired Company is a guarantor for any liability
(including Indebtedness) of any other Person. Except as set forth on Section
3.19 of the Disclosure Schedules, no Acquired Company has any outstanding
Indebtedness.

by the aggregate dollar amount of proceeds paid to such sellers, (B) the five
(5) largest sellers of accounts or receivables pursuant to forward flow
arrangements determined by the aggregate dollar amount of proceeds paid to
such sellers and (C) the five (5) highest paid suppliers, service providers
and other similar business relations, in the aggregate, of the Acquired
Companies for the years ended December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2011 and
through the date of the Interim Financial Statements ("Material Suppliers"),
and sets forth opposite the name of each such Material Supplier the amount
paid to such to such Material Supplier during such period. No Acquired Company
has received any written notice from any Material Supplier, and Seller has no
Knowledge, that (i) such Material Supplier has stopped or terminated, or
expects to stop or terminate, supplying for sale to any Acquired Company
accounts or receivables or (ii) any Acquired Company is no longer invited to
participate in the purchase of accounts or receivables that will be sold by
such Material Supplier in the future (whether as a result of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise).

  

  

Section 3.21 Originated Loans; Credit Card Utilization; Putbacks.

  

  

(a) The loans and fee receivables of the Acquired Companies that are
originated by an Acquired Company and included on the Interim Balance Sheet
and arising subsequent to the Interim Balance Sheet Date represent loans and
fees related to loans in connection with credit cards opened under the
Acquired Company's balance transfer program in the ordinary course of business
(the "Originated Loans and Fees"). Except as set forth on Section 3.21(a) of
the Disclosure Schedules, there are no amounts due, or to become due, in an
aggregate amount in excess of $500,000 in respect of such Originated Loans and
Fees where the obligors thereunder have indicated in writing are in dispute.

  

  

(b) Section 3.21(b) of the Disclosure Schedules sets forth the un-utilized
open-to-buy credit outstanding on the Acquired Companies' credit card
portfolio as of April 30, 2012.

  

  

(c) Section 3.21(c) of the Disclosure Schedules sets forth any seller of
accounts that since January 1, 2010 has repurchased more than 15% of the
aggregate accounts that have been sold by such seller to the Acquired
Companies pursuant to one or more Receivables Agreements.

times licensed to buy and hold the consumer credit obligations it has owned as
required by the various states in which JCAP does business, including, without
limitation, any applicable collection agency licenses and debt buyer licenses,
and, immediately following the Pre-Closing Reorganization, Credit Logistics is

(e) Except as set forth on Section 3.22(e) of the Disclosure Schedules, to
Seller's Knowledge, (i) no third party collection agency to which the Acquired

to own, operate or lease the properties and assets now owned, operated or

Section 5.02 Employees; Benefit Plans.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller has taken all necessary actions to

(b) Section 5.02(b) of the Disclosure Schedules lists each Employee, each
Employee's base salary or hourly wages and target bonus opportunities and each
such Employee's status as actively employed or on leave.

subsidiaries (collectively, "Buyer Benefit Plans") in which any Employees will
participate after the expiration of the period set forth in the Transition
Services Agreement during which Seller will continue to provide certain
coverage for the Employees under the Seller Benefit Plans (the "Transition
Period"), Buyer shall, or shall cause the applicable Acquired Company to,
recognize all service of the Employees recognized under the corresponding
Benefit Plan in which the Employee participated immediately prior to the
expiration of the Transition Period, as if such service were with Buyer, for
eligibility and vesting purposes in any Buyer Benefit Plan in which such
Employees may be eligible to participate after the expiration of the
Transition Period (other than for purposes of vesting of future equity
awards); provided, however, such service shall not be recognized to the extent
that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

20  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i) each Employee
to be eligible to participate, without any waiting time, as soon as
administratively practicable, in any and all Buyer Benefit Plans to the extent
coverage under any such Buyer Benefit Plan is to replace any comparable
Benefit Plan in which such Employee participated immediately before the
expiration of the Transition Period provided such Employee would have been
eligible to participate under the comparable Benefit Plan; and (ii) for
purposes of each Buyer Benefit Plan providing medical, dental, drug and vision
benefits to any Employee, Buyer shall cause all waiting periods, pre-existing
condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-
work or similar requirements of such Buyer Benefit Plan to be waived for such
Employee and his or her covered dependents to the same extent as under the
comparable Benefit Plan, and Buyer shall cause any eligible expenses incurred
by such Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the
plan year of the Benefit Plan ending on the date of such Employee's
participation in the corresponding Buyer Benefit Plan begins to be given full
credit under such Buyer Benefit Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such Buyer Benefit Plan.

account balances under any Qualified Benefit Plan. Buyer shall cause any Buyer
Benefit Plan qualified under Section 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code to accept
direct rollovers directed by any Employee from any such Benefit Plan in which
the Employee participated on or before the Closing in the form of cash and
outstanding participant loans, if any, from the applicable Benefit Plan.

  

  

(f) The Buyer Benefit Plans shall have exclusive responsibility for the
provision of health care continuation coverage required under COBRA or other
applicable Law with respect to any Employee (and any dependent of any
Employee) who has a "qualifying event" within the meaning of Section 4980B(f)
of the Code (or other applicable Law) under a Buyer Benefit Plan on or after
the Closing Date.

each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 5.02,
express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person (including employees,
retirees, or dependents or beneficiaries of employees or retirees) any rights
or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 5.02.
Nothing contained herein, express or implied, shall be construed to establish,
amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement or limit
Buyer's or the Acquired Companies' ability to amend, modify or terminate any
particular benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in this Section 5.02 shall not
create any right in any Employee or any other Person to any continued
employment with an Acquired Company, Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever.

  

  

(h) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, Seller, in its
sole discretion, may elect to pay transaction bonuses to one or more Employees
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated under
this Agreement. Seller shall bear all liability for any such transaction
bonuses. In addition, Buyer agrees to pay, or cause to be paid, not later than
the payroll immediately following the Closing Date, the "Closing Bonus
Payments" identified in item 2 on Section 3.07(a)(ii) of the Disclosure

or omissions occurring on or after the Closing Date. Seller shall indemnify

Acquired Company, as provided in the Organizational Documents of the Acquired
Company, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall
survive the Closing Date and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their respective terms to the extent permitted by Law.

  

  

(b) The obligations of Buyer and the Acquired Companies under this Section
5.04 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely
affect any director or officer to whom this Section 5.04 applies without the
consent of such affected director or officer (it being expressly agreed that
the directors and officers to whom this Section 5.04 applies shall be third-
party beneficiaries of this Section 5.04, each of whom may enforce the
provisions of this Section 5.04).

  

  

(c) In the event Buyer, an Acquired Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its

provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer or the
Acquired Company, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.04.

  

  

Section 5.05 Buyer Debt Facility. Buyer agrees that it will not consent to any

(d) Following the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies
to, not disclose and keep confidential any books, records or other
information, electronic or otherwise, of Seller that is not primarily related
to the Acquired Companies or the Employees and that is inadvertently included
in the books and records provided to Buyer, except as required by Law or any
other legal process. In the event that Buyer or any of its Affiliates is
requested or required (by oral question or request for information or
documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil
investigative demand, or similar process) to disclose any such information,
Buyer shall notify Seller promptly of the request or requirement so that Buyer
may seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the
provisions of this Section 5.06(d). If, in the absence of a protective order
or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, Buyer is, on the advice of counsel,
compelled to disclose any such information, Buyer may disclose such
information; provided, however, that Buyer shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain, at the reasonable request of Seller and at
Seller's expense, an order or other assurance that confidential treatment will
be accorded to such portion of such information required to be disclosed as
Seller shall designate.

  

  

Section 5.07 Public Announcements. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law
or stock exchange requirement (based upon the reasonable advice of counsel),
neither party to this Agreement shall, and shall cause its respective
Affiliates not to, make any public announcements in respect of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise communicate with any news
media regarding the terms of this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), and the parties shall cooperate as to the timing and contents of any
such announcement. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.07 to the
contrary, each party hereto shall be allowed to disclose the terms of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (i) to authorized
representatives and employees of such party or its Affiliates, (ii) to its and
its Affiliates' investors in connection with summary information about such
party's or any of its Affiliates' financial condition, (iii) to any of such
party's Affiliates, auditors, attorneys, financing sources, potential
investors or other agents or any other Person to whom such party discloses
such information in the ordinary course of business, (iv) following the
Closing to any bona fide prospective purchaser of the equity or assets of such
party or its Affiliates and (v) as required to be disclosed by order of a
Governmental Authority, or by subpoena, summons or legal process, or by law,
rule or regulation so long as such party notified the other party promptly of
the requirement to disclose so that the other party was able to seek an
appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this
Section 5.07.

  

  

Section 5.08 Further Assurances. Following the Closing, each of the parties
hereto shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute and
deliver such additional documents, instruments, conveyances and assurances,
and take such further actions as may be reasonably required to carry out the
provisions hereof and give effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

  

Section 5.09 Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, value added and other such Taxes and fees (including any
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement, if any,
shall be borne and paid equally fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and fifty percent
(50%) by Seller when due. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate to timely file any
Tax Return or other document with respect to such Taxes or fees.

  

  

Section 5.10 Release. Effective as of the Closing, Seller on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) hereby unconditionally
and irrevocably acquits, remises, discharges and forever releases the Acquired
Companies and their respective Affiliates, partners, managers, employees,
officers, directors and agents (collectively, the "Releasees") from any and
all liabilities and obligations of every kind whatsoever, whether accrued or
fixed, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured or determined or
determinable, including those arising under any Applicable Laws, contract,
agreement, arrangement, commitment or undertaking, whether written or oral to
the extent arising on or prior to the date hereof, except for any rights of
Seller under this Agreement or arising after the Closing under any contract
listed on Section 5.10 of the Disclosure Schedules. Seller hereby terminates,
and as agent for and on behalf of each of its Affiliates (other than the
Acquired Companies) terminates, any contract between Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies), on the other hand, and any
Acquired Company, on the other hand, except for any contract or intercompany
payables listed or referenced on Section 5.10 of the Disclosure Schedules.

  

  

Section 5.11 Confidentiality. For a period of two (2) years following the
Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (other than the
Acquired Companies) to, treat and hold as confidential all of the Confidential
Information and refrain from disclosing any of the Confidential Information.
In the event that Seller or any of its Affiliates is requested or required (by
oral question or request for information or documents in any legal proceeding,
interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or similar process) to
disclose any Confidential Information, Seller shall notify Buyer promptly of
the request or requirement so that Buyer may seek an appropriate protective
order or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section 5.11. If, in the
absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, Seller is,
on the advice of counsel, compelled to disclose any Confidential Information,
Seller may disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information that is
legally requested or required to be disclosed in the opinion of Seller\'s
counsel; provided, however, that Seller shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain, at the reasonable request of Buyer and at Buyer's expense,
an order or other assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to
such portion of the Confidential Information required to be disclosed as Buyer
shall designate.

  

  

Section 5.12 Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation; Etc.

  

  

(a) Seller agrees and acknowledges that it is familiar with the trade secrets
and other information of a confidential or proprietary nature of the Acquired
Companies, their respective businesses and their respective business
relations. Seller further agrees and acknowledges that Seller has special
knowledge of the businesses of the Acquired Companies and that in order to
assure Buyer that the Acquired Companies' businesses and the Interests will
retain their value, it is necessary that Seller not engage in the Restricted
Businesses (as defined below) during the applicable Restricted Periods. Seller
also agrees and acknowledges that Buyer and its Affiliates would be
irreparably damaged if Seller were to engage in the Restricted Businesses
during the applicable Restricted Periods and that any such competition would
result in a significant loss of goodwill by Buyer and its Affiliates in
respect of such businesses and the Interests. Seller further agrees and
acknowledges that the covenants and agreements set forth in this Section 5.12
were a material inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement and to
perform its obligations hereunder, and that Buyer and its Affiliates would not
obtain the benefit of the bargain set forth in this Agreement as specifically
negotiated by the parties hereto if Seller breached any of the provisions of
this Section 5.12.

  

  

(b) Therefore, in further consideration of the amounts to be paid hereunder at
the Closing in exchange for the sale of the Interests, and the goodwill of the
businesses of the Acquired Companies sold in connection therewith, Seller
agrees that, except as set forth in this subsection (b) and in subsections (c)
and (e) below (i) from and after the Closing Date and continuing for four (4)
years from the Closing Date (the "Bankrupt Accounts Restricted Period") it
shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, either for itself or through or with any other Person in any
capacity, own, operate, manage, control, engage in, invest in, or participate
in any manner in, act as a consultant or advisor to, render services for
(alone or in association with any Person), or otherwise assist any Person that
engages in or owns, invests in, operates, manages or controls any venture or
enterprise that directly or indirectly engages or proposes to engage anywhere
within the United States or the United Kingdom (the "Territory") in the
business of acquiring or servicing charged-off receivables associated with
charged-off accounts associated with Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 (or similar Law
in the United Kingdom) bankruptcy-related debt of any other Person (other than
Seller or any of its Affiliates) (the "Bankrupt Accounts Restricted
Businesses") and (ii) from and after the Closing Date and continuing for two
(2) years from the Closing Date (the "Delinquent Accounts Restricted Period"
and together with the Bankruptcy Charged-Off Restricted Period, the
"Restricted Periods"), it shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates
not to, directly or indirectly, either for itself or through or with any other
Person in any capacity, own, operate, manage, control, engage in, invest in,
or participate in any manner in, act as a consultant or advisor to, render
services for (alone or in association with any Person), or otherwise assist
any Person that engages in or owns, invests in, operates, manages or controls
any venture or enterprise that directly or indirectly engages or proposes to
engage anywhere within the Territory in the business of acquiring or servicing
charged-off receivables associated with (A) normal delinquency charged-off
accounts of any Person (other than Seller or any of its Affiliates) or (B)
charged-off accounts acquired through offering additional general purpose
credit as an incentive to repay charged-off accounts and improve liquidation
rates on the charged-off balance (specifically, the Acquired Companies'
balance transfer program) (the "Delinquent Accounts Restricted Businesses" and
together with the Bankrupt Accounts Restricted Businesses, the "Restricted
Businesses"); provided, however, that nothing herein shall prohibit or
otherwise restrict Seller or any of its Affiliates from (1) acquiring, owning,
or otherwise investing in charged-off receivables covered by the Restricted
Businesses above if acquired after the date hereof pursuant to an acquisition,
whether in one transaction or a series of related transactions, of non-
charged-off portfolios if the Weighted Average Account Value Percentage is
greater than 20%, (2) servicing charged-off receivables and accounts, whether
on behalf of Seller or any other Person (whether or not such Person is engaged
in the Restricted Businesses), or (3) owning, investing in, or participating
on the board of directors (or similar governing body) of, any Person in which
Seller or any of its Affiliates owns less than 30% of the Capital Stock of
such Person. For purposes of this Section 5.12(b), "Weighted Average Account
Value Percentage" shall mean (i) the purchase price of the receivables
portfolio as specified in the relevant acquisition agreement for the
receivables portfolio, divided by (ii) the face value of all receivables in
such receivables portfolio determined as specified in the relevant acquisition
agreement for such receivables portfolio.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

22  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) If, during the applicable Restricted Periods, Seller or any of its
Affiliates, directly or indirectly, acquires more than 30% of the equity or a
majority of the assets of, or otherwise acquires or merges with or into any
other Person (an "Acquired Person," such acquisition or merger an
"Acquisition") and immediately before the consummation of such Acquisition the
Acquired Person is engaged in a Restricted Business, then upon and after the
effective date of such Acquisition, it shall not be a violation of Section
5.12(b) for Seller or any of its Affiliates to engage in such acquired
Restricted Business, directly or indirectly, provided that (i) the primary
purpose of the Acquisition is other than to engage in the Restricted
Businesses, (ii) such acquired Restricted Business is an Excepted Restricted
Business, and (iii) the Acquired Person does not bid for or acquire pools of
charged-off receivables following the Acquisition other than pursuant to
contractual commitments in existence as of the date of the Acquisition or as
permitted by the other provisions of this Section 5.12. For the purposes
hereof, an "Excepted Restricted Business" is one for which the Restricted
Business so acquired constitutes less than twenty percent (20%) of the gross
assets or gross revenues of the Acquired Person (determined on a consolidated
basis in accordance with GAAP) for the last full fiscal year of the Acquired
Person prior to the effective date of such Acquisition.

  

  

(d) During the Bankrupt Accounts Restricted Period, Seller shall not, and
shall cause each of its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, in any
other capacity without the prior written consent of Buyer, employ, engage,
recruit or solicit for employment or engagement (other than by a general
solicitation advertisement, posting or similar job solicitation process not
targeting the employees of any Acquired Company so long as such solicitation
does not result in a hiring or engagement), any Person who is employed or
engaged by any Acquired Company with respect to any Acquired Company's
business as of the Closing Date (other than any such Person that is terminated
by Buyer or an Acquired Company following the Closing and such Person has not
been employed by Buyer or an Acquired Company for at least nine months), or
otherwise seek to interfere with, influence or alter any such Person's
relationship with any of the foregoing.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of the provisions of
this Section 5.12 shall apply to or bind, directly or indirectly, (i) any
Person that is not an Affiliate of Seller on the Closing Date that, directly
or indirectly, acquires, in one transaction or a series of transactions, by
purchase of stock or assets, merger, recapitalization, consolidation or
otherwise, a majority of the Capital Stock of Seller following the Closing
Date, or (ii) any Affiliate of Seller (other than any Subsidiary of Seller)
that engages, directly or indirectly, as of the Closing, in a material manner
(A) in a Delinquent Accounts Restricted Business with respect to such
Delinquent Accounts Restricted Business as engaged by such Affiliate or (B) in
a Bankrupt Accounts Restricted Businesses listed on Section 5.12(e) of the
Disclosure Schedules with respect to such Bankrupt Restricted Businesses as
engaged by such Affiliate.

  

  

(f) Seller recognizes that the territorial, time and scope limitations set
forth in this Section 5.12 are reasonable and are properly required to protect
Buyer's substantial investment hereunder and for the protection of Buyer's
legitimate interest in client relationships, goodwill and trade secrets of the
Acquired Companies' businesses, and that such limitations would not impose any
undue burden upon Seller. In the event that any such territorial, time or
scope limitation is deemed to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable by a
court of competent jurisdiction, Buyer and Seller agree to the reduction of
any or all of said territorial, time or scope limitations to such an area,
period or scope as said court shall deem reasonable or enforceable under the
circumstances. If such partial enforcement is not possible in such
jurisdiction, the provision shall be deemed severed as to such jurisdiction,
and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect.

  

  

(g) Seller acknowledges and agrees that the covenants set forth in this
Section 5.12 hereof are reasonable and necessary for the protection of Buyer's
and the Acquired Companies' business interests, that irreparable injury will
result to Buyer and/or the Acquired Companies if Seller breaches any of the
terms of this Section 5.12, and that in the event of Seller's actual or
threatened breach of any of the provisions contained in this Section 5.12,
Buyer will have no adequate remedy at law. Seller accordingly agrees that in
the event of any actual or threatened breach by it of any of the provisions
contained in this Section 5.12, Buyer shall be entitled to the following
rights and remedies, each of which rights and remedies shall be independent of
the others and severally enforceable: (i) such injunctive and other equitable
relief as may be deemed necessary or appropriate by a court of competent
jurisdiction and (ii) the right and remedy to require Seller to account for
and pay over to Buyer any profits, monies, accruals, increments or other
benefits derived or received by Seller as the result of any transactions or
conduct constituting a breach of any of the provisions contained in this.
Nothing contained herein shall be construed as prohibiting Buyer from pursuing
any other remedies available to it for such breach or threatened breach,
including the recovery of any damages which it is able to prove.

  

  

(h) Seller acknowledges and agrees that the consideration to be delivered by
Buyer at the Closing in accordance with this Agreement is alone more than
sufficient consideration for the restrictive covenants contained in this
Section 5.12. Each of the covenants contained in this Section 5.12 is intended
by each party hereto to be, and shall be construed as, an agreement
independent of any other provision in this Agreement, and the existence of any
claim or cause of action of Seller against Buyer, whether predicated on this
Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by
Buyer of any covenant in this Section 5.12. The parties hereto hereby agree
that the covenants contained in this Section 5.12 are material and substantial
parts of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

Section 5.13 Employment Taxes. Buyer and Seller agree that beginning on the
Closing Date, the alternative procedure set forth in IRS Revenue Procedure
2004-53 (2004-2 C.B. 320) shall apply with respect to the Employees and that
Seller shall provide any information or records to facilitate such procedure
as are reasonably requested by Buyer.

  

  

Section 5.14 Insurance. Following the Closing, each Acquired Company shall be
entitled to make claims against any of Seller's pre-Closing occurrence-based
insurance policies in which such Acquired Company was covered prior to the
Closing.

  

  

Section 5.15 Intellectual Property Matters. Effective as of the Closing, (i)
Seller hereby grants (and shall cause CCIP or any other Affiliate of Seller to
grant) to Buyer, the Acquired Companies, and its and their respective
successors and assigns a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, and
non-exclusive license, with the right to sublicense, under any Intellectual
Property Rights that are owned as of the Closing by Seller, CCIP, or any
Affiliate of Seller but that were used in the conduct of the business of the
Acquired Companies prior to Closing, to use, reproduce, display, perform and
practice such Intellectual Property Rights solely in connection with the
conduct of such business after the Closing and in the manner generally used
prior to Closing, and (ii) Buyer, on behalf of the Acquired Companies, hereby
grants to Seller, its Affiliates, and its and their respective successors any
assigns a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, and non-exclusive
license, with the right to sublicense, under any Intellectual Property Rights
that are owned as of the Closing by the Acquired Companies, and that were used
in the conduct of the business of Seller or its post-Closing Affiliates prior
to Closing (but excluding the business of the Acquired Companies), to use,
reproduce, display, perform and practice such Intellectual Property Rights
solely in connection with the conduct of such business after the Closing and
in the manner generally used prior to Closing. The right to sublicense under
the foregoing licenses shall extend only to contractors and agents of the
applicable licensee in the context of performing services for the applicable
licensee in connection with such licensee's business to which the license
granted hereunder relates.

VII or ARTICLE VIII is referred to as the "Indemnified Party," and the party
against whom such claims are asserted under this ARTICLE VII or ARTICLE VIII
is referred to as the "Indemnifying Party." The indemnification provided for
in Section 7.02 and Section 7.03 shall be subject to all of the following
limitations, and the indemnification provided for in Section 8.01 shall be
subject to the limitations set forth in subsections (e) through (f) of this
Section 7.04:

  

  

(a) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for
indemnification under Section 7.02(a) (excluding Seller Fundamental
Representations) or Section 7.03(a) (excluding Buyer Fundamental
Representations), as the case may be, until the aggregate amount of all Losses
in respect of indemnification under Section 7.02(a) (excluding Seller
Fundamental Representations) or Section 7.03(a) (excluding Buyer Fundamental
Representations) exceeds $1,250,000 (the "Deductible"), in which event the
Indemnifying Party shall only be required to pay or be liable for Losses in
excess of the Deductible.

  

  

(b) The amount that an Indemnifying Party shall be liable to an Indemnified
Party for Losses pursuant to Section 7.02(a) or Section 7.03(a), as
applicable, shall be limited as follows:

  

  

(i) With respect to all indemnification pursuant to Section 7.02(a) and,
solely with respect to a breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement
or obligation to be performed by Seller pursuant to the Transition Services
Agreement, Section 7.02(b), other than (A) indemnification for the Seller
Special Representations (or pursuant to another provision of Article III
relating to the subject matter of a Seller Special Representation) which shall
be subject to terms of subsection (ii) below, and (B) indemnification for the
Seller Fundamental Representations which shall be subject to the terms of
subsection (iv) below, an aggregate amount of Losses not to exceed
$19,200,000;

  

  

(ii) With respect to all indemnification pursuant to Section 7.02(a) for
Seller Special Representations (or pursuant to another provision of Article

without duplication for or in substitution of indemnification pursuant to
Section 7.04(b)(i) above, an aggregate amount of Losses not to exceed
$19,200,000;

  

  

(iii) With respect to indemnification pursuant to Section 7.03(a), other than

(c) Payments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 7.02 or Section 7.03
in respect of any Loss shall be limited to the amount of any liability or
damage that remains after deducting therefrom any insurance proceeds (net of
any co-pays, deductible or increase in premiums related to such claim) and any
third party indemnity, contribution or other similar payment received by the
Indemnified Party (or the Acquired Company) in respect of any such claim. The
Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to recover

believes it would be adverse to such Indemnified Party's future business
prospects, under any third party indemnity, contribution or other similar
agreements for any Losses.

  

  

(d) In no event shall any Indemnifying Party be liable to any Indemnified
Party for any punitive damages (except to the extent paid to a third party).

reasonable steps to the extent required by Law to mitigate any Loss upon
becoming aware of any event or circumstance that would be reasonably expected
to, or does, give rise thereto.

  

  

(f) To avoid duplicative recovery, no Losses may be claimed under Section

Losses for which such Claim is made (i) are specifically identified and
included as a deduction to the Initial Purchase Price as a Company Transaction
Expense, or (ii) are included and specifically identifiable in the calculation
of any Net Charge-Off Reimbursement pursuant to Section 2.06 (and then, in
each case, only to the extent of such amounts included).

Section 7.05 Indemnification Procedures.

  

  

(a) Third-Party Claims. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any action, suit, claim or other legal proceeding
made or brought by any Person who is not a party to this Agreement or an
Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or a Representative of the foregoing (a
"Third-Party Claim") against such Indemnified Party with respect to which the
Indemnifying Party is or may be obligated to provide indemnification under
this Agreement (including pursuant to Section 8.01), the Indemnified Party
shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof. The failure
to give such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party has been materially and adversely
prejudiced by reason of such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party
shall describe the Third-Party Claim in reasonable detail, shall include
copies of all material written evidence thereof provided by the third party
and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the
Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in, or by giving
written notice to the Indemnified Party within twenty (20) days of its receipt
of a written notice of a claim expressly referencing this subsection and
stating that the Indemnified Party is responsible for all liabilities and
obligations relating to such claim for indemnification, to assume, the defense
of any Third-Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party's expense and by the
Indemnifying Party's own counsel, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in
good faith in such defense; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume such defense (unless
otherwise agreed to in writing by the Indemnified Party) and shall pay the
fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party if (1) the
claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal or quasi-criminal
Proceeding; (2) the claim primarily seeks an injunction or equitable relief
against the Indemnified Party; or (3) upon petition by the Indemnified Party,
the appropriate court rules that the Indemnifying Party failed or is failing
to vigorously prosecute or defend such claim. If the Indemnifying Party has
elected to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim pursuant to the prior
sentence, then the Indemnified Party may instead assume the defense of a
Third-Party Claim for reasons other than those specified in (1) through (3)
above to the extent it gives written notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party
and expressly references this subsection and states that the Indemnified Party
is responsible for all liabilities and obligations, and releases the
Indemnifying Party from any and all obligations of indemnification, relating
to such Third-Party Claim. In the event that the Indemnifying Party assumes
the defense of any Third-Party Claim, subject to Section 7.05(b), it shall
have the right to take such reasonable action to avoid, dispute, defend,
appeal or make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third-Party Claim in the
name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have
the right, at its own cost and expense, to participate in the defense of any
Third-Party Claim with counsel selected by it subject to the Indemnifying
Party's right to control the defense thereof, except that the Indemnifying
Party shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel if
(A) the Indemnified Party has been advised by counsel that a reasonable
likelihood exists of a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party and such conflict cannot be waived, (B) an adverse
determination with respect to the Third-Party Claim would reasonably be
expected to be materially detrimental to the Indemnified Party's business, or
(C) the Third-Party Claim relates to a Proceeding by a Governmental Authority.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any fees and expenses of separate counsel of
the Indemnified Party that are incurred prior to the date the Indemnifying
Party effectively assumes control of such defense shall be borne by the
Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to compromise or
defend such Third-Party Claim or fails to promptly notify the Indemnified
Party in writing of its election to defend as provided in this Agreement, the
Indemnified Party may, subject to Section 7.05(b), pay, compromise, defend
such Third-Party Claim and seek indemnification for any and all Losses based
upon, arising from or relating to such Third-Party Claim. Seller and Buyer
shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects in connection with
the defense of any Third-Party Claim, including making available (subject to
the provisions of Section 5.06) records relating to such Third-Party Claim and
furnishing, without expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket
expenses) to the defending party, management employees of the non-defending
party as may be reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of
such Third-Party Claim.

  

  

(b) Settlement of Third-Party Claims. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of any
Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as
provided in this Section 7.05(b). If a firm offer is made to settle a Third-
Party Claim without leading to liability or the creation of a financial or
other obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party or subject the
Indemnified Party to injunctive or other equitable relief and provides, in
customary form, for the unconditional release of each Indemnified Party from
all liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third-Party Claim and
the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such offer, the
Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to that effect to the Indemnified
Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer within ten
days after its receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party may continue to
contest or defend such Third-Party Claim and in such event, the maximum
liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such Third-Party Claim shall not
exceed the amount of such settlement offer plus the costs and expenses of
defending such Third Party Claim incurred prior to such notice. If the
Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer and also fails to assume
defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle the
Third-Party Claim upon the terms set forth in such firm offer to settle such
Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant
to Section 7.05(a), it shall not agree to any settlement unless (i) the
settlement of the Third-Party Claim will not lead to liability or the creation
of a financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnifying Party or
subject the Indemnifying Party to injunctive or other equitable relief and
provides, in customary form, for the unconditional release of each
Indemnifying Party from all liabilities and obligations in connection with
such Third-Party Claim, or (ii) the Indemnifying Party provides its written
consent to such settlement (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed).

  

  

(c) Direct Claims. Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third-Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be
asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party prompt written
notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not,
however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations,
except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has been materially
and adversely prejudiced by reason of such failure. Such notice by the
Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail and
shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss
that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying
Party shall have 30 days after its receipt of such notice to respond in
writing to such Direct Claim. During such 30-day period, the Indemnified Party
shall allow the Indemnifying Party and its professional advisors to
investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct
Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in respect of the
Direct Claim and the Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying Party's
investigation by giving such information and assistance (including access to
the Acquired Company's premises and personnel and the right to examine and
copy any accounts, documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of
its professional advisors may reasonably request (subject to the provisions of
Section 5.06). If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such
30-day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have rejected such
claim, in which case the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such
remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and subject
to the provisions of this Agreement.

  

  

(d) Manner of Payment. Any indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE VII or
ARTICLE VIII shall be effected (i) in the case of an indemnification claim
resolved by agreement of the parties or pursuant to a final, non-appealable
order of a court of competent jurisdiction in favor of a Seller Indemnified
Party, by wire transfer of immediately available funds from Buyer to an
account(s) designated in writing by Seller within fifteen (15) days after the
determination thereof and (ii) in the case of an indemnification claim
resolved by agreement of the parties or pursuant to a final, non-appealable
order of a court of competent jurisdiction in favor of a Buyer Indemnified
Party, by wire transfer of immediately available funds from Seller to an
account(s) designated in writing by such Buyer Indemnified Party within
fifteen (15) days after the determination thereof; provided that any
indemnification owed by Seller to the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to
(ii) above shall first be satisfied out of the Escrow Accounts pursuant to the
terms of the Escrow Agreement or by cancelling amounts owing by Buyer or any
of its subsidiaries to Seller or any of its Affiliates under the Buyer Debt
Facility Agreement up to $4,600,000 (less any indemnification claims paid from
the Debt Escrow Account or previous amounts offset against amounts owing by
Buyer or any of its subsidiaries to Seller under the Buyer Debt Facility
Agreement in respect of indemnification claims hereunder).

  

  

Section 7.06 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification
payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the parties as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax, accounting and other purposes,
unless otherwise required by Law.

  

  

Section 7.07 Exclusive Remedies. Subject to Section 9.11 and ARTICLE VIII, the
parties acknowledge and agree that their sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to any and all claims (other than claims arising from fraud on the
part of a party hereto in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement, shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions
set forth in this ARTICLE VII. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party
hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted under Law, any and all rights,
claims and causes of action for any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to
the subject matter of this Agreement it may have against the other parties
hereto and their Affiliates and each of their respective Representatives
arising under or based upon any Law, except pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this ARTICLE VII and ARTICLE VIII. Nothing in this
Section 7.07 shall limit any Person's right to seek and obtain any equitable
relief to which any Person shall be entitled pursuant to Section 9.11 or to
seek any remedy on account of fraud by any Person.

  

  

Section 7.08 Effect of Investigation. The right to indemnification, payment of
Losses of a Buyer Indemnified Party or for other remedies based on any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of Seller contained in or
made pursuant to this Agreement shall not be affected by (i) any investigation
conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being
acquired) at any time, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or
compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation or
(ii) the waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any representation
or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any covenant or
obligation, and will not affect the right to indemnification based on such
representations, warranties, covenants and obligations.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

26  

  

 

 

 

  

Section 7.09 Materiality. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, for purposes of determining whether there has been a breach and the
amount of Losses that are the subject matter of a claim for indemnification or
reimbursement hereunder, each representation and warranty in this Agreement
shall be read without regard and without giving effect to the term "material"
or "Material Adverse Effect" or similar phrases contained in such
representation or warranty; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to
Section 3.06 and Section 3.07(b)(i) or the terms "Material Collection
Agencies," "Material Contract," "Material Permit" or "Material Supplier."

  

  

ARTICLE VIII

  

Tax Matters

  

  

Section 8.01 Tax Indemnification. Subject to Sections 7.04(c) through (f) and
Section 7.05, from and after the Closing Date, Seller shall indemnify the
Buyer and hold it harmless from and against any Losses arising from (i) any
and all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of the Acquired Companies for all
taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and the portion through
the end of the Closing Date for any taxable period that includes (but does not
end on) the Closing Date ("Pre-Closing Tax Period"), (ii) any and all Taxes of
any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined, or unitary group of which
any Acquired Company (or any predecessor of any of the foregoing) is or was a
member on or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treas. Reg.
Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state, local, or non-U.S. law or
regulation, and (iii) any and all Taxes of any person (other than an Acquired
Company) imposed on an Acquired Company as a transferee or successor, by
contract or pursuant to any law, rule or regulation, which Taxes relate to an
event or transaction occurring before the Closing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify Buyer for any Taxes
(A) actually paid on or prior to the Closing Date, or (B) any withholding,
payroll, employment, social security or other similar Taxes, accrued for as of
June 30, 2012 and thereafter in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practices.

  

  

Section 8.02 Straddle Period. In the case of any taxable period that includes
(but does not end on) the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the amount of
any Taxes for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an
interim closing of the books as of the close of business of the Closing Date
(and for such purpose, the taxable period of any partnership or other pass-
through entity in which any Acquired Company holds a beneficial interest shall
be deemed to terminate at such time); provided, however, that with respect to
Taxes (other than income, wage, franchise/capital, sales, use, or withholding
Taxes) or exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an
annual basis, and not on a closing of the books method, such Taxes,
exemptions, allowances, or deductions shall be allocated between the period
ending on and including the Closing Date and the period beginning after the
Closing Date based on the number of days for the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on and including the Closing Date, on the one hand, and the
number of days for the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after the
Closing Date, on the other hand.

  

  

Section 8.03 Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns. Buyer shall prepare and
file or cause to be prepared and filed all Tax Returns that (i) are required
to be filed by or with respect to the Acquired Companies (and not as part of a
larger consolidated or combined group that includes entities other than the
Acquired Companies), and (ii) that are due after the Closing Date. With
respect to any Tax Returns in the preceding sentence for a taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date (any "Pre-Closing
Return"), such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past
practice, unless a more likely than not basis does not exist for such
position. With respect to any Pre-Closing Return, Buyer shall deliver a copy
of such Tax Return to Seller for its review and comment not less than fifteen
(15) days prior to the date on which such Tax Return is due to be filed
(taking into account any applicable extensions). If the Parties disagree as to
any item reflected on any such Pre-Closing Return, they shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve such disagreement. If they cannot reach a final
resolution by ten (10) days before the due date of such Pre-Closing Return
(taking into account any applicable extension) the matter shall be submitted
to an independent accounting firm for resolution, the costs of which shall be
borne equally fifty percent (50%) by Seller and fifty percent (50%) by Buyer.

  

  

Section 8.04 Cooperation on Tax Matters. Buyer, Seller and the Acquired
Companies shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by
the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this
Article VIII and, subject to the obligations of the parties pursuant to
Section 7.05, any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes.
Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other Party's
request) the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant
to any such audit, litigation or other Proceeding and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder.

  

  

Section 8.05 Tax-Sharing Agreements. All tax-sharing agreements or similar
agreements with respect to or involving the Acquired Companies shall be
terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the Acquired
Companies shall not be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

  

  

Section 8.06 Certain Tax Matters. Seller and Buyer acknowledge and agree that
each of the Acquired Companies are disregarded entities of Seller and that for
federal income Tax purposes the transfer of the Purchased Interests will be
treated as a taxable sale of one hundred percent (100%) undivided interest in
the assets of the Acquired Companies by Seller to Buyer.
