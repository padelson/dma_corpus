</FONT>As of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Documents are in full force and effect and have not been withdrawn or terminated
or otherwise amended, supplemented or modified in any respect. Each of the Debt Commitment Documents, in the form so delivered,
is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto and enforceable in
accordance with their respective terms against Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, against each of the other parties thereto
(except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by the applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or
similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors&rsquo; rights generally or by general principles of equity). As of the date
hereof, other than the Debt Commitment Documents, there are no engagement letters, side letters, contracts or other agreements
or arrangements relating to the Debt Financing or to the ability of Parent to make a drawing on the Letter of Credit or the issuer
thereof to honor such drawing. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
(i) would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Acquisition Sub, or, to the Knowledge of Parent, on the part
of any other party thereto, under any term, (ii) would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in a failure of any condition
to the full funding under the Debt Commitment Letters or (iii) would, or would reasonably be expected to, otherwise result in any
portion of the Debt Financing or the Letter of Credit contemplated thereby to be unavailable on a timely basis, and in any event,
not later than the Closing. As of the date hereof, neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub has reason to believe that it will be unable
to satisfy on a timely basis, and in any event, not later than the Closing, any term or condition of the Debt Commitment Documents
required to be satisfied by it. Parent and/or Acquisition Sub have fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required
by the Debt Commitment Documents to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement. Assuming the conditions set forth in <U>Section
7.1</U> and <U>Section 7.2(c)</U> are satisfied or (to the extent permitted by Law) waived at Closing and assuming no breach by
the Company of its representations, warranties and covenants hereunder such that the conditions set forth in <U>Section 7.2</U>
would fail to be satisfied, the aggregate proceeds from the Debt Financing (including, if applicable, the Letter of Credit) (after
netting out applicable fees, expenses, original issue discount and similar premiums and charges and after giving effect to the
maximum amount of &ldquo;flex&rdquo; (including any original issue discount flex) provided for under the Debt Financing) when funded
in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letters, together with cash on hand of Parent and its Subsidiaries, in the aggregate shall
be sufficient to (i)&nbsp;fund all of the amounts required to be provided by Parent for the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and (ii) satisfy all of Parent&rsquo;s and Acquisition Sub&rsquo;s obligations under this Agreement, including
the payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration and the payment of all Expenses of the Merger (including any repayment or refinancing
of indebtedness of Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company required in connection therewith (including any Debt Payoff Amount pursuant
to <U>Section 6.13</U>). There are no conditions precedent or contingencies related to the funding or investing, as applicable,
of the full amount of the Debt Financing and the Letter of Credit at or prior to the Closing, other than as expressly set forth
in or contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters.</P>
