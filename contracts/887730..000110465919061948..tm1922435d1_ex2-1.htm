virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
Company, Parent, Acquisition Sub or the holders of any securities of the
Company or Acquisition Sub:

  



  

(a) _Cancellation of Company Securities_. Each share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock")
held by the Company or held, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Acquisition
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled
and retired and shall cease to exist as issued or outstanding shares, and no
consideration or payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in
respect thereof.

  



  

   

3

 



    



  

(b) _Conversion of Company Securities_. Except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares
canceled and retired pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ and any Dissenting Shares)
shall be converted into the right to receive $27.20 per share of Company
Common Stock in cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). Each
share of Company Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in this _Section 3.1(b)_ shall no longer be
issued or outstanding and shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to
exist, and the holders of certificates (the "Certificates") or book-entry
shares ("Book-Entry Shares") which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights
with respect to such Company Common Stock other than the right to receive,
upon surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with
_Section 3.2(b)_ , the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon.

  



  

(c) _Conversion of Acquisition Sub Capital Stock_. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, each share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of
Acquisition Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and become one (1) fully paid share of common
stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation and constitute
the only issued or outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

  



  

(d) _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this
Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the number of outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock shall occur as a result of a reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or similar
event, or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, the
Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to provide the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. Nothing in this
_Section 3.1(d)_ shall be construed to permit any party to take any action
that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this
Agreement.

  



  

Section 3.2 _Payment for Securities; Exchange of Certificates_.

  



  

(a) _Designation of Paying Agent; Deposit of Exchange Fund_. Prior
to the Closing, Parent shall designate a reputable bank or trust company (the
"Paying Agent") that is organized and doing business under the Laws of the
U.S., the identity and the terms of appointment of which to be reasonably
acceptable to the Company, to act as Paying Agent for the payment of the
Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.1(b)_ , and shall enter into an
agreement (the  "Paying Agent Agreement") relating to the Paying Agent's
responsibilities with respect thereto, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Company. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, cash
constituting an amount equal to the Aggregate Merger Consideration as reduced
pursuant to the third sentence of _Section 3.6_ (such Aggregate Merger
Consideration as deposited with the Paying Agent, the "Exchange Fund"). In
the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments
contemplated by _Section 3.1(b)_ , Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to
be deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount which is
equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payments in full.
Parent shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (A) held for the benefit of the
holders of Company Common Stock and (B) applied promptly to make payments
pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to _Section 3.1_ , except as
expressly provided for in this Agreement.

(b) _Procedures for Exchange_.

  



  

(i) _Certificates_ _. _ As promptly as reasonably practicable
following the Effective Time, and in any event not later than two (2) Business
Days thereafter, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each holder of record of a Certificate that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock: (A) a
letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the
Paying Agent and which shall be in the form and have such other provisions as
Parent and the Company may reasonably specify and (B) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration into which the number of shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant
to this Agreement (which instructions shall be in the form and have such other
provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify).

  



  

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_ _._ As promptly as reasonably practicable
following the Effective Time and in any event not later than the second (2nd)
Business Day thereafter, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Book-Entry Share not held through
The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") (and to deliver to DTC, in the case of
holders of Book-Entry Shares held through DTC) that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (A) a
letter of transmittal, which shall be in the form and have such
other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify, and (B)
instructions for returning such letter of transmittal in exchange for the
right to receive the Merger Consideration into which the number of shares of
Company Common Stock previously represented by such Book-Entry Shares shall
have been converted pursuant to this Agreement (which instructions shall be in
the form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may
reasonably specify). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, no holder of Book-Entry Shares shall be required to deliver a
Certificate to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such
holder is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_.

  



  

(c) _Timing of Exchange_. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to
the Paying Agent, together with, in the case of Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares not held through DTC, a letter of transmittal duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, or, in the case
of Book-Entry Shares held through DTC, receipt of an "agent's message" by the
Paying Agent, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such
instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each
share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share upon the later to occur of (i) the Effective Time or (ii)
the Paying Agent's receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Share, in accordance with _Section 3.2(b)_ , as
applicable, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be forthwith canceled. The Paying Agent
Agreement shall provide that the Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may
impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with customary
exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration
payable upon the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

  



  

   

5

 



    



  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
the Surviving Corporation, upon written demand, and any such holders prior to
the Merger who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation as a general creditor
thereof for payment of their claims for the Merger Consideration in respect
thereof.

  



  

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be
liable to any Person in respect of any cash held in the Exchange Fund properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall not
have been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which any cash in
respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to
or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any such cash in
respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

  



  

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent Agreement
shall provide that the Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the
Exchange Fund as directed by Parent or, after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation; _provided_ that (i) no such investment shall relieve
Parent or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this _Article
III_ , and following any losses Parent shall promptly provide additional
funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Company Common
Stock in the amount of such losses, (ii) no such investment shall have
maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this
Agreement and (iii) all such investments shall be in short-term obligations of
the U.S. with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by
the U.S. and backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Any interest or
income produced by such investments will be payable to the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as directed by Parent.

  



  

(g) _Withholding_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration and any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to
any Person such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the Treasury
Regulations or any provision of applicable federal, state, local or non-U.S.
Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid over
to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts (i) shall be promptly
remitted by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as
applicable, to the applicable Governmental Authority and (ii) shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. Parent represents
that it is not aware of any obligation under applicable Tax Law (as of the
date of this Agreement) to deduct or withhold any amount in respect of Taxes
from payments under this Agreement (other than compensatory payments to
employees). To the extent that Parent becomes aware that payments under this
Agreement (other than compensatory payments to employees) may be subject to
withholding Taxes, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
promptly notify the Company and the parties shall cooperate in good faith to
minimize or eliminate the amount of any such withholding.

Section 3.3 _Company Options, Company Restricted Stock Units and
Company Long-Term Incentive Plan Awards_.

  



  

(a) _Treatment of Company Options_. As of the Effective Time, each
Company Option (whether or not vested) that is outstanding immediately prior
thereto shall be canceled and shall entitle the holder thereof to receive in
exchange therefor, an amount in cash (subject to any applicable withholding
or other Taxes or other amounts required by applicable Law to be withheld)
equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration, over the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock underlying such Company Option (the  "Option Payment"). Following the
Effective Time, any such canceled Company Option shall no longer be
exercisable and shall only entitle the Company Option holder to the Option
Payment; _provided_ that if the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock underlying such Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration, such Company Option shall be canceled without any cash payment
or other consideration being made in respect thereof. The
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, pay through the payroll of the Surviving Corporation (or the relevant
employer subsidiary) to each holder of a Company Option the Option Payment (if
any) within five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time.

  



  

(b) _Treatment of Company Restricted Stock Units_. As of the
Effective Time, each Company Restricted Stock Unit (whether or not vested)
that is outstanding immediately prior thereto shall be canceled and shall
entitle the holder thereof to receive in exchange therefor, an amount in cash
(subject to any applicable withholding or other Taxes or other amounts
required by applicable Law to be withheld) equal to the product of (i) the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Restricted Stock Unit and (ii) the Merger Consideration (the "Restricted
Stock Unit Payment"). The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, pay through the payroll of the
Surviving Corporation (or the relevant employer subsidiary) to each holder of
a Company Restricted Stock Unit the Restricted Stock Unit Payment within five
(5) Business Days following the Effective Time.

  



  

   

7

 



    



  

(c) _Treatment of Long-Term Incentive Plan Awards_. As of the
Effective Time, each Company Long-Term Incentive Plan Award (whether or not
vested) that is outstanding immediately prior thereto shall be canceled and
shall entitle the holder thereof to receive in exchange therefor, an amount
in cash (subject to any applicable withholding or other Taxes or other amounts
required by applicable Law to be withheld) equal to: (i) with respect to the
time-based vesting portion of such Company Long-Term Incentive Plan Award,
the product of (A) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
thereto and (B) the Merger Consideration and (ii) with respect to the
performance-based vesting portion of such Company Long-Term Incentive Plan
Award, the total value of the payout (whether in the form of cash or equity-
based awards) that would have been earned assuming (A) for each Company Long-
Term Incentive Plan Award relating to the two (2) year performance period
ending on March 31, 2020, the maximum level of achievement of the applicable
performance targets and (B) for each Company Long-Term Incentive Plan Award
relating to the two (2) year performance period ending on March 31, 2021, the
greater of target and actual level of achievement of the applicable
performance targets (each such amount, together with the amount set forth in
clause (i) above, the "LTIP Payment"). The Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay through the payroll of
the Surviving Corporation (or the relevant employer subsidiary) to each
holder of a Company Long-Term Incentive Plan Award the LTIP Payment
within five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time.

  



  

(d) _Section 409A_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, with respect to any Company Equity Award that constitutes
nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code and
that the Company determines prior to the Effective Time is not eligible to be
canceled in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B),
such payment will be made at the earliest time permitted under the applicable
Company Equity Award that will not trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A
of the Code.

  



  

(e) If any payment owed to a holder of any Company Equity Award
pursuant to _Sections 3.3(a)_, _3.3(b)_ or _3.3(c)_ , as applicable, cannot
be made through the Surviving Corporation's payroll system or payroll
provider, then the Surviving Corporation shall issue a check for such payment
to such holder (subject to any applicable withholding or other Taxes or
other amounts required by applicable Law to be withheld), which check shall
be sent by courier to such holder promptly following the Effective Time (but
in no event more than five (5) Business Days thereafter).

  



  

(f) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the
Company, the Company Board and the Compensation Committee of the Company
Board, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which
are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this _Section 3.3_.

  



  

Section 3.4 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit, in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to which the holder
thereof is entitled pursuant to this _Article III_.

  



  

   

8

 



    



  

Section 3.5 _Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights_. After the
Effective Time, there shall be no registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or Paying
Agent for transfer following the Effective Time, they shall be canceled
against delivery of the applicable Merger Consideration, as provided for in
_Section 3.1(b)_ , for each share of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Payment of the Merger
Consideration in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ , and, if
applicable, any unclaimed dividends upon the surrender of Certificates, shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares.

  



  

Section 3.6 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that holders
thereof are entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL,
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly exercised and
perfected his or her demand for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, but the holders of such Dissenting Shares shall
be entitled to receive such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder
shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his
or her right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL (whether occurring
before, at or after the Effective Time), such holder's shares of Company
Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon, and such shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting
Shares. The Aggregate Merger Consideration shall be reduced, on a dollar-for-
dollar basis, as if the holder of such Dissenting Shares had not been a
stockholder on the Closing Date. The Company shall give prompt written notice
to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock,
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL received by the Company relating to appraisal demands, and Parent shall
have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do or
commit to do any of the foregoing.

  



  

Article IV 
  
  _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

  



  

Except as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter (subject to _Section
9.3(b)_ ) or in the Company SEC Documents filed by the Company with the SEC
not less than two (2) Business Days prior to the date of this Agreement
(other than any disclosures set forth under the headings "Risk Factors" or
"Forward-Looking Statements" and any other disclosures included therein to the
extent they are predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in nature) to the
extent that the applicable disclosure in the Company Disclosure Letter or the
Company SEC Documents is such that its relevance to a representation or
warranty contained in this _Article IV_ is reasonably apparent on the face of
such disclosure, the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent as
follows:

  



  

   

9

 



    



  

Section 4.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. Each
of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a corporation, partnership or other
entity duly organized, validly existing and (to the extent applicable) in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization and has the requisite entity power and authority to own, lease
and operate its properties, rights and assets and to conduct its business as
it is now being conducted, except where the failure to be in good standing or
to have such power and authority would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or
licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which
the ownership, leasing or operating of its assets, rights or properties, or
nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and
in good standing would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company's Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as may be further
amended from time to time, the "Company Certificate of Incorporation") and
the Company's Amended and Restated By-Laws (as may be further amended from
time to time, the  "Company By-Laws"), in each case, as currently in effect,
are included in the Company SEC Documents, and the Company is not in
violation of any provision of such documents, except as would not be material
to the Company.

  



  

Section 4.2 _Capitalization_.

  



  

(a) As of the close of business on November 7, 2019 (the
"Capitalization Date"), the authorized capital stock of the Company consists
of (i) 175,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock, 58,092,446 of which were
issued and outstanding, and none of which were held in treasury, (ii)
10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.10 per share, of the
Company, of which 120,000 shares are classified as Junior Participating
Preferred Stock, Series A (no shares of which were issued and
outstanding) and (iii) zero shares of non-voting common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company. Except as set forth on _Section 4.2(d)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter, there are no existing and outstanding (i)
options, warrants, calls, phantom stock, subscriptions or other rights,
convertible securities, agreements or commitments of any character to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party obligating the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell any shares of
capital stock or other equity interests in the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, or giving
any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, such shares or equity
interests, (ii) contractual or other obligations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any capital stock,
voting securities or other equity interests of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of the options, warrants, calls, subscriptions or other
rights, convertible securities, agreements or commitments described in clause
(i) of this sentence or (iii) voting trusts or similar agreements to which
the Company is a party with respect to the voting of the capital stock of the
Company. All outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are, and, at the time
of issuance, all such shares that may be issued upon the vesting,
settlement or exercise, as applicable, of Company Equity Awards will be, duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to
or issued in violation of any preemptive or similar rights, purchase option,
call rights, rights of first refusal or similar rights. None of the Company's
Subsidiaries owns any shares of Company Common Stock. Since the
Capitalization Date, no shares of capital stock of the Company, no capital
stock or other equity interests of any of the Company's Subsidiaries, and no
other securities directly or indirectly convertible into, or exchangeable or
exercisable for, capital stock of the Company, or capital stock or other
equity interests of any of the Company's Subsidiaries, have been issued
(including any dividend equivalent rights or phantom stock units), other than
shares of Company Common Stock issued upon the exercise of Company Options or
shares of Company Common Stock issued upon the vesting of Company Restricted
Stock Units or Company Long-Term Incentive Plan Awards outstanding as of the
close of business on the Capitalization Date.

  



  

   

10

 



    



  

(b) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or equivalent
equity interests of each of the Company's Subsidiaries are owned of record
and beneficially, directly or indirectly, by the Company or the relevant
wholly owned Subsidiary (except for _de minimis _ equity interests held by a
Third Party for local regulatory reasons as set forth on _Section 4.2(b)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter) and free and clear of all Liens except for
ordinary restrictions on transfer imposed by applicable securities laws
and Permitted Liens. Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock or
voting securities of, or other equity interests in, each of the Company's
Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
(in each case, to the extent applicable) and not subject to or issued in
violation of preemptive or similar rights, purchase option, call rights,
rights of first refusal or similar rights. _Section 4.2(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter sets forth all of the Subsidiaries of the Company and the
ownership of equity interests in such Subsidiary by the Company or its
Subsidiaries and any other Person. The certificates of incorporation or by-
laws (or equivalent organizational documents) of each Subsidiary of the
Company as in effect as of the date of this Agreement have been made
available to Parent. None of the Company's Subsidiaries are in
material violation of any of their respective certificates of incorporation
or by-laws (or equivalent organizational documents).

  



  

(c) Except as set forth on _Section 4.2(c)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns
any interest or investment (whether equity or debt) in any corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other entity, other than a Subsidiary of
the Company.

  



  

(d) _Section 4.2(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth,
as of the Capitalization Date, a list of all outstanding Company Equity
Awards, the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to each such
Company Equity Award (calculated using target-level performance for all
applicable Company Equity Awards), the grant date, and to the extent
applicable, the exercise price per share. Each Company Equity Award was
granted in material compliance with all applicable securities Laws, the
applicable provisions of Section 409A of the Code and all of the terms and
conditions of the Company Stock Plan pursuant to which it was issued. All
Company Options granted by the Company have been granted having a per share
exercise price at least equal to the fair market value of the underlying
equity on the date the Company Option was granted, and have not otherwise been
modified within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and associated
Treasury Department guidance.

Section 4.3 _Authority Relative to Agreement_.

  



  

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement, perform its covenants and

Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the other parties hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of

Laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors' rights and remedies

other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to

in this clause (iv)).

  



  

Section 4.4 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

  



  

(a) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company nor the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will (i) violate any provision of the Company
Certificate of Incorporation or the Company By-Laws or the equivalent
organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the Company or (ii) assuming
that the Consents, registrations, declarations, filings and notices referred

or affected or (iii) result in any breach of, or constitute a default (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to any right of
termination, modification, acceleration or cancellation of, or loss of any
benefit under, any Contract (other than any Company Benefit Plan) to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which any of their
respective properties, rights or assets is bound, or result in the creation of

or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than, in the case
of clauses (ii) and (iii) any such conflict, violation, breach, default,
termination, modification, acceleration, cancellation, loss of benefit or Lien
that would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Transaction
Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

   

12

 



    



  

(b) No consent, approval, clearance, license, permit, order or
authorization (each of the foregoing, a "Consent") of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, or notice to, any Governmental Authority is
required to be obtained or made by or with respect to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, other than (i) the applicable reporting or other requirements of
and filings with the SEC under the Exchange Act (including the filing of the
Proxy Statement), (ii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State in accordance with the DGCL and appropriate documents with
the relevant authorities of the other jurisdictions in which the Company or

the HSR Act, "Antitrust Laws") or applicable foreign investment Laws and
(viii) such other Consents, registrations, declarations, filings or notices
the failure of which to be obtained or made would not have a Company Material
Adverse Effect ( _provided_ that subclause (v) in the definition of "Company
Material Adverse Effect" shall be disregarded for purposes of this _Section
4.4(b)_ ) or a Transaction Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 4.5 _Permits; Compliance With Laws_.

  



  

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries are in possession of all
franchises, grants, accreditations, registrations, authorizations,
licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions, consents, certificates,
approvals and orders necessary for the Company and its Subsidiaries to carry
on their respective business as it is now being conducted or to own, lease or
operate their properties (the "Company Permits") and all Company Permits are
in full force and effect and no suspension or cancellation of any of
the Company Permits is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened, except where the failure to be in possession of or be in full
force and effect, or the suspension or cancellation of, any of the Company
Permits would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. No default has
occurred under, and there exists no event that, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, would result in a default under, or would give to others any
right of revocation, non-renewal, adverse modification or cancellation of any
Company Permit, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any cease and desist letters or written inquiries from any
Governmental Authority with respect to any such Company Permit, except, in
each case, as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

   

13

 



    



  

(b) Except as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the
Company and its Subsidiaries are, and since April 1, 2017, have been, in
compliance with and not in default or violation of any (i) Law applicable to
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or by which any of their respective
properties, rights or assets are bound or (ii) Company Permit. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no representation or warranty in _Section 4.5(a)_ or this
_Section 4.5(b)_ is made with respect to Company SEC Documents or
financial statements, "disclosure controls and procedures" or "internal
control over financial reporting," employee benefits matters, Intellectual

as promptly as reasonably practicable to any inquiries from, and supplying as
promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information or
documentation that may be requested by, a Governmental Authority in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the parties
hereto shall promptly (and in no event later than thirty five (35) Business
Days following the date that this Agreement is executed) make its respective
filings under the HSR Act, and any other applications and filings required
under any Antitrust Laws in the jurisdictions listed in _Section 6.3(a)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the Merger. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, obtaining any Consents, approvals or waivers of or
making any notice to any Third Party pursuant to _Section 6.3(a)(ii)_ above
or otherwise shall not be considered a condition to the obligations of Parent
and Acquisition Sub to consummate the Merger.

(b) Parent and Acquisition Sub agree to use reasonable best efforts
(and to cause their Subsidiaries to use reasonable best efforts) to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment and obtain all Consents under any
Antitrust Laws that may be required by any foreign or U.S. federal, state or
local Governmental Authority, in each case, with competent jurisdiction, so as
to enable the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, prior to the Termination Date, including
committing to or effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, trust, or
otherwise, the sale or other disposition of such assets or businesses of
Parent, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries as are required to be
divested in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of or
vacate or lift, any Order, that would otherwise have the effect of
preventing or materially delaying the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable
prior to the Termination Date (collectively, a "Remedy");  _provided_ that
Parent and Acquisition Sub shall not be required or obligated (and nothing
contained in this _Section 6.3_  or this Agreement shall require or obligate
Parent and Acquisition Sub) to take or agree to any Remedy or any other action
that would result in or account for, either individually or in the aggregate,
the one year loss of net worldwide sales revenues (as measured by 2019 sales
revenue) in excess of ninety five million dollars ($95,000,000) to Parent, the
Company and their respective Subsidiaries (taken as a whole, after giving
effect to the Merger); _provided_ , _further_ , that any such action
contemplated by this _Section 6.3(b)_ is conditioned upon the consummation of
the Merger. Without limiting the foregoing, in no event shall the Company or
any of its respective Subsidiaries propose, negotiate, effect or agree to any
action contemplated by this _Section 6.3(b)_ without the prior written
consent of Parent.

  



  

(c) Each of the parties hereto will, subject to applicable Law,
furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as
the other may reasonably request in connection with the preparation of any
required governmental filings or submissions or substantive communications
and will cooperate in responding to any inquiry from a Governmental Authority,
including (i) promptly informing the other party of such inquiry, (ii)
consulting in advance before making any presentations or submissions to
a Governmental Authority, (iii) giving the other party the opportunity to
attend and participate in any meetings, discussions or substantive telephone
calls with any Governmental Authority, to the extent not prohibited by such
Governmental Authority, and (iv) supplying each other with copies of all
material correspondence, filings or communications between any party and
any Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement. Parent and the
Company shall (to the extent permitted under applicable Law) consult with the
other party in advance of any meeting, discussion or teleconference with any
Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party,
with any other person, and, to the extent not prohibited by the Governmental
Entity or other person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings, discussions and teleconferences. The parties
shall discuss in advance the strategy and timing for obtaining any clearances
required or advisable under any applicable Law in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall take the lead in all meetings and
communications with any Governmental Authority in connection with obtaining
such clearances required under any Antitrust Law. Any materials exchanged by
the parties pursuant to this _Section 6.3_ may be redacted or withheld as
necessary to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns, and to
remove references concerning the valuation of the Company or Parent's
consideration of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or other
competitively sensitive material; _provided_ , _further_ , that the parties
hereto may, as they deem advisable and necessary, designate any materials
provided to the other under this _Section 6.3_ as "outside counsel only."

(d) Each party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the CFIUS Approval. Such efforts
shall include promptly (and not later than fifteen (15) Business Days after
the date of this Agreement, unless otherwise agreed by the parties) making
any draft filing required in connection with the CFIUS Approval in accordance
with the DPA, promptly making any final filing in connection with the CFIUS
Approval and in accordance with the DPA after receipt of confirmation that
CFIUS has no further comment to the draft filing, and providing any
information requested by CFIUS or any other agency or branch of the U.S.
government in connection with the CFIUS review or investigation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement within the timeframes set forth
in the DPA, and if CFIUS suggests or requests that, or if the parties
determine it to be appropriate that, the parties withdraw and resubmit the
filing submitted to CFIUS pursuant to this _Section 6.3(d)_ , each party
shall cooperate in withdrawing and resubmitting the CFIUS filing; _provided,
however_ , that neither party shall be under any obligation to cooperate to
resubmit such filing if the CFIUS Approval could not be obtained before the
Termination Date because the Termination Date would occur before the
conclusion of the forty-five (45) day review period as defined by the DPA.

  



  

(e) With respect to Parent, such efforts shall also include taking
or causing to be taken all action necessary to obtain the CFIUS Approval that
is customary for obtaining such approval so as to enable the consummation of
the Closing, including entering into a mitigation agreement, letter of
assurance, national security agreement, proxy agreement, trust agreement or
other similar arrangement or agreement in relation to the business and assets
of Parent or the Company, or otherwise divesting or agreeing to divest assets
of Parent, with mitigation and related terms and conditions that are customary
for such arrangements or agreements;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Company
and Parent shall not be required to take or cause to be taken or agree to take
any action in connection with this Agreement or any transactions contemplated
by this Agreement unless such action would be conditioned upon or occur
subsequent to the Closing.

  



  

(f) Parent and Acquisition Sub agree to use reasonable best
efforts (and to cause their Subsidiaries to use reasonable best efforts) to
avoid or eliminate each and every impediment and to obtain the approvals of
foreign investment and investment in mainland China for the purpose of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement issued by the
Investment Commission, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan.

  



  

(g) If required by applicable Law, each party shall, and shall

governmental bodies, including, in connection with Japanese foreign exchange
Law.

Section 6.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Upon
reasonable notice, the Company shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
to) afford to the representatives, officers, directors, employees, agents,
attorneys, accountants, Affiliates, consultants, financing sources, financial
advisors and other advisors ("Representatives") of Parent reasonable access,
in a manner not disruptive in any material respect to the operations of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, during normal business hours
and upon reasonable written notice throughout the period commencing on the
date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ , to the properties,
books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, during such period,
shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to such
Representatives all information concerning the business, properties and
personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries as may reasonably be requested
in writing, in each case, for any reasonable business purpose related to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing herein shall require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to disclose any information to Parent or Acquisition Sub if such
disclosure would, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, (i) cause
significant competitive harm to the Company or its Subsidiaries if the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated, (ii) violate
applicable Law or the confidentiality provisions of any agreement entered
into prior to the date of this Agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or (iii) jeopardize any attorney-client or other
legal privilege; _provided_ that the parties hereto shall use reasonable best
efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements under circumstances in
which such restrictions apply to allow access in a manner that does not
result in such effects; _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing herein shall
authorize Parent or its Representatives to undertake any environmental
testing involving sampling of soil, groundwater, or similar invasive
techniques at any of the properties owned, operated or leased by the Company
or its Subsidiaries, without the Company's prior written consent. No
investigation or access permitted pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ shall affect
or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the Company
hereunder; _provided_ that the foregoing will not affect any determination of
breach of such representations or warranties or the satisfaction of the
closing condition set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_. Each of Parent and
Acquisition Sub agrees that it will not, and will instruct and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives not to, use any
information obtained pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ for any competitive or
other purpose unrelated to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to minimize any disruption to the
respective business of the Company and its Subsidiaries that may result from
requests for access under this _Section 6.4_. The Confidentiality Agreement
shall apply with respect to information furnished by the Company, its
Subsidiaries and the Company's officers, employees and other Representatives
hereunder.

Section 6.5 _Non-Solicitation; Competing Proposals_.

  



  

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its directors,
officers and Subsidiaries to, and shall instruct and use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries' other Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing solicitation of, or
discussions or negotiations with, any Third Party relating to any Competing
Proposal, and the Company further agrees that it shall promptly request in
writing that all non-public information previously provided by or on behalf
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Persons be promptly returned
or destroyed in accordance with the terms of the applicable confidentiality
agreement and immediately terminate all physical and electronic dataroom
access previously granted to any such Persons or their Representatives.
Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, from the date of
this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date, if any,
on which this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_ , the
Company shall not, shall cause each of its directors, officers and
Subsidiaries not to, and shall instruct and use its reasonable best efforts
to cause its and its Subsidiaries' other Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly
facilitate, whether publicly or otherwise, any inquiry, discussion, offer or
request that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Competing Proposal, (ii) engage, continue or otherwise participate in
negotiations or discussions with (it being understood that the Company may
inform Persons of the provisions contained in this _Section 6.5_ ), or
furnish or provide access to any of the Company's or its Subsidiaries' books
and records, properties or non-public information or data to, any Person
(other than Parent, Acquisition Sub or their respective Representatives)
relating to a Competing Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal, (iii) approve or enter
into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement or similar agreement (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with this _Section 6.5_ )
providing for or relating to a Competing Proposal or requiring the Company to
abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (an  "Alternative Acquisition Agreement"), (iv) approve, endorse,
or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, endorse or recommend, any
Competing Proposal, (v) take any action to make any provision of any "fair
price," "moratorium,"  "control share acquisition" or other form of
antitakeover statute or regulation (or any related provision in the
Company Certificate of Incorporation or the Company By-Laws) inapplicable to
any transactions contemplated by a Competing Proposal or (vi) terminate,
amend, modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality agreement,
standstill or similar agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party; _provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company shall be permitted to grant a waiver of any "standstill" or similar
obligation of any Person with respect to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries solely to the extent to allow such Person to submit a
confidential Competing Proposal to the Company Board if the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
the failure to take such action would be reasonably expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

  



  

(b) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, and
in any event within forty-eight (48) hours of receipt by the Company or any
of its Representatives of any Competing Proposal or any inquiry, proposal,
offer or request that would reasonably be expected to lead to any Competing
Proposal or any solicitation, discussion communications or negotiations sought
to be initiated or continued with the Company or any of their Representatives
concerning a Competing Proposal, deliver to Parent a written notice setting
forth: (i) the identity of the Person making such Competing Proposal,
inquiry, proposal, offer or request; and (ii) the material terms and
conditions of any such Competing Proposal, inquiry, proposal, offer or request
(including a complete copy of any such Competing Proposal, inquiry, proposal,
offer or request (including copies of the current drafts of all agreements,
term sheets and financing commitments related thereto or submitted
therewith)). The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of any
material change, amendment or other modification of any such Competing
Proposal, inquiry, proposal, offer or request on a prompt basis, and in any
event within forty-eight (48) hours following the Company's receipt of such a
change, amendment or modification, including providing Parent promptly after
the receipt or delivery of copies of all written proposals, offers or draft
agreements sent to or provided to the Company, its Subsidiaries or their
Representatives with respect to such Competing Proposal, inquiry, proposal,
offer or request. The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not
to, after the date of this Agreement, enter into any Contract with any Person
that prohibits or otherwise limits the Company from providing any information
contemplated by this _Section 6.5_ to Parent, Acquisition Sub or their
Representatives, or otherwise complying with its obligations under this
_Section 6.5_.

  



  

   

45

 



    



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at
any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, in the event
that the Company receives a written Competing Proposal from any Person that
did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.5_ , the Company, the Company
Board and their Representatives may engage in negotiations or substantive
discussions with, or furnish any information and other access to, any Person
making such Competing Proposal and any of its Representatives if the Company
Board determines in good faith (A) after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors that such Competing Proposal either
constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected to result in a
Superior Proposal and (B) after consultation with outside legal counsel that
the failure to take the actions contemplated by this clause (c) would be
reasonably expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ that (x) prior to furnishing or providing access
to the Company's books and records, properties or any non-public information
or data concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries, the Company notifies
Parent in writing that it has determined to provide such access or information
and receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement
containing confidentiality terms that are not materially less favorable to
the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, it being
understood that such confidentiality agreement need not restrict the making,
or amendment, of a confidential Competing Proposal (and related confidential
communications) to the Company or the Company Board (such confidentiality
agreement, an "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement") and (y) any such non-
public information or data so furnished shall be made available to Parent
substantially concurrently with it being so furnished to such Person or its
Representatives to the extent it was not previously made available to Parent
or its Representatives.

  



  

   

46

 



    



  

(d) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 6.5(d)_ or, in
the case of clauses (A) and (C), _Section 6.5(e)_ , neither the Company Board
nor any committee of the Company Board shall (i) (A) withhold,
withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw,
qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Acquisition Sub, the
Company Recommendation, (B) approve, adopt or recommend, or propose publicly
to approve, adopt or recommend, to the Company's stockholders any Competing
Proposal, (C) fail to include the Company Recommendation, as applicable, in
the Proxy Statement or any filing, amendment or supplement relating to the
Proxy Statement, (D) fail to publicly recommend against any tender or
exchange offer that constitutes a Competing Proposal within ten (10) Business
Days after it is launched (or such fewer number of days as remain prior to
the Company Stockholders' Meeting as it may be adjourned or postponed) or (E)
fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation within ten (10) Business
Days after the written request of Parent following a Competing Proposal that
has been publicly announced (or, if the Company Stockholders' Meeting is
scheduled to be held within ten (10) Business Days of such request, within
five (5) Business Days of such request and in any event, prior to the date of
the Company Stockholders' Meeting) (any action described in this clause (i)
being referred to as an "Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii) approve or
recommend, or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to agree to,
execute or enter into, any Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to receipt of
the Company Stockholder Approval, if the Company has received an unsolicited
written Competing Proposal that did not result from a breach of this _Section
6.5_ and the Company Board has determined in good faith (after having given
effect to all of the changes, revisions, modifications and adjustments that
may be offered by Parent) (x) after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, that such Competing Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal and (y) after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take the actions in clauses (I) and (II) of this
sentence would be reasonably expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, the Company Board may (I) make an Adverse
Recommendation Change or (II) cause or permit the Company to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal concurrently with
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ and
subject to payment of the Company Termination Fee; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that (1) no Adverse Recommendation Change may be made and (2) the actions in
clause (II) of this sentence may not be effected, in each case, unless (A)
the Company Board has delivered to Parent at least four (4) Business Days'
prior written notice advising Parent that the Company Board intends to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change (a "Notice of Adverse Recommendation") or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 6.5(d)_  and _Section
8.1(c)(ii)_ (a "Notice of Superior Proposal") and specifying in reasonable
detail the reasons therefor, including the identity of the Person making such
Superior Proposal and the material terms and conditions of any such Superior
Proposal, including a complete copy of any such Superior Proposal (including
copies of the current drafts of all agreements, term sheets, financing
commitments and other documentation and correspondence that relate to such
Superior Proposal), (B) if requested in writing by Parent, during the four (4)
Business Day period after delivery of such Notice of Adverse Recommendation
or Notice of Superior Proposal, the Company and its Representatives negotiate
in good faith with Parent and its Representatives regarding any revisions,
changes, modifications, adjustments or amendments to this Agreement that
would permit the Company Board not to take such actions and (C) no earlier
than the end of such four (4) Business Day period, the Company Board (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors and having
complied with this _Section 6.5_ ) shall have determined in good faith,
after considering the revisions, changes, modifications, adjustments and
amendments proposed by Parent during such four (4) Business Day period, that
such Competing Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and that
the failure to take such action would be reasonably expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Any amendment to
the financial terms or any other material amendment of such Superior Proposal
shall require a new Notice of Adverse Recommendation or Notice of Superior
Proposal, as applicable, and the Company shall be required to comply again
with the requirements of this _Section 6.5(d)_ , except that such new notice
period shall be for two (2) Business Days.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at
any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, in response to
an Intervening Event, the Company Board may make an Adverse Recommendation
Change contemplated by clauses (A) or (C) of the definition thereof if the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisors) that the failure to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change would be reasonably expected to be inconsistent with the
directors' fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under applicable
Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board may not make such an
Adverse Recommendation Change unless (i) the Company Board has delivered to
Parent a Notice of Adverse Recommendation identifying and describing in
reasonable detail such Intervening Event, (ii) if requested by Parent, during
the four (4) Business Day period after delivery of the Notice of Adverse
Recommendation, the Company and its Representatives negotiate in good
faith with Parent and its Representatives regarding any revisions, changes,
modifications, adjustments or amendments to this Agreement that would permit
the Company Board not to take such actions and (iii) no earlier than the end
of such four (4) Business Day period, the Company Board (after consultation
with its legal counsel and financial advisors and having complied with this
_Section 6.5_ ) shall have determined in good faith, after considering the
terms of any revisions, changes, modifications, adjustments or amendments to
this Agreement proposed by Parent during such four (4) Business Day period,
that the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change contemplated by
clauses (A) or (C) of the definition thereof would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under applicable Law.

  



  

   

47

 



    



  

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall restrict the Company or the
Company Board from (i) taking or disclosing a position contemplated by
Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a)(2) or (3) under the Exchange Act, or (ii)
otherwise making disclosure required to comply with applicable Law (it being
agreed that a "stop, look and listen" communication by the Company Board to
the Company's stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act
or a factually accurate public statement by the Company that describes the
Company's receipt of a Competing Proposal and the operation of this Agreement
with respect thereto shall not be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation
Change or give rise to a Parent termination right pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)(ii)_ ); _provided_ that (A) any disclosure made as permitted under
clause (ii) above that relates to a Competing Proposal (other than a
"stop, look and listen" communication by the Company Board to the Company's
stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be
deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Company Board
expressly publicly reaffirms the Company Recommendation in connection with
such disclosure and (B) any Adverse Recommendation Change must be made in
accordance with _Sections 6.5(d)_ and _(e)_.

  



  

(g) The Company agrees that any material breach of this _Section
6.5_ by any of its Representatives acting on the Company's behalf shall be
deemed a breach of this Agreement by the Company.

  



  

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

  



  

(i) "Competing Proposal" shall mean any bona fide inquiry,
proposal or offer made by any Person (other than Parent, Acquisition Sub or
any Affiliate thereof) or group of Persons as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of
the Exchange Act to purchase or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, in
one transaction or a series of transactions, (a) beneficial ownership (as
defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of twenty percent (20%) or
more of the voting power or any class of equity securities of the Company (or
any Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the Company representing twenty
percent (20%) or more of the revenue, net income or assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) pursuant to a merger, consolidation or
other business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution,
partnership, joint venture, sale of shares of capital stock or of equity
interests in the Company (or any Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the Company
representing twenty percent (20%) or more of the revenue, net income or
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), tender offer,
exchange offer or similar transaction or (b) any one or more assets or
businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries that constitute twenty percent
(20%) or more of the revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

  



  

   

48

 



    



  

(ii) "Intervening Event" shall mean any positive change, event,
effect or circumstance or change in circumstances or facts (including any
change in probability or magnitude of circumstances) that (i) is material to
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) was not known and was
not reasonably foreseeable to the Company Board on or prior to the date of
this Agreement and (iii) does not relate to any Competing Proposal.

  



  

(iii) "Superior Proposal" shall mean a written Competing Proposal
(with all percentages in the definition of Competing Proposal increased to
fifty percent (50%)) made by a Third Party that the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors and considering all financial (including financing terms), legal,
timing, regulatory and other aspects and risks of such Competing Proposal and
after taking into account any revisions, changes, modifications, adjustments
and amendments to the terms of this Agreement offered by Parent to the
Company or the Company Board in response to such Competing Proposal, (A) is
reasonably capable of being consummated in accordance with its terms and (B)
would be, if consummated, more favorable to the Company's stockholders from a
financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

Section 6.6   _Directors ' and Officers' Indemnification and
Insurance_.

  



  

(a) Parent and Acquisition Sub agree that all rights to exculpation
and indemnification for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), now existing in favor of the
current or former directors and officers, if any (the foregoing persons, the
"DandO Indemnified Parties"), as the case may be, of the Company or its
Subsidiaries as provided in their respective organizational documents as in
effect on the date of this Agreement or in any Contract for indemnification
in effect as of the date of this Agreement shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect. The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify, defend and hold
harmless, and advance expenses to DandO Indemnified Parties with respect to all
acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time prior to
the Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), to the
fullest extent that the Company or its Subsidiaries would be permitted by
applicable Law and to the fullest extent required by the organizational
documents of the Company or its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this
Agreement. Parent shall cause the certificate of incorporation, by-laws or
other organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to exculpation,
indemnification, advancement of expenses and limitation of director and
officer liability that are no less favorable to the DandO Indemnified Parties
than those set forth in the Company's and its Subsidiaries' organizational
documents as of the date of this Agreement, which provisions thereafter shall
not, for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of the DandO Indemnified Parties.

  



  

   

49

 



    



  

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 6.6(a)_ , to the
fullest extent that the Company would be permitted by applicable Law to do
so, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to: (i) indemnify and hold
harmless each DandO Indemnified Party against and from any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, (an "Action") to the extent such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains
to: (A) any alleged action or omission in such DandO Indemnified Party's
capacity as a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
prior to the Effective Time; or (B) this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) pay in advance of the final
disposition of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation the
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) of any DandO Indemnified Party
upon receipt of a written affirmation by the DandO Indemnified Party of his or
her good faith belief that he or she has met the standard of conduct
necessary for indemnification applicable to him or her and a written
undertaking by him or her or on his or her behalf to repay the amount paid or
reimbursed if it is ultimately determined that the standard of conduct for
indemnification was not met. Any determination required to be made with
respect to whether the conduct of any DandO Indemnified Party complies or
complied with any applicable standard shall be made by independent legal
counsel selected by the DandO Indemnified Party, which counsel shall be
reasonably acceptable to the Surviving Corporation, and the fees of such
counsel shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this _Section 6.6(b)_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement, Parent shall not, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to,
settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise
seek termination with respect to any Action, unless such settlement,
compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all
of the DandO Indemnified Parties covered by the Action from all
liability arising out of such Action.

  



  

(c) Unless the Company shall have purchased a "tail" policy prior
to the Effective Time as provided below, for at least six (6) years after the
Effective Time, (i) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its other
Subsidiaries to maintain in full force and effect the coverage provided by
the existing directors' and officers' liability insurance and
fiduciary insurance in effect as of the date of this Agreement and maintained
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable (the  "Existing DandO
Insurance Policies"), or provide substitute policies for the Company and its
current and former directors and officers who are currently covered by such
Existing DandO Insurance Policies, in either case, on terms and conditions no
less advantageous to the DandO Indemnified Parties, or any other
Person entitled to the benefit of this _Section 6.6_ , as applicable, than
the Existing DandO Insurance Policies, covering claims arising from facts,
events, acts or omissions that occurred at or prior to the Effective Time,
including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement ( _provided_ that
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall not be required to
pay an annual premium for such insurance in excess of three hundred percent
(300%) of the aggregate annual premiums currently paid by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, on an annualized basis, but in such case
shall purchase as much of such coverage as possible for such amount) and (ii)
Parent shall not, and shall not permit the Surviving Corporation or its other
Subsidiaries to, take any action that would prejudice the rights of, or
otherwise impede recovery by, the beneficiaries of any such
insurance, whether in respect of claims arising before or after the Effective
Time. In lieu of such insurance, prior to the Effective Time, the Company may
(or if Parent requests, the Company shall) purchase a six (6) year "tail"
prepaid policy on such terms and conditions ( _provided_ that the premium for
such insurance shall not exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the
aggregate annual premiums currently paid by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, on an annualized basis), in which event Parent
shall cease to have any obligations under the first sentence of this _Section
6.6(c)_.

(d) In the event that the Surviving Corporation, any of the
Company's Subsidiaries or any of their successors or assigns shall (i)
consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving company or entity of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfer all or substantially all its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to
be made so that the successor and assign of the Surviving Corporation or any
such Subsidiary assumes the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.6_.

  



  

(e) The DandO Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section 6.6_ applies
shall be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.6_. The provisions of
this _Section 6.6_ are intended to be for the benefit of each DandO Indemnified
Party and his or her successors, heirs or representatives. The Surviving
Corporation shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by any DandO Indemnified Party in
enforcing its indemnity and other rights under this _Section 6.6_. The rights
of each DandO Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in
limitation of, any other applicable rights such DandO Indemnified Party may
have under the respective organizational documents of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, any other indemnification
arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, this _Section 6.6_ shall survive the consummation of the
Merger indefinitely (or any earlier period actually specified in this
_Section 6.6_ ) and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors
and assigns of the Surviving Corporation, and shall be enforceable by the DandO
Indemnified Parties and their successors, heirs or representatives.

  



  

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will be construed
to, release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance
claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or indemnification
agreement that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers or other
employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided
for in this _Section 6.6_ is not prior to or in substitution for any such
claims pursuant to such policies or agreements.

  



  

Section 6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall
give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the
Company, of (a) any notice or other communication received by such party from
any Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, if
the subject matter of such communication or the failure of such party to
obtain such consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, and (b) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or
proceedings commenced or, to such party's Knowledge, threatened against,
relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its
Subsidiaries which relate to this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall provide Parent
a reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense and settlement of any
stockholder litigation or claim against the Company or its directors or
officers relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and the Company shall not settle or seek to settle any such
stockholder litigation without the prior written consent of Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.7_ ,
any litigation or claim relating to Dissenting Shares shall be governed by

expressly contemplated by _Section 6.5_ , the Company, Parent and Acquisition
Sub shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or
otherwise making any public statements with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and none of the parties hereto or
their Affiliates shall issue any such press release or make any public
statement prior to obtaining the other parties' consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except that no such consent shall
be necessary to the extent disclosure may be required by Law
(including required filings with the SEC), Order or applicable stock exchange
rule or any listing agreement of any party hereto or is consistent with prior
communications previously consented to by the Company and Parent.

  



  

Section 6.9 _Employee Benefits_.

  



  

(a) Employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior
to the Effective Time who remain employees of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates following the Effective Time are
hereinafter referred to as the "Continuing Employees." For the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first (1st) anniversary of
the date on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to, provide for each
Continuing Employee compensation and employee benefits that are, in the
aggregate, substantially comparable to the compensation and benefits, in the
aggregate, being provided as of the date hereof under the Company Benefit
Plans (including any equity-based compensation, but excluding, retention
arrangements or any other compensation or benefits payable in
connection with, or as a result of, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and any employee benefits that are frozen, discontinued or, as of
the Effective Time, being frozen or discontinued). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent shall not be required to provide such compensation and
benefits in the form of equity or equity-based awards or defined benefit
pension plans.

  



  

(b) Parent agrees that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including
the Surviving Corporation) shall cause the applicable employee benefit plans
established following the Closing Date (if any) and any other employee benefit
plans covering the Continuing Employees following the Effective Time
(collectively, the "Post-Closing Plans"), to use commercially reasonable
efforts to recognize the service of each Continuing Employee (to the extent
such service was recognized by the Company Benefit Plan set forth in _Section
4.12(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter) for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and determination of the level of benefits (but not for
benefit accrual purposes under a defined benefit pension plan) under the
Post-Closing Plans, to the extent such recognition does not result in the
duplication of any benefits or for any newly-established plan of Parent or
its Subsidiaries for which similarly-situated employees of Parent or its
Subsidiaries do not receive past service credit.

  



  

   

52

 



    



   



  

(c) For the calendar year including the Effective Time, Parent and
its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that the Continuing Employees shall not be
required to satisfy any deductible, co-payment, out-of-pocket maximum or
similar requirements under the Post-Closing Plans that provide medical, dental
and other welfare benefits (collectively, the "Post-Closing Welfare Plans")
to the extent amounts were previously credited for such purposes under
comparable Company Benefit Plans that provide medical, dental and other
welfare benefits.

  



  

(d) Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that as of
the Effective Time, any waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions and
requirements to show evidence of good health contained in such Post-Closing
Welfare Plans shall be waived with respect to the Continuing Employees (except
to the extent any such waiting period, pre-existing condition exclusion or
requirement to show evidence of good health was already in effect
with respect to such employees and has not been satisfied under the
applicable Company Benefit Plan in which the participant then participates or
is otherwise eligible to participate as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time).

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, as of the
Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to, honor in accordance with their terms as in effect as of
the date of this Agreement, all Company Benefit Plans set forth in _Section
4.12(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter or as consented to by Parent in
accordance with _Section 6.1(e)_.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.9_ to the contrary,
nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall (i) be treated
as an amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan, Post-
Closing Plan, or any other employee benefit plans of the Company or Parent,
(ii) confer upon any Person (including any current or former service provider
of the Company or its Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents
thereof)) other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder, (iii) interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent, which rights are hereby
expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any Continuing
Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, except
to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a written agreement between
Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or any Affiliate of Parent and
the Continuing Employee or any severance, benefit or other applicable plan,
policy or program covering such Continuing Employee or (iv) prevent Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent from amending or
terminating any Company Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms.

  



  

Section 6.10   _Conduct of Business by Parent Pending the Merger_.
Parent and Acquisition Sub covenant and agree that, between the date of this
Agreement and the earlier of the Effective Time and the date, if any, on which
this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_ , except (a)
as may be required by Law, (b) as may be agreed to in writing by the
Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), or (c) as may be expressly required or permitted pursuant to
this Agreement, Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries
to: (i) acquire or agree to acquire by merging or consolidating with, or by
purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any
other manner, any business of any Person or other business organization or
division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets, if
such business competes in any line of business of the Company or its
Subsidiaries and the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to, or
the consummation of, such acquisition, merger or consolidation, or (ii) take
or agree to take any other action (including entering into or agreeing to
enter into any material license, joint venture, or other transaction), in each
case of clause (i) and (ii), that would reasonably be expected to (A) impose
any material delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of
not obtaining, any authorization, consent, order, declaration or approval of
any Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period, (B) materially increase the risk of any
Governmental Authority entering an Order prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (C) materially increase the risk
of not being able to remove any such Order on appeal or otherwise, or (D)
otherwise materially delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including by acquiring or agreeing to acquire
all or a portion of the equity in the entity using or having any rights in any
business of the type and character of, or that competes with, all or any part
of the Company, or entering into or agreeing to enter into any material
license, joint venture or other agreement or transaction; and except as
otherwise permitted by the foregoing, enter into any agreement to do any of
the foregoing.

by any Debt Financing Source and, if applicable, the Shareholder Lender that

Sources and, if applicable, the Shareholder Lender of their obligations
thereunder; and (v) draw down upon and consummate the Debt Financing, and, if
applicable, draw on the Letter of Credit, in each case, at or prior to the
Closing.

  



  

(b) Neither Parent nor its Affiliates shall agree to any amendment,
supplement or other modification to, obtain any replacement of, or grant any
waiver of, any condition or other provision under the Debt Financing or the
Letter of Credit (other than pursuant to any "flex" provisions set forth in
the Debt Commitment Documents) without the prior written consent of the
Company if such amendment, modification or waiver (i) would reduce the
aggregate amount of the net proceeds of the Debt Financing or the Letter of
Credit (including by changing the amount of fees or other amounts to be paid
(including original issue discount) with respect to the Debt Financing), (ii)
would impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend or modify
any of the conditions under the Debt Commitment Letters or (iii) would, or
would reasonably be expected to, (x) prevent, delay or impair the ability of
Parent to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or (y) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Acquisition
Sub to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment
Documents. Parent shall not permit, release or consent to the withdrawal,

or Person, except for Citigroup Global Markets Taiwan Securities Co. Limited,
any financial advisory role on an exclusive basis in connection with the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) prohibit or seek
to prohibit any bank or investment bank or other potential provider of debt or

(d) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing or the

Acquisition Sub shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use
their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain, and to negotiate and
enter into definitive agreements with respect to, alternative debt financing

or adversely impact, or be reasonably expected to prevent, impede, delay or
adversely impact the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The definitive agreements entered into pursuant to this

(e) Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledges and agrees that
neither the obtaining of the Debt Financing, the Letter of Credit or any
alternative financing is a condition to the Merger or the Closing and

availability of the Debt Financing, the Letter of Credit or any alternative
financing, subject to the applicable conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_

with such financing (including any action taken in accordance with this 
_Section 6.11_ or _Section 6.12_ ) and any information utilized in connection
therewith or in connection with any action taken pursuant to _Section 6.13_ ,
unless such losses, damages, claims, costs and expenses are found in a final
judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been primarily caused
by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Company,
its Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates or its and their and their
Affiliates' respective Representatives.

  



  

(h) Any breach of the Debt Commitment Documents, the Financing
Agreements or any alternative financing commitment or alternative financing
agreement by Parent or Acquisition Sub shall be deemed a breach by Parent of
this _Section 6.11_. Parent shall (i) furnish the Company with drafts and

modification of the Debt Commitment Documents and of the Financing Agreements
and any alternative financing agreement promptly upon their execution, (ii)
give the Company prompt notice of any breach or threatened breach by any
party to the Debt Commitment Documents, any alternative financing commitment,

(d) by Parent, if:

  



  

(i) the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the
failure of any condition set forth in  _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_ ,

(i) (A) this Agreement is terminated by (x) the Company or Parent
pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ , (y) the Company or Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ , or (z) Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ , (B) a
Competing Proposal had been publicly announced, had been publicly disclosed
or otherwise had become known, disclosed or communicated to the Company,

this Agreement and prior to such termination, and (C) within twelve (12)
months of such termination of this Agreement, the Company either consummates a
transaction involving a Competing Proposal or enters into a definitive
agreement providing for a Competing Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that
for purposes of this _Section 8.3(a)(i)_ , the references to "twenty percent
(20%)" in the definition of Competing Proposal shall be deemed to be
references to "fifty percent (50%)";

  



  

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(ii)_ ; or

  



  

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)(ii)_ , then

  



  

the Company shall (A) in the case of clause (i) above, no later than two (2)
Business Days following the date of the earlier of the entry into the
definitive agreement or consummation of such transaction involving a
Competing Proposal, (B) in the case of clause (ii) above, prior to or
substantially concurrently with such termination, and (C) in the case of this
clause (iii), no later than two (2) Business Days after the date of such
termination, pay, or cause to be paid, at the direction of Parent, the Company
Termination Fee; it being understood that in no event shall the Company be
required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

  



  

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company or
Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ , then the Company shall promptly,
but in no event more than two (2) Business Days after receipt of an invoice
thereof, pay, or cause to be paid, at the direction of Parent, all costs and
Expenses incurred by or on behalf of Parent, Acquisition Sub and their
respective Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, up to an aggregate maximum amount of eighteen
million dollars ($18,000,000), which amount shall be credited against any
Company Termination Fee (if any) that subsequently becomes payable to Parent.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, but subject to _Section 9.9_ , Parent's right to receive payment
from the Company of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_ ,
together with any costs and Expenses and interest payable pursuant to
_Section 8.3(b)_ and _Section 8.3(d)_ , in circumstances where the Company
Termination Fee is payable pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)(i)_ , _Section
8.3(a)(ii)_ or _Section 8.3(a)(iii)_ , shall constitute the sole and
exclusive remedy (in circumstances where the Company Termination Fee
is payable) of Parent and Acquisition Sub against the Company and its
Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future general or
limited partners, stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers,
employees, agents, Affiliates or assignees of any of the foregoing

and upon payment of such amount (in circumstances where the Company
Termination Fee is payable), none of the Company Related Parties shall have
any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this

9.9_ and the payment of the Company Termination Fee, under no circumstances
shall Parent be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance that results in the Closing occurring and the Company Termination
Fee.

(d) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreement
contained in this _Section 8.3_ is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the Company Termination Fee is not a
penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will
compensate Parent and its Affiliates in the circumstances in which such fee is
payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision, and (iii) without the agreement contained in this _Section 8.3_ ,
the parties would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company
fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ and, in
order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a
judgment against the Company for the payment of any amount set forth in this
_Section 8.3_ , the Company shall pay Parent its costs and Expenses in
connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount at the
annual rate equal to the prime rate as published in _The Wall Street
Journal _ in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through
the date such payment was actually received, or such lesser rate as is the
maximum permitted by applicable Law.

pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iv)_ , or (iii) (x) the Company or Parent pursuant
to _Section 8.1(b)(v)_ or (y) Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ (and at
such time the Company is entitled to terminate pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(v)_
), then Parent shall (A) in the case of clause (i), if the Company has
elected to receive the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to the second sentence
of _Section 8.4(c)_ , no later than two (2) Business Days following Parent's
receipt of such written election and (B) in the case of clauses (ii) and
(iii), no later than two (2) Business Days after the date of such
termination, pay, or cause to be paid, at the direction of the Company, the
applicable Parent Termination Fee; it being understood that in no event shall
Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one
occasion.

  



  

   

 | 66| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company or
Parent pursuant to (i) _Section 8.1(b)(vi)_ or (ii)  _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ (and
at such time either the Company or Parent is entitled to terminate pursuant to
_Section 8.1(b)(vi)_ ), then Parent shall promptly, but in no event more than
two (2) Business Days after receipt of an invoice thereof, pay, or cause to
be paid, at the direction of the Company, all costs and Expenses incurred by
or on behalf of the Company and its respective Affiliates in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, up to an
aggregate maximum amount of eighteen million dollars ($18,000,000), which
amount shall be credited against any Parent Termination Fee (if any) that
subsequently becomes payable to the Company.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, but subject to _Section 9.9_ , the Company's right to receive
payment from Parent of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.4(a)_
, together with any costs and Expenses and interest payable pursuant to

Termination Fee is payable pursuant to _Section 8.4(a)_ , shall constitute
the sole and exclusive remedy (in circumstances where the Parent Termination
Fee is payable) of the Company against Parent, Acquisition Sub, their
Subsidiaries and the Debt Financing Sources and any of their respective
former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, members,
managers, directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates or assignees of
any of the foregoing (collectively, the "Parent Related Parties") for all
losses and damages suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for any breach or failure
to perform hereunder, and upon payment of such amount (in circumstances where
the Parent Termination Fee is payable), none of the Parent Related Parties
shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except that
Parent and Acquisition Sub shall also be obligated with respect to _Section
8.7_ ). In the event that the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(c)(iii)_ , the Company shall, within thirty (30) days of the time
of termination, irrevocably elect in writing to either (i) receive the Parent
Termination Fee as the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company against any
and all Parent Related Parties (and in which case the foregoing sentence
shall apply) or (ii) maintain its right to seek monetary damages against
Parent and Acquisition Sub for knowing and intentional breaches pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement and upon the making of such irrevocable election
(x) the Company shall only be entitled to the remedy so selected and shall in
no event be entitled to both the Parent Termination Fee and any recovery of
any monetary damages; provided, in the event that the Company does not make
such election within such thirty (30) day period or the Company or any of its
Affiliates commences any Action to recover any monetary damages within such
thirty (30) day period, the Company shall be deemed to have elected to
maintain its right to seek monetary damages for knowing and intentional
breaches pursuant to the terms of this Agreement as its sole and exclusive
remedy against the Parent Related Parties. While the Company may pursue both
a grant of specific performance in accordance with _Section 9.9_ and either
(i) the payment of the Parent Termination Fee or (ii) the recovery of
monetary damages, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted
or entitled to receive both (x) a grant of specific performance that results
in the Closing occurring and (y) the Parent Termination Fee or any recovery
of any monetary damages.

  



  

(d) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreement
contained in this _Section 8.4_ is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the Parent Termination Fee is not a
penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will
compensate the Company and its Affiliates in the circumstances in which such
fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this
Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, which amount would otherwise be impossible to
calculate with precision, and (iii) without the agreement contained in this
_Section 8.4_ , the parties would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly,
if Parent fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.4_
 and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company commences a suit that
results in a judgment against Parent for the payment of any amount set forth
in this _Section 8.4_ , Parent shall pay the Company its costs and Expenses in
connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount at the
annual rate equal to the prime rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_
in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the date
such payment was actually received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum
permitted by applicable Law.

respective boards of directors at any time before or after receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (i) after the

amendment that by Law or in accordance with the rules of any stock exchange
requires further approval by the Company's stockholders without such further
approval of such stockholders nor any amendment or change not permitted under
applicable Law and (ii) any amendment of _Section 8.4_ , this _Section 8.5_ ,
_Section 9.4_ , _Section 9.7_ , _Section 9.8_ , _Section 9.10_  or _Section

jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any

or evidence of materiality of such item, nor shall it establish any standard
of materiality for any purpose whatsoever.

(c) The words "hereof," "herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and
"herewith" and words of similar import shall refer to this Agreement as a
whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. References to
articles, sections, clauses, paragraphs, exhibits, annexes and schedules are
to the articles, sections, clauses and paragraphs of, and exhibits, annexes
and schedules to, this Agreement, unless otherwise specified, and the table of
contents and headings in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and

Agreement. The words "made available to Parent" and words of similar import
refer to documents (i) posted to the data site maintained by the Company or
its Representatives in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) delivered in person or electronically to Parent, Acquisition
Sub or any of their respective Representatives or (iii) that are publicly

deemed to refer to such statute as amended from time to time and to any rules
or regulations promulgated thereunder ( _provided_ that for purposes of any
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement that are made as

statutes) by succession of comparable successor Laws ( _provided_ that for
purposes of any representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
that are made as of a specific date or dates, references to any statute shall
be deemed to refer to such statute, as amended, and to any rules or
regulations promulgated thereunder, in each case, as of such date or dates).

English language version of this Agreement shall govern all questions of
interpretation relating to this Agreement, notwithstanding that this
Agreement may have been translated into, and executed in, other languages.

  



  

Section 9.4 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other authority to be invalid, void, illegal, unenforceable or against its
regulatory policy, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall
in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, void, illegal, unenforceable or
against its regulatory policy, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties hereto as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in
order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger, be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

Section 9.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the

written consent of the other parties; _provided_ that Acquisition Sub may, in
its discretion and upon prior written notice to the Company, assign any or all
of its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to an Affiliate
of Parent, but no such assignment will relieve Acquisition Sub of its
obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns. Any attempted
assignment in violation of this _Section 9.5_ shall be null and void.

understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

  



  

Section 9.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not
intended to and shall not confer upon any Person other than the parties

respect to _Section 6.6_ from and after the Effective Time), (B) the Debt
Financing Sources (solely with respect to _Section 8.4_ , _Section 8.5_ ,

_Section 9.12_ ), (C) the Company Related Parties (solely with respect to

_Section 8.4_ ) are third-party beneficiaries.

  



  

Section 9.8 _Governing Law_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement and all actions, proceedings or counterclaims
(whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, or the actions of Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company in
the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement thereof, shall
be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of laws provision
or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that
would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the
State of Delaware.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, each of the parties hereto: (i) irrevocably agrees that it will not
bring or support any Person in any action, suit, proceeding, hearing or
arbitration before any Governmental Authority of any kind or description,
whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against any of the Debt Financing Sources in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing or
the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, in any forum
other than the U.S. Federal and New York State courts located in New York
County, State of New York; and (ii) irrevocably agrees that, except as
specifically set forth in the Debt Commitment Documents, all claims or causes
of action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise)
against any of the Debt Financing Sources in any way relating to this
Agreement, the Debt Financing or the performance thereof or the financings
contemplated thereby, shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to
any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of New
York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws
of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement (but without limiting (x) the
obligations of the Debt Financing Sources to the Parent and its Affiliates
under the Debt Commitment Letters and (y) the rights or remedies of the
Parent and its Affiliates under the Debt Commitment Letters), the Debt
Financing Sources shall not have any liability to the Company, any of its
Affiliates or any of its or their Representatives relating to, arising out of
or in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or otherwise, whether at law, or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise, and none of the Company, any of its
Affiliates or any of its or their Representatives shall have any rights or
claims of any kind or description, whether at law, or equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise, against the Debt Financing Sources, in each case relating
to, arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing,
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

  



  

   

72

 



    



  

Section 9.9 _Specific Performance_.

  



  

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy,
would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of it hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will
not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at
law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for
any reason at law or in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions or any other equitable relief to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to show proof of actual damages or provide
any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement
to the contrary, it is explicitly agreed that the Company shall only be
entitled to seek specific performance of Parent's or Acquisition Sub's
obligations to effect the Closing in accordance with  _Article II_, if and
only if (a) all conditions in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ have been
satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing (but subject to such conditions
being capable of being satisfied at Closing if specific performance was
granted)) at the time when the Closing was required to occur pursuant to
_Section 2.2_ , (b) the Bridge Debt Financing has been funded or will be
funded at the Closing on the terms set forth in the Bridge Commitment Letter
and (c) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that all
of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ have been and
continue to be satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, each of which shall then and continues to
be capable of being satisfied as of the Closing) or waived (to the extent
such waiver is permitted under applicable Law) and that the Company is
prepared to consummate the Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or
entitled to receive both such grant of specific performance to effect the
Closing and the payment of any damages, including the payment of the Parent
Termination Fee.

Section 9.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

  



  

(a) Each of the parties hereto hereby (i) expressly and irrevocably

sitting in the State of Delaware in connection with any dispute arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such

Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court

any final judgment, order or decree issued by any court in the state of
Delaware, whether for monetary damages, injunctive or equitable relief or
otherwise (a "Delaware Judgment"), in any foreign court or tribunal,
including the courts of the Republic of China, and hereby waives any
opposition to the enforcement of any Delaware Judgment in any such foreign
court or tribunal. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in
any action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.
The parties hereby further agree that New York state or U.S. federal courts
sitting in New York County, State of New York shall have exclusive
jurisdiction over any action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise) brought against any Debt Financing Source in connection with
the transactions contemplated under this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Each party hereto irrevocably consents to the service of process
outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in _Section
9.10(a)_ in any such action or proceeding by mailing copies thereof by
registered or certified U.S. mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested,
to its address as specified in or pursuant to _Section 9.2_. However, the
foregoing shall not limit the right of a party to effect service of process
on the other party by any other legally available method.

  



  

Section 9.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in
multiple counterparts, all of which shall together be considered one and the
same agreement. Delivery of an executed signature page to this Agreement by
