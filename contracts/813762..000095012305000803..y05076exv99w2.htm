 WHEREAS, the Corporation is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the State of Delaware;   

 WHEREAS, Shareholder owns 100% of the outstanding common stock of the Corporation, par value $.01 per share (the " _TransTexas Common Stock_ ");   

 WHEREAS, the General Corporation Law of Delaware, 8 _Del._ _C._ §§ 101 _et_   _seq_. (the " _GCL_ "), and the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, 6  _Del._ _C._ §§ 17-101 _et seq_. (the " _LP Act_ "), each permits a corporation organized and existing under the GCL to merge with and into a limited partnership formed and existing under the LP Act; and

The Merger Price shall be paid by the Partnership to Shareholder upon surrender of the certificate(s) formerly representing the TransTexas Common Stock. The shares of TransTexas Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Price are hereinafter referred to collectively as the " _Merger Shares_ ".

 All statements, reports, materials and other supporting documentation delivered under this Section 1.1(b) shall be in form and content reasonably satisfactory to Buyer;    

 (c) the Merger Price shall be $180 million in cash, provided that:

The Corporation and each of the Subsidiaries is licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing (where the concept of "good standing" is applicable) as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the nature of the properties owned, leased or operated by it and the business transacted by it require such licensing or qualification (except, with respect to the Subsidiaries, where the failure to be so licensed or qualified or be in good standing will not in the aggregate adversely affect the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or have a Material Adverse Effect on any of the Subsidiaries).

 INDEMNIFICATION    

 9.1 _Indemnification by Shareholder_. Shareholder agrees to indemnify the Partnership, its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, independent contractors, stockholders, principals, partners, agents, or representatives (each an "Indemnified Person" and collectively, the "Indemnified Persons") against, and to hold each Indemnified Person harmless from, any and all Losses incurred or suffered by any Indemnified Person relating to or arising out of or in connection with (a) any breach of or any inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by Shareholder in this Agreement, or (b) any breach of or failure by any Shareholder to perform any of its covenants or obligations set out or contemplated in this Agreement. Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary contained herein, the aggregate liability of Shareholder and Barberry Corp. for any and all obligations under this Agreement shall in no event exceed the Merger Price.   

 9.2 _Claims_. As promptly as is reasonably practicable after becoming aware of a claim for indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Person shall promptly give notice to the Shareholder ("Indemnifying Person") of such claim and the amount the Indemnified Person will be entitled to receive hereunder from the Indemnifying Person; provided that the failure of the Indemnified Person to promptly give notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of its obligations except to the extent (if any) that the Indemnifying Person shall have been prejudiced thereby. If the Indemnifying Person does not object in writing to such indemnification claim within 30 days of receiving notice thereof, the Indemnified Person shall be entitled to recover, on the thirty-fifth day after such notice was given, from the Indemnifying Person the amount of such claim, and no later objection by the Indemnifying Person shall be permitted; if the Indemnifying Person agrees that it has an indemnification obligation but objects that it is obligated to pay only a lesser amount, the Indemnified Person shall nevertheless be entitled to recover, on the thirty-fifth day after such notice was given, from the Indemnifying Person the lesser amount, without prejudice to the Indemnified Persons claim for the difference. In addition to the amounts recoverable by the Indemnified Person from the Indemnifying Person pursuant to the foregoing provisions, the Indemnified Person shall also be entitled to recover from the Indemnifying Person interest on such amounts at the rate of Two Times Prime from, and including, the thirty-fifth day after such notice of an indemnification claim is given to, but not including, the date such recovery is actually made by the Indemnified Person.    ##### 

  

  

 9.3 _Notice of Third Party Claims; Assumption of Defense_. The Indemnified Person shall give notice as promptly as is reasonably practicable to the Indemnifying Person of the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding, by any Person not a party hereto (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Agreement; provided that the failure of the Indemnified Person to promptly give notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of its obligations except to the extent (if any) that the Indemnifying Person shall have been prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Person may, at its own expense, participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim, suit, action or proceeding (a) upon notice to the Indemnified Person and (b) upon delivery by the Indemnifying Person to the Indemnified Person a written agreement that the Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification for all Losses arising out of such Third Party Claim, suit, action or proceeding and that the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for the entire amount of any Loss, at any time during the course of any such Third Party Claim, suit, action or proceeding, assume the defense thereof; provided, however, that (i) the Indemnifying Persons counsel is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person, and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall thereafter consult with the Indemnified Person upon the Indemnified Persons reasonable request for such consultation from time to time with respect to such Third Party Claim, suit, action or proceeding. If the Indemnifying Person assumes such defense, the Indemnified Person shall have the right (but not the duty) to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Person. If, however, the Indemnified Person reasonably determines in its judgment that representation by the Indemnifying Persons counsel of both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, then such Indemnified Person may employ separate counsel to represent or defend it in any such Third Party Claim, action, suit or proceeding and the Indemnifying Person shall pay all of the fees and disbursements in connection with the retention of such separate counsel. If the Indemnifying Person fails to promptly notify the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party desires to defend the Third Party Claim pursuant, or if the Indemnifying Person gives such notice but fails to prosecute vigorously and diligently or settle the Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party will have the right to defend, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Person, the Third Party Claim by all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings will be prosecuted by the Indemnified Person in good faith or will be settled at the discretion of the Indemnified Person (with the consent of the Indemnifying Person, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld). The Indemnified Person will have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof. Whether or not the Indemnifying Person chooses to defend or prosecute any such Third Party Claim, suit, action or proceeding, all of the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof.    

 9.4 _Settlement or Compromise_. Any settlement or compromise made or caused to be made by the Indemnified Person or the Indemnifying Person, of any claim, suit, action or proceeding shall also be binding upon the Indemnifying Person or the Indemnified Person, as the case may be, in the same manner as if a final judgment or decree had been entered by a court of competent jurisdiction in the amount of such settlement or compromise thereof; provided, however, that no obligation, restriction or Loss shall be imposed on the Indemnified Person as a result of such settlement without its prior written consent. The Indemnified Person will give the Indemnifying Person at least 30 days notice of any proposed settlement or compromise of any Third Party Claim, suit, action or proceeding it is defending, during which time the Indemnifying Person may reject such proposed settlement or compromise; provided, however, that from and after such rejection, the Indemnifying Person shall be obligated to assume the defense of and full    ##### 

  

  

and complete liability and responsibility for such Third Party Claim, suit,
action or proceeding and any and all Losses in connection therewith in excess
of the amount of unindemnifiable Losses which the Indemnified Person would
have been obligated to pay under the proposed settlement or
compromise.    

 9.5 _Failure of Indemnifying Person to Act_. In the event that the Indemnifying Person does not assume the defense of any Third Party Claim, suit, action or proceeding brought against an Indemnified Person, then any failure of the Indemnified Person to defend or to participate in the defense of any such Third Party Claim, suit, action or proceeding or to cause the same to be done, shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of any of its obligations under this Agreement.   

 9.6 _Tax Character_. Shareholder and the Partnership agree that any payments pursuant to this Article IX will be treated for federal and state income tax purposes as adjustments to the Merger Price, and that they will report such payments on all Tax Returns consistently with such characterization.
