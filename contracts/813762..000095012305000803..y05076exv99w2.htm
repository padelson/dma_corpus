without prejudice to the Indemnified Person&#146;s claim for the difference. In addition to the amounts
recoverable by the Indemnified Person from the Indemnifying Person pursuant to the foregoing

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.3 <U>Notice of Third Party Claims; Assumption of Defense</U>. The Indemnified Person shall
give notice as promptly as is reasonably practicable to the Indemnifying Person of the assertion of
any claim, or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding, by
any Person not a party hereto
(a &#147;<U>Third Party Claim</U>&#148;) in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Agreement;
provided that the failure of the Indemnified Person to promptly give notice shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Person of its obligations except to the extent (if any) that the Indemnifying Person
shall have been prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Person may, at its own expense, participate
in the defense of any Third Party Claim, suit, action or proceeding (a)&nbsp;upon notice to the
Indemnified Person and (b)&nbsp;upon delivery by the Indemnifying Person to the Indemnified Person a
written agreement that the Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification for all Losses arising
out of such Third Party Claim, suit, action or proceeding and that the Indemnifying Person shall be
liable for the entire amount of any Loss, at any time during the course of any such Third Party
Claim, suit, action or proceeding, assume the defense thereof; provided, however, that (i)&nbsp;the
Indemnifying Person&#146;s counsel is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person, and (ii)&nbsp;the
Indemnifying Person shall thereafter consult with the Indemnified Person upon the Indemnified
Person&#146;s reasonable request for such consultation from time to time with respect to such Third
Party Claim, suit, action or proceeding. If the Indemnifying Person assumes such defense, the
Indemnified Person shall have the right (but not the duty) to participate in the defense thereof
and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Person. If,
however, the Indemnified Person reasonably determines in its judgment that representation by the
Indemnifying Person&#146;s counsel of both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person would
present such counsel with a conflict of interest, then such Indemnified Person may employ separate
counsel to represent or defend it in any such Third Party Claim, action, suit or proceeding and the
Indemnifying Person shall pay all of the fees and disbursements in connection with the retention of
such separate counsel. If the Indemnifying Person fails to promptly notify the Indemnified Party
that the Indemnifying Party desires to defend the Third Party Claim pursuant, or if the
Indemnifying Person gives such notice but fails to prosecute vigorously and diligently or settle
the Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party will have the right to defend, at the sole cost
and expense of the Indemnifying Person, the Third Party Claim by all appropriate proceedings, which
proceedings will be prosecuted by the Indemnified Person in good faith or will be settled at the
discretion of the Indemnified Person (with the consent of the Indemnifying Person, which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld). The Indemnified Person will have full control of such defense
and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof. Whether or not the Indemnifying
Person chooses to defend or prosecute any such Third Party Claim, suit, action or proceeding, all
of the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.4 <U>Settlement or Compromise</U>. Any settlement or compromise made or caused to be made
by the Indemnified Person or the Indemnifying Person, of any claim, suit, action or proceeding
shall also be binding upon the Indemnifying Person or the Indemnified Person, as the case may be,
in the same manner as if a final judgment or decree had been entered by a court of competent
jurisdiction in the amount of such settlement or compromise thereof; provided, however, that no
obligation, restriction or Loss shall be imposed on the Indemnified Person as a result of such
settlement without its prior written consent. The Indemnified Person will give the Indemnifying
Person at least 30&nbsp;days&#146; notice of any proposed settlement or compromise of any Third Party Claim,
suit, action or proceeding it is defending, during which time the Indemnifying Person may reject
such proposed settlement or compromise; provided, however, that from and after such rejection, the
Indemnifying Person shall be obligated to assume the defense of and full

connection therewith in excess of the amount of unindemnifiable Losses which the Indemnified Person
would have been obligated to pay under the proposed settlement or compromise.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.5 <U>Failure of Indemnifying Person to Act</U>. In the event that the Indemnifying Person
does not assume the defense of any Third Party Claim, suit, action or proceeding brought against an
Indemnified Person, then any failure of the Indemnified Person to defend or to participate in the
defense of any such Third Party Claim, suit, action or proceeding or to cause the same to be done,
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of any of its obligations under this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.6 <U>Tax Character</U>. Shareholder and the Partnership agree that any payments pursuant to this Article&nbsp;IX will be
