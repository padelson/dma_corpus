viii AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of July 20, 2016 (this " _Agreement_
"), between F.N.B. CORPORATION, a Florida corporation (" _FNB_ "), and YADKIN
FINANCIAL CORPORATION, a North Carolina corporation (" _YDKN_ ").

W I T N E S S E T H: 

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of YDKN and FNB have determined that it is in
the best interests of their respective companies and their shareholders to
consummate the strategic business combination transaction provided for in this
Agreement pursuant to which YDKN will, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, merge with and into FNB (the "
_Merger_ "), so that FNB is the surviving company in the Merger (hereinafter
sometimes referred to in such capacity as the " _Surviving Company_ "); and

 

WHEREAS, as a material inducement to FNB to enter into this Agreement, each of
the Persons set forth on _Schedule I_ attached hereto have entered into a
voting agreement with FNB dated as of the date hereof, substantially in the
forms attached hereto as _Exhibit A-1 and Exhibit A-2_ , pursuant to which
each such Person has agreed, among other things, to vote all shares of
YDKN Common Stock (as defined herein) owned by such Person in favor of the
approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; and

 

WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended that (i) the
Merger shall qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and
the regulations of the U.S. Department of the Treasury promulgated thereunder
(as such regulations may be amended from time to time,
including corresponding provisions of successor rules and regulations
thereto, the " _Treasury Regulations_ "), (ii) FNB and YDKN each be a party to
the reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code (clauses
(i) and (ii), the " _Intended Tax Treatment_ "), and (iii) this Agreement be
and is adopted as a plan of reorganization for purposes of Sections 354 and
361 of the Code and within the meaning of Treas. Reg. § 1.368-2(g); and

 

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe
certain conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as
follows: ARTICLE 1

 

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the bank and bank holding company laws of North Carolina
(N.C.G.S. § 53C-7-201 et seq. and N.C.G.S. §53C-10-201 et seq.) and the North
Carolina Business Corporation Act (the " _NCBCA_ ") and the Florida Business
Corporation Act (the "FBCA"), at the Effective Time, YDKN shall merge with and
into FNB. FNB shall be the surviving company in the Merger, and shall continue
its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Florida. As of the
Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of YDKN shall cease.

 

1.2 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the
articles of merger that shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of North Carolina (the " _North Carolina Articles of Merger_ ") and the
articles of merger that shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Florida (the " _Florida Articles of Merger_ "), respectively, on or
before the Closing Date. The term " _Effective Time_ " shall mean the date and
time when the Merger becomes effective as set forth in the North Carolina
Articles of Merger and the Florida Articles of Merger. 

1.3 _Effects of the Merger_.

 

(a) _Effects Under NCBCA and FBCA_. At and after the Effective Time, the
Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of (i)
the NCBCA and the bank and bank holding company laws of North Carolina, and
(ii) the FBCA.

(b) _Directors and Executive Officers of the Surviving Company_. The
directors of the Surviving Company at and immediately after the Effective Time
shall be (i) the directors of FNB immediately prior to the Merger, and (ii)
one (1) current member of YDKNs Board of Directors designated by FNB in
consultation with YDKN (the " _YDKN Designee_ "). The YDKN Designee will have
a term expiring at the first annual meeting of FNB shareholders following the
Effective Time. The executive officers of the Surviving Company at and
immediately after the Effective Time shall be the executive officers of FNB
immediately prior to the Merger.

 

1.4 _Conversion of YDKN Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of YDKN, FNB or the holder of any
of the following securities:

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, each share of Voting Common
Stock, par value $1.00 per share, of YDKN (the " _YDKN Voting Common Stock_
") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than
Treasury Shares, shall, by virtue of the Merger, no longer be outstanding and
shall as of the Effective Time automatically be converted into and shall
thereafter represent the right to receive as consideration in the Merger, 2.16
shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of common stock, $0.01 par value, of FNB ("
_FNB Common Stock_ ") (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 



2 (b) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, each share of Non-Voting
Common Stock, par value $1.00 per share, of YDKN (the " _YDKN Non-Voting
Common Stock_ " and, together with the Yadkin Voting Common Stock, the " _YDKN
Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, other than Treasury Shares, shall, by virtue of the Merger, no longer
be outstanding and shall as of the Effective Time automatically be converted
into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive, at the election of
the holders of Yadkin Non-Voting Common Stock, either (i) the Merger
Consideration or (ii) an amount in cash (the " _Cash Election_ "), rounded up
to the nearest $0.01, equal to the Average Closing Price multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio (the " _Cash Consideration_ ").

(c) At and after the Effective Time, each Treasury Share shall be cancelled
and retired and no shares of FNB Common Stock or other consideration shall be
issued in exchange therefor. " _Treasury Shares_ " means the shares of YDKN
Common Stock held by YDKN, any YDKN Subsidiaries, FNB or any FNB Subsidiaries,
in each case other than shares of YDKN Common Stock held in YDKN Benefit
Plans or related trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the like,
or otherwise held in a fiduciary, including custodial or agency, capacity or
as a result of debts previously contracted in good faith.

(d) The parties acknowledge that the Merger constitutes a "Change of Control,"
as defined in the Piedmont Community Bank Holdings, Inc. Phantom Equity Plan
(the " _Piedmont PEP_ "). Immediately prior to Effective Time, YDKN, through
the Rabbi Trust established pursuant to that certain Rabbi Trust Agreement,
made as of July 4, 2014, by and between YDKN and U.S. Bank National
Association (the " _Rabbi Trust Agreement_ "), shall pay in shares of YDKN
Common Stock all amounts due to plan participants and, if applicable, their
beneficiaries under Section 4.3 of the Piedmont PEP and all remaining shares
of YDKN Common Stock in the Rabbi Trust shall be distributed to legacy
stockholders of Piedmont Community Bank Holdings, Inc. pursuant to the terms
of the Rabbi Trust Agreement and shall be treated for the purposes of
this Agreement in the same manner as all other issued and outstanding shares
of YDKN Common Stock including _Section 1.4(a)_.

(e) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of YDKN shall be closed
as to holders of YDKN Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time and
no transfer of shares of YDKN Common Stock by any such holder shall thereafter
be made or recognized. If, after the Effective Time, certificates
representing shares of YDKN Common Stock (" _Certificates_ ," it being
understood that any reference herein to " _Certificates_ " shall be deemed to
include reference to shares of YDKN Common Stock held in book entry form) are
properly presented pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_ of this Agreement to the
Exchange Agent, such Certificates shall be cancelled and exchanged for FNB
Common Stock held in book entry form representing the number of whole shares
into which the shares of YDKN Common Stock represented by the Certificates was
converted in the Merger, plus, if applicable pursuant to _Section 1.4(g)_ ,
any payment for any fractional share of FNB Common Stock (without any
interest thereon) and any dividends or distributions to which the holder of
such Certificates is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_.

 

(f) Each holder of YDKN Common Stock shall have the option of enrolling the
whole shares of FNB Common Stock issuable to such shareholder upon the
consummation of the Merger in FNBs Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock
Purchase Plan (the " _DRSP Plan_ "),

 



3  as long as such shareholder enrolls with a minimum of fifty (50) whole
shares of FNB Common Stock. Each YDKN shareholder electing to enroll in the
DRSP Plan shall be issued FNB Common Stock held in book entry form
representing the number of whole shares received in the Merger.

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
YDKN Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional
share of FNB Common Stock, after taking into account all shares of YDKN Common
Stock owned by such holder as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall receive an amount in cash, without interest, rounded to the nearest
cent, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a) the Average Closing
Price by (b) the fraction of a share (calculated to the nearest ten-thousandth
when expressed in decimal form) of FNB Common Stock, to which such holder
would otherwise be entitled. No such holder shall be entitled to dividends or
other rights in respect of any such fractional shares. " _Average Closing
Price_ " means the average composite closing price of FNB Common Stock as
reported by the NYSE for each of the twenty (20) consecutive trading days
ending on and including the fifth (5th) such trading day prior to the Closing
Date rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth.

1.5 _FNB Capital Stock_. At and after the Effective Time, each share of
FNB capital stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be affected by the
Merger.

 

1.6 _YDKN_ _Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _YDKN Stock Options_. Each outstanding and unexercised option immediately
prior to the Effective Time that was granted to purchase shares of YDKN
Common Stock (each, a " _YDKN_ _Stock Option_ ") under an equity-based
compensation plan identified in _Section 1.6(a)_ of the YDKN Disclosure
Schedule (collectively, the " _YDKN_ _Equity Plans_ "), shall, at the
Effective Time, cease to represent a right to acquire shares of YDKN Common
Stock and shall be assumed by FNB and converted automatically into an option
to acquire that number of whole shares of FNB Common Stock (rounded down to
the nearest whole share) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a) the
number of shares of YDKN Common Stock subject to such YDKN Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (b) the Exchange Ratio, with
an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) obtained
by dividing (i) the per share exercise price under each such YDKN Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the Exchange Ratio. Each such
YDKN Stock Option as so assumed and converted shall continue to have, and
shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applicable immediately
prior to the Effective Time except as provided in this _Section 1.6(a)_ and
that from and after the Effective Time, FNB and the Compensation Committee of
the FNB Board of Directors, including, if applicable, the entire Board of
Directors of FNB, shall be substituted for YDKN and the Compensation Committee
of the Board of Directors of YDKN, including, if applicable, the entire Board
of Directors of YDKN, administering such YDKN Equity Plans. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, each YDKN Stock Option that is an "incentive stock option"
shall be adjusted as required by Section 424 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, so as not to constitute a modification,
extension or renewal of the option within the meaning of Section 424(h) of the
Code. FNB and YDKN agree to take all reasonable and necessary steps to effect
the provisions of this _Section 1.6(a)_. Promptly following the

 



4  Effective Time, FNB shall issue to each holder of each outstanding YDKN
Stock Option that has been assumed by FNB a document evidencing the conversion
and assumption of such YDKN Stock Option by FNB pursuant to this _Section
1.6(a)_.

(b) _YDKN Restricted Stock_. At the Effective Time, each award in respect of
a share of YDKN Common Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse
restriction granted under a YDKN Equity Plan that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (a " _YDKN Restricted Stock Award_ " and, together
with the YDKN Stock Options, the " _YDKN Equity Awards_ ") shall fully vest
and shall be converted into the right to receive, without interest, the Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 1.4_ and the shares of YDKN
Common Stock subject to such YDKN Restricted Stock Award shall be treated for
the purposes of this Agreement in the same manner as all other shares of YDKN
Common Stock.

 

1.7 _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Company_. At the
Effective Time, the FNB Charter, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving
Company until thereafter amended in accordance with its terms and applicable
Law. At the Effective Time, the FNB Bylaws, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Company until
thereafter amended in accordance with its terms and applicable Law.

 

1.8 _The Bank Merger_. As soon as practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, YDKN and FNB shall cause Yadkin Bank (" _YDKN Bank_ "), a state-
chartered bank and a wholly owned subsidiary of YDKN, and First National Bank
of Pennsylvania (" _FNB Bank_ "), a national banking association and wholly
owned subsidiary of FNB, respectively, to enter into a bank merger agreement
substantially in the form attached to this Agreement as _Exhibit B_ (the "
_Bank Merger Agreement_ "), which provides for the merger of YDKN Bank with
and into FNB Bank immediately following the Merger, with FNB Bank being the
surviving entity (the " _Bank Merger_ "). Prior to filing applications for the
Requisite Regulatory Approvals: (i) (A) YDKN shall cause YDKN Bank to obtain
approval from the Board of Directors of YDKN Bank for the Bank Merger
Agreement, (B) YDKN, as the sole shareholder of YDKN Bank, shall approve the
Bank Merger Agreement and (C) YDKN shall cause the Bank Merger Agreement to be
duly executed by YDKN Bank and delivered to FNB; and (ii) (A) FNB shall
cause FNB Bank to obtain approval from the Board of Directors of FNB Bank for
the Bank Merger Agreement, (B) FNB, as the sole shareholder of FNB Bank, shall
approve the Bank Merger Agreement and (C) FNB shall cause the Bank Merger
Agreement to be duly executed by FNB Bank and delivered to YDKN. Prior to the
Effective Time, YDKN shall cause YDKN Bank, and FNB shall cause FNB Bank, to
execute such articles or statement of merger and such other documents and
certificates as are necessary or desirable to make the Bank Merger effective
(the " _Bank Merger Certificates_ ") immediately following the Effective Time.

 

1.9 _Right to Revise Structure_. At FNBs election delivered to YDKN in
writing, FNB may at any time alternatively structure the Merger so that any
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FNB is merged with and into
YDKN; provided, however, that no such change shall (i) alter or change the
amount or kind of the Merger Consideration or treatment of the shares YDKN
Common Stock or YDKN Equity Awards provided for in this Agreement, (ii)
prevent the parties from obtaining the opinions of counsel referred to in
_Sections 7.2(d)_ and _7.3(d)_ or adversely affect the Tax treatment for
YDKNs shareholders as a result of receiving the Merger

 



5  Consideration or the Tax treatment of either party pursuant to this
Agreement, or (iii) be reasonably likely to impede or delay consummation of
the transactions this Agreement contemplates. In the event of such an
election, the parties agree to execute an appropriate amendment to this
Agreement (to the extent such amendment only changes the method of effecting
the business combination and does not substantively affect this Agreement or
the rights and obligations of the parties or their respective shareholders) in
order to reflect such election.

 

ARTICLE 2

EXCHANGE OF SHARES 

2.1 _FNB to Make Merger Consideration Available_. At or as promptly as
practicable following the Effective Time, FNB shall deposit, or shall cause
to be deposited, with Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as exchange agent ("
_Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Certificates and for
exchange in accordance with this _Article 2_ , (i) book entry shares
representing the aggregate number of shares of FNB Common Stock issuable
pursuant to this Agreement in exchange for the shares of YDKN Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger and (ii)
immediately available funds sufficient in amount to pay (x) any Cash
Consideration issuable in accordance with _Section 1.4(b),_ (y) any dividends
or distributions payable in accordance with _Section 2.2(b)(i_ ), and (z) cash
in lieu of any fractional shares of FNB Common Stock to be issued pursuant to
_Section 1.4(g)_ , and paid pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_ in exchange for
outstanding shares of YDKN Common Stock (such immediately available funds and
book entry shares of FNB Common Stock, collectively being referred to as the
" _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the
Exchange Fund as directed by FNB, provided that no such investment or losses
thereon shall affect the amounts payable to the holders of Certificates.

2.2 _Exchange Shares_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later
than five (5) business days thereafter, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each
holder of record of YDKN Common Stock a letter of transmittal in customary
form as prepared by FNB and reasonably acceptable to YDKN (which shall
specify, among other things, that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration and any
cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the shares of YDKN Common Stock
represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted
pursuant to this Agreement and any dividends or distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_. After the Effective Time of
the Merger, each holder of a Certificate formerly representing shares of YDKN
Common Stock, other than Treasury Shares, who surrenders or has surrendered
such Certificate or customary affidavits and indemnification regarding the
loss or destruction of such Certificate, together with duly executed
transmittal materials to the Exchange Agent, shall, upon acceptance thereof,
be entitled to: (i) book entry shares representing FNB Common Stock
into which the shares YDKN Common Stock shall have been converted pursuant to
_Section 1.4_ , (ii) any cash in lieu of any fractional share of FNB Common
Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled and (iii) any dividends
or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section
2.2(b)_ ; provided

 



6  however, that if the holder of Yadkin Non-Voting Common Stock has made the
Cash Election and has surrendered such Certificate or customary affidavits and
indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such Certificate,
together with duly executed transmittal materials to the Exchange Agent, then
such holder shall, upon acceptance thereof, be entitled to the Cash
Consideration. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificate upon
compliance with such reasonable and customary terms and conditions as the
Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance
with normal practices. Subject to applicable Law, until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 2.2_ , each Certificate representing shares of
YDKN Common Stock shall be deemed from and after the Effective Time of the
Merger to evidence only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, any
cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the shares of YDKN Common Stock
represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted
pursuant to this Agreement, any dividends or distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_ and, if applicable, the Cash
Consideration. Subject to applicable Law, FNB shall not be obligated to
deliver the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and/or
any declared but unpaid dividends or, if applicable, the Cash Consideration
to which any former holder of YDKN Common Stock is entitled as a result of the
Merger until such holder surrenders his Certificate or Certificates for
exchange as provided in this _Section 2.2_. If any shares of FNB
Common Stock, or any cash in lieu of fractional shares and/or declared but
unpaid dividends, are to be issued in a name other than that in which a
Certificate surrendered for exchange is issued, the Certificate so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and the
person requesting such exchange shall affix any requisite stock transfer tax
stamps to the Certificate surrendered or provide funds for their purchase or
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such taxes are not
payable. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then
upon the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to FNB, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by FNB or the Exchange Agent, the posting
by such Person of a bond in such amount as FNB and the Exchange Agent may
determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it, FNB or the Surviving Company with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement. 

(b) Following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the
record holder of the whole shares of FNB Common Stock issued in exchange
therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of
any dividends or distributions, if any, with a record date prior to the
Effective Time that have been declared by YDKN in respect of shares of YDKN
Common Stock after the date of this Agreement in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time, (ii) at the time
of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional
share of FNB Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
_Section 1.4(g)_ and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time of the Merger and which had become
payable with respect to such whole shares of FNB Common Stock prior to the
time of surrender, and (iii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions, with a record date after the Effective Time
of the Merger but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to
surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of FNB Common Stock.

 



7 (c) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of YDKN of the shares of YDKN Common Stock that were issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle
transfers of shares of YDKN Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to FNB for any
reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.
All shares of FNB Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares of FNB
Common Stock and/or declared but unpaid dividends issued or paid upon the
surrender for exchange of shares of YDKN Common Stock (or the provision of
customary affidavits and indemnification for lost or mutilated Certificates in
accordance with the terms hereof) and the letter of transmittal, shall
be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining
to such shares of YDKN Common Stock.

(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund, including any interest thereon, that
remains undistributed to the shareholders of YDKN following the passage of
twelve (12) months after the Effective Time of the Merger shall be delivered
to FNB, upon demand, and any shareholders of YDKN who have not theretofore
complied with this _Section 2.2_ shall thereafter look only to FNB for payment
of their claim for FNB Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
FNB Common Stock and any unpaid dividends or distributions payable in
accordance with _Section 2.2(b)_.

(e) Neither YDKN nor FNB shall be liable to any holder of shares of
YDKN Common Stock or FNB Common Stock, as the case may be, for such shares,
any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, or cash from the Exchange
Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.

(f) The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of
ownership with respect to the shares of FNB Common Stock held by it from time
to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or
other distributions paid or distributed with respect to such shares of FNB
Common Stock for the account of the Persons entitled thereto.

 

2.3 _Adjustments for Dilution and Other Matters_. If prior to the Effective
Time of the Merger, (a) FNB shall declare a stock dividend or distribution on
FNB Common Stock with a record date prior to the Effective Time of the Merger,
or subdivide, split up, reclassify or combine FNB Common Stock, or make a
distribution other than a regular quarterly cash dividend, on FNB Common
Stock or on any security convertible into FNB Common Stock, in each case with
a record date prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, or (b) the
outstanding shares of FNB Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased,
changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or
securities in each case as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other
similar change in FNBs capitalization, then a proportionate adjustment or
adjustments will be made to the Exchange Ratio and, as applicable, the Average
Closing Price to give holders of YDKN Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event, which adjustment may
include, as appropriate, the issuance of securities, property or cash on the
same basis as that on which any of the foregoing shall have been issued,
distributed or paid to holders of such class of FNB Common Stock generally.

 



8 2.4 _Withholding Rights_. The Exchange Agent or, subsequent to the first
anniversary of the Effective Time, FNB, shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any cash in lieu of fractional shares of FNB Common Stock, cash
dividends or distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_ and any other
cash amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
YDKN Common Stock or YDKN Equity Awards such amounts as the Exchange Agent or
FNB, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or
any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law, with respect to the making
of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so withheld by the Exchange
Agent or FNB, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of
YDKN Common Stock or YDKN Equity Awards in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or FNB, as the case may be.

 

ARTICLE 3

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF YDKN

Except as (i) disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by YDKN to FNB
prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _YDKN Disclosure Schedule_ ")
or (ii) as disclosed in any YDKN Reports filed by YDKN prior to the date
hereof (but disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the heading
"Risk Factors," or disclosures of risks set forth in any "forward-looking
statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-specific
or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), YDKN hereby
represents and warrants to FNB as follows:

 

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 

(a) YDKN is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of North Carolina. YDKN has
the corporate power and authority and has all licenses, permits and
authorizations of applicable Governmental Entities required to own or lease
all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where such failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect upon YDKN.

(b) True and complete copies of the articles of incorporation of YDKN (the "
_YDKN Articles_ ") and the bylaws of YDKN (the " _YDKN Bylaws_ "), each as
amended, supplemented, restated and/or otherwise modified and in effect as of
the date of this Agreement, have previously been made available to FNB.

(c) YDKN Bank is a state-chartered bank and is regulated by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (" _FDIC_ ") and the North Carolina
Commissioner of Banks (" _NCCOB_ "). YDKN Bank is duly organized, and validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of North Carolina
and has the requisite power and authority, corporate or otherwise, to own its
property and carry on its business as presently conducted, but is not
qualified to do business in any other jurisdiction or required to be qualified
to do business in any other jurisdiction except where the failure to be so
qualified would not have a Material Adverse

 



9  Effect on YDKN. Each of YDKNs other Subsidiaries (i) was duly organized,
(ii) is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization, (iii) is duly licensed or qualified to do
business in, and in good standing under the laws of, all jurisdictions,
whether federal, state, local or foreign, where its ownership or leasing of
property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified, and
(iv) has all requisite corporate power and authority, and has all licenses,
permits and authorizations of applicable Governmental Entities required to own
or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now
conducted, except for purposes of clause (iii) only, as would not be
reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on YDKN. The articles of incorporation, bylaws and similar
governing documents of each Subsidiary of YDKN, copies of which have been
made available to FNB, are true and correct copies of such documents as
amended, supplemented, restated and/or otherwise modified and in effect on the
date of this Agreement.

 

(d) As used in this Agreement, (i) the word " _Subsidiary_ " when used with
respect to either party, means any corporation, partnership, joint venture,
limited liability company or any other entity (A) of which such party, or a
subsidiary of such party, is a general partner, or (B) at least a majority of
the securities or other interests of which having by their terms ordinary
voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors or persons
performing similar functions with respect to such entity is directly or
indirectly owned by such party and/or one or more Subsidiaries thereof, and
the terms " _YDKN Subsidiaries_ " and " _FNB Subsidiaries_ " shall mean any
direct or indirect Subsidiary of YDKN or FNB, respectively; and (ii) the term
" _Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect to FNB, YDKN or the
Surviving Company, as the case may be, any event, circumstance, development,
change or effect that alone or in the aggregate with other events,
circumstances, developments, changes or effects, (A) is materially adverse to
the business, results of operations or financial condition of such party and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole; provided, however, that, with respect to
this clause (A), Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to include
effects to the extent resulting from (1) changes, after the date of this
Agreement, in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") or
regulatory accounting requirements applicable to banks or savings associations
and their holding companies generally, (2) changes, after the date of this
Agreement, in Laws of general applicability or interpretations thereof by
courts or any Governmental Entity, (3) actions or omissions of (x) FNB or (y)
YDKN, in each case, taken at the request of, or with the prior written
consent of, the other or required hereunder, (4) changes, events or
developments, after the date of this Agreement, in the regional, national or
world economy or financial or securities markets generally, or changes,
events or developments, after the date of this Agreement, in general economic
conditions or other changes, events or developments, after the date of this
Agreement that affect banks or savings associations or their holding
companies generally, except to the extent that such changes have a materially
disproportionate adverse effect on such party relative to other similarly
situated participants in the markets or industries in which they operate, (5)
consummation or public disclosure of the transactions this Agreement
contemplates, including the resignation of employment of employees or any
impact on such partys business, customer relations, condition or results of
operations, in each case as a result therefrom, (6) any outbreak or
escalation of war or hostilities, any occurrence or threats of terrorist acts
or any armed hostilities associated therewith and any national or
international calamity, disaster or emergency or any escalation thereof, (7)
any changes in interest rates or foreign currency rates, (8) any claim, suit,
action, audit, arbitration, investigation, inquiry or other proceeding or
order

 



10  which in any manner challenges, seeks to prevent, enjoin, alter or delay, or
seeks damages as a result of or in connection with, the transactions this
Agreement contemplates, (9) any failure by such party to meet any published,
whether by such party or a third party research analyst, or internally
prepared estimates of revenues or earnings, (10) a decline in the price, or a
change in the trading volume of, such partys common stock on the New York
Stock Exchange (including any successor exchange, the " _NYSE_ ") and (11) any
matter to the extent that (x) it is disclosed in reasonable detail in the
partys disclosure schedules delivered to the other party pursuant to this
Agreement or in the YDKN Reports or FNB Reports prior to the date hereof
(except for risk factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk
Factors," or disclosures of risks set forth in any "forward-looking
statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-specific
or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), as applicable, and
(y) such disclosed matter does not worsen in a materially adverse manner, or
(B) materially delays or impairs the ability of such party to timely
consummate the transactions this Agreement contemplates.

 

3.2 _Capitalization_.

(a) The authorized capital stock of YDKN consists of 76,000,000 shares of
capital stock, which are divided into 75,000,000 shares of common stock (of

and (vii) no other shares of capital stock or other equity securities of YDKN
issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. All of the issued and
outstanding shares of YDKN Common Stock have been duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no
personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. Other than YDKN Equity
Awards issued prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of this
Agreement, there are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, puts,
calls, rights, exchangeable or convertible securities or other commitments or
agreements obligating YDKN to issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire, any such securities. There are no voting trusts,
shareholder agreements, proxies or other agreements in effect with respect to
the voting or transfer of the shares of YDKN Common Stock or other equity
interests of YDKN. As of the date of this Agreement, no bonds, debentures,
notes or other indebtedness having the right to vote on any matters on
which shareholders of YDKN may vote are issued or outstanding.

(b) All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or other
equity ownership interests of each YDKN Subsidiary are owned by YDKN,
directly or indirectly, free and clear of any material liens, pledges, charges
and security interests and similar encumbrances, other than liens for property
Taxes not yet due and payable (" _Liens_ "), and all of such shares or

 



11  equity ownership interests are duly authorized and validly issued and are
fully paid, nonassessable (except, with respect to bank Subsidiaries that are
insured depository institutions, as provided under 12 U.S.C. § 55 or any
comparable provision of applicable state law) and free of preemptive rights.
No such Subsidiary has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any character calling for the
purchase or issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other equity
security of such Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to
purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any other
equity security of such Subsidiary or any securities representing the right
to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any other
equity security of such Subsidiary.

 

3.3 _Authority; No Violation_.

 

(a) YDKN has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions this Agreement contemplates,
subject to the receipt of the Requisite YDKN Vote and Requisite Regulatory
Approvals. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions this Agreement contemplates have been duly and validly
approved by the Board of Directors of YDKN. Except for the approval of this
Agreement required under North Carolina law by the affirmative vote of a

Directors of YDKN (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that would be
reasonably likely to adversely affect YDKNs ability to accurately record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in YDKNs internal control over financial reporting.

or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of YDKN or any of

partnership, corporation, trust, joint venture, organization, Governmental
Entity or other entity (each, a " _Person_ ") relating to YDKN, any of the
YDKN Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or permits, licenses
or authorizations that has had, or is reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on YDKN.

(b) There is no judgment or order of any Governmental Entity or regulatory
restriction, other than those of general application that apply to similarly
situated financial or bank holding companies or their Subsidiaries, that has
been imposed upon YDKN, any of the

respects, has timely paid or withheld and timely remitted all Taxes shown
thereon as arising and has duly and timely paid or withheld and timely
remitted all material Taxes, whether or not shown on any Tax Return, that are

faith, which have not been finally determined, and (ii) have been adequately
reserved against in accordance with GAAP. All required estimated Tax payments
sufficient to avoid any underpayment penalties or interest have been made by
or on behalf of each of YDKN and the YDKN Subsidiaries. Neither YDKN nor any
of the YDKN Subsidiaries has granted any extension or waiver of the limitation
period for the assessment or collection of Tax that remains in effect. There
are no disputes, audits, examinations or proceedings in progress or pending,
including any notice received of any intent to conduct an audit or
examination, or claims asserted, for Taxes upon YDKN or any of the YDKN
Subsidiaries. No claim has been made by a Governmental Entity in a
jurisdiction where YDKN or any of the YDKN Subsidiaries has not filed Tax
Returns such that YDKN or any of the YDKN Subsidiaries is or may be subject to
taxation by that jurisdiction. All deficiencies asserted or assessments made
as a result of any examinations by any Governmental Entity of the Tax Returns
of, or including, YDKN or any of the YDKN Subsidiaries have been fully paid.
No issue has been raised by a Governmental Entity in any prior examination
or audit of each of YDKN and the YDKN Subsidiaries which, by application of
the same or similar principles, could reasonably be expected to result in a
proposed deficiency in respect of such Governmental Entity for any subsequent
taxable period. There are no Liens for Taxes, other than statutory liens for
Taxes not yet due and payable, upon any of the assets of YDKN or any of the
YDKN Subsidiaries. Neither YDKN nor any of the YDKN Subsidiaries is a party to
or is bound by any Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification agreement or
arrangement, other than such an agreement or arrangement exclusively between
or among YDKN and the YDKN Subsidiaries. Neither YDKN nor any of the YDKN
Subsidiaries (A) has been a member of an affiliated group filing a
consolidated federal income Tax Return, other than a group the common parent
of which was YDKN, or (B) has any liability for the Taxes of any Person, other
than YDKN or any of the YDKN Subsidiaries, under Treas. Reg. § 1.1502-6, or
any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law, or as a transferee or
successor, by contract or otherwise. Neither YDKN nor any of the YDKN
Subsidiaries has been, during the two-year period ending on the date hereof,
a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation", within the
meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code in a distribution of stock
intended to be governed in whole or in part by Sections 355 of the Code. YDKN
is not and has not been a "United States real property holding corporation"
within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code during the applicable
period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code. Neither YDKN, nor
any of the YDKN Subsidiaries or any other Person on their behalf has executed
or entered into any written agreement with, or obtained or applied for any
written consents or written clearances or any other Tax rulings from, nor has
there been any written agreement executed or entered into on

 



16  behalf of any of them with any Governmental Entity, relating to Taxes,
including any private letter rulings of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service
("IRS") or comparable rulings of any Governmental Entity and closing
agreements pursuant to Section 7121 of the Code or any predecessor provision
thereof or any similar provision of any applicable Law, which rulings or
agreements would have a continuing effect after the Effective Time. Neither
YDKN nor any of the YDKN Subsidiaries has engaged in any transaction that is
the same as or substantially similar to one of the types of transactions that
the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (" _IRS_ ") has determined to be a
tax avoidance transaction and identified by notice, regulation or other form
of published guidance as a "listed transaction", as set forth in Treas. Reg. §
1.6011-4(b)(2). YDKN has made available to FNB complete copies of (i) all
federal, state, local and foreign income or franchise Tax Returns of YDKN and
the YDKN Subsidiaries relating to all taxable periods beginning on and after
January 1, 2012, and (ii) any audit report issued within the last three years
relating to any Taxes due from or with respect to YDKN or the YDKN
Subsidiaries. Neither YDKN, any of the YDKN Subsidiaries nor FNB, as a
successor to YDKN, will be required to include any item of material income in,
or exclude any material item of deduction from, taxable income for any
taxable period or portion thereof ending after the Closing Date as a result of
any (i) change in method of accounting for a taxable period ending on or prior
to the Closing Date, (ii) installment sale or open transaction disposition
made on or prior to the Effective Time, (iii) prepaid amount received on or

of periods described in Treasury Regulations under Section 1502 of the Code,
or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign Law, for
periods or portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date. Neither

of this Agreement, have been timely made or paid in full. Each YDKN Benefit
Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan under Section 3(1) of ERISA
either (i) is funded through an insurance company contract and is not a
"welfare benefit fund" within the meaning of Section 419 of the Code, (ii) is
self-funded, or (iii) is unfunded.

(d) With respect to each YDKN Benefit Plan, YDKN and the YDKN Subsidiaries
have complied in all material respects, with all provisions of ERISA, the
Code and all Laws and regulations applicable to such YDKN Benefit Plans. Each
YDKN Benefit Plan has been administered in all material respects in accordance
with its terms. There are not now, nor do any circumstances exist that would
reasonably be likely to give rise to, any requirement for the posting of
security with respect to any YDKN Benefit Plan or the imposition of any
material lien on the assets of YDKN or any of the YDKN Subsidiaries under
ERISA or the Code.  _Section 3.11(d)_ of the YDKN Disclosure Schedule
identifies each YDKN Benefit Plan that is intended to be a "qualified plan"
within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code (the " _YDKN
Qualified Plans_ "). The IRS has issued a favorable determination letter with
respect to each YDKN Qualified Plan and the related trust which has not been
revoked, or YDKN is entitled to rely on a favorable opinion issued by the IRS.
To the knowledge of YDKN, there are no existing circumstances and no events
have occurred that would reasonably be likely to adversely affect the
qualified status of any YDKN Qualified Plan or the related trust. None of YDKN
and the YDKN Subsidiaries nor, to YDKNs knowledge, any other Person,
including any fiduciary, has engaged in any "prohibited transaction", as
defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA, which would
reasonably be likely to subject YDKN, any of the YDKN Subsidiaries or any
Person that YDKN or any of the YDKN Subsidiaries has an obligation to
indemnify, to any material Tax or penalty imposed under Section 4975 of the
Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

 

(e) With respect to each YDKN Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV or
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code, (i) there does not
exist any accumulated funding deficiency within the meaning of Section 412 of
the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, whether or not waived, and (ii) (A) no
reportable event within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which the
30-day notice requirement has not been waived has occurred, (B) all premiums,
if any, to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the " _PBGC_ ") have been
timely paid in full, (C) no liability, other than for premiums to the PBGC,
under Title IV of ERISA has been or would reasonably be likely to be incurred
by YDKN or any of the YDKN Subsidiaries and (D) the PBGC has not instituted
proceedings to terminate any such YDKN Benefit Plan and, to YDKNs knowledge,
no condition exists that makes it reasonably likely that such proceedings will
be instituted or which would reasonably be likely to constitute grounds under
Section 4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or the appointment of a trustee
to administer, any such YDKN Benefit Plan.

 



19 (f) (i) No YDKN Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a plan that has two or
more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control,
within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a " _Multiple Employer Plan_ "),
(ii) none of YDKN and its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates has, at any time during the last six (6) years, contributed to or
been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer
Plan and (iii) none of YDKN and the YDKN Subsidiaries nor any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates has incurred any Withdrawal Liability that has
not been satisfied in full. There does not now exist, nor do any circumstances
exist that would reasonably be likely to result in, any Controlled Group
Liability that would be a liability of YDKN or any of the YDKN Subsidiaries
following the Effective Time, other than such liabilities that arise solely
out of, or relate solely to, the YDKN Benefit Plans or YDKN Employment
Agreements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither YDKN
nor any of the YDKN Subsidiaries, nor, to YDKNs knowledge, any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates, has engaged in any transaction described in
Sections 4069, 4204 or 4212 of ERISA.

 

(g) YDKN and the YDKN Subsidiaries have no liability for life, health, medical
or other welfare benefits to former employees or beneficiaries or dependents
thereof, except for health continuation coverage as required by Section 4980B
of the Code, Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or applicable law and at no expense to
YDKN and the YDKN Subsidiaries.

 

(h) Neither the execution nor the delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions this Agreement contemplates will,
either alone or in conjunction with any other event, whether contingent or
otherwise, (i) result in any payment or benefit becoming due or payable, or
required to be provided, to any director, employee or independent contractor
of YDKN or any of the YDKN Subsidiaries, (ii) increase the amount or value of
any benefit or compensation otherwise payable or required to be provided to
any such director, employee or independent contractor, (iii) result in the
acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or funding of any such benefit
or compensation including deferred compensation or (iv) result in any amount
failing to be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code or would be
subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code or additional tax
under Section 409A of the Code.

(i) YDKN has delivered or made available to FNB a true and complete list of
the corporate and functional titles, hire dates, incentive compensation,
profit sharing and bonuses paid in 2015, full or part-time status, 2016 annual
salaries or hourly rates of all employees of YDKN or any of the
YDKN Subsidiaries (" _YDKN Employees_ ") as of the date hereof and, with
respect to any YDKN Employee on a leave of absence or otherwise not actively
employed (" _Inactive YDKN Employees_ "), the date on which each such
Inactive YDKN Employee is expected to return to active employment. Except as
otherwise set forth in _Section 3.11(i)_ of the YDKN Disclosure Schedule, (A)
none of the YDKN Employees has a contract of employment with YDKN or any of

Assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the

YDKN or the YDKN Subsidiary party thereto, as the case may be, in accordance
with its terms and is in full force and effect, except as may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting
the rights of creditors generally and the availability of equitable remedies.
There is not under any such Lease any material existing default by YDKN or any
of the YDKN Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of YDKN, any other party

constitute such a default. The consummation of the transactions this Agreement
contemplates will not cause any default under the Leases, provided the
consents and notices disclosed in this _Section_ _ _ _3.17(b)_ of the YDKN
Disclosure Schedule have been obtained or made, except for any such default
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect on YDKN.

" _Leased Properties_ ") constitute all of the real estate on which YDKN and
the YDKN Subsidiaries maintain their facilities or conduct their business as
of the date of this Agreement, except for locations the loss of which would
not result in a Material Adverse Effect on YDKN.

Loans, and all Loans owned by YDKN and each YDKN Subsidiary are with full
recourse to the borrowers, and neither of YDKN nor any YDKN Subsidiary has

limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting
creditors rights and except as may be limited by the exercise of judicial
discretion in applying principles of equity.

other lender or participant to YDKN or any YDKN Subsidiary for payment or

Subsidiary that have had their respective terms to maturity accelerated
during the past twelve (12) months, (ii) all loan commitments or lines of

exists in connection therewith and (v) all assets classified by YDKN as OREO
and all other assets currently held that were acquired through foreclosure or

its Subsidiaries is bound by an agreement pursuant to which Loans or pools of
Loans or participations in Loans have been sold that contains any obligation
of YDKN or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase such Loans or interests
therein or that would entitle the buyer to pursue any other recourse against
YDKN or any of the YDKN Subsidiaries.

authority and has all licenses, permits and authorizations of applicable
Governmental Entities required to own or lease all of its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly
licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties
and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification
necessary, except where such failure to be so licensed or qualified would not
have a Material Adverse Effect upon FNB.

(b) True and complete copies of the articles of incorporation (the " _FNB
Charter_ ") and bylaws of FNB (the " _FNB Bylaws_ "), each as amended,
supplemented, restated and/or otherwise modified and in effect as of the date

licenses, permits and authorizations of applicable Governmental Entities

Material Adverse Effect on FNB. The charter documents and bylaws of each
Subsidiary of FNB that is a "significant subsidiary" within the meaning of
Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X of the SEC, copies of which have been made

internal accounting controls effective to provide reasonable assurances
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP. FNB (i) has implemented and

and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that would be reasonably likely to
adversely affect FNBs ability to accurately record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in FNBs
internal control over financial reporting.

the FNB Subsidiaries, that has had, or is reasonably likely to have, a
Material Adverse Effect on FNB.

of, or including, FNB or any of its Subsidiaries have been fully paid.
No issue has been raised by a Governmental Entity in any prior examination or
audit of each of FNB and its Subsidiaries which, by application of the same or
similar principles, could reasonably be expected to result in a proposed
deficiency in respect of such Governmental Entity for any subsequent taxable
period. There are no Liens for Taxes, other than statutory liens for Taxes not

common parent of which was FNB, or (B) has any liability for the Taxes of any
Person, other than FNB or any of the FNB Subsidiaries, under Treas. Reg. §

is not and has not been a "United States real property holding corporation"
within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code during the applicable

into any written agreement with, or obtained or applied for any written
consents or written clearances or any other Tax rulings from, nor has there
been any written agreement executed or entered into on behalf of any of them

thereof or any similar provision of any applicable Law, which rulings or
agreements would have a continuing effect after the Effective Time. Neither
FNB nor any of the FNB Subsidiaries has engaged in any transaction that is the
same as or substantially similar to one of the types of transactions that the

compensation, severance, employment, change of control or fringe benefit plan,
program or policy.

 

" _FNB Employment Agreement_ " means a contract, offer letter or agreement of
FNB or any of its Subsidiaries with or addressed to any individual who is
rendering or has rendered services thereto as an employee pursuant to which
FNB or any of its Subsidiaries has any actual or contingent liability or

past, present or future services.

(a) _Section 4.11(a)_ of the FNB Disclosure Schedule includes a complete list
of all FNB Benefit Plans and all FNB Employment Agreements.

(b) With respect to each FNB Benefit Plan, FNB made available to YDKN a true,

FNB Benefit Plan, including all plan documents, trust agreements, and
insurance contracts and other funding vehicles, (ii) the two most recent
Annual Reports (Form 5500 Series) and accompanying schedules, if any, (iii)

applicable Law or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking, and
all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding any FNB
Benefit Plan, for the period six (6) years prior to and through the date of
this Agreement, have been timely made or paid in full. Each FNB Benefit Plan
that is an employee welfare benefit plan under Section 3(1) of ERISA either
(i) is funded through an insurance company contract and is not a "welfare
benefit fund" within the meaning of Section 419 of the Code, (ii) is self-
funded, or (iii) is unfunded.

(d) With respect to each FNB Benefit Plan, FNB and its Subsidiaries have
complied in all material respects, with all provisions of ERISA, the Code and
all Laws and regulations applicable to such FNB Benefit Plans. Each FNB
Benefit Plan has been administered in all material respects in accordance with
its terms. There are not now, nor do any circumstances exist that would
reasonably be likely to give rise to, any requirement for the posting of
security with respect to a FNB Benefit Plan or the imposition of any material
lien on the assets of FNB or any of its Subsidiaries under ERISA or the Code.
_Section 4.11(d)_ of the FNB Disclosure Schedule identifies each FNB Benefit
Plan that is intended to be a "qualified plan" within the meaning of Section
401(a) of the Code (" _FNB Qualified Plans_ "). The IRS has issued a
favorable determination letter with respect to each FNB Qualified Plan and the
related trust which has not been revoked, or FNB is entitled to rely on a
favorable opinion issued by the IRS. To the knowledge of FNB, there are no
existing circumstances and no events have occurred that would reasonably be
likely to adversely affect the qualified status of any FNB Qualified

 



37  Plan or the related trust. None of FNB and its Subsidiaries nor, to FNBs
knowledge, any other Person, including any fiduciary, has engaged in any
"prohibited transaction", as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section
406 of ERISA, which would reasonably be likely to subject FNB, any of its
Subsidiaries or any Person that FNB or any of its Subsidiaries has an
obligation to indemnify, to any material Tax or penalty imposed under Section
4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

(e) No FNB Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA
or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code has failed to satisfy the minimum funding
standards contained in Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code. With
respect to such FNB Benefit Plans: (A) no reportable event within the meaning
of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which the 30-day notice requirement has not
been waived has occurred, (B) all premiums to the PBGC have been timely paid
in full, (C) no liability, other than for premiums to the PBGC, under Title IV
of ERISA has been or would reasonably be likely to be incurred by FNB or any
of its Subsidiaries and (D) the PBGC has not instituted proceedings to
terminate any such FNB Benefit Plan and, to FNBs knowledge, no condition
exists that makes it reasonably likely that such proceedings will be
instituted or which would reasonably be likely to constitute grounds under
Section 4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or the appointment of a trustee
to administer, any such FNB Benefit Plan.

 

(f) (i) No FNB Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a Multiple Employer
Plan, (ii) none of FNB and its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates has, at any time during the last six (6) years, contributed to or
been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer
Plan and (iii) none of FNB and its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates has incurred, during the last six (6) years, any Withdrawal
Liability that has not been satisfied in full. There does not now exist, nor
do any circumstances exist that would reasonably be likely to result in,
any Controlled Group Liability that would be a liability of FNB or any of its
Subsidiaries following the Effective Time, other than such liabilities that
arise solely out of, or relate solely to, the FNB Benefit Plans or the FNB
Employment Agreements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
neither FNB nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to FNBs knowledge, any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates, has engaged in any transaction described in
Sections 4069, 4204 or 4212 of ERISA.

 

(g) Other than as set forth in _Section 4.11(g)_ of the FNB Disclosure
Schedule, FNB and its Subsidiaries have no liability for life, health,
medical or other welfare benefits to former employees or beneficiaries or
dependents thereof, except for health continuation coverage as required by
Section 4980B of the Code, Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or applicable Law.

 

(h) No labor union, labor organization, or works council has made a demand for
recognition or certification for representation of employees of FNB or its
Subsidiaries, and there are no representations, certification proceedings, or
petitions seeking a representation proceeding presently pending or, to FNBs

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

6.1  _Regulatory Matters_.

(a) FNB agrees to prepare and file, as soon as practicable (but in any case,
within sixty (60) calendar days of the date of this Agreement), the
Registration Statement with the SEC in connection with the issuance of FNB
Common Stock in the Merger including the Joint Proxy Statement and prospectus
and other proxy solicitation materials of YDKN and FNB constituting a part
thereof and all related documents. YDKN shall prepare and furnish to FNB such
information relating to it and its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders as may be reasonably required in connection with the
above referenced documents based on its knowledge of and access to the
information required for said documents. YDKN and its legal, financial and
accounting advisors shall have the right to review in advance and approve,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed,
such Registration Statement prior to its filing. YDKN agrees to cooperate with
FNB and FNBs counsel and accountants in requesting and obtaining appropriate
opinions, consents and letters from its financial advisor and independent
auditor in connection with the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy
Statement. Each of YDKN and FNB agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after the filing thereof.
FNB also agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary
state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry
out the transactions this Agreement contemplates. After the SEC has declared
the Registration Statement effective under the Securities Act, each of YDKN
and FNB shall promptly mail the Joint Proxy Statement to their respective
shareholders, and the expenses in connection therewith shall be borne in
accordance with _Section 9.3(a)_.

(b) Each of YDKN and FNB agrees that none of the respective information
supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Registration

 



51  Statement shall, at the time the Registration Statement and each amendment
or supplement thereto, if any, becomes effective under the Securities Act,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading. Each of YDKN and FNB agrees that none of the information
supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Joint Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto shall at
the dates of mailing to YDKNs shareholders and FNBs shareholders, the YDKN
Shareholders Meeting and the FNB Shareholders Meeting contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading. Each
of YDKN and FNB further agrees that if such party shall become aware prior to
the Effective Time of any information furnished by such party that would cause
any of the statements in the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy
Statement to be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or to
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not
false or misleading, to promptly inform the other party thereof and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
filed promptly with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated
to the shareholders of YDKN.

 

(c) FNB agrees to advise YDKN, promptly after FNB receives notice thereof, of
the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any
supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order or
the suspension of the qualification of FNB Common Stock for offering or sale
in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or, to the extent FNB is aware thereof,
threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC
for the amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement or for
additional information.

 

(d) The parties shall cooperate with each other and use their respective
reasonable best efforts to promptly (but in any case, within sixty (60)
calendar days of the date of this Agreement) prepare and file all necessary
documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to
obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties, Regulatory Agencies and Governmental
Entities that are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions this
Agreement contemplates, including the Merger and the Bank Merger, and to
comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals
and authorizations of all such Regulatory Agencies and Governmental Entities.
YDKN and FNB shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent
practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, all the information
relating to YDKN or FNB, as the case may be, and any of their respective
Subsidiaries, which appear in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party, Regulatory Agency or any Governmental Entity
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties shall act reasonably and
as promptly as practicable. The parties shall consult with each other with
respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties, Regulatory Agencies and Governmental
Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions this Agreement
contemplates and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to completion of the transactions this Agreement
contemplates. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of
FNB and YDKN shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to (i) avoid
the entry of, or to have

 



52  vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that would restrain,
prevent or delay the Closing, and (ii) avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as possible.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to
require FNB or YDKN to take any action, or commit to take any action, or
agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining the
foregoing permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of Regulatory
Agencies or Governmental Entities that would reasonably be likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Surviving Company after giving effect to the
Merger, after the Effective Time (a " _Materially Burdensome Regulatory
Condition_ "). In addition, YDKN agrees to cooperate and use its reasonable
best efforts to assist FNB in preparing and filing such petitions and
filings, and in obtaining such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations
of third parties, Regulatory Agencies and Governmental Entities, that may be
necessary or advisable to effect any mergers and/or consolidations of
Subsidiaries of YDKN and FNB following consummation of the Merger.

(e) Each of FNB and YDKN shall, upon request, furnish to the other all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement, the
Registration Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or application
made by or on behalf of FNB, YDKN or any of their respective Subsidiaries to
any Regulatory Agency or Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(f) Each of FNB and YDKN shall promptly provide each other with any written
communications received from any Regulatory Agency or Governmental Entity
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will
promptly advise the other upon receiving any oral communication with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from any Regulatory Agency
or Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is required for consummation
of the transactions this Agreement contemplates.

 

(g) YDKN and FNB shall consult with each other before issuing any press
release with respect to the Merger or this Agreement and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public statements without the prior
consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that a party may, without the prior
consent of the other party, but after such consultation, to the extent
practicable under the circumstances, issue such press release or make such
public statements as may upon the advice of outside counsel be required by Law
or the rules or regulations of the SEC, the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC,
the OCC, the NCCOB or the NYSE. In addition, the Chief Executive Officers of
YDKN and FNB shall be permitted to respond to appropriate questions about the
Merger from the press. YDKN and FNB shall cooperate to develop all public
announcement materials and make appropriate management available at
presentations related to the Merger as reasonably requested by the other
party.

 

6.2 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, each of YDKN and FNB shall, and shall cause each of
their respective

 



53  Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and
other representatives of the other, reasonable access, during normal business
hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties,
books, contracts, commitments and records, and, during such period, the
parties shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, make
available to the other party all other information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as the other party may reasonably request. Each party
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any interference with
the other partys regular business operations during any such access.
YDKN shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, provide to FNB a
copy of each report, schedule and other document filed or received by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state banking
laws other than reports or documents that such party is not permitted to
disclose under applicable Law. Neither YDKN nor FNB nor any of their
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information
where such access or disclosure would be likely to jeopardize or prejudice
the attorney-client privilege or attorney work-product protection of such
party or its Subsidiaries or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order,
judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior
to the date of this Agreement, including laws relating to confidential
supervisory information. The parties shall make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the
preceding sentence apply to the extent possible in light of those
restrictions.

(b) All information and materials provided pursuant to this Agreement shall be
subject to the provisions of the confidentiality agreement, dated April 7,
2016, between YDKN and FNB (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 

(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect the representations and warranties of the
other set forth in this Agreement.

6.3 _Shareholder Approvals_.

 

(a) YDKN shall call a meeting of its shareholders for the purpose of obtaining
the Requisite YDKN Vote (the " _YDKN_ _Shareholders Meeting_ "), and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to convene such meeting as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Registration Statement being declared effective.
Subject to _Section 6.11(b)_ , YDKN shall (i) through the Board of Directors
of YDKN, recommend that the shareholders of YDKN approve and adopt this
Agreement, and approve the Merger and the other transactions this Agreement
contemplates, (ii) include such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement
(the " _YDKN_ _Recommendation_ "), and (iii) subject to the fiduciary duties
of the Board of Directors of YDKN, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
from its shareholders a vote approving and adopting the Merger and this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, YDKNs
obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this _Section 6.3_ shall not be
affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to YDKN of any Acquisition Proposal or by any change in the
YDKN Recommendation.

(b) FNB shall call a meeting of its shareholders for the purpose of obtaining
the Requisite FNB Vote (the " _FNB Shareholders Meeting_ "), and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to convene such meeting as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Registration Statement being declared effective.
FNB shall (i) through the Board of Directors of FNB, recommend that the
shareholders of FNB approve the issuance of FNB Common Stock pursuant

 



54  to this Agreement, (ii) include such recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement (the " _FNB Recommendation_ ") and (iii) and use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain from its shareholders a vote approving such issuance in
accordance with Section 312.03 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company
Manual. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the FNB Shareholders
Meeting shall be convened and the issuance of FNB Common Stock pursuant to
this Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of FNB at the FNB
Shareholders Meeting for the purpose of voting on such issuance, and nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to relieve FNB of such obligation. 

(c) YDKN and FNB shall cooperate to schedule and convene the YDKN Shareholders
Meeting and the FNB Shareholders Meeting on the same date. 

6.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Cooperation_. Each of YDKN and FNB agrees to
exercise good faith and use its reasonable best efforts to satisfy the
various covenants and conditions to Closing in this Agreement, and to
consummate the transactions this Agreement contemplates as promptly as
possible.

 

6.5 _NYSE Approval_. FNB shall cause the shares of FNB Common Stock to be
issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to
official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

6.6 _Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) As soon as administratively practicable after the Effective Time, FNB
shall take all reasonable action so that employees of YDKN and the YDKN
Subsidiaries shall be entitled to participate in each FNB Benefit Plan of
general applicability with the exception of FNBs defined benefit pension plan
and any other plan frozen to new participants (collectively, the " _FNB
Eligible Plans_ ") to the same extent as similarly-situated employees of FNB
and its Subsidiaries, it being understood that inclusion of the employees of
YDKN and the YDKN Subsidiaries in the FNB Eligible Plans may occur at
different times with respect to different plans, provided that coverage shall
be continued under corresponding YDKN Benefit Plans until such employees are
permitted to participate in the FNB Eligible Plans and provided further,
however, that nothing contained in this Agreement shall require FNB or any of
its Subsidiaries to make any grants to any former employee of YDKN under any
discretionary equity compensation plan of FNB or to provide the same level of
(or any) employer contributions or other benefit subsidies as YDKN or the
YDKN Subsidiaries have provided. Notwithstanding the foregoing, during the
period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary
thereof, FNB or its Subsidiaries shall provide severance payments and
benefits to each employee of YDKN and the YDKN Subsidiaries that are no less
favorable than the severance payments and benefits provided by FNB and its
Subsidiaries to their similarly situated employees, as in effect as of the
date hereof and as described in _Section 6.6(a)_ of the FNB Disclosure
Schedule.

(b) FNB shall cause each FNB Eligible Plan in which employees of YDKN and the
YDKN Subsidiaries are eligible to participate, to recognize, for purposes of
determining eligibility to participate in, and vesting of, benefits under the
FNB Eligible Plans, the service of such employees with YDKN and the YDKN
Subsidiaries to the same extent as such service was credited for such purpose
by YDKN or the YDKN Subsidiaries, and, solely for purposes of

 



55  FNBs severance and vacation plans, policies and programs, for purposes of
determining the benefit amount, provided, however, that such service shall not
be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits. Except for the commitment to continue those YDKN
Benefit Plans that correspond to FNB Eligible Plans until employees of YDKN
and the YDKN Subsidiaries are included in such FNB Eligible Plans, nothing in
this Agreement shall limit the ability of FNB to amend or terminate any of the
YDKN Benefit Plans in accordance with and to the extent permitted by their
terms.

 

(c) At and following the Effective Time, FNB and the Surviving Company shall
honor and continue to be obligated to perform, in accordance with their
terms, all benefit obligations to, and contractual rights of, current and
former employees of YDKN and the YDKN Subsidiaries and current and former
directors of YDKN and the YDKN Subsidiaries existing as of the Closing Date
under any YDKN Benefit Plan.

(d) At such time as employees of YDKN and the YDKN Subsidiaries become
eligible to participate in a medical, dental or health plan of FNB or its
Subsidiaries, FNB shall, to the extent reasonably practicable and available
from its insurers, cause each such plan to (i) waive any preexisting condition
limitations to the extent such conditions were satisfied or waived under the
analogous YDKN Benefit Plan, (ii) waive any waiting period limitation or
evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to
such employee or dependent on or after the Effective Time to the extent such
employee or dependent had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement
under an analogous YDKN Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time and (iii)
provide each such employee of YDKN and the YDKN Subsidiaries and his or her
eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments or coinsurance and
deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time under an YDKN Benefit Plan (to
the same extent that such credit was given under the analogous YDKN Benefit
Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible,
co-payment, coinsurance or maximum out-of-pocket requirements under any
medical, dental or health plan of FNB or its Subsidiaries.

 

(e) YDKN shall adopt such Board resolutions and take such other action as FNB
may reasonably request at least thirty (30) days prior to the Effective Time
to cause all 401(k) Plans to be terminated immediately prior to the Effective
Time (the " _Plan Termination Date_ ") and the accounts of all participants
and beneficiaries in the 401(k) Plans as of the Plan Termination Date to
become fully vested as of the Plan Termination Date. As soon as practicable
after the Effective Time, but in no event later than six (6) months after the
Plan Termination Date, FNB shall file or cause to be filed all necessary
documents with the IRS for a determination letter that the termination of the
401(k) Plans as of the Plan Termination Date will not adversely affect the
plans qualified status. FNB shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
such favorable determination letter; including adopting such amendments to
the 401(k) Plans as may be requested by the IRS as a condition to its issuance
of a favorable determination letter. As soon as practicable following the
receipt of a favorable determination letter from the IRS regarding the
qualified status of the 401(k) Plans upon its termination, the account
balances in the 401(k) Plans shall be distributed to participants and
beneficiaries or transferred to an eligible tax-qualified retirement plan
or individual retirement account as a participant or beneficiary may direct.
The Surviving Company shall take all other actions necessary to complete the
termination of the 401(k) Plans, including filing a Final Form 5500, that
arise after the Effective Time. FNB agrees, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, to permit the participants in the

 



56  401(k) Plans who become employees of FNB or its Subsidiaries to roll over
their account balances in the 401(k) Plans and loans from the 401(k) Plans to
the F.N.B. Corporation Progress Savings 401(k) Plan. Notwithstanding anything
in _Section_ _ _ _6.6(a)_ to the contrary, employees of YDKN or any YDKN
Subsidiary who continue in employment with the Surviving Company following the
Effective Time shall be eligible as of the Effective Time to participate in
the F.N.B. Corporation Progress Savings 401(k) Plans.

(f) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, YDKN shall, at the written
request of FNB, (i) freeze or terminate each other YDKN Benefit Plan as
requested by FNB, including without limitation any employee benefit pension
plan within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA and any non-qualified
deferred compensation plans and make appropriate distributions therefrom;
provided, however, that YDKN shall not distribute balances of less than
$20,000 from employee benefit pension plans; and (ii) freeze all post-
retirement benefits available under the YDKN Benefit Plans.

(g) YDKN shall take such action, and provide any required notices, as may be
necessary or appropriate to cause any Person presently serving as a trustee
or administrator to any YDKN Benefit Plan to be removed effective as of the
Effective Time and to appoint FNB, First National Trust Company, or such other
FNB Subsidiary or committee as FNB shall specify, to serve as successor
trustee or administrator to such removed individual trustees or administrators
effective as of the Effective Time.

 

(h) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to (i) be treated as an
amendment of any YDKN Benefit Plan; (ii) prevent FNB, YDKN or any of their
successors or Affiliates, after the Effective Time, from terminating the
employment of any YDKN employee who remains employed with YDKN or any of the
YDKN Subsidiaries; or (iii) create any third party beneficiary rights in any
employee of YDKN or any of the YDKN Subsidiaries, or any beneficiary or
dependent thereof, with respect to the compensation, terms and conditions of
employment and/or benefits that may be provided to any YDKN employee by FNB,
YDKN or any of their successors or Affiliates or under any benefit plan which
FNB, YDKN or any of their successors or Affiliates may maintain.

6.7  _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_.

(a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (each a " _Claim_ ") in
which any individual who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of
this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or
officer of YDKN or any of the YDKN Subsidiaries or who is or was serving at
the request of YDKN or any of the YDKN Subsidiaries as a director, officer,
employee, trustee or fiduciary of another Person (the " _Indemnified Parties_
"), is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or
arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he or
she is or was a director or officer of YDKN or any of the YDKN Subsidiaries or
was serving at the request of the YDKN or any of the YDKN Subsidiaries as a
director, officer, employee, trustee or fiduciary of another Person or (ii)
this Agreement or any of the transactions this Agreement contemplates,
whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, the parties
shall cooperate and use their best efforts to defend against such Claim and
respond 

 



57  thereto. From and after the Effective Time, FNB shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Company to, (A) indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest
extent currently provided under applicable Law, the YDKN Articles and the
YDKN Bylaws, each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, costs, expenses, including reimbursement for reasonable fees and
expenses, including fees and expenses of legal counsel, and judgments, fines
and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such threatened or
actual Claim and (B) advance expenses as incurred (including in advance of the
final disposition of any Claim) by such Indemnified Party to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law; provided that the Indemnified Party to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking (in a reasonable and
customary form) if required by applicable Law to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification.

(b) FNB and the Surviving Company agree that all rights to indemnification of
liabilities, including advancement of expenses, and all limitations with
respect thereto, existing in favor of any Indemnified Person, as provided
under _Section 6.7(a)_ , shall survive the Merger and shall continue in
full force and effect, without any amendment thereto; provided, however, that
any determination required to be made with respect to whether an Indemnified
Partys conduct complies with the standards set forth under applicable Law,
the YDKN Articles or the YDKN Bylaws, as the case may be, shall be made by
independent legal counsel, whose fees and expenses shall be paid by FNB and
the Surviving Company, selected by such Indemnified Party and reasonably
acceptable to FNB; and, provided further that nothing in this _Section 6.7_
shall impair any rights or obligations of any current or former director or
officer of YDKN or its Subsidiaries, including pursuant to the respective
organizational documents of YDKN, or its Subsidiaries, under applicable Law
or otherwise.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, FNB shall obtain and FNB shall maintain for a
period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance policies
covering the Indemnified Parties who as of the Effective Time are covered by
YDKNs directors and officers liability insurance or fiduciary liability
insurance policies, in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, including the transactions this Agreement contemplates,
provided that these policies must be of at least the same coverage amounts
and contain coverage terms and conditions that are not less advantageous than
such policies of YDKN. The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence
shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid policies have been obtained
prior to the Effective Time from an insurer or insurers selected by FNB in
consultation with YDKN that has or have an insurer financial strength rating
by A.M. Best Co. of at least "A", which policies provide the Indemnified
Parties with coverage, from the Effective Time to the sixth (6th) anniversary
of the Effective Time, including in respect of the transactions this Agreement
contemplates, on terms that are no less advantageous to the Indemnified
Parties than YDKNs directors and officers liability insurance or fiduciary
liability insurance policies existing immediately prior to the date of this
Agreement. If such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective
Time, then FNB shall maintain such policies in full force and effect and
continue the obligations thereunder. However, in no event shall FNB be
required to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in excess of 300% of the
annual premium paid by YDKN for such insurance (the " _Insurance Amount_ ") on
the date of this Agreement, and further provided that if FNB is unable to
maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this  _Section 6.7(c)_ as a
result of the preceding provision, FNB shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain policies containing

 



58  coverage amounts, terms and conditions that are the most advantageous for
the Indemnified Parties as is available for the maximum Insurance Amount.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.7_ shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If the Surviving
Company, or any of its successors or assigns, consolidates with or merges into
any other entity and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger, transfers all or substantially all of its assets or
deposits to any other entity or engages in any similar transaction, then in
each case, the Surviving Company will cause proper provision to be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Company will expressly
assume the obligations of the Surviving Company set forth in this _Section
6.7_.

 

6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, including any merger between a Subsidiary of FNB, on the one hand,
and a Subsidiary of YDKN, on the other hand, or to vest the Surviving Company
with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities
and franchises of either party to the Merger, the proper officers and
directors of each party and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such
necessary action as may be reasonably requested by, and at the sole expense
of, FNB.

 

6.9 _Advice of Changes_. Each of FNB and YDKN shall promptly advise the other
of any change or event (i) having or reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on it or (ii) that it believes would or would be reasonably
likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations,
warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement; provided, however, that
no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements of the parties, or remedies with respect thereto, or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement or that
reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate,
to the failure of a condition in _Article 7_ ; provided, further, that a
failure to comply with this _Section 6.9_ shall not constitute the failure of
any condition set forth in  _Article 7_ to be satisfied unless the underlying
Material Adverse Effect or material breach would independently result in the
failure of a condition set forth in _Article 7_ to be satisfied.

 

6.10 _Dividends_. Except for regular dividends paid at the quarterly rate in
effect as of the date of this Agreement, after the date of this Agreement,
YDKN shall not declare or pay any dividend in respect of shares of YDKN Common
Stock, provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 6.10_ , after the date of this Agreement YDKN shall coordinate
the declarations of any dividends in respect of the YDKN Common Stock and the
record dates and payment dates relating thereto with FNBs declaration of
regular quarterly dividends on FNB Common Stock and the record dates and
payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of YDKN and FNB that
holders of YDKN Common Stock shall not receive two dividends, or fail to
receive one dividend, in any quarter with respect to their shares of YDKN
Common Stock and any shares of FNB Common Stock such holders receive in
exchange therefor in the Merger.

6.11 _Certain Actions_.

forth in subsection (iii) below, (ii) to engage in any discussions or
negotiations with, and provide any information to, any Third Party in response
to a bona fide Acquisition Proposal by any such Third Party, if (x) YDKNs
Board of Directors concludes in good faith, based on the information then
available after consultation with outside counsel and, with respect to
financial matters, its financial advisor that failure to do so would be
reasonably likely to violate their fiduciary duties under applicable Law and
that such Acquisition Proposal could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal, (y) prior to providing any information or data to any Third
Party in connection with such Acquisition Proposal by any such Third Party,
YDKNs Board of Directors receives from such Third Party an executed
confidentiality agreement, which confidentiality terms shall be no less
favorable to YDKN than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and
(iii) to withdraw, modify, qualify in a manner adverse to FNB, condition or
refuse to make the YDKN Recommendation (the " _Change in YDKN Recommendation_
") if YDKNs Board of Directors concludes in good faith, based on the
information then available after consultation with outside counsel and, with
respect to financial matters, its financial advisor, that failure to do so
would be reasonably likely to violate their fiduciary duties under applicable
Law. Notwithstanding any Change in YDKN Recommendation, this Agreement shall
be submitted to the shareholders of YDKN at the YDKN Shareholders Meeting for
the purpose of voting on the approval of this Agreement and nothing contained
herein shall be deemed to relieve YDKN of such obligation; provided, however,
that if the Board of Directors of YDKN shall have effected a Change in YDKN
Recommendation, then the Board of Directors of YDKN may submit this Agreement
to YDKNs shareholders without recommendation (although the resolutions
adopting this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded), in which
event the Board of Directors of YDKN may communicate the basis for its lack of
a recommendation to YDKNs shareholders in the Joint Proxy Statement or
an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by
applicable Law. In addition to the foregoing, YDKN shall not submit to the
vote of its shareholders any Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger prior
to the termination of this Agreement.

 



60 (c) YDKN will promptly, and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours, (i)
notify FNB in writing of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any
information related thereto, which notification shall include the material
terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) notify FNB in
writing of any related developments, discussions and negotiations on a

each other to facilitate the integration, from and after the Closing, of YDKN

effect, give FNB a controlling influence over the management or policies of
YDKN or any of the YDKN Subsidiaries, or otherwise violate applicable Laws.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from the date of this
Agreement through the Closing Date and consistent with the performance of
their day-to-day operations, the continuous operation of YDKN and the YDKN
Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business and applicable Law, YDKN shall
use reasonable efforts to cause the employees and officers of YDKN and the
YDKN Subsidiaries, including YDKN Bank, to reasonably cooperate with FNB in

be requested by such law firms. FNB and YDKN shall each use its reasonable

certificates described in this _Section 6.13_.

6.14 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, FNB and YDKN shall take all

related electronic informational systems (the "Informational Systems
Conversion") to a single such system. It is the intent of the Parties that, to
the extent commercially reasonable, the systems of YDKN and the systems
acquired by YDKN from NewBridge Bancorp be converted to those used by FNB as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time. Such planning shall
include, but not be limited to: (a) discussion of the parties third-party
service provider arrangements; (b) non-renewal of personal property leases

functions; (f) providing copies of all system conversion planning and testing
documents and related materials to FNB in advance of the development of
the final systems conversions plans and observational rights for an FNB
representative to attend YDKN conversion planning meetings concerning the
systems conversions along with the right to observe data system conversion
testing protocols and access to data required to effectively map systems; and
(g) any other actions necessary and appropriate to facilitate the conversion,
as soon as practicable following the Effective Time.

conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and
its Subsidiaries respective operations.

6.18 _FNB Reincorporation_. YDKN acknowledges that prior to the Effective

transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) FNB has not received the
written opinion of its tax counsel, Reed Smith LLP, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to FNB, prior to the consummation of the
Reincorporation, to the effect that, on the basis of facts, representations
and assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinion, the Reincorporation
will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. The Parties agree that from and after the effective date of the
Reincorporation, all references in this Agreement to (a) "State of Florida,"
(b) "Florida Business Corporation Act," (c) "FBCA" and (d) "Florida Articles
of Merger," shall be amended and replaced, without any further action of the
Parties, by the terms (w) Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, (x) Pennsylvania

of Merger," respectively.

(d) _Federal Tax Opinion_. YDKN shall have received the written opinion of its
tax counsel, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to YDKN, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that,
on the basis of facts, representations and assumptions set forth or referred
to in such opinion, the Merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. In rendering such opinion, counsel may
require and rely upon Tax Representation Letters executed by officers of YDKN
and FNB.

Vote or the Requisite FNB Vote, and the Merger may be abandoned:

 

(a) _Mutual Consent_. by the mutual consent in writing of FNB and YDKN if the
Board of Directors of each so determines by vote of a majority of the members
of its entire Board;

(b) _Breach_.

 

(i) by FNB, if (A) any of the representations and warranties of YDKN contained

breached or failed to comply with any of its obligations under this Agreement
such that the condition set forth in _Section 7.2(b)_ would not be satisfied,
in either case other than as a result of a material breach by FNB of any of
its obligations under this Agreement, and such failure or breach with respect
to any such representation, warranty or obligation cannot be cured, or, if
curable, shall continue unremedied for a period of thirty (30) days after YDKN

breach, but in no event shall such 30-day period extend beyond the Outside

Merger is not consummated on or before 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on May 31,
2017 (the " _Outside Date_ "), unless the failure of the Merger to be

or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth in this
Agreement;

 

(d) _No Regulatory Approval_. by FNB or YDKN, if its respective Board of

Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final nonappealable
order, injunction or decree permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or
making illegal the consummation of the Merger or the Bank Merger; provided,

the YDKN Board of Directors shall have failed to make the YDKN Recommendation
or shall have effected a Change in YDKN Recommendation, (iii) the YDKN Board

YDKN Vote has been obtained, by YDKN in order to enter concurrently into an
Acquisition Proposal that has been received by YDKN and the YDKN Board of
Directors in compliance with _Sections 6.11(a)_ and _(b)_ and that
YDKNs Board of Directors concludes in good faith, in consultation with its
financial and legal advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior
Proposal; provided, however, that this Agreement may be terminated by YDKN
pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)_ or this _Section 8.1(i)_ only after the third
(3rd) business day following YDKNs provision of written notice to FNB
advising FNB that the YDKN Board of Directors is prepared to accept a Superior
Proposal (it being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that the delivery
of such notice shall not entitle FNB to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 8.1(i)_ ) and only if (i) during such three (3) business day
period, YDKN has negotiated, and has used its reasonable best efforts to
cause its financial and legal advisors to negotiate, with FNB in good faith to
make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that
such

 



69  Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal and (ii)
YDKNs Board of Directors has considered any such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement resulting from such negotiations and has
concluded in good faith, based upon consultation with its financial and legal
advisers, that such Acquisition Proposal remains a Superior Proposal even
after giving effect to the adjustments proposed by FNB, and further provided

Fee provided by _Section 6.11(f)_ to FNB; or

 

(j) _FNB Market Value_. by YDKN, if the YDKN Board of Directors so determines
by a majority vote of its members at any time during the five (5) business
day period commencing on the Determination Date if both of the following
conditions are satisfied:

 

(i) the FNB Market Value is less than 80% of the Initial FNB Market Value; and

 

(ii) the number obtained by dividing the FNB Market Value by the Initial FNB
Market Value (" _FNB Ratio_ ") shall be less than the quotient obtained by
dividing the Final Index Price by the Initial Index Price, minus 0.20 (the "
_Index Ratio_ ").

 

(iii) For purposes of this _Section 8.1(j)_ , the following terms shall have
the meanings indicated below:

 

(A) " _FNB Market Value_ " shall be the average of the daily closing sales
prices of a share of FNB Common Stock as reported on NYSE for the ten (10)
consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Determination Date.

(B) " _Determination Date_ " shall mean the date on which the last Requisite
Regulatory Approval is obtained with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, without regard to a requisite waiting period.

 

(C) " _Final Index Price_ " means the average of the closing price of the
Index on each of ten (10) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the
Determination Date.

(D) " _Index_ " means the SNL Mid Cap U.S. Bank Index; provided, however,
that if the SNL Mid Cap U.S. Bank Index is not available for any reason,
"Index" shall mean the NASDAQ Bank Index.

 

(E) " _Initial FNB Market Value_ " means the average of the daily closing
sales prices of a share of FNB Common Stock, as reported on NYSE, for the ten
(10) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date of this

Index for the ten (10) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the
date of this Agreement.



 



70 (iv) For purposes of this _Section 8.1(j)_ , if FNB or any company
belonging to the Index declares or effects a stock dividend,
reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares
or similar transaction between the date of this Agreement and the
Determination Date, the prices for the common stock of such company shall be
appropriately adjusted for the purposes of applying this _Section 8.1(j)_.

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either FNB or YDKN as provided in _Section_ _ _ _8.1_ , this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and have no effect except (i) _Sections 6.2(b)_ , 
_6.11(f)-(h)_ , _8.2_ , _9.3_ and _9.8_ shall survive any termination of this
Agreement and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, no party shall be relieved or released from any liability
or damages arising out of its fraud or willful breach of any of the
provisions of this Agreement.

8.3 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this Agreement
may be amended by the parties, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors at any time before or after the receipt of the
Requisite YDKN Vote; provided, however, that after the receipt of the
Requisite YDKN Vote, there may not be, without further approval of the YDKN
shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement that requires such further
approval under applicable Law. This Agreement may not be amended except by
an instrument in writing specifically designated as an amendment hereto,
signed on behalf of each of the parties.

8.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (ii) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this
Agreement; provided, however, that after the receipt of the Requisite YDKN
Vote, there may not be, without further approval of the YDKN shareholders, any
extension or waiver that requires further approval under applicable Law or any
portion of this Agreement that changes the amount or form of
the consideration to be delivered to the holders of YDKN Common Stock under
this Agreement, other than as this Agreement contemplates. Any agreement on
the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such
extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of,
or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

9.5 _Interpretation_. The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and
drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Articles, Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to an
Article or Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words
"include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall
be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The YDKN
Disclosure Schedule and the FNB Disclosure Schedule, as well as all other
schedules and all exhibits to this Agreement, shall be deemed part of this
Agreement and included in any reference to this Agreement. Any matter
disclosed pursuant to any section of either Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed disclosed for purposes of any other section of _Article 3_ or _Article
4_ , respectively, to the extent that applicability of the disclosure to such
other section is reasonably apparent on the face, notwithstanding the absence
of a specific cross-reference, of such disclosure. No item is required to be
set forth in either Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or
warranty if its absence would not result in the related representation or

 



73  warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect. The mere inclusion of an item in
either Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty
shall not be deemed an admission by either party that such item represents a
material exception or fact, event or circumstance or that such item is
reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect, or that any breach
or violation of applicable Laws or any contract exists or has actually
occurred. This Agreement shall not be interpreted or construed to require any
person to take any action, or fail to take any action, if to do so would
violate any applicable Law. As used in this Agreement, "knowledge" means the
actual knowledge as of the date referenced of executive officers of the
applicable party following reasonable inquiry of persons within their
organization and its Subsidiaries who would be reasonably expected to
be knowledgeable about the relevant subject matter. As used herein, (i)
"business day" means any day other than a Saturday, a Sunday or a day on which
banks in Raleigh, North Carolina or Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania are authorized
by law or executive order to be closed, (ii) the term "made available" means
any document or other information that was (a) provided by one party or its
representatives to the other party or its representatives prior to the
date hereof, (b) included in the virtual data room of a party prior to the
date hereof or (c) filed by a party with the SEC and publicly available on
EDGAR prior to the date hereof, (iii) references to "the date hereof" shall
mean the date of this Agreement, (iv) the word "or" is not exclusive and (v)
terms defined in the singular have a comparable meaning when used in the
plural, and vice versa.

 

9.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement, any signed agreement or instrument entered
into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto
or thereto, may be executed in two or more counterparts, including by
facsimile or other electronic means, all of which shall be considered one and
the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being
understood that each party need not sign the same counterpart. No party hereto
or to any such agreement or instrument shall raise the use of a facsimile
machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file to deliver a
signature to this Agreement or any amendment hereto or the fact that any
signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through
the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data
file as a defense to the formation of a contract and each party hereto forever
waives any such defense.

 

9.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, including the documents and the
instruments referred to in this Agreement, together with the Confidentiality
Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes
all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the
parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

 

9.8 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Specific Performance_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any applicable conflicts
of law.

(b) Each of the parties to this Agreement agrees that it shall bring any
action or proceeding in respect of any claim arising out of or related to
this Agreement or the transactions that are contemplated by this Agreement
exclusively in any federal or state court sitting in Wilmington, Delaware (the
" _Chosen Courts_ "), and solely in connection with claims arising under this
Agreement or the transactions that are the subject of this Agreement, (i)

 



74  irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, (ii)
waives any objection to laying venue in any such action or proceeding in the
Chosen Courts, (iii) waives any objection that the Chosen Courts are an
inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any party hereto and (iv)
agrees that service of process upon such party in any such action or
proceeding shall be effective if notice is given in accordance with  _Section
9.4_.

(c) EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT SUCH
PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT:
(I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES
THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS _SECTION 9.8_.

 

(d) Each party agrees that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or
were otherwise breached. Accordingly, the parties shall be entitled to
specific performance of the terms hereof, including an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms and provisions hereof (including the parties
obligation to consummate the Merger), in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties further waives (i)
any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would
be adequate and (ii) any requirement under any law to post security or a bond
as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

 

9.9 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms
or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision
of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable. In all such cases, the
parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to substitute a valid, legal
and enforceable provision that, insofar as practicable, implements the
original purposes and intents of this Agreement.

 

9.10 _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be
assigned by either of the parties, whether by operation of law or otherwise,
without the prior written consent of the other party. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of 

 



75  and be enforceable by each of the parties and their respective successors
and assigns. Except as otherwise specifically provided in _Section 6.7(d)_ ,
this Agreement, including the documents and instruments referred to in this
Agreement, is not intended to and does not confer upon any person other than
the parties to this Agreement any rights or remedies under this Agreement,
including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth
herein. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product
of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject
to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance herewith without notice or
liability to any other person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the
knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the
parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement
as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

FORM OF VOTING AGREEMENT

July 20, 2016

F.N.B. Corporation

One North Shore Center

 

12 Federal Street

Pittsburgh, PA 15212

 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

Concurrently with the execution of this letter agreement (" _Voting
Agreement_ "), F.N.B. Corporation, a Florida corporation (" _FNB_ "), and
Yadkin Financial Corporation, a North Carolina corporation (" _Yadkin_ "), are
entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, of even date herewith (the "
_Merger Agreement_ "), whereby Yadkin will merge with and into FNB (the "
_Merger_ ") and shareholders of Yadkin will receive the Merger Consideration
as set forth in the Merger Agreement, subject to the closing of the Merger.
All defined terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed
thereto in the Merger Agreement.

 

A condition to FNBs interest in entering into the Merger Agreement is that I
execute and deliver this Voting Agreement to FNB.

 

Intending to be legally bound hereby, I irrevocably agree and represent as
follows:

 

(a) As of the date of this Voting Agreement, I have, and at all times during
the term of this Voting Agreement will have, beneficial ownership (as defined
in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of, and good and valid title to, the
number of shares of voting common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Yadkin
(the " _Yadkin Common Stock_ "), that is set forth on _Appendix A_ hereto,
and I hold stock options or restricted stock awards to acquire or obtain the
number of shares of Yadkin Common Stock set forth on _Appendix A_ hereto. All
of the securities listed on _Appendix A_ are owned free and clear of any
proxy or voting restriction, claims, liens, encumbrances and security
interests and any other limitation or restriction whatsoever (including,
except with respect to stock options or restricted stock awards, any
restriction on the right to dispose of such securities). None of the
securities listed on _Appendix A_ is subject to any voting trust or other
agreement or arrangement with respect to the voting rights of such securities.

 

(b) As of the date of this Voting Agreement, except for the securities set
forth on _Appendix A_ , I do not beneficially own any (i) shares of capital
stock or voting securities of Yadkin, (ii) securities of Yadkin convertible
into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock or voting securities of
Yadkin or (iii) options or other rights to acquire from Yadkin any shares of
capital stock, voting securities or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for capital stock or voting securities of Yadkin. The Yadkin
Common Stock listed on _Appendix A_ , together with all Yadkin Common Stock
that I subsequently acquire during the term of this Voting Agreement,
including through the exercise of any stock options, warrants or similar
instruments, are referred to herein as the " _Shares_ ".

 



A-1-1 (c) During the term of this Voting Agreement, at the YDKN Shareholders Meeting
and at any other meeting of Yadkin shareholders, however called, and on every
action or approval by written consent of shareholders of Yadkin, I will vote
or cause to be voted all Shares over which I have sole voting power, and I
will use my reasonable best efforts to cause any Shares over which I share
voting power to be voted in favor of (i) approval and adoption of the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, and (ii) any proposal to
adjourn or postpone such meeting to a later date if there are not sufficient
votes to approve the Merger Agreement. Determinations as to "sole" or "shared"
voting power shall be made in accordance with Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act.

 

(d) During the term of this Voting Agreement, I will not, directly or
indirectly, offer, sell, transfer, pledge, encumber or otherwise dispose of
(collectively, " _Transfer_ ") any Shares over which I have sole dispositive
power (or any interest therein), and I will use my reasonable best efforts to
not permit the Transfer of any Shares over which I have shared
dispositive power (or any interest therein), except to the extent permitted
by paragraph (g) hereof.

(e) I agree that Yadkin shall not be bound by any attempted sale of any
Yadkin Common Stock over which I have sole voting and dispositive power, and
Yadkins transfer agent shall be given appropriate stop transfer orders and
shall not be required to register any such attempted sale, unless the sale
has been effected in compliance with the terms of this Voting Agreement.

(f) I represent that I have the legal capacity to enter into this Voting
Agreement, that I have duly and validly executed and delivered this Voting
Agreement and that this Voting Agreement is a valid and binding obligation
enforceable against me in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency and other laws affecting creditors rights and general equitable
principles; and further, that no consent of my spouse is necessary under any
"community property" or other laws in order for me to enter into and perform
my obligations under this Voting Agreement.

(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, I may Transfer any or all
of the Shares over which I have beneficial ownership to my spouse, ancestors
or descendants or other transfers solely for estate planning purposes;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in any such case, prior to and as a condition to
the effectiveness of such Transfer, each person to which any of such Shares
or any interest in any of such Shares is or may be Transferred shall have
executed and delivered to FNB an agreement to be bound by the terms of this
Voting Agreement.

 

I am signing this Voting Agreement solely in my capacity as a shareholder of
Yadkin and as an option or restricted stock holder, if I am such, and not in
any other capacity, such as a director or officer of Yadkin or as a fiduciary
of any trusts in which I am not a beneficiary. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary: (a) I make no agreement or understanding herein in
any capacity other than in my capacity as a beneficial owner of Yadkin Common
Stock and (b) nothing herein shall be construed to limit or affect any action
or inaction by me or any of my representatives, as applicable, in serving on
Yadkins Board of Directors or as an officer of Yadkin, in acting in my
capacity as a director, officer or fiduciary of Yadkin.

This Voting Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
concurrently with, and automatically upon, the earliest to occur of (a) the
favorable vote of the Yadkin

 



A-1-2  shareholders with respect to the approval of the Merger Agreement, (b) the
Effective Time, (c) FNB and I enter into a written agreement to terminate this
Voting Agreement, or (d) any termination of the Merger Agreement in
accordance with its terms, except that any such termination shall be without
prejudice to FNBs rights if termination should arise out of my willful breach
of any covenant or representation contained herein.

All notices and other communications in connection with this Voting Agreement
shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally, sent
via facsimile, with confirmation, mailed by registered or certified mail,
return receipt requested, or delivered by an express courier, with

This Voting Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of the parties. This Voting Agreement constitutes
the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter
of this Voting Agreement.

 

I agree and acknowledge that FNB may be irreparably harmed by, and that there
may be no adequate remedy at law for, any violation of this Voting Agreement
by me. Without limiting other remedies, FNB shall have the right to seek to
enforce this Voting Agreement by specific performance or injunctive relief.
This Voting Agreement and all claims arising hereunder or relating hereto,
shall be governed and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of
the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of
law thereof. I hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in Wilmington, Delaware,
in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this letter.

If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Voting Agreement is
held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity to be
invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions of this Voting Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon
such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Voting Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely
as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

 



A-1-3 This Voting Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile
transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties
hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed
to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the
same instrument.

 _VOTING AGREEMENT_

 

This VOTING AGREEMENT, dated as of July 20, 2016 (this " _Agreement_ "), is
entered into by and between F.N.B. Corporation, a Florida corporation ("
_FNB_ "), and the undersigned shareholder of the Company (together with its
affiliated private investment funds holding shares of Company Common Stock,
the " _Shareholder_ "). Capitalized terms used herein and not defined shall
have the meanings specified in the Merger Agreement (defined below).

WHEREAS, concurrently herewith, Yadkin Financial Corporation, a North
Carolina corporation (the " _Company_ " or " _YDKN_ "), and FNB are entering
into that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (the " _Merger Agreement_ ")
pursuant to which, among other transactions, the Company will, on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth therein, merge with and into FNB, with
FNB being the surviving company and, in connection therewith, the shares of
voting common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Treasury
Shares, will, without any further action on the part of the holder thereof, be
automatically converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
set forth in the Merger Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions
therein;

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, the Shareholder is the record and beneficial
owner of, and has the sole right to vote and dispose of, the number of shares
of voting common stock of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") set forth
on the signature page hereto (such shares of Company Common Stock are
hereinafter referred to as the " _Shares_ ", and the Shares, together with any
other capital stock of the Company acquired by the Shareholder after the date
hereof, whether acquired directly or indirectly, upon the exercise of
options, conversion of convertible securities or otherwise, and any other
securities issued by the Company that are entitled to vote on the approval of
the Merger Agreement held or acquired by the Shareholder, whether acquired
heretofore or hereafter, are collectively referred to herein as the " _Subject
Shares_ ");

WHEREAS, receiving the Requisite YDKN Vote is a condition to the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; and

 

WHEREAS, as an inducement to FNB to enter into the Merger Agreement and incur
the obligations therein, FNB has required that the Shareholder enter into
this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the mutual covenants and
agreements set forth herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

 

1\. _Agreement to Vote; Restrictions on Voting and Dispositions_.

 

(a) _Agreement to Vote Subject Shares_. The Shareholder hereby irrevocably
agrees that from the date hereof until the Expiration Time, at any meeting
(whether annual or special and each adjourned or postponed meeting) of the
Companys shareholders,

 



A-2-1  however called, the Shareholder will, to the fullest extent that the Subject
Shares are entitled to vote thereon, (x) appear at such meeting or otherwise
cause all of the Subject Shares to be counted as present thereat for purposes
of calculating a quorum and (y) vote or cause to be voted all of the Subject
Shares to approve the Merger Agreement, provided that the Merger Agreement
shall not have been amended or otherwise modified in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the Shareholder (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, the making of any waiver, amendment or other
modification of the Merger Agreement that reduces the amount or value of,
or changes the type of, consideration payable to holders of Company Common
Stock in the Merger).

(b) _Restrictions on Transfers_. The Shareholder hereby agrees that, from the
date hereof until the earlier of the receipt of the Requisite YDKN Vote or the
Expiration Time, the Shareholder shall not, directly or indirectly, sell,
offer to sell, give, pledge, grant a security interest in, encumber, assign,
grant any option for the sale of or otherwise transfer or dispose of, or enter
into any agreement, arrangement or understanding to sell, any Subject Shares
(collectively, " _Transfer_ ") other than to its affiliates (a " _Permitted
Transferee_ "); _provided_ that as a condition to such Transfer, such
affiliate shall execute an agreement that is identical in form to this
Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that the assigning Shareholder shall
remain jointly and severally liable for the breaches of any of such affiliates
of the terms hereof. Any Transfer in violation of this provision shall be
void. The Shareholder further authorizes FNB to notify the Companys transfer
agent that there is a stop transfer order with respect to all of the Subject
Shares and that this Agreement places limits on the voting of the Subject
Shares.

 

(c) _Transfer of Voting Rights_. The Shareholder hereby agrees that the
Shareholder shall not deposit any Subject Shares in a voting trust, grant any
proxy or power of attorney or enter into any voting agreement or similar
agreement or arrangement, in each case, in contravention of the obligations of
the Shareholder under this Agreement with respect to any of the Subject
Shares. 

(d) _Acquired Shares_. Any shares of Company Common Stock or other voting
securities of the Company with respect to which beneficial ownership is
acquired by the Shareholder or its affiliates, including, without limitation,
by purchase, as a result of a stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization,
combination, reclassification, exchange or change of such shares of Company
Common Stock or upon exercise or conversion of any securities of the Company,
if any, after the date hereof shall automatically become subject to the terms
of this Agreement as Subject Shares.

 

(e) _Inconsistent Agreements_. The Shareholder hereby agrees that it shall not
enter into any agreement, contract or understanding with any person prior to
the termination of this Agreement, directly or indirectly, to vote, grant a
proxy or power of attorney or give instructions with respect to the voting of
the Subject Shares in any manner which is inconsistent with this Agreement.

2\. _Non-Solicit_. In its capacity as a shareholder of the Company, the
Shareholder shall not, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
affiliates (excluding portfolio company investments) and each of their
respective officers, directors, employees and representatives acting on its
behalf not to, directly or indirectly, solicit proxies or become a

 



A-2-2  "participant" in a "solicitation" (as such terms are defined in the
Securities Exchange Act) or otherwise knowingly encourage or assist any party
in taking or planning any action that would reasonably be expected to compete
with, restrain or otherwise serve to interfere with or inhibit the timely
consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms of the Merger
Agreement.

 

3\. _Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Shareholder_. __

 

(a) _Representations and Warranties_. The Shareholder represents and warrants
to FNB as follows:

 

(i) _Capacity_. The Shareholder is duly organized and validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation and has all
requisite capacity, power and authority to enter into and perform his, her or
its obligations under this Agreement. No filing with, and no permit,
authorization, consent or approval of, a Governmental Entity is necessary on
the part of the Shareholder for the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by the Shareholder or the consummation by the Shareholder of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(ii) _Due Authorization_. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered
by the Shareholder and the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by the Shareholder and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the
part of the Shareholder.

 

(iii) _Binding Agreement_. Assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement by FNB, this Agreement constitutes the valid and
binding agreement of the Shareholder, enforceable against the Shareholder in
accordance with its terms (except in all cases as such enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership,
conservatorship, moratorium, or similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors rights generally and except that the availability of the equitable
remedy of specific performance or injunctive relief is subject to
the discretion of the court before which any proceeding may be brought).

(iv) _Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Shareholder does not, and the performance by the Shareholder of his, her or
its obligations hereunder and the consummation by the Shareholder of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not violate or conflict with, or
constitute a default under, any agreement, instrument, contract or other
obligation or any order, arbitration award, judgment or decree to which the
Shareholder is a party or by which the Shareholder is bound, or any statute,
rule or regulation to which the Shareholder is subject or, in the event that
the Shareholder is a corporation, partnership, trust or other entity, any
charter, bylaw or other organizational document of the Shareholder, except for
any of the foregoing as would not reasonably be expected, either individually
or in the aggregate, to impair the ability of the Shareholder to perform its
obligations hereunder. Except as contemplated by this Agreement, the
Shareholder (a) has not entered into any voting agreement or voting trust
with respect to any Shares or entered into any other contract relating to the
voting of the Shares or (b) has not appointed or granted a proxy or power of
attorney with respect to any Shares.

 



A-2-3 (v) _Ownership of Shares_. Except for restrictions in favor of FNB
pursuant to this Agreement, and except for such transfer restrictions of
general applicability as may be provided under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and the "blue sky" laws of the various States of the United States,
the Shareholder owns, beneficially and of record, all of the Shares, as
applicable, free and clear of any proxy, voting restriction, security
interest, or other lien and has sole voting power and sole power of
disposition with respect to the Shares with no restrictions on the
Shareholders rights of voting or disposition pertaining thereto and no person
other than the Shareholder has any right to direct or approve the voting or
disposition of any of the Shares. As of the date hereof, the number of Shares
equals that number of shares of Company Common Stock set forth on the
signature page hereto. The Shareholder has possession of an outstanding
certificate or outstanding certificates representing all of the Shares (other
than Shares held at the Depository Trust Company and/or in book-entry form)
and such certificate or certificates does or do not contain any legend or
restriction inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, the Merger
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

(vi) _Legal Actions_. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no action,
suit, investigation, complaint or other proceeding pending against the
Shareholder or, to the knowledge of the Shareholder, threatened against the
Shareholder that restricts or prohibits (or, if successful, would restrict or
prohibit) the exercise by the Shareholder of its obligations under this
Agreement.

(vii) _Reliance_. The Shareholder understands and acknowledges that FNB
is entering into the Merger Agreement in reliance upon the Shareholders
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the representations and
warranties of the Shareholder contained herein.

 

(b) _Representations and Warranties_. FNB represents and warrants to the
Shareholder as follows:

 

(i) _Capacity_. FNB is duly organized and validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has all
requisite corporate power and authority to enter into and perform its
obligations under this Agreement. No filing with, and no permit,
authorization, consent or approval of, a Governmental Entity is necessary
on the part of FNB for the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by FNB or the consummation by FNB of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

(ii) _Due Authorization_. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered
by FNB and the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by FNB
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
authorized by all necessary action on the part of FNB.

 

(iii) _Binding Agreement_. Assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Shareholder, this Agreement constitutes the
valid and binding agreement of FNB, enforceable against FNB in accordance with
its terms

 



A-2-4  (except in all cases as such enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, conservatorship,
moratorium, or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights
generally and except that the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance or injunctive relief is subject to the discretion of the court
before which any proceeding may be brought).

 

(iv) _Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by FNB
does not, and the performance by FNB of its obligations hereunder and the
consummation by FNB of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, violate
or conflict with, or constitute a default under, any agreement, instrument,
contract or other obligation or any order, arbitration award, judgment or
decree to which FNB is a party or by which FNB is bound, or any statute, rule
or regulation to which FNB is subject or, in the event that FNB is a
corporation, partnership, trust or other entity, any charter, bylaw or
other organizational document of FNB, except for any of the foregoing as
would not reasonably be expected, either individually or in the aggregate, to
impair the ability of FNB to perform its obligations hereunder.

 

(c) _Covenants_. From the date hereof until the Expiration Time:

 

(i) the Shareholder agrees not to take any action that would make any
representation or warranty of the Shareholder contained herein untrue or
incorrect or have the effect of preventing, impeding or in any material
respect, interfering with or adversely affecting the performance by the
Shareholder of its obligations under this Agreement;

 

(ii) the Shareholder hereby agrees, while this Agreement is in effect, to
promptly notify FNB of the number of any new shares of Company Common Stock
acquired by the Shareholder, if any, after the date hereof; and

(iii) the Shareholder hereby authorizes FNB and the Company to publish and
disclose in any announcement or disclosure required by applicable Law and any
proxy statement filed in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement solely the Shareholders identity and ownership of the
Subject Shares and the nature of the Shareholders obligation under this
Agreement, subject to the prior written approval of such disclosure, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.



     | 4. |

_Termination_. Other than this Section 4 and Section 5, which shall survive
any termination of this Agreement, this Agreement will terminate (the "
_Expiration Time_ ") upon the earliest of (a) the favorable vote of the YDKN
shareholders with respect to the approval of the Merger Agreement, (b) the
Effective Time, (c) the date of termination of the Merger Agreement in
accordance with its terms, (d) the making of any waiver, amendment or other
modification of the Merger Agreement that reduces the amount or value of
consideration payable to holders of Company Common Stock in the Merger, or
changes the type of consideration payable to holders of Company Common Stock
in the Merger in a manner reasonably expected to be adverse to holders of
Company Common Stock (for the avoidance of doubt, any such change that reduces
the amount or value of the consideration payable to holders of Company 

---|---|--- 
 



A-2-5 holders of Company Common Stock"), and (e) the date on which the Merger
Agreement shall have been amended or otherwise modified in a manner that
would otherwise be reasonably expected to be materially adverse to the
Shareholder; _provided_ that no such termination shall relieve any party
hereto from any liability for any willful and material breach of
this Agreement occurring prior to such termination. 
---|--- 



     | 5. | _Miscellaneous_. 
---|---|--- 

(a) _Expenses_. All expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses.

(b) _Notices_. Any notice required to be given hereunder shall be sufficient
if in writing, and sent by email or facsimile transmission (provided that any
notice received by facsimile transmission or otherwise at the addressees
location on any business day after 5:00 p.m. (addressees local time) shall

A-2-6 (d) _Successors and Assigns_. No party may assign any of its or his rights or
delegate any of its or his obligations under this Agreement without the prior
written consent of the other party. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns,
including without limitation any corporate successor by merger or otherwise.

(e) _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing expressed or referred to in this
Agreement will be construed to give any person, other than the parties to this
Agreement and their respective successors and permitted assigns, any legal or
equitable right, remedy or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or
any provision of this Agreement.

(f) _No Partnership, Agency, or Joint Venture_. This Agreement is intended to
create, and creates, a contractual relationship and is not intended to create,
and does not create, any agency, partnership, joint venture or any like
relationship between the parties hereto.

 

(g) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement embodies the entire agreement and
understanding among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings relating to such subject
matter.

(h) _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or law, or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal

manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the

effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

(i) _Specific Performance; Remedies Cumulative_. The parties hereto

remedies which the parties may have hereunder or at law or in equity, may, in
his or its sole discretion, apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for
specific performance or injunction or such other relief as such court may deem
just and proper in order to enforce this Agreement or prevent any violation
hereof and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, each party waives
any objection to the imposition of such relief. All rights, powers and
remedies provided under this Agreement or otherwise available in respect
hereof at law or in equity shall be cumulative and not alternative, and the
exercise or beginning of the exercise of any thereof by any party shall not
preclude the simultaneous or later exercise of any other such rights, powers
or remedies by such party.

 

(j) _No Waiver_. The failure of any party hereto to exercise any right, power
or remedy provided under this Agreement or otherwise available in respect
hereof at law or in equity, or to insist upon compliance by any other party
hereto with his or its obligations hereunder, and any custom or practice of
the parties at variance with the terms hereof, shall not constitute a
waiver by such party of his or its right to exercise any such or other right,
power or remedy or to demand such compliance.

 



A-2-7 (k) _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all disputes or controversies arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of
the State of Delaware, without regard to any applicable conflicts of law
principles.

 

(l) _Submission to Jurisdiction_. The parties hereto agree that any suit,
action or proceeding brought by either party to enforce any provision of, or
based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in any federal or state
court located in Wilmington, Delaware. Each of the parties hereto submits to
the jurisdiction of any such court in any suit, action or proceeding seeking
to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of, or in
connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and
hereby irrevocably waives the benefit of jurisdiction derived from present or
future domicile or otherwise in such action or proceeding. Each party hereto
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit,
action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or
proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum.

 

(m) _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ARISING OUT OF,
OR RELATING TO, THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND
(D) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

(n) _Drafting and Representation_. The parties have participated jointly in
the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. No provision of this Agreement
will be interpreted for or against any party because that party or his or its
legal representative drafted the provision.

(o) _Name, Captions, Gender_. Section headings of this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and are to be given no effect in the construction or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the context may require, any
pronoun used herein shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine or
neuter forms.

 

(p) _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile or other
electronic means and in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed to be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one
instrument. Each counterpart may consist of a number of copies each signed by
less than all, but together signed by all, the parties hereto.

 



A-2-8 (q) _No Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claims
or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement may
only be made against the entities that are expressly identified as parties
hereto (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Permitted Transferees) and
no former, current or future equity holders, controlling persons, directors,
officers, employees, agents or affiliates of any party hereto or any former,
current or future stockholder, controlling person, director, officer,
employee, general or limited partner, member, manager, agent or affiliate
(other than the Shareholder) of any of the foregoing, including the Company
(each, unless a Permitted Transferee, a " _Non-Recourse Party_ ") shall have
any liability for any obligations or liabilities of the parties to this
Agreement or for any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based on,
in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or in
respect of any representations made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith. Without limiting the rights of any party against the other parties
hereto, in no event shall any party or any of its affiliates seek to enforce
this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement against,
or seek to recover monetary damages from, any Non-Recourse Party. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 5(q) shall be deemed to limit,
restrict or otherwise affect in any way any rights or remedies available
under the Merger Agreement.
