such deemed surrender shall be satisfied by Angle withholding cash in an
amount equal to any Taxes, if any required to be remitted in connection with

    | 2.6| Officers and Employees

at such times as may reasonable requested by Bellatrix. 
---|---|--- 
   | (b)| Any employee of Angle who voluntarily resigns or is terminated
for just cause prior to the Effective Time (provided that Angle shall not

---|---|--- 
   | (c)| The Parties acknowledge and agree that a portion of the Angle
Employee Obligations represents bonuses to be declared and paid to employees
of Angle (excluding any employee who is a party to an Angle Employment
Agreement) in an amount not to exceed the amount agreed to by Bellatrix and

further acknowledge and agree that the amount of such Angle Employee Bonuses
to be paid to each Angle employee may be determined by the board of directors

not be offered continuing employment with Angle or Bellatrix, and that the
employment of such executive officer will cease as of the Effective Time. 
---|---|--- 
   | (e)| The Parties acknowledge that completion of the Arrangement will
constitute a "Change of Control" for purposes of the existing Angle
Employment Agreements. Angle has disclosed in writing Angle\'s bona fide good
faith estimate, having regard to the assumptions set forth therein, of the

Employee Obligations (other than the Angle Employee Bonuses) will be paid out
at the Effective Time subject to such employees receiving such payments
executing resignations and mutual releases in accordance with Subsections
3.2(p) and 3.2(q). As at the Effective Time, no officers, employees or
consultants of Angle shall be entitled to change of control, termination or
severance payments (or both), except such payments the particulars of which
are disclosed in writing to Bellatrix by Angle on or prior to the
Agreement Date. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the aggregate amount

member of the current board of directors of Angle ("Angle Nominee") be
appointed as a director of Bellatrix. To the extent that Angle makes such
request prior to the Effective Time and provided such Angle Nominee is
acceptable to the board of directors of Bellatrix having regard to such
considerations as the board of directors of Bellatrix considers appropriate

factors as the current composition of the board of directors of Bellatrix and
the expertise and experience of such Angle Nominee as well as the
current members of the board of directors of Bellatrix, the board of
directors of Bellatrix shall authorize and approve the appointment of such
Angle Nominee, such appointment to be effective immediately following the
Effective Time.

Agreements and Undertakings 
---|---|--- 
   | (a)| Bellatrix agrees that, after the Effective Time, Angle and any
successor to Angle will not take any action to terminate or adversely affect,
and will fulfill its obligations pursuant to, indemnities provided or
available to or in favour of past and present officers and directors of Angle
pursuant to the provisions of the articles, by-laws or other
constating documents of Angle, applicable corporate legislation and any
written indemnity agreements (and each of them), which have been entered into
between Angle and its past or current officers or directors effective on or
prior to the Agreement Date and Angle has provided Bellatrix the most recent
form of indemnity agreement used for its directors and officers on or prior to
the Agreement Date. 
---|---|--- 
   | (b)| Bellatrix will maintain or cause to be maintained in effect for
six years from the Effective Time, customary policies of directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance providing coverage comparable to the coverage
provided by the directors\' and officers\' policies obtained by Angle that
are in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and providing
coverage in respect of claims arising from facts or events that occurred on
or prior to the Effective Time and which will cover all claims made prior to
the Effective Date or within six years of the Effective Date. Prior to the
Effective Time, Angle may, in the alternative, with the consent of Bellatrix,
purchase run off directors\' and officers\' liability insurance for the
benefit of its officers and directors having a coverage period of up to six
years from the Effective Time, and in such event Bellatrix will not have any
further obligation under this Subsection 2.8(b). 
---|---|--- 
   | 2.9| Applicable U.S. Securities Laws 
---|---|--- 
  

The Arrangement shall be structured and executed such that, assuming the
Court considers the fairness of the terms and conditions of the
Arrangement and grants the Final Order, the issuance of the Bellatrix Shares
issuable to Angle Shareholders under the Arrangement will not require
registration under the U.S. Securities Act, in reliance upon Section 3(a)(10)
thereof. Each Party agrees to act in good faith, consistent with the intent
of the Parties and the intended treatment of the Arrangement as set out in
this Section 2.9.

   | 2.10| Income Tax Election 
---|---|--- 
   | (a)| The exchange of Angle Shares solely for Bellatrix Shares will be
structured as a tax deferred share-for-share exchange pursuant to Subsection
85.1(1) of the Tax Act. In addition, as an alternative, a Angle Shareholder
shall be entitled, in the manner and in accordance with any deadlines
contemplated by the Plan of Arrangement, to make an income tax election,
pursuant to Subsection 85(1) or 85(2) of the Tax Act, as applicable (and the
analogous provisions of provincial income tax law), with respect to the
exchange of Angle Shares for Bellatrix Shares or a combination of Bellatrix
Shares and cash under the Arrangement. The Arrangement will be structured to
allow those Angle Shareholders who receive a combination of Bellatrix Shares
and cash in consideration for their Angle Shares to have such exchange be
treated as a single transaction whereby all of their Angle Shares are
exchanged as a single transaction for the Bellatrix Shares and cash so
received. 
---|---|---

--- 

    | (b)| Angle, Bellatrix and the Depositary shall be entitled to deduct
or withhold from any dividend or consideration payable to any Angle
Securityholder, such amounts as Angle, Bellatrix or the Depositary is required
to deduct or withhold with respect to such payment under the Tax Act or any
provision of federal, provincial, territorial, state, local or foreign tax
law, in each case, as amended. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or
withheld, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated, for all
purposes hereof, as having been paid to the Angle Securityholders in respect
of whom such deduction or withholding was made, provided that such deducted
or withheld amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate Governmental
Authority. To the extent that the amount so required to be deducted or
withheld from any payment to a holder exceeds the cash portion of the
consideration and dividends otherwise payable to the holder, any of Angle,
Bellatrix or the Depositary is hereby authorized to sell or otherwise dispose
of such other portion of share portion of the consideration as is necessary to
provide sufficient funds to Angle, Bellatrix or the Depositary, as the case
may be, to enable it to comply with all deduction or withholding requirements
applicable to it, and Angle, Bellatrix and the Depositary shall notify the
holder thereof and remit to the holder thereof any unapplied balance of the
net proceeds of such sale.

Agreement as contemplated by Subsection 3.4(d) and after receiving the advice
of its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, as reflected in minutes of
the board of directors of Angle, that the taking of such action is necessary
for the board of directors in the discharge of its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Laws, (B) Angle complies with its obligations set out in
Subsection 3.4(d), and (C) Angle terminates this Agreement in accordance with
Subsection 8.1(g) and concurrently therewith pays the amount required by
Section 6.1. 
---|---|--- 
   | (c)| Angle shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours of receipt
by Angle) notify Bellatrix (at first orally and then in writing) of any
Acquisition Proposal (or any amendment thereto) or any request for non-public
information relating to Angle, its assets, or any amendments to the foregoing
received by Angle. Such notice shall include a copy of any
written Acquisition Proposal (and any amendment thereto) received by Angle
or, if no written Acquisition Proposal has been received, a description of
the material terms and conditions of, and the identity of the Person making
any inquiry, proposal, offer or request (to the extent then known by Angle).
Angle shall also provide such further and other details of the Acquisition
Proposal or any amendment thereto as Bellatrix may reasonably request (to the
extent then known by Angle). Angle shall keep Bellatrix fully informed of the
status, including any change to material terms, of any Acquisition Proposal or
any amendment thereto, shall respond promptly to all reasonable inquiries by
Bellatrix with respect thereto, and shall provide to Bellatrix copies of all
material correspondence and other written material sent to or provided to

    | (d)| Following receipt of a Superior Proposal, Angle shall give
Bellatrix, orally and in writing, at least 72 hours advance notice of any
decision by its board of directors to accept, recommend, approve or enter into
an agreement to implement a Superior Proposal, which notice shall (i) confirm
that the board of directors of Angle has determined that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; (ii) identify the third party making
the Superior Proposal; (iii) confirm that the entering into of a definitive
agreement to implement such Superior Proposal is not subject to any due
diligence or access condition; and (iv) confirm that a definitive agreement
to implement such Superior Proposal has been settled between Angle and such
third party in all material respects, and Angle will concurrently provide a
true and complete copy thereof and, will thereafter promptly provide any
amendments thereto, to Bellatrix. During the 72 hour period commencing on the
delivery of such notice, Angle agrees not to accept, recommend, approve or
enter into any agreement to implement such Superior Proposal` and not to
release the party making the Superior Proposal from any standstill provisions
and shall not withdraw, redefine, modify or change its recommendation in
respect of the Arrangement. In addition, during such 72 hour period, Angle
shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, negotiate in good
faith with Bellatrix and its financial and legal advisors to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Arrangement
as would enable Angle to proceed with the Arrangement, as amended, rather than
the Superior Proposal. In the event Bellatrix confirms in writing its
commitment to amend this Agreement to provide a transaction
financially superior for the Angle Shareholders than the Superior Proposal
and so advises the board of directors of Angle prior to the expiry of such 72
hour period, the board of directors of Angle shall not accept, recommend,
approve or enter into any agreement to implement such Superior Proposal and
shall not release the party making the Superior Proposal from any standstill
provisions and shall not withdraw, redefine, modify or change its
recommendation in respect of the Arrangement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
and for greater certainty, Bellatrix shall have no obligation to make or
negotiate any changes to this Agreement in the event that Angle is in receipt
of a Superior Proposal. Angle acknowledges that each successive material
modification of any Superior Proposal shall constitute a new Superior
Proposal for purposes of the requirement under this Subsection 3.4(d) to
initiate a new 72 hour notice period. 
---|---|--- 
   | (e)| The board of directors of Angle shall reaffirm its recommendation
of the Arrangement by news release promptly, and in any event within 72 hours
of being requested to do so by Bellatrix (or in the event that the Angle
Meeting to approve the Arrangement is scheduled to occur within such 72 hour
period, prior to the scheduled date of such meeting), in the event that (i)
any Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced unless the board of directors
of Angle has determined that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal in accordance with this Section 3.4; or (ii) the Parties have entered
into an amended agreement pursuant to Subsection 3.4(d) that results in any
Acquisition Proposal not being a Superior Proposal. 
---|---|--- 
   | (f)| Bellatrix agrees that all information that may be provided to it
by Angle with respect to any Superior Proposal pursuant to this Section 3.4
shall be treated as if it were "Evaluation Material" as that term is defined
in the Angle Confidentiality Agreement and such information shall not be
disclosed or used except in accordance with the Angle
Confidentiality Agreement or in order to enforce its rights under this
Agreement in legal proceedings. 
---|---|--- 
   | (g)| Each Party shall ensure that its Representatives are aware of the
provisions of this Section 3.4. Angle shall be responsible for any breach of
this Section 3.4 by its Representatives. 
---|---|--- 
   | 3.5| Access to Information 
---|---|--- 
   | (a)| From and after the Agreement Date until the earlier of the
Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement, Angle shall, subject to
compliance with Applicable Laws and the Angle Confidentiality Agreement and
upon reasonable notice, provide Bellatrix and its Representatives access,
during normal business hours and at such other time or times as Bellatrix may
reasonably request, to its premises (including field offices and sites),
books, Contracts, Returns, records, computer systems, properties, employees
and management personnel and shall furnish promptly to Bellatrix all
information concerning its business, properties, operations and personnel as
Bellatrix may reasonably request in order to permit Bellatrix to be in a
position to expeditiously and efficiently integrate the business and
operations of Angle with those of Bellatrix immediately upon but not prior to
the Effective Date. From and after the Agreement Date until the earlier of
the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement, Angle agrees to
keep Bellatrix appraised in a timely manner of every circumstance, action,
occurrence or event occurring or arising after the Agreement Date that would
reasonably be considered relevant and material to a prudent operator of the
business and operations of Angle. From and after the Agreement Date until the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, Angle shall confer
with Bellatrix prior to taking action with respect to any material
operational matters involving its business and Angle shall update Bellatrix
as to all material matters following any weekly operations meetings held by
Angle and, if requested by Bellatrix, shall allow Bellatrix personnel to
attend such weekly operations meetings.

    | (b)| The Parties acknowledge and agree that all information provided
by Angle to Bellatrix (or any of its Representatives) pursuant to this
Section 3.5 shall be considered to be "Evaluation Material" for purposes of
the Angle Confidentiality Agreement and shall be subject to the Angle
Confidentiality Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
   | 3.6| Pre-Acquisition Reorganization 
---|---|--- 
  

Angle shall reasonably cooperate with Bellatrix and its tax advisors in
structuring the Arrangement and other transactions contemplated to occur in
conjunction with the Arrangement and any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization (as
defined below) in a tax effective manner and assist Bellatrix and its tax
advisors in making such investigations and enquiries with respect to Angle in
that regard, as Bellatrix and its tax advisors shall consider necessary
provided that Angle shall not be obligated to consent or agree to any
structuring contemplated by this Section 3.6 that (i) would have the effect
of reducing the consideration to be received under the Arrangement by any of
the Angle Securityholders; (ii) impose any incremental tax obligations on the
Angle Securityholders in connection with the Arrangement or a Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization; or (iii) may have an adverse effect on Angle or its business
or assets if the Arrangement is not consummated for any reason, and unless it
has received an appropriate indemnity indemnifying it for all liabilities,
damages, claims, judgements, costs, expenses, and losses which it may suffer
or incur as a result of such Pre-Acquisition Reorganization. "Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization" means any reorganization of the corporate structure, capital
structure, business, operations and assets of Angle prior to the acquisition
by Bellatrix of all of the issued and outstanding Angle Shares.
Without limiting the generality of, and subject to the foregoing, Angle
agrees to co-operate with Bellatrix in order to facilitate any such
reorganization, amalgamations, transactions or Pre-Acquisition Reorganization
which Bellatrix determines would be advisable to enhance the tax efficiency
of the combined corporate group and any anticipated dispositions and to
provide such information on a timely basis and to assist in the obtaining of
any such information in order to facilitate a successful completion of
any such reorganization, amalgamations, transactions or Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization as is reasonably requested by Bellatrix. Any Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization costs shall not be included in Angle Transaction Costs.

any officer, director or employee of, or consultant to Bellatrix, (ii) any
holder of record or beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting securities
of Bellatrix or (iii) any associate or affiliate of any such Person

title of Bellatrix to its assets, whether or not an action, suit,

time such information was provided. Except with respect to changes in
commodity prices, Bellatrix has no knowledge of a material adverse change in
any production, cost, price, reserves or other relevant information provided
to Sproule since the date that such information was provided. Bellatrix
believes that Bellatrix Reserves Report reasonably presents the quantity and
pre-tax present worth values of the crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural

being (upon expiration of the applicable cure period) hereinafter referred to
as a "Angle Damages Event") provided no Bellatrix Damages Event has occurred,
Bellatrix shall pay to Angle $17 million (the "Angle Termination Fee") as
liquidated damages, in immediately available funds, to an account designated
by Angle, within two Business Days after the occurrence of the first Angle
Damages Event, and after the occurrence of such Angle Damages Event, but prior

   | 6.3| Liquidated Damages and Specific Performance 
---|---|--- 
  

Each of Bellatrix and Angle acknowledges that the payment of any amount set
out in Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 is a payment of liquidated damages and
represents a genuine pre-estimate of the damages that Bellatrix or Angle (as
applicable) will suffer or incur as a result of the event giving rise to such
damages and the resultant termination of this Agreement and is not a penalty.
Each of Bellatrix and Angle irrevocably waives any right it may have to raise
as a defence that any such liquidated damages payable by it are excessive or
punitive. For greater certainty, Bellatrix and Angle agree that receipt of an
amount pursuant to Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 is the sole monetary remedy of
Bellatrix or Angle (as applicable) hereunder, provided, however, that this
limitation shall not apply in the event of fraud or wilful or intentional
breach of this Agreement by the Party that has made, or is required to make,
a payment pursuant to this Article 6\. Nothing in this Article 6 shall
preclude Bellatrix or Angle from seeking and obtaining injunctive relief to
restrain any breach or threatened breach of the covenants of the other Party
set out in this Agreement, the Angle Confidentiality Agreement and the
Bellatrix Confidentiality Agreement or specific performance of any of
such covenants of the other Party, without the necessity of posting bond or
security in connection therewith.

   | (a)| change the time for performance of any of the obligations or acts
of Bellatrix or Angle hereunder; 
---|---|--- 
   | (b)| waive any inaccuracies in, or modify, any representation or
warranty contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; 
---|---|--- 
   | (c)| waive compliance with, or modify, any of the covenants contained
herein and waive or modify performance of any of the obligations of Bellatrix
or Angle hereunder; or

   | (d)| waive satisfaction of, or modify, any of the conditions precedent
set out herein; 
---|---|--- 
  

provided that no such amendment reduces or adversely affects the
consideration to be received by the Angle Shareholders without approval by the
Angle Shareholders given in the same manner as required for the approval of
the Arrangement.

  

Article 8 
 TERMINATION

   | 8.1| Termination 
---|---|---

   | (a)| by mutual written consent of Bellatrix and Angle; 
---|---|--- 
   | (b)| by either Bellatrix or Angle if: (i) the Angle Shareholders fail
to approve the applicable Arrangement Resolution by the requisite vote at the

any Party whose failure to fulfill any of its obligations has been the cause
of, or resulted in, the failure of the Effective Time to occur by such date; 
---|---|--- 
   | (d)| by either Party as provided in Subsection 5.4(b), provided that
the failure to satisfy the particular condition precedent being relied upon
as a basis for termination of this Agreement did not occur as a result of a
breach by the Party seeking to rely on the condition precedent of any of its
covenants or obligations under the Agreement; 
---|---|--- 
   | (e)| by Bellatrix upon the occurrence of a Bellatrix Damages Event, as
provided in Section 6.1; 
---|---|--- 
   | (f)| by Angle upon the occurrence of a Angle Damages Event, as
provided in Section 6.2; or 
---|---|--- 
   | (g)| by Angle upon the occurrence of a Bellatrix Damages Event, as set
out in Section 6.1(c), and the payment by Angle to Bellatrix of the amount
specified in Section 6.1, provided that Angle has complied with its
obligations set out in Section 3.4. 
---|---|--- 
  

In the event of the termination of this Agreement in the circumstances set
out in this Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and be of
no further force or effect and no Party shall have any liability or further
obligation to the other hereunder except with respect to the obligations set
out in any of Section 4.3, Article 6, (provided in the case of Sections 6.1
and 6.2, the right of payment (in the case of Section 6.1(b), being the
public announcement or making of such Acquisition Proposal) arose prior
to the termination of this Agreement); Article 9 and Article 10, all of which
shall survive such termination. For greater certainty, the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to this Article 8 shall not affect the rights or
obligations of any Party under the Angle Confidentiality Agreement or the
Bellatrix Confidentiality Agreement and such confidentiality agreements shall
remain in full force and effect, subject to any further agreement of the
Parties.

  

Unless otherwise provided herein, the exercise by either Party of any right
of termination hereunder shall be without prejudice to any other remedy
available to such Party at law or in equity.

Subsection 3.1(e) to receive the Share Consideration) for the Share

deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated, for all purposes hereof, as
having been paid to the Angle Securityholders in respect of whom such
deduction or withholding was made, provided that such deducted or withheld
amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. To the
extent that the amount so required to be deducted or withheld from any
payment to a holder exceeds the cash portion of the consideration otherwise
payable to the holder, any of Angle, Bellatrix or the Depositary is hereby
authorized to sell or otherwise dispose of such other portion of the
consideration as is necessary to provide sufficient funds to Angle, Bellatrix
or the Depositary, as the case may be, to enable it to comply with all
deduction or withholding requirements applicable to it, and Angle, Bellatrix
and the Depositary shall notify the holder thereof and remit to the

the holder\'s Angle Debentures to Bellatrix at the Effective Time,
notwithstanding the provisions of Section 191 of the ABCA. A Dissenting
Debentureholder who is, for any reason, not entitled to be paid the fair
value of the holder\'s Angle Debentures shall be deemed to have participated
in the Arrangement on the same basis as a non-dissenting holder of
Angle Debentures, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 191 of the ABCA
and, such Dissenting Debentureholder shall be deemed to receive the
consideration for such holder\'s Angle Debentures on the basis set forth in
Subsection 3.1(e) and subject to Section 3.5. The fair value of the Angle
Debentures held by a Dissenting Debentureholder shall be determined as of the
close of business on the last Business Day before the day on which the
Arrangement Resolution is approved by holders of Angle Debentures at the
Angle Meeting. In no event shall Angle or Bellatrix be required to recognize
any Dissenting Debentureholder as a securityholder of Angle after the
Effective Time and the names of such holders shall be removed from the
register of holders of Angle Debentures as at the Effective Time. For
greater certainty, in addition to any other restrictions in Section 191 of
the ABCA, no person who has voted in favour of the Arrangement shall be
entitled to dissent with respect to the Arrangement.
