have the effects set forth in this Agreement and specified in __ the DGCL.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company
shall be amended and restated to read as set forth on _Exhibit B_ hereto and
shall thereafter be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions thereof
and hereof and applicable Law. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the
provisions thereof and hereof and applicable Law.

contemplated by this Agreement (such transactions, including the Merger, the
Subsequent Merger and the Share Issuance, the " _Transactions_ ") will take
place at 10:00 a.m., Chicago time, on a date to be specified by the parties,

Parent and the Company may agree), the Company and Merger Sub shall file with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") executed in accordance with, and containing such

treated for federal income tax purposes as a "reorganization" under Section

merging directly with and into Parent, with the Company Shares converted in
such merger into the right to receive the consideration provided for
hereunder.

(c) Each of the parties hereto shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
treat the Merger and the Subsequent Merger for all tax purposes consistent

and after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation,

Surviving Corporation immediately prior to the effective time of the
Subsequent Merger shall be the officers of the Surviving Company from and
after the effective time of the Subsequent Merger, in the case of _clause

been duly elected or appointed and qualified, or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving CompanyÂ’s certificate
of formation and operating agreement and applicable Law.

Section 1.7 _Directors of Parent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
take all actions as may be necessary such that, as of the Effective Time, the
Parent Board of Directors (the " _Parent Board_ ") shall include Deborah

who, as of the date hereof, is a member of the Company Board and is mutually

ARTICLE II

 

MERGER CONSIDERATION; CONVERSION OF STOCK

 

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock (each a " _Company Share_ " and collectively, the "
_Company Shares_ ") or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

 

(a) Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub shall be
converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) Each Company Share that is owned by any Parent Company or any Acquired
Company shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and no shares of Parent common stock,
par value $0.01 per share (" _Parent_ _Common Stock_ "), or other
consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the holders of any securities of the
Company or Merger Sub:

(i) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_,  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)(ii)_,
_Section_ __ _ 2.1(d)_ and _Section_ _ 2.2_, each issued and outstanding
share of Company Common Stock (in each case, other than Company Shares to be
cancelled in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_ and any Appraisal Shares
(to the extent provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.1(d)_)), which immediately prior
to the Effective Time will be the only class of common stock of the Company
then outstanding, shall thereupon be canceled and extinguished and
automatically converted into and shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive the following consideration, without interest thereon, upon the
surrender of the certificate representing any such Company Shares or Company
Book-Entry Shares (either case being referred to in this Agreement, to the
extent applicable, as a " _Certificate_ "): (x) $24.63 in cash (the " _Per_  
_Share Cash Amount_ ") and (y) 0.1505 of a share of validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable Parent Common Stock (subject to adjustment in accordance
with  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)(ii)_, the " _Exchange Ratio_ ").

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, from the
date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of
Parent Common Stock or the outstanding Company Shares or the securities
convertible into or exercisable for shares of Parent Common Stock or Company
Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of
shares, readjustment or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or
stock distribution thereon shall be declared with a record date within said
period, the Merger Consideration and the Exchange Ratio and any other
similarly dependent items, as the case may be (including the treatment of
Company Stock Awards in _Section_ __ _ 2.3_), shall be appropriately adjusted
to provide the holders of Company Shares and Company Stock Awards the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

 



4

    

(iii) The shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued, and cash payable,
upon the conversion of Company Shares pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
2.1(c)_ and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_ are referred to collectively as "
_Merger Consideration_ ".

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Company Shares
that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are
held by any Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of
such Company Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with,
Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Appraisal Shares_ ") shall not be converted into
Merger Consideration as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)_, but rather the
holders of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment by the
Surviving Corporation of the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any
such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose
the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such
holder to be paid the fair value of such holderÂ’s Appraisal Shares shall cease
and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the
Effective Time into, and shall have become exchangeable solely for the right
to receive, the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)_.
The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of any Company Shares, and Parent shall have the right
to participate in and direct all negotiations and Actions with respect to such
demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with a nationally
recognized financial institution designated by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the
holders of Company Shares, for exchange in accordance with this _Article II_ ,
through the Exchange Agent, certificates representing the full number of
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_ in
exchange for outstanding Company Shares. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall provide or shall cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent all of the
cash necessary to pay the cash portion of the Merger Consideration, and shall,
after the Effective Time on the appropriate payment date, if applicable,
provide or cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent any dividends or other
distributions payable on such shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_ (such shares of Parent Common Stock and cash provided
to the Exchange Agent, together with any dividends or other
distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). For the purposes of such deposit, Parent shall assume that
there will not be any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock. Parent shall
make available to the Exchange Agent, for addition to the Exchange Fund, from
time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional
shares in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_. The Exchange Agent shall
deliver the Parent Common Stock and cash contemplated to be issued pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_ out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not
be used for any other purpose.

(b) Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, to each holder of record of a
Certificate whose Company Shares were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ _2.1(c)_ , (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed
by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount
of cash and the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be
in non-certificated book-entry form) which the aggregate number of Company
Shares previously represented by such Certificate shall have been converted
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)_ into the right to receive and cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as set forth in  _Section_ __ _
2.2(e)_, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made and
shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Subject to _Section_
__ _ 2.1(c)(iii)_ and the last sentence of _Section_ _2.2(c)_ , until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_, each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration into which the
Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate have been
converted pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)_. No interest shall be paid or
accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

(c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
Certificate formerly representing Company Shares or Company Book-Entry Shares
with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon surrender
thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any
such holder pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_, in each case until the
surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this _Article II_. Subject
to applicable Law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be
paid to the holder of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange
therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender or delivery, as
the case may be, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share
of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 2.2(e)_ and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to such surrender or delivery, as the case may be,
and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such
whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

(d) The Merger Consideration issued (and paid) in accordance with the terms of
this  _Article II_ upon conversion of any Company Shares shall be deemed to
have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such Company Shares (other than the right to receive dividends or other
distributions, if any, in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_). After the
Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of Company Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificates formerly representing Company Shares are presented to
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

(e) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Company Shares pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.1_, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle
the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of Parent Common Stock.
For purposes of this  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_, all fractional shares to which
a single record holder would be entitled shall be aggregated, and calculations
shall be rounded to three decimal places. In lieu of any such fractional
shares, each holder of Company Shares who would otherwise be entitled to such
fractional shares shall be entitled to an amount in cash, without interest,
rounded down to the nearest cent, equal to the product of (i) the amount of
the fractional share interest in a share of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled under _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)_ (or would be entitled but for
this _Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_) and (ii) an amount equal to the Closing Volume-
Weighted Average Price. As soon as practicable after the determination of the
amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Company Shares in lieu of any
fractional share interests in Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall
make available such amounts, without interest, to the holders of Company
Shares entitled to receive such cash.

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the
holders of Company Shares for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Parent, and any holder of Company Shares who has not
theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of its claim for the Merger Consideration and any dividends
or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock as contemplated by
_Section_ _ 2.1(c)_.

 

(g) None of Parent, Merger Sub, Merger LLC, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to
any Person in respect of any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund (including
any amounts delivered to Parent in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.2(f)_) delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. Immediately prior to the date on which any
Merger Consideration or any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent
Common Stock as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)(i)_ in respect of a
Company Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in
respect of such Company Share shall, to the extent permitted by Law, become
the property of the Surviving Company, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



7

    

(h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable and customary amount as
Parent or the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
shares of Parent Common Stock and the cash, unpaid dividends or other
distributions that would be payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant
to this _Article II_ had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been
surrendered.

 

(i) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as
directed by Parent, on a daily basis; _provided_ , that no monetary losses on
such investment thereof shall affect the Merger Consideration payable
hereunder and, following any such losses, Parent shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
Company Shares, for exchange in accordance with this _Article II_ , in the
amount of such losses to the extent that the amount then in the Exchange Fund
is insufficient to pay the cash portion of the Merger Consideration that
remains payable. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Parent.

(j) Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company or the Exchange
Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or under any provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to
the appropriate taxing authority, such amount deducted or withheld shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made, and, in the case
of any amounts deducted or withheld from any payments not consisting entirely
of cash, Parent shall be treated as though it deducted or withheld an
appropriate amount of the type of consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder of Company Shares, sold such consideration for
an amount of cash equal to the fair market value of such consideration at the
time of such deemed sale and paid such cash proceeds to the Person in respect
of which such deduction or withholding was made.

Section 2.3 _Treatment of Company Stock Awards_.

 

(a) Each option to purchase Company Common Stock granted under any Company
Stock Plan (a " _Company Stock Option_ "), whether vested or unvested, that
is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease, at the Effective Time, to represent a right to acquire Company Shares
and shall be converted at the Effective Time, without any action on the part
of any holder of any Company Stock Option, into an option to purchase Parent
Common Stock (a " _Parent Stock Option_ "), on the same terms and conditions
as were applicable under such Company Stock Option (including, but not
limited to, provisions relating to vesting, forfeiture and the effect of
termination of employment). The number of shares of Parent Common Stock
subject to each such Parent Stock Option shall be equal to the number of
Company Shares subject to the corresponding Company Stock Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded
down to the nearest whole share of Parent Common Stock, and such Parent Stock
Option shall have an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest
cent) equal to the per share exercise price of such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Option

 



8

    

 Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , that in the case of any Company Stock Option to
which Section 421 of the Code applies as of the Effective Time by reason of
its qualification under Section 422 or Section 423 of the Code, the exercise
price, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such option and
the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in a
manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the exercise price, the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to such option and the terms and conditions of
exercise of each Company Stock Option shall be determined in a manner
consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.

(b) As of the Effective Time, each outstanding award of restricted stock
units granted pursuant to a Company Stock Plan (" _Company Restricted Stock
Units_ ") that is outstanding at the Effective Time shall be assumed by Parent
and shall be converted into an award of restricted stock units with respect
to Parent Common Stock (" _Parent Restricted Stock Units_ "). Each Parent
Restricted Stock Unit so assumed and converted shall continue to have, and
shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions that applied to the
applicable Company Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective
Time (including, but not limited to, provisions relating to vesting,
forfeiture and the effect of termination of employment). As of the Effective
Time, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each award of
Parent Restricted Stock Units shall be equal to the product of (i) the total
number of Company Shares covered by such Company Restricted Stock
Units immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ (ii) 0.301. Any
of the Company Restricted Stock Units that are required to be settled
immediately prior to Effective Time shall be settled immediately prior to the
Effective Time and the holders of Company Restricted Stock Units and the
Company Shares received (or to be received) pursuant to such settlement shall
be treated as Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

 

(c) As of the Effective Time, each Company Restricted Share that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall receive the
same treatment accorded to Company Shares as specified in _Section_ __ _
2.1_.

(d) If Parent so elects, Parent may, in its sole discretion, assume any or
all of the Company Stock Plans; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Parent does
not elect to assume such Company Stock Plans, the Parent Stock Options and
Parent Restricted Stock Units contemplated under this  _Section_ __ _ 2.3_
shall be granted under the Parent Stock Plans. If Parent makes such election,
Parent shall, prior to the Effective Time, (x) register on SEC Form S-8 all
shares of Parent Common Stock that could be issued pursuant to the Parent
Stock Options and Parent Restricted Stock Units and (y) take all such steps to
ensure that all such shares of Parent Common Stock shall be validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable upon issuance in respect of the Parent Stock
Options and Parent Restricted Stock Units. To the extent that Parent does not
elect to assume one or more of the Company Stock Plans, in response
to written notice from Parent delivered not less than ten (10) Business Days
prior to the Effective Time, at or prior to the Effective Time, the board of
directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") shall adopt
any resolutions and take all steps necessary to (i) cause such Company Stock
Plan(s) to terminate at or prior to the Effective Time and (ii) ensure that
from and after the Effective Time neither Parent, the Surviving Company nor
any of their respective successors or Affiliates will be required to deliver
shares of common stock or other capital stock of Parent or the Surviving
Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of the Company Stock Awards
pursuant thereto.

 



 



9

    

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or an appropriate
committee thereof) shall take all actions as may be necessary to effectuate
the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ (including adopting such
resolutions as are necessary for the treatment of the Company Restricted Stock
Units, Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Shares (collectively, the
" _Company Stock Awards_ ") and the Company Stock Plans as contemplated by
this _Section_ _ 2.3_).

any Company Material Contract, (iv) result in any breach or violation of any

other than, in the case of _clauses (ii)_ , _(iii)_ and _(iv)_ above, any
such items that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect or
materially impair the ability of the Company to perform its obligations
hereunder or prevent or unreasonably delay the consummation of any of the
Transactions.

 

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company,
and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions, do not and will not
require any consent, approval, order, license, authorization or permit of,
action by, filing, registration or declaration with or notification to, any
U.S. or non-U.S. governmental or regulatory (including stock exchange or

and (vii) where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals,

have a Company Material Adverse Effect or materially impair the ability of
the Company to perform its obligations hereunder or prevent or unreasonably
delay the consummation of any of the Transactions.

 

Section 3.5 _SEC Reports; Financial Statements_.

 

(a) The Company has filed or furnished all forms, reports, statements,
schedules, certifications and other documents (including all
exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto) required to be filed or
furnished by the Company with the SEC since January 1, 2017 (all such forms,
reports, statements, schedules, certifications, exhibits and other information
incorporated

 



14

    

therein, and other documents, collectively, the " _Company SEC Documents_ ").
As of their respective dates, or, if amended, as of the date of the last such
amendment filed prior to the date hereof, each of the Company SEC Documents
complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (" _SOX_
"), and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as the
case may be, each as in effect on the date so filed. Except to the extent that
information in any Company SEC Document has been revised or superseded by a
Company SEC Document filed prior to the date hereof, none of the Company SEC
Documents contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a
material fact required to be stated or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. No Subsidiary of the Company is subject to the periodic
reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and no Subsidiary of the Company
is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of any non-U.S. Governmental
Entity that performs a similar function to that of the SEC or any securities
exchange or quotation system, in each case except for periodic reporting
requirements solely by virtue of such SubsidiaryÂ’s operations as a broker or
dealer.

 

(b) The audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries (including any related notes thereto) that are
included in the Company SEC Documents (i) comply as to form in all material
respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC applicable
thereto, (ii) have been prepared in accordance with United States generally
accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto or permitted by the SEC under the Exchange Act) and (iii) fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries at the respective dates thereof and
the consolidated results of their operations, cash flows and stockholdersÂ’

vendors and to detect possible errors or omissions in the Subordinate
ServicersÂ’ performance of their duties as sub-servicers or vendors. Such
policies and procedures have not detected, nor does any Acquired Company
otherwise have notice or Knowledge, of a failure of a Subordinate Servicer to
comply with the related Subservicing Agreements that could reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the servicing rights,
performance by HFF LP of its obligations under the Applicable Requirements or
on HFF LPÂ’s ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

 



38

Section 4.5 _SEC Reports; Financial Statements_. 

(a) Parent has filed or furnished all forms, reports, statements, schedules,
certifications and other documents (including all exhibits, amendments and
supplements thereto) required to be filed or furnished by Parent with the SEC
since January 1, 2017 (all such forms, reports, statements, schedules,
certifications, exhibits and other information incorporated therein, and
other documents, collectively, the " _Parent SEC Documents_ "). As of their
respective dates, or, if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment
filed prior to the date hereof, each of the Parent SEC Documents complied in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of

 



46

    

the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and SOX, and the applicable rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, as the case may be, each as in effect on
the date so filed. Except to the extent that information in any Parent SEC
Document has been revised or superseded by a Parent SEC Document filed prior
to the date hereof, none of the Parent SEC Documents contains any untrue
statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be
stated or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No Subsidiary
of Parent is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange
Act, and no Parent Company is subject to the periodic reporting requirements
of any non-U.S. Governmental Entity that performs a similar function to that
of the SEC or any securities exchange or quotation system, in each case except
for periodic reporting requirements solely by virtue of such SubsidiaryÂ’s
operations as a broker or dealer.

consolidated Subsidiaries (including any related notes thereto) that
are included in the Parent SEC Documents (i) comply as to form in all
material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC
applicable thereto, (ii) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on
a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto or permitted by the SEC under the Exchange Act)
and (iii) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial
position of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries at the respective dates
thereof and the consolidated results of their operations, cash flows and
stockholdersÂ’ equity for the periods indicated. The unaudited consolidated
financial statements of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries (including
any related notes thereto) that are included in the Parent SEC Documents (x)
comply as to form in all material respects with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC applicable thereto, (y) have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or may be permitted
by the SEC under the Exchange Act) and (z) fairly present in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations, cash flows and stockholdersÂ’ equity for the periods
indicated.

 

(c) Parent maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) as required by
Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act and sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting for the Parent
Companies. Parent has designed disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable
assurance that material information required to be disclosed by Parent in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SECÂ’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to ParentÂ’s
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. ParentÂ’s management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of ParentÂ’s internal controls over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of SOX, and based on the most
recent such assessment concluded that such controls were effective. Parent
has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation, to ParentÂ’s outside
auditors and the audit committee of the Parent Board (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of such
internal control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect in any material respect ParentÂ’s ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in ParentÂ’s internal control over financial reporting. Since January 1,
2017, Parent has not identified any significant deficiency, material
weakness or fraud, whether or not material, that involved management or other
employees.

 



47

    

(d) Since January 1, 2017, (i) the Chief Executive Officer and the then-acting
Chief Financial Officer of Parent have signed, and Parent has furnished to
the SEC, all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the
Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of SOX; (ii) the statements contained
in such certifications are accurate; (iii) such certifications contain no
qualifications or exceptions to the matters certified therein and have not
been modified or withdrawn; and (iv) neither Parent nor any of its officers
has received notice from any Governmental Entity questioning or challenging
the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing or submission of such
certifications.

 

(e) Since January 1, 2017, (i) no Parent Company nor, to the knowledge of
Parent, any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant
or representative of any of the Parent Companies has received or otherwise
had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing
practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of any of the Parent
Companies or their respective internal accounting controls, including any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that any of the Parent
Companies has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices and
(ii) no attorney representing any of the Parent Companies, whether or not
employed by any of the Parent Companies, has reported evidence of a material

(f) Parent has made available to the Company true, correct and complete copies
of all written comment letters from the staff of the SEC received since
January 1, 2017 relating to the Parent SEC Documents and all written responses
of Parent thereto other than with respect to requests for confidential
treatment. Parent has timely responded to all comment letters from the staff
of the SEC, and the SEC has not asserted that any of such responses is
inadequate, insufficient or otherwise non-responsive. There are no outstanding
or unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC staff with
respect to any Parent SEC Documents and, to the knowledge of Parent, none of
the Parent SEC Documents (other than confidential treatment requests) is the
subject of ongoing SEC review. There are no internal investigations, or to
the knowledge of Parent, SEC inquiries or investigations or other
governmental inquiries or investigations pending or threatened, in each case
regarding any accounting practices of any of the Parent Companies.

 

Section 4.6 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. No Parent Company has any

or otherwise, except for liabilities and obligations (a) reflected or reserved
against in ParentÂ’s consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2018 (or the

to form in all material respects with the requirements of applicable Law,
including the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, except
that no representation is made by Parent with respect to statements made or
incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by the Company
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Form S-4 or Proxy
Statement.

Acquisition Proposal or any proposal, inquiry or offer that could reasonably
be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal if the Company Board

counsel) that failure to waive such standstill would reasonably be expected
to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the
Company under applicable Law.

(b) The Acquired Companies shall not, and shall cause their respective
directors, officers and Key Employees not to, and shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to cause any other of their respective Representatives
not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage

at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, (i) the
Company receives, after the date of this Agreement, an unsolicited _bona fide_
written Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii) such Company Acquisition Proposal
did not result from a breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ and (iii) the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s
outside legal counsel and outside financial advisors) that such Company
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Company Superior Proposal, then, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, the Company may (A) make available information with respect to the
Acquired Companies to the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal
pursuant to a Company Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any non-public information provided or made available to any
Person given such access shall have been previously provided or made
available to Parent or shall be provided or made available to Parent prior to
or concurrently with the time it is provided or made available to such Person,
and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making

_provided_ , _however_ , that the Acquired Companies shall, and shall cause
its and their respective Representatives to, cease any activities described
in _clause (A)_ or _(B)_ of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(c)_ immediately
following the time the applicable Company Acquisition Proposal ceases to be a
Company Superior Proposal or a Company Acquisition Proposal that could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Superior Proposal. The Company
shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) advise Parent
in writing of the receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry,
proposal or offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company
Acquisition Proposal (including the identity of the Person making or
submitting such Company Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, proposal or offer,
and the terms and conditions thereof) that is made or submitted by any Person
prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall keep Parent informed, on a
reasonably current basis, of the status of, and any financial or other changes

withhold, withdraw or qualify (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent) the
Company Recommendation or the approval of this Agreement, the Merger, the
Subsequent Merger or any of the other Transactions, take any action (or permit
or authorize any of the Acquired Companies or any of their respective
Representatives to take any such action) inconsistent with the Company
Recommendation or resolve, agree or propose to take any such actions (each
such action set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)(i)(A)_ being referred to
herein as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation_ _Change_ ") or (B) adopt,
approve, recommend, endorse or otherwise declare advisable any __ Company
Acquisition Proposal or resolve, agree or propose to take any such actions,
(ii) cause 

 



61

    

or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger

Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, (iii) take any action to make the
provisions of any Takeover Laws or any restrictive provision of any applicable
anti-takeover provision in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the
Company, inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by a Company
Acquisition Proposal (including approving any transaction under the DGCL) or
(iv) resolve, agree or propose to take any such actions.

 

(e) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)_, at any time prior to obtaining
the Company Stockholder Approval, provided that the Acquired Companies have
complied with the applicable provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, then,
prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may
solely in response to a Company Superior Proposal received on or after the
date hereof that has not been withdrawn or abandoned and that did not result
from a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in order to cause the Company to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)(ii)_ (including payment of the
Termination Fee) and concurrently enter into a binding definitive agreement to
effect such Company Superior Proposal. Neither the Company Board nor any
committee thereof shall make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ _ 7.1(d)(ii)_ or cause the
Company to enter into a binding definitive agreement to effect such
Company Superior Proposal unless the Company has first complied with the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 5.3(f)_ and, after so complying, the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s outside
legal counsel and financial advisor) that such Company Acquisition Proposal
continues to constitute a Company Superior Proposal.

(f) The Company Board shall not take any action set forth in _Section_ __ _
5.3(e)_ unless the Company has first (i) provided written notice to Parent (a
" _Notice of Company Superior_ _Proposal_ ") advising Parent that the Company
has received a Company Superior Proposal, __ specifying the terms and
conditions of such Company Superior Proposal, identifying the Person making
such Company Superior Proposal and providing copies of any agreements
intended to effect (or to be entered into in connection with) such Company
Superior Proposal, and that the Company Board has made the determination
required under _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_, (ii) negotiated, and caused
the Company and its Representatives to negotiate, during the five (5)
Business Day period following ParentÂ’s receipt of the Notice of Company
Superior Proposal (the " _Company_ _Superior Proposal Notice Period_ "), in
good faith with Parent to enable Parent to make __ counteroffers or proposals,
including to amend the terms of this Agreement (to the extent Parent wishes to
do so), and (iii) after complying with _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ , determined
in good faith (after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s outside legal counsel and
financial advisors and taking into account any such counteroffer or proposed
amendment to the terms of this Agreement) that such Company Acquisition
Proposal remains a Company Superior Proposal and the failure to make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change and accept such Company Superior Proposal would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Company BoardÂ’s fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if during the Company Superior Proposal Notice Period any
revisions are made to a Company Acquisition Proposal and such revisions are
material (it being understood and agreed that any change to consideration with
respect to such proposal is material), the Company shall deliver a new Notice
of Company Superior Proposal to Parent and shall comply with the
requirements of

 



62

    

this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(f)_ with respect to such new Notice of Company
Superior Proposal. In the event that the Company receives a Company
Acquisition Proposal during the pendency of this Agreement, the Company hereby
agrees that notwithstanding the standstill provisions contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, Parent shall be permitted to propose to the
Company one or more amendments to this Agreement.

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Company Board,
in circumstances not involving or relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal,
from effecting a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to the
occurrence of a Company Intervening Event if the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s outside legal counsel) that
the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
Company BoardÂ’s fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under
applicable Law and the Company has first (i) provided written notice to
Parent (a " _Notice_ _of Company Intervening Event_ ") describing the Company
Intervening Event and advising __ Parent that the Company Board intends to
take such action and specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable detail;
(ii) negotiated, and caused the Company and its Representatives to negotiate,
during the five (5) Business Days following ParentÂ’s receipt of the Notice of
Company Intervening Event (the " _Company Intervening Event Notice Period_ "),
in good faith with Parent regarding any revisions to the terms of the
Transactions proposed by Parent in response to such Company Intervening
Event; and (iii) at the end of the Company Intervening Event Notice Period,
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the
CompanyÂ’s outside legal counsel (and taking into account any adjustment
or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent), that a
Company Intervening Event continues to exist and that the failure to make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Law.

(h) The Company agrees that it shall take all actions necessary so that any
Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall not change the approval of this
Agreement or any other approval of the Company Board or any committee thereof
in any respect that would have the effect of causing any of the Takeover Laws
of any state (including Delaware) or other similar statutes to be applicable
to the Transactions, including the Merger and the Subsequent Merger.

 

(i) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ shall prohibit the Company
Board from (A) taking and disclosing a position contemplated by Item 1012(a)
of Regulation M-A, Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or Rule 14d-9 under
the Exchange Act or (B) making any disclosure to its shareholders if the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s
outside counsel) that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the Company BoardÂ’s fiduciary duties to the stockholders of
the Company under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the
Company nor the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall be permitted to
recommend that the stockholders of the Company tender any securities in
connection with any tender or exchange offer (or otherwise approve, endorse or
recommend any Company Acquisition Proposal), unless in each case, in
connection therewith, the Company Board effects a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_; _provided_ ,
_further_ that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen"
communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change unless the Company Board expressly reaffirms the Company
Recommendation and rejects any Company Acquisition Proposal within three (3)
Business Days after such stop, look and listen communication.

 



63

    

(j) Any action taken or not taken by any Representative of any of the Acquired
Companies that if taken or not taken by the Company would constitute a breach
of this _Section_ _ 5.3_ shall be deemed a breach of this Agreement by the
Company.

development or occurrence that is material to the Acquired Companies, taken as
a whole, that is not known or reasonably foreseeable (or the magnitude of
which is not known or reasonably foreseeable) to or by the Company Board
as of the date of this Agreement, which event, fact, circumstance,
development or occurrence (or the magnitude of which) becomes known to or by
the Company Board prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Company Intervening Event relates to an
event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence involving Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries, then such event, fact, circumstance, development or
occurrence shall not constitute a Company Intervening Event unless it has a
Parent Material Adverse Effect; _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event
shall the following constitute a Company Intervening Event: (A) the receipt,
existence or terms of a Company Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry or
matter relating thereto or consequence thereof, (B) events or circumstances
arising from the announcement or the existence of, or any action taken by
either party pursuant to and in compliance with the terms of, this Agreement
and (C) changes in the market price or trading volume of the Company Shares or
shares of Parent Common Stock (it being understood that the facts and
occurrences giving rise to or contributing to such changes may be taken into
account in determining whether there has been a Company Intervening Event).

(iv) " _Company Superior Proposal_ " means any binding, _bona fide_ written
offer made by a third party or group pursuant to which such third party or
group would acquire, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the outstanding
Company Shares or substantially all of the assets of the Acquired Companies,
taken as a whole, (A) on terms which, in the good faith determination of the
Company Board (after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s outside legal counsel),
are superior from a financial point of view to the stockholders of the
Company to the Transactions, taking into account all the terms and conditions
of such proposal and this Agreement (including the Termination Fee, any
changes proposed by Parent to the terms of this Agreement and the potential
time delays and other risks to consummation associated with such offer), (B)
that is reasonably likely to be completed, taking into account all financial,
regulatory, legal and other aspects of such offer and (C) for which any
necessary financing is fully committed (including with respect to any
indebtedness that could be required to be repaid in connection with the
transactions contemplated by such offer).

 

Section 5.4 _Preparation of the Form S-4 and Proxy Statement; Stockholder
Meeting_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Parent and
the Company shall prepare, and Parent shall file with the SEC, the Form S-4,
in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of Parent
and the Company shall cooperate in the preparation and filing of the Form S-4
and Proxy Statement. The Company and Parent shall provide the other with the
opportunity to review and comment on such documents prior to their filing with
the SEC. Each of Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
reasonably practicable after such filing and to keep the Form S-4 effective as
long as necessary to consummate the Merger and the Subsequent Merger. No
filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement
will be made by Parent or the Company, as applicable, without the otherÂ’s
prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) and without providing the other the opportunity to review and comment
thereon. Parent or the Company, as applicable, will advise the other promptly
after it receives oral or written notice of

 



65

    

the time when the Form S-4 has become effective or any supplement
or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension
of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with
the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any oral or written
request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or
comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional
information, and will promptly provide the other with copies of any
written communication received from the SEC or any state securities
commission. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information
relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors, is discovered by Parent or the Company which should be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 or the Proxy
Statement, so that any such document would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other party and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC, after the other party
has had a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and, to the
extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the
respective stockholders of Parent and the Company. The Company will cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the
Securities Act. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __
_ 5.4_, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.4_ shall prohibit the Company or
Parent from making any filing of any Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, Annual
Report on Form 10-K or Current Report on Form 8-K required pursuant to the
Exchange Act.

 

(b) The Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following
effectiveness of the Form S-4, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders (the " _Company Stockholder Meeting_ ") for the
purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder Approval. Subject to _Section_ __ _
5.3(e)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(f)_, the Company shall, through the Company
Board, recommend that its stockholders adopt and approve this Agreement and
the Transactions, including the Merger (the " _Company Recommendation_ "),
and shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) solicit from its stockholders
proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and (ii) take all other
action necessary or advisable to secure the Company Stockholder Approval, and
the Company Board shall not withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose
publicly to withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify the Company Recommendation
in a manner adverse to Parent. The Company shall have the right to postpone
or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting (A) by not more than thirty (30)
days in the aggregate (1) for the absence of a quorum, (2) to allow reasonable
additional time to solicit additional proxies to the extent that at such time
the Company has not received a number of proxies that it reasonably believes
sufficient to obtain he Company Stockholder Approval at the Company
Stockholder Meeting, or (3) to the extent required by applicable Law, or (B)
with the written consent of Parent. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the CompanyÂ’s obligations pursuant to this _Section 5.4(b)_ shall
not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
public or private communication to the Company of any Company Acquisition
Proposal or by a Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless this Agreement
has been terminated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)(ii)_.

 



66

    

Section 5.5 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to contractual
and legal restrictions applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and
to the Representatives of Parent, reasonable access during normal business
hours during the period prior to the Effective Time or the termination of
this Agreement to all of the CompanyÂ’s properties, books, contracts,
commitments, personnel and records (including the work papers of independent
accountants, if available and subject to the consent of such independent
accountants), and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent (a) a copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities laws and
(b) all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as
Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that such access does
not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of the Acquired Companies. This
_Section_ __ _ 5.5_ shall not require any Acquired Company to permit any
access, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of
the Company would reasonably be expected to result in (i) the disclosure of
any trade secrets of third parties or a violation of any of such Acquired
CompanyÂ’s obligations with respect to confidentiality if such
Acquired Company shall have used its best efforts to obtain the consent of
such third party to such inspection or disclosure, (ii) the loss of attorney-
client privilege with respect to such information or (iii) in the case of
documents or portions of documents relating to pricing or other matters that
are highly sensitive, a Governmental Entity alleging that providing such
information violates any Regulatory Law. If any material is withheld by such
Acquired Company pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Company shall inform
Parent as to the general nature of what is being withheld. All information
exchanged pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ shall be subject to the Mutual
Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated September 27, 2018,
between the Company and Jones Lang LaSalle Americas, Inc., a Maryland
corporation (the " _Confidentiality_ _Agreement_ "). 

Section 5.6 _Further Action; Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law to consummate the Transactions, and no party hereto shall fail
to take or cause to be taken any action that would reasonably be expected
to prevent, impede or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent,
Merger Sub or Merger LLC to, and no Acquired Company shall, without the prior
written consent of Parent, agree to any modification to or accommodation
under any Contract or pay any fee, penalty or other consideration to any third
party for any consent or approval required for the consummation of the
Transactions. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each
party hereto agrees to make (i) an appropriate filing of a Notification and
Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions within
fifteen (15) Business Days from the date hereof and to supply as promptly as
reasonably practicable and advisable any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to take
all other commercially reasonable actions necessary, proper or advisable
to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods
under the HSR Act as soon as practicable, including by requesting early
termination of the waiting period provided for in the HSR Act, (ii) if
required, appropriate filings under any Regulatory Law as soon as reasonably
practicable and (iii) any other necessary, proper or advisable registrations,
filings and notices within twenty (20) Business Days after the date hereof.
Subject to applicable Law, and except as required by any Governmental Entity,
neither Parent nor the Company shall agree to extend any waiting period under
the HSR Act without the prior written consent of the other party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , if Parent and the Company disagree as to whether to extend the
period, ParentÂ’s determination shall control.

 



67

    

(b) Without limiting _Section_ __ _ 5.6(a)_, Parent agrees to, and
will cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to take any and all
actions necessary to avoid, eliminate, and resolve any and all impediments
under any Regulatory Law or trade regulation law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity or any other Person with respect to the Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to obtain all consents, approvals, and
waivers under any Regulatory Law that may be required by any Governmental
Entity to enable the parties to close the Transactions as promptly as
reasonably practicable, including, (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to,
and/or effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the
sale, divestiture, transfer, license, disposition, or hold separate (through
the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of such assets, properties, or
businesses of Parent or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or of the assets,
properties, or businesses to be acquired pursuant to this Agreement as are
required to be divested in order to avoid the entry of any decree, judgment,
injunction (permanent or preliminary), or any other order that would make the
Transactions unlawful or would otherwise materially delay or prevent the
consummation of the Transactions, (ii) terminating, modifying, or assigning
existing relationships, Contracts, or obligations of Parent or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates or those relating to any assets, properties, or
businesses to be acquired pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) changing or
modifying any course of conduct regarding future operations of Parent or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates or the assets, properties, or businesses to be
acquired pursuant to this Agreement, or (iv) otherwise taking or committing
to take any other action that would limit Parent or its Subsidiaries or
AffiliatesÂ’ freedom of action with respect to, or their ability to retain, one
or more of their respective operations, divisions, businesses, product lines,
customers, assets or rights or interests, or their freedom of action with
respect to the assets, properties, or businesses to be acquired pursuant to
this Agreement; provided that Parent is not obligated to take any action
contemplated in  _clause (i)_ through _(iv)_ unless such action is expressly
conditioned upon the closing of the Transactions; provided further that in the
event that any action contemplated in _clause (i)_ through _(iv)_ would
result in the parties resolving objections, if any, as may be asserted with
respect to the Transactions under any Regulatory Law and obtaining all
consents under requisite Regulatory Laws that may be required by any
Governmental Entity with competent jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties
hereto to consummate the Transactions, as between the Company and Parent,
Parent shall be entitled to make the final determination as to which of such
actions to pursue so long as such determination otherwise complies with the
terms of this Agreement.

(c) In addition, if any action or proceeding is instituted (or
threatened) challenging the Transactions as violating any Regulatory Law or
if any decree, order, judgment, or injunction (whether temporary, preliminary,
or permanent) is entered, enforced, or attempted to be entered or enforced by
any Governmental Entity that would make the Transactions illegal or otherwise
delay or prohibit the consummation of the Transactions, Parent and its
Affiliates and Subsidiaries shall take any and all actions to contest and
defend any such claim, cause of action, or proceeding to avoid entry of, or
to have vacated, lifted, reversed, repealed, rescinded, or terminated, any
decree, order, judgment, or injunction (whether temporary, preliminary, or
permanent) that prohibits, prevents, or restricts consummation of
the Transaction.

 



68

    

(d) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and Merger LLC, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, shall, in connection with the efforts referenced
in _Section_ __ _ 5.6(a)_, _5.6(b)_ and _5.6(c)_ to obtain all requisite
approvals and authorizations for the Transactions under the HSR Act or any
other Law and to make any other necessary, proper, or advisable
registrations, filings and notices, use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry,
including any Action initiated by a private party, (ii) keep the other party
reasonably informed on a prompt basis of any communication received by such
party from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission (the "
_FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ")
or any other Governmental Entity and of any communication received or given in
connection with any Action by a private party, in each case regarding any of
the Transactions and (iii) permit the other party a reasonable opportunity to
review any substantive written communication given by it to, and consult with
each other in advance of any scheduled substantive meeting or conference
with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity or, in connection with
any Action by a private party, with any other Person, and to the extent
permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other applicable Governmental Entity or
other Person, give the other party the reasonable opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings and conferences. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company and Parent may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably
designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other side
under this _Section_ __ _ 5.6(b)_ as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such
materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the
outside counsel regarding Regulatory Law of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by outside counsel to employees, officers, directors or consultants
of the recipient or any of its Affiliates unless express permission is
obtained in advance from the source of the materials (the Company or Parent,
as the case may be) or its legal counsel. Each of the Company and Parent shall
cause its respective counsel regarding Regulatory Law to comply with this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.6(d)_.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ to the
contrary, Parent and its Affiliates shall not be required to take any actions
that, individually or in the aggregate, are materially detrimental to the
benefits of the Transactions to Parent and its Subsidiaries.

 

Section 5.7 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) For a period of two (2) years following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, provide each employee of the Acquired
Companies who remains in the employment of Parent and its Subsidiaries during
such period (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") with (i) the base salary or
hourly wage rate and aggregate incentive compensation opportunities that are,
in each case, not less than those provided to such Continuing Employee as of
immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) employee benefits including
severance (other than those included in clause (i)) that are substantially
comparable, in the aggregate, to the employee benefits (other than those
included in clause (i)) provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and
its Subsidiaries.

 

(b) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
ensure that each Continuing Employee is provided full credit for prior
service with the Acquired Companies to the extent such service would be
recognized if it had been performed as an employee of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries for purposes of (i) eligibility and vesting under any

 



69

    

Parent Employee Plans but not for benefit accrual purposes under any defined
benefit plan of any of the Parent Companies or for purposes of determining
retirement eligibility under any equity or equity based award granted in
connection with the Transactions and (ii) unless covered under another
arrangement with or of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving
Company, determination of benefit levels under any Parent Employee Plan or
policy of general application in each case relating to paid time off or
severance, in either case, for which the Continuing Employees are otherwise
eligible and in which the Continuing Employees are offered participation, but
except where such credit would result in a duplication of benefits. For the
avoidance of doubt, no Continuing Employee shall be retroactively eligible for
any Parent Employee Plan, including any such Parent Employee Plan that was
frozen prior to the Effective Time. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Parent Employee Plan_ " means any employee benefit plan including,
without limitation, any "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 3(2) of ERISA) or "employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA). The Company shall provide Parent or its designee
all information reasonably requested to allow Parent to comply with such
obligations in this _Section_ __ _ 5.7(b)_.

(c) Without limiting the foregoing, if the Continuing Employees participate
in any Parent Employee Plan that provides medical, dental, vision or
prescription drug benefits, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts
(or shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause one of its Affiliates,
including, following the Closing, the Company) to (i) cause there to be waived
any pre-existing condition, actively at work, waiting period and
similar requirements and (ii) cause the Parent Benefit Plans to honor any
expenses incurred by the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents
under any corresponding Company Plan during the portion of the calendar year
up to the date that coverage under a Company Plan is replaced with coverage
under such Parent Benefit Plan for purposes of satisfying applicable
deductible, co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket expenses. The Company shall
provide Parent or its designee all information reasonably requested to allow
Parent to comply with such obligations in this _Section_ _ 5.7(c)_.

 

(d) The Company and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to adopt,
effective as of the Closing, compensation plans or arrangements for each
Continuing Employee who is eligible to participate in Holliday Fenoglio
Fowler, L.P. Second Amended and Restated Profit Participation Bonus Plan, HFF
Securities, L.P. Second Amended and Restated Profit Participation Plan, the
HFF, Inc. Firm Profit Participation Bonus Plan or the HFF, Inc. Executive
Bonus Plan (collectively, the " _Profit Participation Plans_ ") immediately
prior to the Closing that provide incentive compensation opportunities
following the Closing Date that are on substantially the same terms
(including eligibility to participate, calculation of the applicable bonus
pool and time at which distributions are made) as existed immediately prior to
the Closing Date under such Profit Participation Plans. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Parties agree that (i) the plans under which the foregoing
incentive compensation opportunities will be provided will include
administrative and governance provisions which are consistent with
the administrative and governance provisions contained in similar plans
maintained by Parent and its Subsidiaries, (ii) the form in which such
incentive compensation opportunities will be paid to Continuing Employees will
be Parent Restricted Stock Units or cash (each of which may or may not be
subject to deferral, as determined by Parent) or a combination of the
foregoing, at ParentÂ’s discretion, and (iii) the terms of such plans,
including the applicable performance measures and calculation thereof
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the calculation of "margin" and



 



70

    

 allocations of "overhead" expenses), will be adjusted as Parent and the
Company mutually determine in good faith is appropriate in order to, as
appropriate, reflect the combination of the applicable businesses of Parent
and the Company and to prevent the inequitable dilution or enlargement of the
intended incentive compensation opportunities (including to take into account
the effect of the Transactions and that the Company will be a Subsidiary of
Parent and the increased size of the combined organization). In addition,
Parent agrees to adopt a policy pursuant to which it will make annual grants
of equity or equity-based compensation awards to Continuing Employees
in aggregate amounts of up to $10,000,000; provided that the Parent Board or
its delegate shall have sole discretion to determine the aggregate amount of
the awards, the recipients thereof and the terms of such awards.

 

(e) The Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions necessary or
appropriate to terminate, effective on the Closing Date (and contingent upon
the Closing), any Company Plan set forth on Section 5.7(e) of the Company
Disclosure Letter effective as of the date set forth therein, unless Parent,
in its sole and absolute discretion, agrees to sponsor and maintain any
such Company Plan by providing the Company with written notice of such
election at least ten (10) days before the Effective Time. Unless Parent so
provides such notice to the Company, the Company shall deliver to Parent,
prior to the Closing, evidence that the Company Board has validly adopted
resolutions to terminate such scheduled Company Plans on Section 5.7(e) of the
Company Disclosure Letter (the form and substance of which resolutions shall
be subject to review and approval of Parent, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and taken all other actions
necessary to terminate such Company Plans scheduled on Section 5.7(e) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, effective no later than the date immediately
preceding the Closing Date.

(f) The Company shall provide prompt written notice to Parent of any Key
Employee, and any other employee of any Acquired Company with annual base
compensation, services fees or any bonus opportunities collectively greater
than $1,000,000, who delivers written notice, or, to the knowledge of the
Company, communicates, to any Acquired Company at any time between the date
of this Agreement and the Effective Time that he or she intends to resign or
retire as a result of or in connection with the Transactions.

 

(g) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, Parent or any of
its Affiliates (including the Surviving Company) to continue any specific
employee benefit plans, or to continue the employment of any specific Person
for any period of time. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ are for
the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing
herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to (i)
constitute an amendment to any of the compensation and benefits plans
maintained for or provided to Continuing Employees prior to, on or following
the Effective Time, (ii) impede or limit Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, the Surviving Company or any of their respective Affiliates from
amending or terminating any Company Plan following the Effective Time or (iii)
confer upon or give to any Person (including for the avoidance of doubt any
current or former employees, labor unions, directors, or independent
contractors of any of the Acquired Companies, or on or after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries), other than the parties hereto and their respective
permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or
remedies under or by reason of any provision of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.7_.

 



71

    

Section 5.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company and Parent
shall promptly notify each other of the receipt of any written communication
received from any Person alleging that it is or may be required to obtain a
consent of such Person in connection with the Transactions or from any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions. The delivery of any
notice pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.8_ shall not (i) cure any breach of,
or non-compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or (ii) limit
the remedies available to the party sending or receiving such notice.

Section 5.9 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

(a) Parent, Merger Sub and Merger LLC agree that all rights to exculpation or
indemnification arising from, relating to or otherwise in respect of, acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the
current or former directors or officers of any of the Acquired Companies as
provided in their respective certificates of incorporation, bylaws or other
organizational documents shall survive the Merger and the Subsequent Merger
and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.
For a period of no less than six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Company to, and the Surviving Company shall,
maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses provisions of each Acquired CompanyÂ’s certificate of incorporation
and bylaws or similar organizational documents in effect as of the date of
this Agreement or in any indemnification agreements of the Acquired Companies
with any of their respective directors, officers or employees in effect as of
the date of this Agreement, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify
any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any individuals who immediately before the Effective Time were
current or former directors, officers or employees of any of the Acquired
Companies; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses in respect of any Action pending
or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until
the final disposition of such Action.

(b) Each of Parent and the Surviving Company shall, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance
funds in respect of each of the foregoing and costs of defense to) each
current and former director or officer of any of the Acquired Companies (each,
together with such individualÂ’s heirs, executors or administrators, an "
_Indemnified Party_ "), in each case against any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, fees and expenses (including attorneysÂ’ fees and disbursements),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement (collectively, " _Losses_ ")
in connection with any actual or threatened Action, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of, relating to or in connection
with the fact that such Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director or
fiduciary of any of the Acquired Companies at or prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by
applicable Law, to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification for such expenses. No Indemnified Party shall settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual
Action for which indemnification could be sought by an Indemnified Party
hereunder unless Parent consents in writing to such settlement, compromise
or consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

 



72

    

(c) The Company shall obtain, at or prior to the Effective Time, prepaid
(or "tail") directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ insurance and indemnification policies
that provide coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time for an
aggregate period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time (the
" _Continuing D andO Insurance_") that are substantially similar (with respect
to limits and deductibles) to the CompanyÂ’s existing policy or, if
substantially similar insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available
coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not pay an annual
premium for the Continuing DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the last annual
premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Company Â’s_ _Current
Premium_ "). If such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed 300%
of __ the CompanyÂ’s Current Premium, then Parent shall cause to be maintained
policies of insurance which, in ParentÂ’s good faith determination, provide
the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to 300% of the
CompanyÂ’s Current Premium.

 

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and
assets, then, and in each case, Parent and the Surviving Company shall ensure
that such surviving corporation or entity or the transferees of such
properties or assets assume the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _
5.9_.

 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party under this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_ shall
be in addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of any of the Acquired Companies or under any
agreement of any Indemnified Party with any of the Acquired Companies, in each
case in effect as of the date of this Agreement, or under applicable Law.
These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and the Subsequent
Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party.

 

Section 5.10 _Section_ __ _ 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
and the Company shall take all such steps as may be required or reasonably
appropriate to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including
derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) or acquisitions of
Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Parent
Common Stock) resulting from the Transactions by each individual who is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Company or who will become subject to such
reporting requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act. Parent and the Company shall provide to
the other party, prior to adoption, copies of the resolutions to be adopted
by their respective boards of directors to implement the foregoing.

Section 5.11 _Anti-Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Law is or may become
applicable to this Agreement (including the Merger, the Subsequent Merger and
the other Transactions), each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and Merger
LLC and their respective boards of directors (or other governing body) shall
grant all such approvals and take all such actions as are reasonably necessary
or appropriate so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable hereafter on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act
reasonably to eliminate or minimize the effects of such Law on such
transactions.

 



73

    

Section 5.12 _Control of Operations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
CompanyÂ’s operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over its operations.

which the Company is to be treated as merging directly with and into Parent,

connection with the statements made in the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement

(d) If there is a determination within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the
Code that the Merger and the Subsequent Merger, taken together, do not
qualify as a reorganization described in Section 368(a) of the Code, Parent,
the Company, Merger Sub and Merger LLC shall take the position for federal
income tax purposes that the Merger was a qualified stock purchase within the
meaning of Section 338 of the Code and the Subsequent Merger qualified as a
liquidation described in Section 332 of the Code.

 

(e) Parent, the Company, Merger Sub and Merger LLC hereby adopt this Agreement
as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations
Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368- 3(a).

subject matter hereof and thereof (except that the Confidentiality Agreement
shall be deemed amended as necessary so that until the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ hereof, Parent, Merger Sub,
Merger LLC and the Company shall be permitted to take the actions contemplated
by this Agreement).

 

Section 8.6 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement, express
or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person other than the
parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns any legal or
equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature under or by reason of this
Agreement, except for the provisions of _Article II_ (which, from and after
the Effective Time, shall be for the benefit of the holders of Company Shares,
Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Stock Units immediately prior to
the Effective Time) and _Section_ __ _ 5.9_ (which shall be for the benefit
of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs).

Section 8.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims or causes
of action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of
or relate to this Agreement or the Transactions, or the negotiation, execution
or performance of this Agreement, shall be governed by the internal Laws of
the State of Delaware applicable to agreements made and to be performed
entirely within such state, without regard to the conflicts of law principles
of such state that would cause the application of the laws of another
jurisdiction.

Section 8.8 _Jurisdiction; Enforcement_. Each of the parties irrevocably
agrees that any Action with respect to this Agreement and the rights and
obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any
Judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising
hereunder brought by the other party hereto or its successors or assigns,
shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery
and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if
the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware).
The parties further agree that no party to this Agreement shall be required to
obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or
as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section_ __ _
8.80_, and each party waives any objection to the imposition of such relief or
any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any
such bond or similar instrument. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably
submits with regard to any such Action for itself and in respect of its
property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the
aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any action relating to
this Agreement or any of the Transactions in any court other than the
aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees
not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in
any Action with respect to this Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any
reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this  _Section_ __
_ 8.80_, (ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law,
any claim that (x) the Action in such court is brought in an inconvenient
forum, (y) the venue of such Action is improper or (z) this Agreement, or the
subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each of the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub and Merger LLC hereby consents to service being
made through the notice procedures set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ and
agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by registered
mail (return receipt requested and first-class postage prepaid) to the
respective addresses set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ shall be effective
service of process for any Action in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions.

 

Section 8.9 _Assignment; Successors_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or
delegated, as a whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by any
party without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such
assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that Merger Sub or Merger LLC may assign in its sole
discretion and without the consent of any other party, any or all of its
rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall
relieve Parent, Merger Sub or Merger LLC of its obligations under this
Agreement. Any purported assignment without such consent shall be void.
Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective
successors and assigns.

 



95

    

Section 8.10 _Remedies_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, the parties agree
that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached and that money damages or other legal remedies would not
be an adequate remedy for any such failure to perform or breach. Accordingly
and subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.3(d)_, each of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub and Merger LLC shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms
hereof, including an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in the Delaware Court of Chancery, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity and no party
will allege, and each party hereby waives the defense or counterclaim, that
there is an adequate remedy at law. Each of the parties hereby further waives
any requirement under any law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief.

Section 8.11  _Currency_. All references to "dollars" or "$" or "US$" in this
Agreement refer to United States dollars, which is the currency used for all
purposes in this Agreement.

 

Section 8.12 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction,
and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such
jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or
portion of any provision had never been contained herein, so long as the
economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

Section 8.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
KNOWINGLY, INTENTIONALLY AND VOLUNTARILY WITH AND UPON THE ADVICE OF
COMPETENT COUNSEL IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS.

 

Section 8.14 _Counterparts; Execution_. This Agreement may be executed in two
or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
instrument and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties. The exchange
of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by facsimile or
by electronic delivery in .pdf format shall be sufficient to bind the parties
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

Section 8.15 _Disclosure Letters_. The Company Disclosure Letter and the
Parent Disclosure Letter are not intended to constitute, and shall not be
construed as constituting, representations or warranties of the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub or Merger LLC, except and to the extent expressly provided
in this Agreement. The fact that any item of information is

 



96

    

disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter
shall not be construed to mean that such information is required to be
disclosed by this Agreement. Inclusion of any item in the Company Disclosure
Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed an admission that
such item is material or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as
applicable. Descriptive headings in the Company Disclosure Letter and the
Parent Disclosure Letter are inserted for reference purposes and for
convenience of the reader only and shall not affect the interpretation
thereof or of this Agreement. Nothing contained in the Company Disclosure
Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be construed as an admission of
liability or responsibility in connection with any pending, threatened or
future matter or proceeding.
