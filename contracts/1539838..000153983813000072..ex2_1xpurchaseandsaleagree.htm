"Seller") and DIAMONDBACK EandP LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
("Buyer"). Each of Buyer and Seller is sometimes referred to herein as a
"Party," and they are sometimes collectively referred to herein as the
"Parties."

RECITALS

WHEREAS, Seller is the owner of certain fee mineral interests located in
Midland County, Texas, as more fully described herein; and

WHEREAS, subject to the terms hereof and the conditions, reservations and
exclusions described herein, Seller desires to sell to Buyer, and Buyer
desires to purchase from Seller, such fee mineral interests.

AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, Seller and Buyer agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

PURCHASE AND SALE

Section 1.1 Purchase and Sale. Subject to the terms and conditions herein set
forth, Seller agrees to sell, assign, convey and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer
agrees to purchase and acquire from Seller at the Closing, to be effective as
of the Effective Time, the Assets.

Section 1.2 Assets. As used herein, the "Assets" shall mean all of Seller's
right, title and interest in and to the following:

(a) the mineral fee interests located in Midland County, Texas, described on
Exhibit A attached hereto, together with the rights of ingress and egress at
all times for the purpose of mining, drilling, exploring, operating and
developing such lands for Hydrocarbons, and storing, handling, transporting,
and marketing therefrom (collectively, the "Mineral Interests");

(b) all crude oil, natural gas, casinghead gas, condensate, sulfur, natural
gas liquids, products and other liquid or gaseous hydrocarbons, and other
minerals of every kind and character which may be produced from or allocable
to the Mineral Interests (collectively, "Hydrocarbons"), together with all
proceeds from or of such Hydrocarbons;

(c) all valid and existing leases, agreements, contracts and contractual
rights and interests of every kind and nature relating to the Mineral
Interests, including the leases, contracts and agreements described in Exhibit
B attached hereto (the "Contracts"), together with all rights to 

enforce the terms and provisions of the Contracts and any claims arising under
any of the Contracts, whether such rights and claims arise on, prior to or
after the Effective Time; provided that Seller shall retain the right to
receive payment of any royalties relating to production of Hydrocarbons from
the Mineral Interests occurring prior to the Effective Time and shall retain,
together with its affiliate, all rights of the surface owner to the extent not
modified or amended by the terms of this Agreement;

(d) to the extent assignable, all licenses, permits, consents, certificates,
exemptions, waivers, authorizations and other rights granted by third persons,
and all certificates of convenience or necessity, immunities, privileges,
grants and other similar rights relating to the Mineral Interests;

(e) all rights of Seller to audit the records of any person and to receive
refunds or payments of any nature attributable to the Assets with respect to
periods occurring from and after the Effective Time; and

(f) originals or, if originals are unavailable, copies of all of the files,
records, information and data relating directly to the properties described in
Section 1.2(a) through Section 1.2(e) above in Seller's possession, including
title records, abstracts, title opinions, title certificates, production
records, contract files, division order files, severance tax records, land
surveys, maps, logs, engineering and technical data, evaluations and reports,
and all other information relating directly to the properties described in
Section 1.2(a) through Section 1.2(e) above (collectively, the "Records").

Section 1.3 Effective Time. The purchase and sale of the Assets shall be
effective as of 12:01 a.m., Central Time, on the Closing Date (the "Effective
Time").

ARTICLE 2 
PURCHASE PRICE

Section 2.1 Purchase Price.

(g) Purchase Price. The purchase price for the Assets shall be FOUR HUNDRED
FORTY MILLION AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($440,000,000.00) (the "Purchase Price").

(h) Deposit. On or before the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, Buyer
and Seller shall enter into an escrow agreement (the "Escrow Agreement"), with
a mutually acceptable escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent"), establishing an
escrow account (the "Escrow Account"). Unless Buyer exercises its right to
terminate this Agreement as set forth in Section 3.3(c), on the first Business
Day following the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, Buyer shall deposit
into the Escrow Account, by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
FORTY-FOUR MILLION AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($44,000,000.00) (the "Deposit"). The
Deposit, together with any earnings thereon, shall be (i) retained as
liquidated damages by Seller as provided in (x) Section 7.3(b), if Buyer
breaches its obligation to purchase the Minimum Assets as set forth in Section
7.3 and Seller elects to terminate the Agreement as a result of such breach or
(y) Section 10.2(a), if Buyer, in breach of this Agreement, fails or refuses
to close the transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) returned to Buyer as
provided in Section 10.2(b) if the transactions contemplated herein fail to
close for reasons



other than due to Buyer's breach of this Agreement. If Closing does occur, the
Deposit shall be applied to the Purchase Price and delivered to Seller.

(i) Closing Payment. At Closing, Buyer shall pay to Seller, by means of a
completed federal funds wire transfer to an account specified by Seller in
writing at least three (3) Business Days prior to Closing, an amount equal to
the Purchase Price, adjusted as follows: (i) minus the Deposit and any
earnings thereon, (ii) plus or minus, as applicable, the adjustments to the
Purchase Price, if any, as set forth in Section 3.3(b), and (iii) minus the
Calculated Value of any Assets excluded from the purchase and sale
contemplated hereby pursuant to Section 4.1 and Section 4.2 (the "Closing
Payment").

ARTICLE 3 
TITLE; DUE DILIGENCE EXAMINATION OF THE ASSETS

Section 3.1 Buyer's Inspection/Access. From and after the date of this
Agreement, at Buyer's sole risk and expense, Buyer may conduct such title
examination of the Assets as Buyer in its sole discretion chooses in order to
determine whether there exist any Title Defects with respect to the Assets. In
connection therewith, until Closing, Seller shall afford to Buyer and its
authorized representatives reasonable access in Seller's offices during
Seller's normal business hours to all books and records of Seller relating to
the Assets, including title opinions, title files, ownership maps, lease and
contract files, conveyances, production records, division order files and
financial and accounting records, in each case insofar as same may be in
existence and in the possession of Seller, excluding, however, any information
that Seller is prohibited from disclosing by bona fide, third party
confidentiality restrictions; provided, however, that Seller shall, at Buyer's
request, request waivers of such confidentiality restrictions. In addition,
Seller shall provide Buyer the right and opportunity, subject to Seller's
prior approval, to inspect the surface acreage to which the Mineral Interests
relate. The cost and expense of Buyer's due diligence review, if any, shall be
borne solely by Buyer.

Section 3.2 Certain Definitions.

(a) The term "Title Defect" shall mean any encumbrance, encroachment,
irregularity, defect in or objection to Seller's ownership of any Asset that
causes Seller not to have good and marketable title to such Asset. Without
limiting the foregoing, and for purposes of clarity, if the aggregate net
mineral acres covered by the Mineral Interests are less than 12,554, such
deficiency shall be a Title Defect.

(b) The term "Royalty Discrepancy" shall mean a discrepancy between the actual
royalty income received by Seller for any Mineral Interest during the period
from January 1, 2013 to July 31, 2013 (the "Measuring Period"), as compared to
the amount of royalty income set forth on Exhibit D.

(c) The term "Defect Value" shall mean the diminution in value of a Mineral
Interest as a result of the Title Defect, which shall be determined, if
applicable, based on the Calculated Value.



(d) The term "Calculated Value" shall mean, with respect to any Mineral
Interest, an amount determined by multiplying the affected net mineral acres
of such Mineral Interest by the following: (Purchase Price divided by 12,554)
divided by 25, which represents the average Purchase Price for each one
percent royalty interest per each net mineral acre, based on all Mineral
Interests being subject to a one-quarter (25%) royalty interest.

Section 3.3 Rights Relating to Title Defects and Royalty Discrepancies.

(a) Buyer shall have a period ending September 16, 2013 (the "Due Diligence
Period") to conduct its due diligence with respect to title and royalties
paid.

(b) Subject to Section 3.3(c) , in the event that Buyer identifies any Title
Defects during the Due Diligence Period, Buyer shall have the right, by
providing written notice to Seller on or before noon, Central Time, on the
last day of the Due Diligence Period, to (i) take assignment of the Asset
affected by the Title Defect and reduce the Purchase Price by the Defect Value
or (ii) exclude the Asset (or portion thereof) affected by the Title Defect
from the purchase and sale contemplated by this Agreement and reduce the
Purchase Price by the Calculated Value of the affected Asset (or portion
thereof), in which case Seller shall retain the Asset. The written notice
provided by Buyer shall identify the Asset affected by the Title Defect,
provide a description of the Title Defect and the amount of Defect Value or
Calculated Value, as applicable, and specify Buyer's election to take
assignment of or exclude the affected Asset. In addition, if during the Due
Diligence Period, Buyer or Seller determines that the aggregate net mineral
acres covered by the Mineral Interests are greater than 12,554, the Purchase
Price shall be increased by the Calculated Value of the net mineral acres in
excess of 12,554.

(c) In addition to the other rights of Buyer or Seller to terminate this
Agreement as set forth in Section 10.1, either Party shall have the right,
exercisable in its sole discretion, to terminate this Agreement by delivering
written notice to other Party on or before 5:00 p.m., Central Time, on the
last day of the Due Diligence Period, if (i) the aggregate Defect Values for
all Title Defects exceed $50,000,000 or (ii) the aggregate Royalty
Discrepancies exceed ten percent (10%) of the total amount of royalty income
for the Measuring Period set forth on Exhibit D. The rights and obligations of
the Parties in the event of such termination shall be as set forth in Section
10.2.

Section 3.4 Conveyance; Special Warranty of Title. Upon Closing, Seller shall
convey and assign to Buyer (or to a designated affiliate of Buyer) good and
marketable title to the Assets, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances
created by through or under Seller, but not otherwise (except for those liens
and encumbrances, if any, that constitute Title Defects for which Buyer has
received a reduction to the Purchase Price and Buyer has elected to take
assignment of the affected Asset as set forth in Section 3.3(b)), pursuant to
one or more mineral deeds and assignments, the form of which is attached
hereto as Exhibit E (collectively, the "Mineral Deed"), containing a special
warranty of title by, through and under Seller but not otherwise.

Section 3.5 Subrogation of Warranties. Seller shall grant to Buyer and/or its
designated affiliate, its successors and assigns, full power and right of
substitution and subrogation in and to all covenants, indemnities and
warranties (including warranties of title) given or made by preceding owners,
vendors or others with respect to the Assets.



ARTICLE 4

PREFERENTIAL RIGHTS AND CONSENTS

Section 4.1 Preferential Rights.

(e) To Seller's knowledge, there are no preferential purchase rights
applicable to the transactions contemplated herein. If, prior to Closing,
either Party identifies a preferential purchase right applicable to the
transactions contemplated hereby, Seller shall send to the holder of such
right a notice in compliance with the contractual provisions applicable to
such right. For purposes of Section 3.3, any preferential purchase right shall
be a Title Defect and the Defect Value shall be an amount equivalent to a loss
of the entirety of Mineral Interest to which the preferential purchase right
applies.

(f) If, prior to Closing, any holder of a preferential purchase right properly
exercises its preferential purchase right, the Asset shall be excluded from
the Assets to be conveyed to Buyer to the extent of the interest affected by
the preferential purchase right, and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by
the Calculated Value of the relevant Asset. Seller shall be entitled to all
proceeds paid in regard to the exercise of the preferential purchase right. If
such holder of such preferential purchase right thereafter fails to consummate
the purchase of the Asset covered by such right within thirty (30) days
following the Closing Date or such later period of time as may be provided for
in the applicable preferential purchase right and such preferential purchase
right is waived, then Seller shall so notify Buyer, and Buyer shall be
obligated to purchase the affected Asset within ten (10) days following
receipt of such notice from Seller, under the terms of this Agreement for a
price equal to such Calculated Value thereof, and, upon receipt of such
portion of the Purchase Price, Seller shall convey the affected Asset to Buyer
in accordance with the terms hereof.

(g) If, prior to Closing, the time for any holder of a preferential purchase
right to exercise that right has not yet expired and the holder has neither
made an election to consummate the purchase of the affected Asset nor waived
the preferential purchase right, that Asset shall be excluded from the Assets
conveyed to Buyer, and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Calculated
Value of the affected Asset. If the holder exercises its preferential purchase
right, Seller shall be entitled to all proceeds paid in regard to the exercise
of the preferential purchase right. If the time to exercise the preferential
purchase right has expired within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date and
the holder has not elected to exercise its preferential purchase right and/or
has waived such preferential purchase right, then Seller shall so notify
Buyer, and Seller shall be obligated to sell, and Buyer shall be obligated to
purchase, the affected Asset on or before ten (10) days following receipt of
such notice from Seller, under terms of this Agreement for a price equal to
such Calculated Value thereof. If the time to exercise the preferential
purchase right has not expired on or before sixty (60) days after the Closing
and the holder has not waived such preferential purchase right, Seller shall
retain such Asset, and Buyer shall no longer have any obligation with respect
to such affected Asset.

Section 4.2 Consents. With respect to any required third party consent to
assignment of the Assets to Buyer, Seller shall send to the holder of each
such right a request for consent to assignment. Prior to Closing, Seller shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all such required consents to
assignment of the Assets, other than consents customarily obtained post-
Closing. Buyer shall



reasonably cooperate with Seller's efforts to obtain such consents. Except for
consents and approvals which are customarily obtained post-Closing (including
certain federal, state or other governmental approvals), if a consent to
assign any Asset has not been obtained as of the Closing Date, then (a) if
Buyer and Seller agree, and the assignment would not be void without consent
or give the counterparty the right of termination, the affected Asset shall be
assigned to Buyer and the respective consents shall be obtained by Buyer post-
Closing and Buyer shall assume the risk of not obtaining such consents
(provided that, after Closing, Seller shall continue to cooperate with Buyer
to obtain such consents) and Buyer shall indemnify Seller from claims arising
from the failure to obtain such consents, or (b) the affected Asset shall be
retained by Seller and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Calculated
Value of such Asset (or other agreed value, if such Asset cannot be valued by
the Calculated Value) and Seller shall for a period of one hundred twenty
(120) days following the Closing Date continue to use commercially reasonable
efforts to procure such consent, with reasonable cooperation from Buyer. If
such consent is obtained during such period, then Seller shall assign such
Asset to Buyer and Buyer shall pay Seller such Calculated Value (or such
agreed value, if applicable) attributed thereto, on or before ten (10) days
following receipt of notice thereof from Seller.

regular and ordinary manner, in accordance with the usual accounting practices
of Seller; (iii) not create or allow the creation of any liens or encumbrances
on any of the Assets; (iv) not terminate or release any of the Contracts and

rights under the Diamondback Leases in the usual, regular and ordinary manner,

(a) Seller hereby conveys a joint right to Buyer to purchase any wells as set
forth in Paragraph 24 of the E.G.L. Lease, Paragraph 24 of the Berry Lease and
any similar provisions included in any other Lease. As a result, each Party is
required to obtain the prior written consent of the other Party to exercise
its right to purchase any wells pursuant to such Paragraphs or any such other
similar provision.

(b) The Parties hereby agree that the rights under Paragraph 24 of the E.G.L.
Lease, Paragraph 24 of the Berry Lease or any similar provision included in
any other Lease cannot be assigned by Seller, including to any assignee of all
or any portion of the surface estate covering the E.G.L. Lease, Berry Lease or
such other Lease. At the Closing, Seller shall provide the written consent of
any surface tenant of the surface estate covered by the E.G.L. Lease, Berry
Lease or any such other Lease with respect to the matters set forth in this
clause (b) and clause (a) above.

(c) The Parties shall, or shall cause their applicable affiliate to, execute
and deliver at the Closing an amendment to the Diamondback Leases to delete
the surface provisions set forth in Paragraph 19 and in Exhibit B of the
Diamondback Leases and to enter into at the Closing a separate agreement, in
recordable form, providing for identical terms regarding the surface estate,
except that the rights and obligations thereunder shall be limited to the
Parties and their respective affiliates and shall not be assignable to any
third party not affiliated with the Parties (the "New Surface Agreement").
Seller agrees that Seller and its affiliates shall continue to interpret and
apply the



surface provisions contained in the New Surface Agreement in the same manner
as those contained in the Diamondback Leases and that any existing waivers or
consents of the surface provisions in the Diamondback Leases shall apply to
the provisions of the New Surface Agreement without any further action by the
Parties. At the Closing, Seller shall, or shall cause its applicable affiliate
to, provide the written consent of any surface tenant to the amendment of the
Diamondback Leases. With respect to any working interest owner, other than
Buyer, that has rights under the Diamondback Leases ("Other Working Interest
Owners"), Seller shall, or shall cause its applicable affiliate to, provide a
waiver of the surface rights, in the same manner as specified in Section
7.2(d), with respect to the rights and interests of such Other Working
Interest Owners (including the provision of a recordable instrument
documenting such waiver) and to provide, after the Closing and upon the
request of Buyer, amendments of the Diamondback Leases with respect to the
Other Working Interest Owners, which amendments will be in the same form as
the amendment executed by Buyer and Seller or their applicable affiliates and
will be recordable in the public records.

(d) Seller hereby agrees that Seller shall, or shall cause its applicable
affiliate to, waive all rights (other than the 1000-foot set-back right along
Loop 250 and State Road 191 north of Section 38, Block 40 Township 1 South)
pursuant to any specific provisions regarding the surface estate that are
contained in any Leases covering the Mineral Interests, including the E.G.L.
Lease and the Berry Lease and any interests of the Other Working Interest
Owners, prior to the assignment of any of its surface estate to which such
provisions apply, with the effect of such waiver that assignee shall not be
entitled to such rights. Seller shall provide Buyer a recordable instrument
documenting such waiver at Closing.

(e) Seller hereby grants to Buyer and/or its affiliates the right to locate up
to five (5) drill pads under the sports complex to be located near Midland,
Texas (referred to as the "Line Drive" sites), together with rights to drill
and use water wells, use existing water wells, and access the surface estate
for locating roads, pipelines, flow lines (including as may be necessary to
transport off-lease production), power lines, pits and other facilities
relating to the drilling and production of such wells. The rights granted
under this clause (e) shall be assignable by Buyer and/or its affiliates and
shall be covenants that run with the land. Exhibit F attached to this
Agreement sets forth a general depiction of the well pads (outlined in red)
and certain related matters. Each well pad shall consist of an eight (8) acre
tract, except for the most easterly well pad, which shall consist of ten (10)
acres.

(f) The Parties acknowledge and agree that the above agreements are made in
consideration of the terms and provisions of this Agreement, including the
Purchase Price payable to Seller, and no further compensation will be payable
by either Party with respect to the above agreements; provided that Seller may
charge Buyer a reasonable charge for water from any water wells on Seller's
surface estate.

(g) Buyer shall have the right to file memoranda of the above referenced
agreements in the public records. In addition, Seller shall, or shall cause
its applicable affiliate to, provide reasonable cooperation to Buyer and its
affiliates, including the execution and delivery of any additional
documentation, as may be necessary to fully accomplish the purposes of the
agreement of the Parties as set forth above.



Section 7.3 Buyer's Financing Obligations.

(a) Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain financing
sufficient to fund the Purchase Price, on terms and conditions acceptable to
Buyer. In the event that Buyer is unable to obtain such financing, Seller
shall sell assign, convey and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase and
acquire from Seller, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
an undivided 22.73% interest in Seller's right, title and interest in and to
the Assets (the "Minimum Assets"), for a purchase price of ONE HUNDRED MILLION
AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($100,000,000) (the "Minimum Purchase Price"). The Parties
may mutually agree that additional Assets are added to the Minimum Assets,
with a corresponding adjustment to the Minimum Purchase Price. All other terms
and provisions of this Agreement shall apply as if the Minimum Purchase Price
was the "Purchase Price" and the Minimum Assets were the "Assets," including
application of the Deposit and the earnings thereon to the Minimum Purchase
Price; provided that the provisions of Section 7.2 shall not apply in the
event that Buyer acquires only the Minimum Assets.

(b) If Buyer breaches its obligation to purchase and acquire the Minimum
Assets as set forth above, Seller shall have the right, unless Seller is in
material breach of this Agreement, to either (i) terminate this Agreement and
retain as liquidated damages, not as penalty, the Deposit, together with any
earnings thereon, or (ii) seek specific performance of the purchase by Buyer
of the Minimum Assets for the Minimum Purchase Price as contemplated in clause
(a), in which case this Agreement shall not terminate and the Deposit shall
remain in the Escrow Account until the earlier to occur of (x) a final non-
appealable order or judgment granting or denying Buyer specific performance of
this Agreement or (y) the mutual agreement of the Parties, at which time the
Deposit shall be released as set forth in this Agreement. Seller's right to
seek specific performance shall only apply to Buyer's breach of this Section
7.3 and not to any other breach by Buyer.

Section 7.4 Reasonable Efforts. Each Party hereto agrees that it will not
voluntarily undertake any course of action inconsistent with the provisions or
intent of this Agreement and will use all commercially reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all
things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

suits, claims, and sanctions of every kind and character (including civil

(f) Seller's Indemnification of Buyer. After the Closing, subject to the
limitations set forth herein, Seller shall defend, indemnify, save and hold
harmless Buyer, its affiliates and Buyer's and such affiliates' respective
officers, directors, shareholders, members, managers, partners, employees,
representatives, attorneys and agents (the "Buyer Indemnified Parties"), from
and against all Losses (except for (x) matters expressly disclosed in filings
recorded in the public records in Midland County, Texas, prior to the
Execution Date, (y) matters of which Buyer has actual knowledge prior to the
Execution Date or (z) matters expressly disclosed in the Leases, other
Contracts, or any title opinions received by Buyer prior to the Closing Date)
which arise from or in connection with: (i) any breach of the representations
or warranties made by Seller in this Agreement to the extent arising from a
claim of a third party that is not a Buyer Indemnified Party; provided,
however, that in the event of a breach of the representations and warranties
set forth in Section 5.9, such indemnification obligation shall also apply to
Losses suffered directly by any Buyer Indemnified Party in addition to any
third party claim; provided, further, for purposes of the interpretation of
the indemnity under this clause (i), Seller's representations and warranties
qualified by "material" or materiality generally shall be deemed to have been
made without the "material" or materiality qualification; (ii) breaches by
Seller of its covenants and agreements under this Agreement; and (iii) any
liabilities or obligations associated with or arising from the Assets prior to
the Effective Time.



(g) Buyer's Indemnification of Seller. After the Closing, subject to the
limitations set forth herein, and except for matters for which Seller is
required to indemnify Buyer Indemnified Parties, Buyer shall defend,
indemnify, save and hold harmless Seller, its affiliates and Seller's and such
affiliates' respective officers, directors, shareholders, members, managers,
partners, employees, representatives, attorneys and agents (the "Seller
Indemnified Parties"), from and against all Losses which arise from or in
connection with (i) any breach of the representations or warranties made by
Buyer in this Agreement to the extent arising from a claim of a third party
that is not a Seller Indemnified Party; (ii) breaches by Buyer of its
covenants and agreements under this Agreement; and (iii) any liabilities or
obligations associated with or arising from the Assets on or after the
Effective Time.

Section 13.2 Third Party Indemnity Procedure. Within twenty (20) days after a
Party seeking indemnification under the terms of this Agreement (the
"Indemnified Party") receives notice of a claim or legal action from a third
party that may result in a Loss for which indemnification may be sought under
Section 13.1 ("Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall give written notice of
such Claim (the "Claim Notice") to the other Party (the "Indemnifying Party"),
together with copies of all pleadings and other information with respect to
such Claim; provided that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice
of a Claim as provided in this Section 13.2 shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its obligations to provide indemnity except to the extent such
failure results in insufficient time being available to permit the
Indemnifying Party to effectively defend against the Claim or otherwise
materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party\'s ability to defend against the
Claim. In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim
Notice to notify the Indemnified Party whether it admits or denies its
liability to defend the Indemnified Party against such claim at the sole cost
and expense of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party is authorized,
prior to and during such thirty (30) day period, to file any motion, answer or
other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its
interests or those of the Indemnifying Party and that is not prejudicial to
the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party admits its liability within
thirty (30) days after receipt of such Claim Notice, the Indemnified Party
shall permit the Indemnifying Party to assume control of such Claim, including
the determination of all appropriate actions, the negotiation of settlements
on behalf of the Indemnified Party and the conduct of litigation through
attorneys of the Indemnifying Party's choice; provided, however, that (i) no
compromise or settlement thereof or consent to any admission or the entry of
any judgment with respect to such Claim may be effected by the Indemnifying
Party without the Indemnified Party's written consent unless the sole relief
provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party
(and no injunctive or other equitable relief is imposed upon the Indemnified
Party) and there is an unconditional provision whereby each plaintiff or
claimant in such Claim releases the Indemnified Party from all liability with
respect thereto and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall have no liability with
respect to any compromise or settlement thereof effected without its written
consent. If the Indemnifying Party assumes control of a claim or legal action,
(i) any expense incurred by the Indemnified Party thereafter for investigation
or defense of the matter shall be borne by the Indemnified Party and (ii) the
Indemnified Party shall give all reasonable information and assistance, other
than pecuniary, that the Indemnifying Party shall deem necessary to the proper
defense of such Claim, legal action or other matter. If the Indemnifying Party
does not admit its liability or admits its liability but fails to diligently
prosecute or settle any Claim to which such Party's indemnification under
Section 13.1



applies, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend against the
Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, with counsel of
the Indemnified Party's choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying
Party to admit its liability and assume the defense of the Claim at any time
prior to settlement or final determination thereof. If the Indemnifying Party
has not yet admitted its liability for a Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
send written notice to the Indemnifying Party of any proposed settlement and
the Indemnifying Party shall have the option for ten (10) days following
receipt of such notice to (i) admit in writing its liability for the Claim and
(ii) if liability is so admitted, reject, in its reasonable judgment, the
proposed settlement. If such a Claim requires immediate action, both the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in good faith to
take appropriate action so as not to jeopardize defense of such Claim or
either Party's position with respect to such Claim.

Section 13.3 Limitation on Claims.

(a) Seller shall not be required to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties
with respect to any claim hereunder for Losses under Section 13.1(b)(i)
unless, and then only to the extent that, the aggregate amount of such Losses
exceeds two percent (2%) of the Purchase Price (the "Claims Deductible"); and

(b) Seller shall not be required to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties to
the extent that the aggregate amount of Losses asserted by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties exceeds twenty percent (20%) of the Purchase Price (the
"Indemnity Cap");

provided, however, that the following indemnification claims shall not be
subject to the Claims Deductible or the Indemnity Cap: (i) claims with respect
to breach by Seller of the representations and warranties in Section 5.1
through Section 5.5, (ii) any claims pursuant to Section 13.1(b)(ii) or (iii),
and (iii) claims with respect to payment of amounts owing by Seller pursuant
to ARTICLE 12; provided that in no event shall Seller's liability to the Buyer
Indemnified Parties hereunder exceed the Purchase Price.

Section 13.4 Survival.

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, the representations and warranties
set forth in this Agreement shall survive the Closing and the delivery and
acceptance of the Mineral Deed, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, until the first anniversary of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.5 and
Section 6.5 shall survive the Closing for the period of the applicable statute
of limitations, plus ninety (90) days.

(b) All claims by a Party for indemnification or damages pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to the breach by the other Party of a representation
and warranty set forth in this Agreement shall be made pursuant to a written
notice or a Claim Notice, as applicable, delivered prior to the expiration of
the relevant representation or warranty, as provided in Section 13.4(a), or
shall be deemed waived, and neither Seller nor Buyer may under any
circumstance make any claim with respect to a representation or warranty after
the expiration thereof, subject to the provisions in Section 13.4(a); provided
that there shall be no termination of any bona fide claim for which a



written notice or a Claim Notice, as applicable, has been given pursuant to
this Agreement with respect to such a representation or warranty on or prior
to its expiration or termination date.

(c) Except for claims with respect to breaches of Seller's representations and
warranties, which are addressed in Section 13.4(b), all other claims by Buyer
for indemnification under this ARTICLE 13 shall be made in writing as provided
herein on or before the first anniversary of the Closing Date (unless a longer
survival period is specified in this Section 13.4) or shall be deemed waived;
provided, however, there shall be no termination of any bona fide claim for
which written notice is given under this Agreement prior to such date, and
provided further, that (i) claims pursuant to ARTICLE 12 with respect to
Taxes, (ii) claims with respect to a breach of any of Seller's covenants
hereunder and (iii) claims with respect to Seller's indemnity obligations set
forth in Section 13.1(b)(iii) may be given at any time prior to the expiration
of the applicable statute of limitations, plus ninety (90) days.

(d) Except as otherwise provided in Section 13.4(a) with respect to breaches
of Buyer's representations and warranties, Buyer's obligation to indemnify
Seller pursuant to (i) Section 13.1(c)(ii) with respect to breaches of Buyer's
covenants shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations, plus ninety (90) days and (ii) Section 13.1(c)(iii) shall survive
the Closing without limitation on duration; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall in no event constitute a waiver of any applicable statute of
limitations.

Section 13.5 Reservation as to Non-Parties. Nothing in this Agreement is
intended to limit or otherwise waive any recourse Buyer or Seller may have
against any person not a Party or affiliate of a Party to this Agreement for
any obligations or liabilities that may be incurred with respect to the
Assets.

Section 13.6 Mutual Releases. Buyer shall be deemed to have released the
Seller Indemnified Parties at Closing from any and all Losses for which Buyer
has agreed to indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties hereunder, and Seller
shall be deemed to have released the Buyer Indemnified Parties at Closing from
any and all Losses for which Seller has agreed to indemnify the Buyer
Indemnified Parties hereunder.
