Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, (a) the Sellers shall sell, transfer, assign, convey and deliver to the Buyer the Purchased Assets free and clear of Liens other than Permitted Liens, and (b) the Buyer shall accept the Purchased Assets and assume the Assumed Obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchased Assets shall not include those assets listed on _Schedule 2.1_ (collectively, the " _Excluded Assets_ "). 

  

 2.2 _Purchase Price_. The total consideration (the " _Purchase Price_ ") to be paid by the Buyer to the Sellers for the sale, transfer, assignment, conveyance and delivery of the Purchased Assets shall be (a) the assumption of the Assumed Obligations and (b) Two Hundred Seventy Million Dollars ($270,000,000.000), payable at the Closing by wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with the wire transfer instructions set forth on _Schedule 2.2_, subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 3.2 and Section 6.4(b).

 2.5 _Allocation of Consideration_. Seller and Buyer agree to cooperate in good faith to determine reasonable allocation of the Purchase Price among the Purchased Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. On or prior to the date ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide to the Sellers Representative Buyers proposed allocation of the Purchase Price. Within thirty (30) days after the receipt of such allocation, the Sellers Representative shall propose to Buyer any changes to such allocation or otherwise shall be deemed to have agreed with such allocation.

In the event that the Seller Representative proposes changes to the allocation within the thirty-day period described above and the parties have not agreed to the allocation of the Purchase Price within sixty (60) days after the Sellers Representatives receipt of Buyers proposed allocation, any disputed items shall be resolved by Marshall and Stevens Incorporated or such other nationally or regionally recognized appraisal firm as agreed by Buyer and the Sellers Representative (" _Appraiser_ "). The determination of the Appraiser shall be final and binding upon both parties and Buyer and Sellers shall each bear one-half of the costs, fees and expenses of the Appraiser relating to the allocation. The allocation of the Purchase Price shall be revised to take into account subsequent adjustments to the Purchase Price in a manner provided by Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.

ARTICLE III 
 INVENTORIES/PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT 

   

 3.1 _Inventory Adjustment_. 

  

 (a) _Inventory Procedures_. The parties hereto acknowledge that the Purchase Price has been based in part on the Purchased Assets including Inventory as of the Effective Time which is adequate for the operation of the Business in the Ordinary Course of Business and with a value of at least Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00) (the " _Inventory Threshold_ "). For purposes of determining the value of the Inventory as of the Effective Time (the " _Inventory Value_ "), the Inventory included in the Purchased Assets shall be measured and valued at the Effective Time in accordance with the following inventory determination and valuation procedures: 

    ##### 

  

     

 (i) Beginning ten (10) days prior to the scheduled Closing Date, an independent inventory inspector (the " _Inspector_ ") (mutually satisfactory to both the Buyer and the Sellers Representative), shall conduct a physical count of the Inventory, such physical count to be brought forward and adjusted through the close of business immediately prior to the Effective Time, using the inventory counting and recognition methodologies and practices set forth in _Schedule 3.1(a)(i)_ (" _Inventory Count_ "). The costs and expenses of the Inspector shall be borne 50% by the Sellers and 50% by the Buyer. In connection with the calculation of the Inventory Value, the Buyer and its representatives, if requested by the Buyer, will have reasonable access to all requisite accounting and other records of Sellers, if necessary. The parties will use their respective Reasonable Efforts to cause the Inspector to complete the Inventory Count by no later than one day prior to Closing. The Inventory Count shall be completed no later than three days after the Closing. If the parties cannot agree on the Inventory Value based upon the Inventory Count within three (3) Business Days after the Closing, the parties shall submit such matter to a mutually agreed upon third party for review and resolution, with the fees and expenses thereof to be borne 50% by the Sellers and 50% by the Buyer; and any determination by such party shall be final and binding upon the parties. 

  

 (ii) Promptly following the determination of the Inventory Value, but in no event later than five Business Days after the Closing Date, the Buyer Parties or the Sellers, as the case may be, shall pay by wire transfer to the other Party immediately available U.S. funds in an amount equal to the excess (in the case of the Buyer Parties) or shortfall (in the case of the Sellers) of the Inventory Value as compared to the Inventory Threshold, if any. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that all or a portion of the Inventory Value is being disputed in good faith, the disputed portion shall not be payable at the time specified in the preceding sentence but instead shall become due and shall be paid within three (3) Business Days following the resolution of such dispute. If not paid when due, interest shall accrue on the amount due at a rate equal to the lesser of (a) 10% per annum or (b) the maximum rate permitted by applicable law. 

  

 (iii) Inventory included in the Inventory Threshold shall be determined in a manner consistent with the presentation of Inventory on the 2007 Annual Financial Statements. 

  

 3.2 _Adjustment to Purchase Price_. All amounts to be paid under this Article III shall be deemed to be adjustments to the Purchase Price.

consistent with business practices prior to the date of this Agreement. For
the avoidance of doubt, (i) there shall be no restrictions on Sellers or
their Affiliates ability to provide Business Services or any other services
outside the Prohibited Area at any time and (ii) nothing herein shall
restrict the Seller Parties or their Affiliates from conducting (A)
nitrogen pumping services or (B) fluid pumping services of 30 barrels per
minute or less. Notwithstanding the foregoing, during the Restricted Period,
the Seller Parties shall not, and shall cause their Affiliates not to, open a
service center within a 100-mile radius of Farmington, New
Mexico; Cottondale, Alabama; Van Buren, Arkansas or the Appalachian Basin out
of which nitrogen pumping services are performed. 

   

 (ii) To the extent that any part of this Section 6.2(a) may be deemed invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, it is intended that such part shall be enforceable to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such part, if more limited in scope, would have been enforceable, and such part shall be deemed to have been so written and the remaining parts shall as written be effective and enforceable in all events. 

  

 (b) The Seller Parties and the Buyer Parties agree and acknowledge that the limitations as to time, geographical area and scope of activity to be restrained as set forth in Section 6.2(a)(i) are reasonable and do not impose any greater restraint than is necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the Buyer Parties. The Seller Parties and the Buyer Parties further agree and acknowledge that, in the event of a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of this Section 6.2, the Buyer Parties shall be entitled to immediate injunctive relief, as any such breach would cause the Buyer Parties irreparable injury for which they would 

   ##### 

  

   

have no adequate remedy at law. Nothing herein shall be construed so as to
prohibit the Buyer Parties from pursuing any other remedies available to them
hereunder, at law or in equity for any such breach or threatened breach. 

   

 (c) The Seller Parties hereby represent to the Buyer Parties that they have read and understand, and agree to be bound by, the terms of this Section 6.2. The Seller Parties acknowledge that the geographic scope and duration of the covenants contained in this Section 6.2 are the result of arms-length bargaining and are fair and reasonable in light of (i) the nature and geographic scope of the operations of the Business throughout the United States and the world, (ii) the Seller Parties level of control over and contact with the Business in all jurisdictions in which it is conducted, (iii) the fact that the Business is conducted throughout the geographic area where competition is restricted by this Agreement, and (iv) the amount of consideration that the Seller Parties are receiving in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the amount of goodwill for which the Buyer is paying. It is the desire and intent of the parties that the provisions of this Agreement be enforced to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements, whether now or hereafter in effect and therefore, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, the parties hereto waive any provision of applicable Legal Requirements that would render any provision of this Section 6.2 invalid or unenforceable. 

   

 (d) At the Closing, the Sellers Representative will deliver to Buyer an acknowledgement letter pursuant to which Wexford Capital LLC (as an Affiliate of the Sellers) acknowledges the existence of and agrees to be bound by and to cause its Affiliates to be bound by the provisions of this Section 6.2. 

   

 6.3 _Further Assurances_. Each party hereto will, at the request of any other party hereto, take such further actions as are reasonably requested and execute any additional documents, instruments or conveyances of any kind which may be reasonably necessary to transfer good and valid title to the Purchased Assets to the Buyer and to further effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 6.4 _Employee and Benefit Matters_. 

  

 (a) The Buyer or an Affiliate of the Buyer agrees to offer to hire all of the Business Employees except those Business Employees identified by Buyer in its sole discretion as _"Excluded Employees"_ on _Schedule 6.4(a)_ ( _"Excluded Employees"_ ) (the _"Designated Employees_ "), at the same base compensation rates paid by Sellers as of the date hereof with such increases thereto between the date hereof and the Closing as may be approved by Buyer (a " _Qualifying Offer_ "). Buyer is not assuming responsibility for any obligations or liabilities with respect to Excluded Employees to whom no offer of employment is made including any obligation for severance or any other benefits. Furthermore, if any Designated Employee to whom an offer of employment is made by Buyer declines an offer of employment made by the Buyer, the Buyer shall have no obligations with respect to such Designated Employee including any obligation for severance or any other benefits, and Sellers shall be responsible for any obligations with respect to such Designated Employee for severance, if applicable, and any other benefits in accordance with the Sellers severance plans, policies or arrangements. Designated Employees who become employed by the Buyer on or within ninety days after the Effective 

   ##### 

  

   

Time are referred to herein as " _Continuing Employees_." Subject to the
provisions of this Section 6.4, the Buyer agrees to be responsible for all
employment-related obligations with respect to Continuing Employees arising
from their employment with Buyer from and after the applicable Hire Date. The
Hire Date for each such Continuing Employee who actually becomes employed by
the Buyer or an Affiliate of the Buyer shall be the Closing Date (effective
as of the Effective Time), except with respect to those individuals to whom
employment offers were made and (i) who are not Actively Employed as of the
Closing Date, in which case the Hire Date shall be the date upon which
such individual is able to and does commence active duty with the Buyer or an
Affiliate of the Buyer, or (ii) with respect to whom the Buyer and the Seller
have agreed will have a later Hire Date. 

   

 (b) On the Effective Time or as soon as administratively feasible thereafter (but in no event later than the time required by any applicable Legal Requirement), Sellers shall pay to each Business Employee all salary and bonus amounts earned as of the Effective Time that has been determined for any prior period but has not been paid. The Buyer agrees to credit Continuing Employees with and be responsible for the payment of all accrued but unpaid paid time off and vacation pay earned with Sellers immediately prior to the Effective Time as reflected on a schedule of Accrued PTO agreed between the Buyer and Seller at or prior to the Closing (the " _Accrued PTO_ ") and the out-of-pocket costs associated therewith shall be the responsibility of the Seller Parties through a reduction of the Purchase Price payable at Closing. The Buyer agrees that the Continuing Employees shall have until December 31, 2009 to use any Accrued PTO, after which time the Buyer shall pay the Continuing Employees for any then unused Accrued PTO. 

   

 (c) Neither the Sellers nor any of their Affiliates has or will, unless acting in accordance with the Buyers prior written consent, (i) solicit, encourage or induce any Designated Employee to reject an employment offer from the Buyer or an Affiliate of the Buyer or solicit, encourage or induce any such employee to continue in the employment of the Sellers or any of their Affiliates from and after the Effective Time and (ii) for the period beginning on the Effective Time and ending on the date that is eighteen months after the Effective Time, solicit, encourage or induce any Continuing Employee to become an employee of any Seller or any of its Affiliates or employ or hire any Continuing Employee; _provided_ , _however_ , that generalized searches for employees, not directed towards Continuing Employees, through the use of advertisements in the media (including the trade media), website job postings, or through the engagement of firms to conduct such generalized searches shall not constitute solicitation, encouragement or inducement for purposes of this Section 6.4(d). 

   

 (d) Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate in any "employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), stock purchase, stock option, severance, fringe benefit, bonus, incentive, deferred compensation, and all other employee benefit plans, agreements, programs, policies or other arrangements (whether or not subject to ERISA) maintained by the Buyer (" _Buyer Plans_ ") for its similarly situated employees; _provided_ , that nothing herein shall obligate Buyer to establish or maintain any particular form of employee benefit plan or to require it to amend any existing benefit plan or policy. 

   

 (e) To the extent permitted under Buyer Plans, the Buyer agrees to (i) credit each Continuing Employee, for purposes of the Buyers vacation policies, for years of service 

    ##### 

  

 

with Sellers, their Affiliates and their predecessors, as the case may be,
determined immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that for 2008 such vacation shall not be less than what they would have been
entitled to under Sellers Plans.. 

   

 (f) On or before each Continuing Employees Hire Date, the Sellers shall (i) take any necessary action to fully vest as of such date the Continuing Employees account balances and other accrued benefits under all employee pension benefit plans (as such term is defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA, including but not limited to, employee pension benefit plans, such as foreign plans, that are not subject to the provisions of ERISA) sponsored, maintained or contributed to by the Sellers that are intended to be qualified under Section 401 of the Code, (ii) take such actions, if any, as may be necessary to provide for the distribution to the Continuing Employee of his or her vested account balance under the Diamondback Energy Services LLC 401(k) Plan and the Sooner Trucking 401(k) Plan (the " _Seller 401(k) Plans_ "), (iii) permit the Continuing Employee to elect on his or her Hire Date (or as soon thereafter as reasonably practicable) a direct rollover of his or her account balance under the Seller 401(k) Plans to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements to a defined contribution plan designated by the Buyer (the " _Buyer 401(k) Plan_ "), and (iv) cause the Seller 401(k) Plans to deliver to the Buyer 401(k) Plan as soon as reasonably practicable after such date the promissory notes and other loan documentation, if any, of the Continuing Employee if he or she has elected such a direct rollover in accordance with the procedures prescribed by Seller (and, if the Continuing Employee makes such an election in accordance with such procedures, then Seller shall not permit the Continuing Employees loan, if any, to be accelerated under the Seller 401(k) Plans). The Buyer 401(k) Plan shall accept the direct rollover of electing Continuing Employees benefits in cash and, if applicable, promissory notes that are not accelerated from the Seller 401(k) Plan. Seller represents, covenants and agrees with respect to the Seller 401(k) Plan, and the Buyer represents, covenants and agrees with respect to the Buyer 401(k) Plan, that, as of each date of a rollover described in this paragraph, such plan will satisfy the requirements of Sections 401(a), (k), and (m) of the Code. 

   

 (g) The Sellers shall provide COBRA continuation coverage (within the meaning of Section 4980B of the Code and the Treasury regulations thereunder) to all individuals who are MandA qualified beneficiaries (within the meaning assigned to such term under QandA-4 of Treasury regulation Section 54.4980B-9) with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for the duration of the period to which such individuals are entitled to such coverage. 

   

 (h) Sellers shall be responsible for any liabilities and obligations arising from the termination by Sellers of employment with Sellers or any of their Affiliates of (i) any Excluded Employee to whom no offer of employment is made by Buyer and (ii) any Designated Employee to whom a Qualifying Offer is made by Buyer but who rejects such offer. 

   

 (i) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Section 6.4, effective as of the Effective Time, (i) Sellers shall (1) cause each Continuing Employee to cease participation in each Plan, (2) make all contributions that are required to be made under each such Plan for periods prior to the Effective Time, and (3) retain all past, present, and future assets, obligations, and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) of Sellers associated with each Continuing Employee under each such Plan, and (ii) the Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, cause each Continuing Employee to be covered immediately following the Effective Time (or, if later, such Continuing Employees Hire Date) under each of the Buyer Plans maintained by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates under the terms and conditions of such Buyer Plan. 

   ##### 

  

    

 (j) Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.4(b), the parties hereby agree that the Buyer is not assuming any Plans, and the Sellers or their Plans, as applicable, shall be solely responsible for, and shall satisfy all such obligations to or for the benefit of each Continuing Employee (and where applicable, the covered dependent of such Continuing Employee), all compensation, bonuses and other payments, and all sick pay, vacation pay, and any other benefits otherwise payable under the Plans, including all hospital, medical, life insurance, disability, supplemental unemployment and all other welfare benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) expenses, benefits, and claims for each Continuing Employee (or where applicable the eligible beneficiaries and dependents of such Continuing Employee), which are accrued or incurred prior to the Effective Time (or if later, applicable Hire Date) and for which the Sellers or one of their Plans, under its respective terms thereof, is obligated. The Buyer and its Affiliates shall be solely responsible for claims of Continuing Employees and their eligible beneficiaries and dependents under welfare benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) that are incurred after the Effective Time (or if later, applicable Hire Date). A medical/dental claim shall be considered incurred on the date when the medical/dental services are rendered or medical/dental supplies are provided; _provided, however_ , that a medical/dental claim with respect to a Continuing Employee (or a covered dependent of a Continuing Employee) who is confined to a hospital or similar facility as of the applicable Hire Date shall be considered incurred before such Hire Date with respect to all medical/dental services rendered and medical/dental supplies provided through and including the date such individual is discharged from the hospital or such facility. Furthermore, any claim for workers compensation by a Business Employee resulting from an incident, injury or matter which occurred prior to the Effective Time shall be made against and be the responsibility of the Sellers. 

   

 (k) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this Section 6.4 are included for the sole benefit of the parties hereto, and that nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall: (i) create any third party beneficiary or other rights (A) in any other Person, including, without limitation, any employees or former employees of Sellers or the Business, any participant in any employee benefit plan maintained by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof, or (B) to continued employment with the Buyer or any of its Affiliates; or (ii) constitute an amendment to any Seller Plan or to any Buyer Plan.

 6.6 _Apportionment of Ad Valorem and Property Taxes_. 

  

 (a) All ad valorem taxes, real property taxes, personal property taxes and similar obligations (" _Property Taxes_ ") attributable to the Purchased Assets, including, without limitation, taxes indirectly payable pursuant to a Scheduled Lease, with respect to a tax period in which the Closing Date occurs shall be apportioned as of the Closing Date between the Sellers and the Buyer determined by prorating such Property Taxes on a daily basis over the entire tax period _._  

   

 (b) The Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid, when due, to the appropriate taxing authorities all Property Taxes relating to the Purchased Assets for the tax period during which the Closing Date occurs. To the extent Sellers receive invoices for Property Taxes following the Closing which are payable by Buyer, Sellers shall forward such invoices promptly to Buyer. The Buyer shall send to Sellers Representative a statement that apportions the Property Taxes between the Sellers and the Buyer based upon Property Taxes actually invoiced and paid to the taxing authorities by the Buyer for the tax year which includes the Closing Date, with the Sellers being responsible for the Property Taxes attributable to the period prior to and including the Closing Date. This statement shall be accompanied by proof of the Buyers actual payment of such Property Taxes for such tax year. Within 30 days of receipt of such statement and proof of payment, the Sellers shall reimburse the Buyer for their pro-rated portion of such Property Taxes. 

   

 6.7 _Apportionment of Certain Post-Closing Payments_. 

  

 (a) If, after the Effective Time, the Buyer shall pay any amounts which constitute an Excluded Liability, then following such payment, the Buyer shall send to the Sellers Representative a statement that identifies the Excluded Liability paid by the Buyer, accompanied by evidence of such payment and such other documentation related thereto as the Sellers Representative may reasonably request. Within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of such statement and related documentation, the Sellers shall either (i) cause the Sellers Representative to provide written notice to the Buyer of any objections to such statement and/or documentation or (ii) reimburse the Buyer for its pro-rated portion of such obligations as shown on such statement. 

   

 (b) If, after the Effective Time, Parent, Buyer or any of their Affiliates shall receive any amounts constituting Excluded Assets, including but not limited to accounts receivables, or any documents, correspondence or other communications regarding Excluded Liabilities, such receiving party shall deliver such amounts, documents, correspondence or other communications to the Sellers Representative promptly and, in any event, within five (5) Business Days of its receipt thereof.

    ##### 

  

  

 6.8 _Non-Consent Contracts_. If the Sellers fail to obtain any consent, approval or waiver listed on _Schedule 4.4_ (or if any such consent, approval or waiver is otherwise not in full force and effect) as of the Closing, then, in the case of each Contract as to which such consent, approval or waiver was not obtained (or otherwise is not in full force and effect) (the " _Non-Consent Contracts_ "), notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither this Agreement, nor the Assignment and Assumption Agreements, nor any other document related to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall constitute a sale, assignment, assumption, transfer, conveyance or delivery or an attempted sale, assignment, assumption, transfer, conveyance or delivery of the Non-Consent Contracts, and, following the Closing, the parties shall cooperate with each other to obtain the consent, approval or waiver relating to each Non-Consent Contract. Pending the obtaining of such consent, approval or waiver relating to any Non-Consent Contract, the parties shall cooperate with each other in any reasonable and lawful arrangements designed to provide to the Buyer the benefits and burdens of use of each Non-Consent Contract for its term (or any right, benefit, obligation or duty arising thereunder, including the enforcement for the benefit of the Buyer of any and all rights of the Seller or its Affiliates against a third party thereunder). After the consent, approval or waiver for the sale, assignment, assumption, transfer, conveyance and delivery of a Non-Consent Contract is obtained, the Seller shall promptly assign, transfer, convey and deliver such Non-Consent Contract to the Buyer, and the Buyer shall assume the obligations under such Non-Consent Contract assigned to the Buyer from and after the date of assignment to the Buyer pursuant to a separate assignment and assumption agreement substantially similar in terms to those of the Assignment and Assumption Agreements (which separate agreement the parties shall prepare, execute and deliver in good faith at the time of such transfer, all at no additional cost to the Buyer). 

  

 6.9 _Books and Records_. The Sellers acknowledge and agree that, from and after the Closing, the Buyer will be entitled to originals or copies of all Books and Records related to the Business and the Purchased Assets. The Sellers will, at the Effective Time, deliver to the Buyer such originals or copies of all Books and Records, which delivery may include delivery-in-place at the Scheduled Real Property. 

  

 6.10 _Certain Information_. 

  

 (a) After the Closing, upon reasonable written notice, the Buyer Parties, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the other and their respective directors, officers, employees, consultants, agents, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice, to such information (including records pertinent to the Purchased Assets, the Excluded Assets, the Assumed Obligations or the Excluded Liabilities), personnel and properties together with assistance relating to the Purchased Assets, the Excluded Assets, the Assumed Obligations and the Excluded Liabilities as is reasonably necessary for verification of calculations delivered by either party pursuant to Sections 6.6 or 6.7, financial reporting purposes, the preparation by the Sellers and their auditors of audited statements for the Business (including for historical periods), the preparation and filing of any returns, reports or forms or the defense of, or response required under, or pursuant to, any lawsuit, action proceeding, audit or investigation by a third party which is not related to any of the Sellers.

    ##### 

  

 

entitled under this Agreement. The Buyer Parties and the Sellers shall, and
shall cause their Affiliates to, retain after the Closing Date all such
records pertinent to the Purchased Assets, the Excluded Assets, the Assumed

Person immediately after the Closing until the later to occur of (i) the
expiration of three years with respect to the subject matter described in
such records or (ii) the final resolution of any outstanding claim or
proceeding with respect to the subject matter described in such records.
After the end of such period, before disposing of any such records, the
applicable party shall give notice to such effect to the other, and shall
give the other, at the others cost and expense, a reasonable opportunity to
remove and retain all or any part of such records as the other may select. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything else set forth herein to the contrary, in no event shall Sellers or the Buyer Parties, or any of their respective Affiliates, be obligated under this Agreement to disclose to any other party or parties (i) any information the disclosure of which is restricted by contract or applicable law except in strict compliance with the applicable contract or law, (ii) any information pertaining to the litigation proceedings as to which the attorney-client privilege may be applicable, or (ii) any personnel files, workers compensation files, employee medical files, other employee Books and Records, affirmative action plans or related Books and Records, the transfer of which is restricted by law except as required by valid subpoena or court order and then only in strict compliance with applicable law, subpoena or court order. If privileged and/or attorney work product documents or information, including communications between any party hereto or its Affiliates and any of their respective counsel, are disclosed to any other party pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, then the Sellers and the Buyer Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that (i) such disclosure is inadvertent, (ii) such disclosure will not constitute a waiver, in whole or in part, of any privilege or work product, and (iii) the receiving party will promptly return to the disclosing party all copies of such documents or information in its possession or in the possession of its Affiliates or Representatives. Additionally, the Sellers and the Buyer Parties agree that they and their Affiliates shall not waive the attorney-client, work product, or like privilege of the other party with respect to any of such documents or information, without the other partys prior written consent. 

   

 6.11 _Publicity_. Except as required by a court of competent jurisdiction or applicable Legal Requirements, including applicable securities laws and regulations including in connection with any proposed financing or offering by any party, none of the parties hereto nor any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives shall, without the prior consent of the other parties (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), make any statement or any public announcement or press release with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 6.12 _Regulatory Filings_. From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, each of the Buyer Parties and the Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to (a) make or cause to be made the filings required of such party or any of its Affiliates under any applicable Legal Requirements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay any fees due of it in connection with such filings, as promptly as is reasonably practicable, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof, (b) cooperate with the other party and furnish all information in such partys possession that is necessary in connection with such other partys filings, (c) use Reasonable Efforts to cause the expiration of the notice or waiting

Agreement, and (h) use Reasonable Efforts to contest and resist any action or
proceeding instituted (or threatened in writing to be instituted) by any

Agreement as violative of any applicable Legal Requirement. If a party
intends to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority with
respect to such filings, it shall give the other party reasonable prior
notice of, and an opportunity to participate in, such meeting. 

  

 6.13 _Access_. The Sellers shall afford to the Buyer and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice during the period prior to the Closing to the properties, books, contracts and records relating to the Purchased Assets and appropriate officers and employees of the Sellers and during such period shall furnish promptly to the Buyer and its Representatives any information concerning the Purchased Assets as the Buyer may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Sellers are under no obligation to disclose to the Buyer or its Representatives (i) any information the disclosure of which is restricted by contract or applicable law except in strict compliance with the applicable contract or law, (ii) any information as to which the attorney-client privilege may be applicable and (iii) personnel files, workers compensation files, employee medical files (including employee "protected health information" (as defined in the HIPPA Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information, 45 CFR Part 146)) and other employee Books and Records and affirmative action plans and related Books and Records.

Access pursuant to this Section 6.13 shall not include the Buyers access for the purpose of conducting any environmental site assessment or sampling of any media whatsoever other than the Phase I Reports referenced in Section 6.20. The Buyer agrees to review, and cause its Representatives to review, all information provided hereunder in a manner that does not interfere unreasonably with the Business and the prompt discharge by the Sellers employees of their duties. 

  

 6.14 _Third-Party Approvals; Cooperation_. 

  

 (a) The Buyer Parties and the Sellers shall (and shall each cause their respective Affiliates to) use Reasonable Efforts to obtain all material consents, approvals and 

    ##### 

  

 

Permits of third parties that any of the Buyer Parties, the Sellers or their
respective Affiliates are required to obtain in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 (b) The Sellers shall use Reasonable Efforts to provide, and shall use Reasonable Efforts to cause their Affiliates to provide, and shall use their respective Reasonable Efforts to cause the respective Representatives of the Sellers to provide to the Buyer Parties its or their reasonable cooperation in connection with the Buyers financing for the transactions contemplated hereby, upon the Buyers request with reasonable prior notice. In the event that the Buyer Parties request Seller Party support with respect to participation in a roadshow, communication with rating agencies, communication with investors or similar such support, the Buyer Parties shall first enter into an indemnification agreement with the Seller Parties on customary terms reasonably satisfactory to the Seller Parties. All out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Sellers in connection with the performance by the Sellers of their obligations pursuant to this Section 6.14(b) shall be paid by the Buyer Parties. Any actions by or on behalf of the Sellers pursuant to this Section 6.14(b) shall be at the sole risk of the Buyer Parties, and the Buyer Parties may not claim, allege or otherwise assert that any acts or omissions by a Seller or any of its Affiliates or Representatives under this Section 6.14(b) were responsible, directly or indirectly, for any failure by the Buyer Parties to obtain any Buyer Party financing. 

   

 (c) Each of the Sellers, on the one hand, and the Buyer Parties, on the other hand, shall use its Reasonable Efforts to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order, ruling or injunction that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing and, if any Governmental Authority shall have issued any decree, order, ruling or injunction, or taken any other action that would have the effect of restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting, delaying or preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Sellers and the Buyer Parties shall use its Reasonable Efforts to have such decree, order, ruling or injunction or other action declared ineffective as soon as practicable. 

   

 (d) Prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall assist the Buyer in and use Reasonable Efforts to facilitate the preparation of financial statements of the Sellers for historical periods to the extent necessary or required in connection with Buyers efforts to obtain the Third Party Financing, which assistance shall include providing access to information relating to the Business in the possession of or available to the Sellers, providing management letters to auditors with respect to historical periods and discussing the historical business and operations of the Sellers with the Buyer and its auditors and other Representatives and the Sellers auditors, in each case during regular business hours and upon reasonable notice.

 6.15 _No Additional Representations_. Each Buyer Party acknowledges and agrees that neither the Sellers nor any of their Representatives has made any representation or warranty, express or implied, with respect to the Business or the Purchased Assets or Assumed Obligations or the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the Business, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Obligations, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or in the other Transaction Documents. 

   ##### 

  

  

 6.16 _Supplemental Disclosure_. From time to time after the date hereof but prior to two (2) days preceding the Closing Date, the Sellers shall have the right to supplement or amend (by written notice to the Buyer Parties) the Seller Disclosure Schedule with respect to any matter that occurs after the date hereof in the Ordinary Course of Business which, if existing at or occurring prior to the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in the Seller Disclosure Schedule or which is necessary to update any information in the Seller Disclosure Schedule which has been rendered materially inaccurate thereby. For the purpose of determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.1 or the existence of a termination right pursuant to Section 9.1(b), no supplement or amendment to the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall (a) eliminate the Buyers right, if any, to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(b) or (b) constitute a cure pursuant to Section 9.1(b). Any supplement to the Disclosure Schedule permitted by this Section 6.16 shall not include matters which occurred prior to the date of this Agreement but were not included in the initial Disclosure Schedule delivered by Sellers at signing. After the Closing, the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed for the purposes of Article VI hereof, to include and reflect such supplements and amendments made in accordance with this Section 6.16 prior to the Closing Date. 

  

 6.17 _Insurance_. Each Buyer Party acknowledges and agrees that effective upon the Closing, all insurance policies carried by or for the benefit of the Sellers or any of their Affiliates with respect to the Purchased Assets and the operation, activities and liabilities of the Business (the " _Seller Insurance Policies_ ") may be terminated or modified by Sellers or deemed by the language of such policies to exclude coverage of the Purchased Assets and the activities, liabilities and operations of the Business. Following the Closing, the parties shall cooperate (at their own respective cost and expense) in submitting any claims under any of the Seller Insurance Policies arising out of occurrences prior to the Closing. Each Buyer Party acknowledges that the Sellers shall not have any responsibility for obtaining or maintaining any insurance or bearing any liability with respect to the Purchased Assets relating to or directly or indirectly arising out of events occurring subsequent to the Closing.

The Buyer Parties hereby covenant: (a) to use Reasonable Efforts to obtain the Third Party Financing as soon as practicable following closing taking into consideration prevailing market conditions; and (b) to keep Sellers reasonably informed of Buyer Parties efforts to obtain the Third Party Financing. 

   

 (b) Nothing in this Section 6.18 shall supersede the provisions of Section 9.2(b).

   ##### 

  

    

Capital LLC has direct or indirect ownership interest), provided that for
purposes hereof Confidential Information shall not include information which
(i) was not, directly or indirectly, obtained from a Seller Party but was
obtained by the Affiliate from a third party who, to the knowledge of such
recipient, had no duty of confidentiality to the Sellers or was independently
developed without use of any Confidential Information relating to the
Business or Purchased Assets or (ii) is generally known in the industry or
becomes publicly available (other than by disclosure in breach of this
Section 6.19), or as required by applicable Legal Requirements, including
applicable securities laws and regulations; _provided_ that, where possible,
if required to make disclosures under applicable Legal Requirements, the
Sellers will to the extent reasonably practicable provide written notice and
an opportunity to the Buyer to request, at its sole cost and expense, that
such disclosures receive confidential treatment. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 6.19 shall prohibit any
Affiliate of a Seller Party from using any information which does not
constitute Confidential Information which is in its possession as of the date
of this Agreement in the ordinary course of its business in a manner
consistent with existing or past practices.

 (a) Between the signing and the Closing, the Seller Parties shall permit the Buyer Parties to have access to the Scheduled Owned Real Property and shall use Reasonable Efforts to assist the Buyer Parties in obtaining access to the Real Property subject to the Scheduled Leases, in each case for the purpose of conducting at the Buyer Parties sole cost and expense a Phase I environmental site assessment (including a Phase I environmental site assessment as developed by the American Society of Testing and Materials and designated as E1527-05 and "All Appropriate Inquiry" standard assessment as developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and codified in 40 C.F.R. Part 312, or analogous assessment); _provided_ , _however_ , that such Phase I access shall not include sampling of any media whatsoever, intrusive or otherwise, without the prior approval of the Sellers Representative, and provided further that the Buyer Parties shall provide the Sellers Representative with copies of any resulting reports, summary charts or audits as promptly as practicable following any Buyer Partys receipt thereof (but, in any event, prior to Closing), whether in the form of final or draft documentation. The Buyer Parties shall use Reasonable Efforts to complete the Phase I environmental site assessments as promptly as practicable, but, in any event, no later than 30 days following the execution of this Agreement. Any consultants selected by the Buyer Parties to conduct the Phase I environmental site assessments shall be reasonably acceptable to the Sellers Representative. 

   

 (b) In the event that a Phase I Report reflects a potential environmental matter which would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely impair Buyers ability to conduct the Business in substantially the same manner as conducted prior to the Effective Time, then Buyer will be entitled to terminate this Agreement by providing written notice of termination to the Sellers Representative unless (i) Sellers remedy the environmental matter prior to Closing or (ii) Sellers and Buyer mutually agree to a plan of action pursuant to which Sellers will remedy the environmental matter following the Closing. If applicable, Sellers and Buyer agree to use their respective reasonable, good faith efforts to reach a mutually acceptable plan of action. 

    ##### 

  

  

 6.21 _Change of Corporate Name_. Promptly after the Closing Date, Sellers shall take such action as may be necessary to cause each applicable Seller to change its corporate name so that it does not contain the words "Sooner," "Packers" or "Total." The Sellers Representative shall provide Buyer with evidence of such change in corporate names of the applicable Sellers required by this Section 6.21 within ten (10) Business Days after such change has been made. Buyers acknowledge that they are acquiring no right, title or interest in and to the name "Diamondback," provided that nothing herein will prohibit Buyer from displaying the Diamondback name on rolling stock, signage and other assets during the transition period following the Closing during which Buyer is removing references to "Diamondback" from such assets, which period shall not extend beyond 120 days after the Effective Time.

 10.2 _Indemnities of the Buyer_. 

  

 (a) _The Buyer Indemnified Liabilities_. Subject to the provisions of this Article X, from and after the Closing, the Buyer and the Parent, jointly and severally, shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Sellers, the Sellers Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, consultants and representatives (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") from, against and in respect of any Damages or Claims that arise out of, relate to or result from any of the following described matters (herein collectively referred to as the " _Buyer Indemnified Liabilities_ "): (i) any representation or warranty made by the Buyer Parties in this Agreement or in any certificate related to such representations and warranties not having been true and correct; (ii) any breach by any Buyer Party of any covenant or obligation of such Buyer Party in this Agreement; and (iii) any Assumed Obligation.

 (i) _Cap_. Sellers aggregate liability for money Damages under Section 10.1(a)(i) will not exceed Forty Million Dollars ($40,000,000) (the " _Cap_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the limitation contemplated hereby will not be applicable with respect to (A) breaches of Sections 4.2 (Power), 4.3 (Authority; Enforceability), 4.13 (Brokers Fees) and 4.16 (Taxes) and breaches of representations and warranties with respect to title to the Purchased Assets (including title representations set forth in Sections 4.8, 4.9, 4.12 and 4.14) or (B) instances of fraud by any Seller Party. 

  

 (ii) _Basket_. Sellers will have no liability for money Damages pursuant to Section 10.1(a)(i) (other than breaches of Sections 4.2 (Power), 4.3 (Authority; Enforceability), 4.13 (Brokers Fees) and 4.16 (Taxes) and breach of representations and warranties with respect to title to the Purchased Assets (including title representations set forth in Sections 4.8, 4.9, 4.12 and 4.14)), unless and until the aggregate Damages claimed under Section 10.1(a)(i) exceeds One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,500,000.00) (the " _Deductible_ ") and then only for the excess amount. 

  

 (b) Any Claims the Seller Indemnified Parties make under this Article X will be limited as follows: 

   

 (i) _Cap_. Parent and the Buyers collective aggregate liability for money Damages under Section 10.2(a)(i) will not exceed $40,000,000; _provided_ , _however_ , that the limitation contemplated hereby will not be applicable with respect to (A) breaches of Section 5.2 (Power), 5.3 (Authority; Enforceability) and 5.5 (Brokers Fees) or (B) instances of fraud by Parent or the Buyer.

Parent and the Buyer will have no liability for money Damages pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(i) (other than for breaches of Sections 5.2 (Power), 5.3 (Authority; Enforceability) and 5.5 (Brokers Fees)) unless and until the aggregate Damages claimed under Section 10.2(a)(i) exceeds $1,500,000 and then only for the excess amount. 

  

 (c) _Insurance_. The amount of Damages required to be paid will be reduced to the extent of any amounts an Indemnified Party actually receives pursuant to the terms of the insurance policies (if any) covering such Claim. 

    ##### 

  

  

 (d) _No Double Materiality_. The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the phrases "material," "materially," "material adverse effect," "in all material respects" and all derivations thereof as used in Article IV shall be applicable and recognized for purposes of reaching the Closing and satisfaction of the condition in Section 8.1(b) but that from and after the Closing such sections shall be read without regard to such phrases or materiality qualifiers and liability of Diamondback and the Sellers, under Article X for a breach of any such representations shall be determined as though such materiality qualifiers were not included in the original language. 

   

 10.4 _Claim Procedures_. Each party that desires to make a Claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article X (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall provide notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") thereof in writing to the Buyer (if the Indemnified Party is a Seller Indemnified Party) or to the Sellers Representative (if the Indemnified Party is a Buyer Indemnified Party) (" _Indemnifying Party_ "), specifying the nature and basis for such claim and the amount thereof, to the extent known, and a copy of all papers served with respect to such claim (if any). For purposes of this Section 10.4, receipt by a party of written notice of any Third-Party Claim which gives rise to a Claim on behalf of such party shall require prompt delivery of a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party of the receipt of such Third-Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that an Indemnified Partys failure to send or delay in sending a Claim Notice shall not relieve an Indemnifying Party from liability hereunder with respect to such Claim except to the extent and only to the extent the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure or delay. 

  

 10.5 _Calculation, Timing, Manner and Characterization of Indemnification Payments_. 

  

 (a) Within twenty (20) days after delivery of a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party will deliver to the Indemnified Party a response (a " _Response_ "), in which the Indemnifying Party will: (i) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the amount specified in the Claim Notice (the " _Claimed Amount_ ") (in which case the Response will be accompanied by a payment by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of the Claimed Amount, by check or by wire transfer), (ii) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive a portion of the Claimed Amount (the " _Agreed Amount_ ") (in which case the Response will be accompanied by a payment by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of the Agreed Amount, by check or by wire transfer) or (iii) dispute that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all or any of the Claimed Amount (a " _Claim Dispute_ "). During the 30-day period following the delivery of a Response that reflects a Dispute, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party will use good faith efforts to resolve the Dispute. If the Dispute is not resolved within such 30-day period, such Claim Dispute will be resolved in accordance with Section 11.4. 

   

 (b) Any indemnity payments made hereunder shall be treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, unless otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirements. 

   

 10.6 _Recovery_. If Damages suffered by any Indemnified Party are recoverable under more than one provision of this Agreement and even though an Indemnified Party is permitted to rely on each provision of Article X independently, such Indemnified Party shall only be 

   ##### 

  

    

permitted to recover with respect to any particular Damages suffered by it
one time as it is the parties intent that once any particular Damages have
been recovered by a particular Indemnified Party under one provision, such
Damages no longer exist with respect to such Indemnified Party and,
therefore, recovery by such particular Indemnified Party for such same
Damages under another provision would constitute an unintended and prohibited
"double" recovery. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to seek recovery under such provisions of this Agreement
that maximizes its recovery ( _e.g._ , if particular Damages would be time
barred if a Claim were made under one provision but would not be time barred
if made under another provision or if Damages would not be recoverable under
Section 10.1(a)(i) as a result of a limitation of a representation or
warranty to the Knowledge of the Sellers but would be recoverable under the
indemnification included in Section 10.1(a)(iii), then the Indemnified Party
may seek recovery under the provision that is not time barred or not subject
to the knowledge qualification). 

  

 10.7 _Control of Third-Party Claims_. 

  

 (a) In the event of the assertion of any Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party, at its option, may assume (with legal counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party) at its sole cost and expense the defense of such Third-Party Claim if it acknowledges to the Indemnified Party in writing its obligations to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to all elements of such Third-Party Claim and in such event the Indemnifying Party may assert any defense of the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ that the Indemnified Party shall have the right at its own expense to participate jointly with the Indemnifying Party in the defense of any such Third-Party Claim. Counsel representing both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party must acknowledge in writing its obligation to act as counsel for all parties being represented and must acknowledge and respect separate attorney-client privileges with respect to each party represented. If the Indemnifying Party elects to undertake the defense of any Third-Party Claim hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the defense or settlement of the Third-Party Claim, including providing access to information, making documents available for inspection and copying, and making employees available for interviews, depositions and trial. The Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to settle any Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

   

 (b) If the Indemnifying Party, by the 30th day after receipt of a Claim Notice with respect to any Third-Party Claim (or, if earlier, by the tenth day preceding the day on which an answer or other pleading must be served in order to prevent judgment by default in favor of the person asserting such Third-Party Claim; _provided_ that the Claim Notice was provided with sufficient time to make compliance with this ten-day period reasonably possible) does not assume actively and in good faith the defense of any such Third-Party Claim or action resulting therefrom, the Indemnified Party may, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, defend against such claim or litigation, after giving notice of the same to the Indemnifying Party, on such terms as the Indemnified Party may deem appropriate, and the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in (but not control) the defense of such action, with its counsel and at its own expense. The Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim for which it is entitled to indemnification hereunder, without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

    ##### 

  

  

 10.8 _Exclusivity of Indemnification Provision_. Except in the case of fraud, the indemnities provided for in this Article X shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties by contract, statute or otherwise, at law or equity, for any claim, cause of action or other matter arising from any breach by the Buyer Parties or Sellers, as applicable, of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements under this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

ARTICLE XI 
 MISCELLANEOUS 

   

 11.1 _Assignment_. 

  

 (a) This Agreement and the rights hereunder may not be assigned by any party without the prior written consent of the other party; _provided_ , _however_ , that any party shall be permitted to collaterally assign without the other partys consent this Agreement and its rights herein and in the other Transaction Documents to such assigning partys bona fide unaffiliated lenders. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers acknowledge that it is the intent of the Buyer to cause record title to different types of assets included in the Purchased Assets to be held by various Affiliates of the Buyer from and after the Closing. Accordingly, the Sellers acknowledge and agree that the Purchased Assets and the associated rights under this Agreement may be assigned by the Buyer to the Buyers designated Affiliates upon the execution and delivery of a written instrument reasonably satisfactory to the Sellers pursuant to which such assignee expressly assumes any or all of the obligations of the Buyer hereunder and agrees to be bound by the terms hereof;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent will nonetheless remain responsible for all of the obligations of the Buyer and any such assignee hereunder. Any purported assignment in breach of this Section 11.1 shall be null and void. 

   

 (c) Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. 

   

 11.2 _Notices_. Unless otherwise provided herein, any notice, request, consent, instruction or other document to be given hereunder by any party hereto to another party hereto shall be in writing and will be deemed given (a) when received if delivered personally or by courier; or (b) on the date receipt is acknowledged if delivered by certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested or (c) one day after transmission if sent by facsimile transmission with confirmation of transmission, as follows:
