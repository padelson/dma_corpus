(vi) _Cancellation of Treasury Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger, any Company Capital Stock that is owned by the Company and not

(vii) _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement,
Parent, the Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall have the right
to deduct and withhold any Taxes as it is required to deduct and withhold
under applicable law from any payments to be made hereunder; _provided_ that,
except with respect to payments in the nature of compensation to be made to
employees or former employees, Parent shall consult with the Equityholders
Representative in good faith prior to withholding any amounts payable to any
Equityholder hereunder. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid
over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been delivered and
paid to the applicable Equityholder or any other recipient of payment in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

(viii) _Treatment of Amounts in Escrow_. Each Equityholder shall be deemed to
have contributed an amount equal to the amount of such Equityholders Pro
Rata Share of (A) the Escrow Amount to the Escrow Fund and (B) the Reserve
Amount to the Reserve Account (in each case, as set forth in the Distribution
Waterfall).

 

(g) _Paying Agent_.

(i) Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company, a New York corporation, shall
act as exchange and paying agent, registrar and transfer agent (in such
capacity, the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging
certificates representing, immediately prior to the Effective Time, Company
Capital Stock (" _Certificates_ ") for the aggregate Series AA Per Share
Merger Consideration or Common Per Share Merger Consideration, as applicable.
At the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall deposit, or Parent or
Merger Sub shall otherwise take all steps necessary to cause to be deposited,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in trust with the Paying
Agent for the benefit of the Stockholders, cash in an aggregate amount equal
to the Payment Fund, which deposit shall be used solely and exclusively for
purposes of paying the Series AA Per Share Merger Consideration and Common Per
Share Merger Consideration, as applicable, and shall not be used to satisfy
any other obligations of the Surviving Corporation. The Paying Agent shall,
pursuant to instructions provided by Parent and the Company, make the payments
provided for in this _Section 1(g)_ out of the Payment Fund (it
being understood that any and all interest earned on funds made available to
the Paying Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall remain the property of the
Surviving Corporation).

 



-5- (ii) No later than two (2) Business Days following the Effective Time, the
Paying Agent shall provide to each record holder of Certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Company Capital Stock (A)
a notice of the effectiveness of the Merger, (B) a letter of transmittal,
substantially in the form of  _Exhibit C_ attached hereto (" _Transmittal
Letter_ "), which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Paying Agent, (C) a Joinder Agreement, and (D)
instructions for use in surrendering such Certificates and receiving the
Series AA Per Share Merger Consideration or Common Per Share Merger
Consideration, as applicable, in respect thereof. In addition, the form of
Transmittal Letter will require the delivering holder to represent that (x)
such delivering holder has good title to such Certificate(s), (y) such
delivering holder has all necessary power and authority to execute
and deliver such Transmittal Letter and to perform its obligations in
connection therewith, and (z) such delivering holder agrees to the terms of
this Agreement.

 

(iii) Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with such
Transmittal Letter and a Joinder Agreement, in each case duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive, promptly after such surrender, in
exchange therefor, (A) cash in an amount equal to the Closing Series AA Per
Share Merger Consideration or Closing Common Per Share Merger Consideration,
which amount(s) shall be paid by the Paying Agent by check or wire transfer in
accordance with the instructions provided by such holder and (B) the right to
receive such holders Pro Rata Share of (x) any amounts released from the
Escrow Fund and/or the Reserve Account and (y) any positive Merger
Consideration Adjustment Amount. No interest or dividends will be paid or
accrued on the consideration payable upon the surrender or transfer of any
Certificate. If the consideration provided for herein is to be delivered in
the name of a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate
surrendered, it shall be a condition of such delivery that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such delivery shall pay any transfer
or other Taxes required by reason of such delivery to a Person other than
the registered holder of the Certificate, or that such Person shall establish
to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid
or is not applicable. Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of
this  _Section 1(g)_, each Certificate (other than those representing
Company Capital Stock to be canceled pursuant to _Section 1(f)(vi)_) shall
represent, for all purposes, only the right to receive the Series AA Per Share
Merger Consideration or Common Per Share Merger Consideration, as applicable,
in respect of the Company Capital Stock formerly evidenced by such Certificate
(which includes any portion of the Merger Consideration that is released from
the Escrow Fund and/or the Reserve Account), without any interest or
dividends thereon.

(iv) The consideration issued upon the surrender of Certificates in
accordance with this Agreement shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Capital Stock formerly
represented thereby. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of any Company Capital
Stock that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



-6- (v) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to a holder
of Certificates or any other Person in respect of any cash delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered or
transferred by the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date (or immediately
prior to such earlier date on which any Series AA Per Share Merger
Consideration or Common Per Share Merger Consideration, as applicable,
dividends (whether in cash, stock or property) or other distributions with
respect to Company Capital Stock in respect of such Certificate would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any foreign, federal, state or
local governments or governmental agency), any such shares, cash, dividends or
distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(vi) In the event any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit (in form and substance acceptable to the Surviving
Corporation) of that fact by the Person (who shall be the record owner of such
Certificate) claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the providing of an indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(h) _Treatment of Options and Non-Participating Options_.

 

(i) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Option_ " means each
outstanding unexercised option or similar entitlement (including convertible
notes or other similar debt instruments) to purchase shares of Company Capital
Stock, whether or not then vested or fully exercisable, granted prior to
January 1, 2016 to any current or former employee or director of the Company
or any other Person (each such Person, an " _Optionholder_ " and collectively,
the " _Optionholders_ "), whether under any stock option plan or otherwise
(collectively, the " _Stock Plans_ ").

 

(ii) On and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company
shall have taken all actions necessary so that at the Effective Time, (A)
each Option held by an Optionholder immediately before the Effective Time
shall become fully vested, (B) all Stock Plans and all Options shall be
terminated and cancelled, in each case in accordance with and pursuant to the
terms of the Stock Plans or other agreements under which such Options were
granted to cause the Stock Plans to be terminated, including but not limited
to obtaining any necessary consents from Optionholders, and (C) upon such
cancellation, each Optionholder who holds an In-the-Money Option shall be
entitled to receive from the Company, in settlement thereof, subject to
_Section 1(h)(vi)_, the Option Per Share Merger Consideration in the form of
(1) cash in an amount equal to the Closing Option Per Share Merger
Consideration and (2) the right to receive cash in an amount equal to such
Optionholders Pro Rata Share of (x) any amounts released from the Escrow Fund
and/or the Reserve Account and (y) any positive Merger Consideration
Adjustment Amount.

(iii) The Option Per Share Merger Consideration, which shall in all events be
paid in a manner that is exempt from or compliant with Section 409A of the
Code, shall be subject to all applicable withholding of Taxes and shall be
paid by the Surviving Corporation to the applicable Optionholders, without
interest, upon receipt (on or after Closing) of a duly executed consent and
agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ (an "
_Option Cancellation Agreement_ ") with respect to each In-the-Money Option.

 



-7- (iv) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Non-Participating Option_ "
means each outstanding unexercised option or similar entitlement to purchase
shares of Company Capital Stock, whether or not then vested or fully
exercisable, granted on or after January 1, 2016 to any current employee or
director of the Company or any other Person (each such Person, a " _Non-
Participating Optionholder_ " and, collectively, the " _Non-Participating
Optionholders_ ") under the GovDelivery Holdings, Inc. 2010 Equity
Compensation Plan (the " _2010 Equity Plan_ ").

(v) On and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company
shall have taken all actions necessary so that at the Effective Time, (A)
each Non-Participating Option held by a Non-Participating Optionholder
immediately before the Effective Time shall become fully vested, (B) all Non-
Participating Options shall be terminated and cancelled in accordance with
the 2010 Equity Plan, including Section 11(b)(iii) thereof, without the need
for any such Non-Participating Optionholders consent, and (C) upon such
cancellation, each Non-Participating Optionholder who holds a Non-
Participating Option shall be entitled to receive from the Company, in
settlement thereof, subject to _Section 1(h)(vi)_, cash in an amount equal to
no less than the consideration such Non-Participating Optionholder would
have received had the Non-Participating Optionholder exercised such Non-
Participating Option (assuming for the purposes of this _Section 1(h)(v)_
only, that all amounts held in the Escrow Fund and the Reserve Account were,
in fact, released),  _less_ the exercise price applicable to such Non-
Participating Option (each such payment, a " _Non-Participating Payment_ ").

 

(vi) The Surviving Corporation shall deduct and withhold from all
consideration otherwise payable or deliverable to any Optionholder
and/or Non-Participating Optionholder, as applicable, pursuant to this
_Section 1(h)_ such amounts as it determines in good faith are required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of the payments pursuant to
this  _Section 1(h)_ under any applicable provision of U.S. or non-U.S.
federal, state, provincial or local Tax law, and such amounts shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable law (but only to the extent that such amounts
are paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority), be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Optionholder and/or Non-
Participating Optionholder, as applicable, in respect of which the Surviving
Corporation made such deduction and withholding. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, effective as of the Closing, any and all rights
of each Optionholder (and any and all Liabilities of the Surviving Corporation
to each Optionholder other than with respect to withholding of Taxes and
reporting with respect thereto) with respect to the Options shall terminate in
all respects, except as expressly set forth herein with respect to the payment
of a portion of the Option Per Share Merger Consideration.
Additionally, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, effective as
of the Closing, any and all rights of each Non-Participating Optionholder (and
any and all Liabilities of the Surviving Corporation to each Non-Participating
Optionholder other than with respect to withholding of Taxes and reporting
with respect thereto) with respect to the Non-Participating Options shall
terminate in all respects, except as expressly set forth herein with respect
to the Non-Participating Payment, and, for the avoidance of doubt, no Non-
Participating Option shall be entitled to receive any additional consideration
with respect to any amounts released from the Escrow Fund, the Reserve Account
and/or any positive Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount.

  



-8- (i) _Repaid Indebtedness; Transaction Expenses_.

 

(i) The Parties hereto agree that, upon the Closing, the Indebtedness of the
Company set forth on the attached _Schedule 1(i)(i)_ (the " _Repaid
Indebtedness_ ") shall be fully repaid by Parent on behalf of the Company in
accordance with this _Section 1(i)(i)_. In order to facilitate such
repayment, no less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, the
Company shall obtain payoff letters for the Repaid Indebtedness (together with
all related documents and instruments, the " _Payoff Documents_ "), which
Payoff Documents shall be in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent and
shall indicate that such lenders have agreed to, if applicable, upon receipt
of the amounts indicated in such Payoff Documents, promptly release all Liens
relating to the assets and properties of the Company and return all possessory
and original collateral.

(ii) In addition, it is contemplated by the Parties that, upon the Closing,
all of the Transaction Expenses will be fully paid. In order to facilitate
such payment, no less than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing, the
Company shall provide and attach hereto as _Schedule 1(i)(ii)_ a statement of
Transaction Expenses in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent. Subject to
the satisfaction of the Companys conditions, covenants and obligations to be
satisfied prior to the Closing, in connection with the Closing, Parent shall
make payment of the Transaction Expenses by wire transfer of immediately
available funds on the Closing Date in order to discharge the amounts payable
thereunder. The Company shall obtain wire transfer instructions for the
satisfaction of the Transaction Expenses no less than two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing.

(j) _Adjustment of the Merger Consideration_.

 

(i) _Capitalization_. In the event that, at the Effective Time, the actual
number of shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding and/or the actual
number of shares of Company Capital Stock issuable upon the exercise of
Options, or similar agreements or upon conversion of securities (including as
a result of any stock split, reclassification, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Capital
Stock) or recapitalization) is different than as described in _Section
5(a)(ii)_, the Common Per Share Merger Consideration shall be accurately
reflected in the Distribution Waterfall. The provisions of this _Section
1(j)_ shall not, in any event, adversely affect, constitute a waiver of or
otherwise impair any of Parents or Merger Subs rights under this Agreement
(including any of Parents or Merger Subs rights arising from any
misrepresentation or breach of the representations and warranties set forth in
_Section 5(a)(ii)_ hereof).

 

(ii) _Closing Date Merger Consideration Adjustment_. Not later than two (2)
Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall cause to be prepared
and delivered to Parent the Companys good faith estimates of the Working
Capital (the " _Estimated Working Capital_ "), the Closing Indebtedness (the "
_Estimated Indebtedness_ "), the Transaction Expenses (the " _Estimated
Transaction Expenses_ "), and the Cash and Cash Equivalents (the " _Estimated
Cash and Cash Equivalents_ ") in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Parent. Such amounts shall be used to calculate the Initial Merger
Consideration, subject to final adjustment as provided in this _Section
1(j)_.

 



-9- (iii) _Closing Statement_. Within seventy-five (75) days following the
Closing, Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and deliver or cause
the Company to deliver to the Equityholders Representative a statement (the "
_Closing Statement_ ") setting forth the actual Working Capital (the " _Actual
Working Capital_ "), the actual Closing Indebtedness (the " _Actual
Indebtedness_ "), the actual Transaction Expenses (the " _Actual Transaction
Expenses_ "), and the actual Cash and Cash Equivalents (the " _Actual Cash
and Cash Equivalents_ "), including, in each case, the calculation thereof and
any trial balances or other supporting documentation used to prepare such
calculations, and the Equityholders Representative shall cooperate
as reasonably requested by Parent in the preparation of the Closing
Statement.

(iv) _Post-Closing Adjustments_. Following the conclusive determination, in
each case, in accordance with _Section 1(j)(v)_, of the Actual Working
Capital (such amount as so determined, the " _Final Working Capital_ "), the
Actual Indebtedness (such amount as so determined, the " _Final Indebtedness_
"), the Actual Transaction Expenses (such amount as so determined, the "
_Final Transaction Expenses_ ") and the Actual Cash and Cash Equivalents (such
amount as so determined, the " _Final Cash and Cash Equivalents_ "), the
amount of the Initial Merger Consideration shall be recalculated by
substituting the Final Working Capital for the Estimated Working Capital, the
Final Indebtedness for the Estimated Indebtedness, the Final Transaction
Expenses for the Estimated Transaction Expenses and the Final Cash and Cash
Equivalents for the Estimated Cash and Cash Equivalents (the result, the "
_Merger Consideration_ "). The " _Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount_ ,"
which may be positive or negative, shall mean (x) the Merger Consideration, as
finally determined in accordance with this _Section 1(j)_, _minus_ (y) the
Initial Merger Consideration. If (A) the Merger Consideration is greater than
the Initial Merger Consideration, then (1) Parent shall pay or cause to be
paid to the Paying Agent (for the benefit of the Stockholders) and the Company
(for the benefit of the Optionholders) the difference between the Initial
Merger Consideration and the Merger Consideration, in each case, to be
distributed in accordance with the applicable Pro Rata Shares set forth in the
Distribution Waterfall and (2) the funds remaining in the Working Capital
Escrow Amount shall be released to the Paying Agent (for the benefit of the
Stockholders) and the Company (for the benefit of the Optionholders), in each
case, to be distributed in accordance with the applicable Pro Rata Shares set
forth in the Distribution Waterfall; or (B) the Initial Merger Consideration
is greater than the Merger Consideration, then (y) such amount shall be paid
from the Working Capital Escrow Amount to Parent (with any shortfall that
exceeds the Working Capital Escrow Amount payable to Parent from the Indemnity
Escrow Amount in accordance with the applicable Pro Rata Shares set forth in
the Distribution Waterfall) and (z) the funds remaining (if any) in the
Working Capital Escrow Amount, after giving effect to clause (y), shall be
released to the Paying Agent (for the benefit of the Stockholders) and the
Company (for the benefit of the Optionholders), in each case to be distributed
in accordance with the applicable Pro Rata Shares set forth in the
Distribution Waterfall.

 



-10- (v) _Post-Closing Adjustment Payments_. The amount of any payment required to
be made pursuant to _Section 1(j)(iii)_ shall be paid to Parent, the Paying
Agent (for the benefit of the Stockholders in accordance with the applicable
Pro Rata Shares set forth in the Distribution Waterfall) and the Company (for
the benefit of the Optionholders in accordance with the applicable Pro Rata
Shares set forth in the Distribution Waterfall), as applicable, within eight
(8) days after the final determination of such amount becomes final in
accordance with  _Section 1(j)(v)_. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event
no payment is required to be made to Parent pursuant to _Section 1(j)(iii)_,
the Working Capital Escrow Amount shall be released to the Paying Agent (for
the benefit of the Stockholders in accordance with the applicable Pro Rata
Shares set forth in the Distribution Waterfall) and the Company (for the
benefit of the Optionholders in accordance with the applicable Pro Rata Shares
set forth in the Distribution Waterfall), as applicable, promptly, but in any
event within five (5) days after the Closing Statement becomes final, and the
Paying Agent and the Company shall distribute the Working Capital Escrow
Amount to the Stockholders and Optionholders (in each case, in accordance
with the applicable Pro Rata Shares set forth in the Distribution Waterfall),
as applicable, promptly, but in any event within five (5) days of the release
of the Working Capital Escrow Amount.

 

(vi) _Adjustment Finalization_. Unless the Equityholders Representative
notifies Parent in writing (the " _Dispute Notice_ ") within thirty (30)
Business Days after receipt by the Equityholders Representative of the
Closing Statement (the " _Dispute Notification Period_ "), of any objections
thereto (specifying in reasonable detail the statement so disputed together
with the basis for such dispute), such Closing Statement shall be final and
binding for all purposes (it being understood that any Closing Statement not
expressly disputed in a writing received by the Equityholders Representative
in the Dispute Notification Period shall become final, binding and conclusive
upon the expiration of the Dispute Notification Period). If the Equityholders
Representative timely notifies Parent of any such objection, Parent and the
Equityholders Representative shall attempt in good faith to reach an
agreement as to the matter in dispute. During the Dispute Notification Period,
for purposes of confirming or disputing the Closing Statement,
the Equityholders Representative shall be given reasonable access to all of
the appropriate records of the Surviving Corporation as well as any
appropriate personnel of the Surviving Corporation materially involved in the
creation or preparation of the Closing Statement. If such Parties shall have
failed to resolve any such dispute within ten (10) Business Days after receipt
of timely notice of such objection (or such longer period mutually agreed to
by Parent and the Equityholders Representative), then any such disputed
matter shall be submitted to and determined by an independent nationally
recognized accounting firm that is mutually agreed upon by Parent and the
Equityholders Representative (in each case, the " _Independent Accounting
Firm_ "). The Independent Accounting Firm shall be given reasonable access to
all of the records of the Surviving Corporation and the Equityholders to
resolve any dispute regarding the Closing Statement, which determination with
respect to any disputed matters in the Closing Statement shall be submitted to
Parent and the Equityholders Representative within twenty (20) Business Days
after the parties engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm. The
Independent Accounting Firm shall address only those items properly disputed
in accordance with this _Section 1(i)(vi)_ and the Independent Accounting
Firm shall make its determination as to any disputed items within the dollar
ranges set forth in the Closing Statement delivered by Parent and the Dispute
Notice delivered by the Equityholders Representative. The fees and expenses
of such Independent Accounting Firm incurred in resolving the disputed matter
shall be equitably apportioned between Parent, on the one hand, and the
Equityholders Representative, on the other hand, such that the Equityholders
Representatives share of such fees and expenses shall be in the same
proportion that the aggregate amount that was unsuccessfully disputed by the
Equityholders Representative (as finally determined by the Independent
Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of such 

 



-11-  disputed amounts so submitted by the Equityholders Representative to the
Independent Accounting Firm, and Parents share shall be the balance of such
fees and expenses; _provided_  that any fees and expenses paid by the
Equityholders Representative shall be paid solely on behalf of the
Equityholders. The Closing Statement, if any, properly disputed hereunder
shall, after resolution of such dispute pursuant to this  _Section
1(j)(vi)_, be final, binding and conclusive on all Parties.

(k) _Release of Liens_. Upon the Closing, the Company shall ensure that all
material Liens (including the Liens set forth on _Schedule 1(k)_ ), other than
Permitted Liens, on the assets of the Company will be released.

 

(l) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, any shares of Company Capital Stock held by a holder who has not
effectively withdrawn or lost such holders appraisal rights under the DGCL ("
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Series AA Per Share Merger Consideration or the Common Per Share Merger
Consideration, as applicable, but the holder thereof shall only be entitled to
such rights as are provided by the DGCL. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any
holder of Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through
failure to perfect or otherwise) such holders appraisal rights under the
DGCL, then, upon the occurrence of such event, such holders shares shall
automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive the
consideration for Company Capital Stock, as applicable, provided for herein,
without interest thereon, and subject to all provisions of this Agreement
applicable to the Stockholders, upon surrender of the Certificate representing
such shares or, if applicable, making of an affidavit as described in
_Section 1(g)(vi)_. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any
demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands,
and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the
Company. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), voluntarily make any payment or offer to make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any claim or demand in respect of
any Dissenting Shares. To the extent that Parent or the Surviving Corporation
(A) makes any payment or payments in respect of any Dissenting Shares in
excess of the consideration that otherwise would have been payable in respect
of such shares in accordance with this Agreement or (B) incurs any other out-
of-pocket costs or expenses in respect of any Dissenting Shares (excluding
payments for such shares) (together " _Dissenting Share Payments_ "), Parent
shall be entitled to recover under the terms of _Section 8 _hereof (subject
to the terms and conditions set forth therein) the amount of such Dissenting
Share Payments.

 

Section 2\. _Conditions to Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub_. The
obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions to be
performed by each in connection with the Closing is subject to satisfaction

as of the Closing:

the Closing Date (except to the extent that such representation and warranty
expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in which case such representation and
warranty shall be true and correct as of such earlier date), except where the
failure to be true and correct has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;  _provided_ , _however_ , that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, the representation of the Company set forth in
_Section 5(g)(x)_ (Absence of Certain Developments) shall be true and correct
in all respects (without disregarding the term Material Adverse Effect) as of
the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as

representation and warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in which
case such representation and warranty shall be true and correct as of such
earlier date); (ii) the representations and warranties in _Sections 5(a)(i)_
(Organization), _5(b)_ (Authorization of the Transaction),  _5(c)(i)_

warranty shall be true and correct as of such earlier date), and (iii) the
representations and warranties in _Section 5(a)(ii)_ (Capitalization) shall
be true and correct in all respects (except for such inaccuracies that
would not result in more than a de minimis increase in the aggregate
consideration payable by Parent) as of the date of this Agreement and as of
the Closing Date with the same effect as though made on and as of the Closing
Date (except to the extent that such representation and warranty expressly
speaks as of an earlier date, in which case such representation and warranty
shall be true and correct as of such earlier date).

property and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted and as
proposed to be conducted and (iii) is qualified to do business and is in

reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or
Merger Sub.

 

(b) _Authorization of the Transaction_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has full
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform each
of their obligations hereunder. This Agreement constitutes the valid and
legally-binding obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable in
accordance with its terms and conditions.

 

(c) _Noncontravention_. Neither the execution and the delivery of this
Agreement and each other agreement, document, instrument or certificate
contemplated hereby to which Parent is a party, nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, shall (i) violate any law or
other restriction to which Parent or Merger Sub is subject in any
material respect, (ii) violate any provision of its organizational documents
or (iii) result in a breach or acceleration of, or create in any party the
right to accelerate, terminate, modify, or require any notice under any
agreement, or other arrangement by which it is bound or to which any of its
assets are subject, except, in the case of clause (iii), for such breaches,
accelerations,

 



-43-  terminations or modifications as would not be, or reasonably be expected to
be material to Parent or Merger Sub. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is required
to give any notice to, make any filing with, or obtain any authorization,
consent or approval of any Governmental Authority in order for the Parties to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for
necessary filings under the HSR Act. There are no Actions pending or
threatened against or affecting Parent or Merger Sub at law or in equity, or
before any Governmental Authority, which would adversely affect Parents or
Merger Subs performance under this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) _Brokers  Fees_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has an obligation to pay
any fees or commissions to any broker, finder or agent with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

has provided to the Company a true and complete copy of the executed equity
commitment letter (the " _Equity Financing Commitment_ "), by and between
Parent and Vista Foundation Fund III, L.P. (" _Sponsor_ "), pursuant to which
Sponsor has committed that Sponsor or certain of its Affiliates will provide
equity financing in the amount set forth therein for the purpose of funding
payment of the Initial Merger Consideration and such other payment
obligations of Parent set forth in _Section 1_ of this Agreement, subject to
the terms and conditions set forth therein and in this Agreement (the "
_Equity Financing_ "). The Company and the Equityholders Representative (on

the Equity Financing Commitment. The Equity Financing Commitment has not been
amended or modified prior to the date of this Agreement, and as of the date
hereof (x) no such amendment or modification is contemplated and (y) the
commitment contained in the Equity Financing Commitment has not been
withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect. As of the date of this
Agreement, there are no side letters or other agreements, contracts or

against Parent in accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability
Exceptions, and there are no conditions precedent related to the funding of
the full amount of the Equity Financing, other than as expressly set forth in

no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or, to the
knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto under the Equity Financing
Commitment. Assuming satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 2_
of this Agreement and based upon facts and events known to Parent on the date
hereof, Parent has no reason to believe, as of the date hereof, that any of
the conditions to the funding of the Equity Financing required to be
satisfied by it will not be satisfied by the time it is required to consummate
the Closing hereunder. Assuming satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
_Section _2 of this Agreement and based upon facts and events known to
Parent on the date hereof, the funds provided pursuant to the Equity Financing
Commitment, if funded in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Equity Financing Commitment, will be sufficient for Parent to have at the
Closing funds sufficient to (A) pay the Initial Merger Consideration and such
other payment obligations of Parent set forth in _Section 1_ of this
Agreement, (B) pay any and all fees and expenses required to be paid by
Parent in connection with the transactions contemplated by

Parent contemplated hereunder that are required to be satisfied in connection
with the Closing. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Sponsor
has duly executed and delivered to the Company the limited guarantee by
Sponsor, dated as of the date of this Agreement, in favor of the Company (the
" _Limited Guarantee_ "). As of the date hereof, the Limited Guarantee (1) is
in full force and effect and (2) is a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Sponsor, enforceable against Sponsor in accordance with its terms, subject to
Enforceability Exceptions. As of the date hereof, (x) there is no default
under the Limited Guarantee by Sponsor and (y) no event has occurred that with
the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both would constitute a default
thereunder by Sponsor.

 

(f) _Merger Sub_. Merger Sub is a direct, wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent
formed for the purposes of engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby,
including effecting the Merger. There is no agreement outstanding pursuant to
which any Person (other than Parent) has any existing or contingent right to
acquire any stock of Merger Sub. Merger Sub has conducted no activities other
than those necessary or appropriate to effectuate the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

the Company (in the case of termination by Parent) or by Parent or Merger Sub

cure for twenty (20) days after the notice of such breach has been

Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7(a)_ if (A) that Partys breach of this
Agreement has prevented the consummation of the transactions contemplated

condition set forth in _Section 2_ or  _Section 3_, as applicable, that

terminated other than pursuant to _Section 7(a)_, such termination will not
affect any right or remedy which accrued hereunder or under applicable laws
prior to or on account of such termination, and the provisions of this
Agreement shall survive such termination to the extent required so that each
Party may enforce all rights and remedies available to such Party hereunder or
under applicable laws in respect of such termination and so that any Party
responsible for any breach or nonperformance of its obligations hereunder
prior to termination shall remain liable for the consequences thereof.

(c) _Waiver of Rights_. Each Party shall be deemed to have waived its rights
to terminate this Agreement upon consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby. No such waiver shall constitute a waiver of any other rights arising
from the non-fulfillment of any condition precedent set forth in _Section 2_
or _Section 3_ hereof or any misrepresentation or breach of any warranty,
covenant or agreement contained herein unless such waiver is made in writing;
any such written waiver shall constitute a waiver only of the specific

punitive and exemplary damages, unless, in each such case, such damages are
incurred as a result of a third party claim, but including reasonable out-of-
pocket legal expenses and costs, including costs of investigation, and to the
extent reasonably foreseeable, indirect and consequential damages) (each, a "
_Loss_ "), which they suffer, sustain or become subject to as the result of
(A) the breach by the Company of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement or any certificate delivered by or on
behalf of the Company at or prior to the Closing, (B) the breach by the
Company of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or any
certificate delivered by or on behalf of the Company at or prior to the
Closing, (C) any Indebtedness of the Company and any Transaction Expenses, in
each case that are not paid in full at the Closing or taken into account
in the calculation of the Merger Consideration, (D) actual or claimed
inaccuracies in the Distribution Waterfall, (E) any claims by any current,
past or putative holder of Company Capital Stock, in his, her or its capacity
as such, including as a result of or in connection with the Dissenting
Shares, Dissenting Share Payments, the exercise of appraisal rights (net of
any amount that would otherwise have been payable to the holder of Company
Capital Stock exercising any appraisal rights), or any distribution of Series
AA Per Share Merger Consideration, Common Per Share Merger Consideration
and/or Option Per Share Merger Consideration to the Equityholders pursuant to
the Distribution Waterfall, (F) any claims by any current, past or putative
holder of Options in his or her capacity as such including as a result of or
in connection with any distribution of Series AA Per Share Merger
Consideration, Common Per Share Merger Consideration and/or Option Per
Share Merger Consideration pursuant to the Distribution Waterfall and
including the determination of the vested and unvested status of any Options,
(G) (1) any and all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing
Date and the portion through the end of the Closing Date for any taxable
period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing

 



-47-  Date (" _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ "), (2) any and all Taxes of any member of
an Affiliated Group of which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any of
their predecessors) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any analogous or similar
state, local, or non-U.S. law), and (3) any and all Taxes with respect to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period of any Person (other than the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
transferee or successor, or by contract, which Taxes arose pursuant to an
event or transaction occurring before the Closing, and (H) any matter set
forth on _Schedule 8(b)(i)(H)_.

(ii) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Equityholders against any
Losses which they suffer, sustain or become subject to as the result of a
breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement or any certificate delivered by or on
behalf of Parent at or prior to the Closing (provided that this clause (ii)
shall not derogate from Parents rights or recoveries pursuant to _Section
8(b)(i)_ above).

 

(iii) For purposes of _Sections 8(b)(i)(A)_ and _8(b)(ii)_ , in determining
whether there has been a breach of any representation or warranty, and in
calculating the amount of any Loss with respect to any such breach, all
qualifications in such representation or warranty referencing the terms
"material," "materiality," "Material Adverse Effect," "in all material
respects" and similar phrases shall be disregarded.

(iv) After the Closing, the Parent Group shall not be entitled to recover
under _Section 8(b)(i)(A)_ for any Losses arising from or as a result of a
breach of representations and warranties set forth in _Section 5_ (other than
representations and warranties described in _Sections 8(a)(i)_ and _8(a)(ii)_
) unless each individual Loss for such breach exceeds fifty thousand U.S.
dollars ($50,000) (the " _Minimum Threshold_ ") (it being understood and
agreed that if a common or similar set of occurrences, events or sets of
facts results in Losses, such Losses shall be aggregated for purposes of
determining if the Minimum Threshold has been satisfied). The Parent Group
shall not be entitled to recover under _Section 8(b)(i)(A)_ for any Losses
arising from or as a result of a breach of representations and warranties set
forth in _Section 5_ (other than representations and warranties described in
_Sections 8(a)(i)_ and _8(a)(ii)_ ) unless the aggregate Losses for all such
breaches above the Minimum Threshold exceeds One Million Five Hundred Thirty
Thousand U.S. dollars ($1,530,000) (the " _Basket_ ") (at which point the
Parent Group shall be entitled to indemnification from and against all
such Losses in excess of the Basket, and not for any such Losses equal to or
below the Basket) and the Parent Group shall not be entitled to recover under
_Section 8(b)(i)(A)_ (other than Losses arising from or as a result of a
breach of representations and warranties described in _Section 8(a)(i)_ and
_8(a)(ii)_ ) for more than an amount equal to, in the aggregate, the Indemnity
Escrow Amount (the " _Cap_ "). None of the Minimum Threshold, the Basket
or the Cap shall apply to any such Loss arising from or as a result of (i)
either an action or inaction that constitutes fraud or willful misconduct (and
no such Losses shall count towards satisfaction of the Minimum Threshold, the
Basket or the Cap) or (ii) a breach of representations and warranties
described in _Section 8(a)(i)_ and _8(a)(ii)_ ; _provided_ that the aggregate
maximum liability of each Responsible Person for Losses pursuant to clauses
(i) and (ii) of this sentence shall not exceed the consideration actually
received by such Responsible Person pursuant to this Agreement.

 



-48- (v) No limitation shall apply to the liability of any individual Responsible
Person for any Loss arising from or as a result of either an action or
inaction that constitutes fraud or willful misconduct committed by such
Responsible Person. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, in no event shall any Responsible Person be liable under this
Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby for
amounts in excess the consideration actually received by such Responsible
Person pursuant to this Agreement, except in the case of fraud or
willful misconduct committed by such Responsible Person.

(vi) Any Person making a claim for indemnification under this _Section
8(b)_ (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") must give the indemnifying party (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") written notice of such claim describing such claim and
the nature and amount, or anticipated amount, of the Loss, to the extent that
the nature and amount thereof are determinable at such time (a " _Claim
Notice_ ") promptly (but in any event no later than forty-five (45) days)
after the Indemnified Party receives notice from a third party with respect
to any matter which may give rise to a claim for indemnification against the
Indemnifying Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") or otherwise discovers the
liability, obligation or facts giving rise to such claim for
indemnification;  _provided_ that the failure to notify or delay in notifying
the Indemnifying Party will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations under this _Section 8(b)_, except to the extent such claim or the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced as a result thereof. Within
thirty (30) days after receipt of a Claim Notice with respect to a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party may assume the defense of such matter;
_provided_ that (A) the Indemnifying Party shall retain counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party, (B) the Indemnified Party may participate
in the defense of such claim, at its own expense, with co-counsel of its
choice to the extent that the Indemnified Party believes in its sole
discretion that such matter shall affect its ongoing business and (C) the
Indemnifying Party may not consent to the entry of any judgment with respect
to the matter or enter into any settlement with respect to the matter which
does not include a provision whereby the plaintiff or claimant in the matter
releases the Indemnified Party from all Liability and obligations with respect
thereto. If, within such thirty (30) day period, the Indemnifying Party does
not assume the defense of such matter, the Indemnified Party may defend
against the matter in any manner that it reasonably may deem appropriate and
may consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to the matter or enter
into any settlement with respect to matter without the consent of the
Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such consent is not
obtained, such settlement shall not be dispositive of the amount of or
existence of any indemnifiable Loss hereunder. The Indemnified Party shall
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in all matters arising under this
_Section 8(b)_.

(vii) In the event an Indemnified Party has a claim for indemnity under this
_Section 8_ against the Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third
Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party agrees to deliver to
the Indemnifying Party a Claim Notice within forty-five (45) days after the
Indemnified Party becomes aware of such Direct Claim; _provided_ that the
failure to notify or delay in notifying the Indemnifying Party will not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this _Section 8(b)_,
except to the extent such claim is materially prejudiced as a result thereof.

 



-49- (viii) As of the Effective Time, Parent, the Escrow Agent and the
Equityholders Representative shall execute and deliver the Escrow Agreement,
and Parent shall deposit (A) the Working Capital Escrow Amount with the Escrow
Agent to be held as a trust fund for the purpose of securing the purchase
price obligations set forth in _Section 1(j)_ and (B) the Indemnity Escrow
Amount with the Escrow Agent to be held as a trust for the purpose of securing
the indemnification obligations set forth in this _Section 8_. The Escrow
Fund shall be held by the Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement pursuant to
the terms thereof. The Escrow Fund shall be held as a trust fund and shall not
be subject to any lien, attachment, trustee process or any other judicial
process of any creditor of any party, and shall be held and disbursed solely
for the purposes and in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and
the Pro Rata Shares set forth in the Distribution Waterfall. Interest earned
on the Escrow Amount shall become part of the Escrow Fund and shall be held
in escrow and distributed in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. The
termination of the Escrow Fund and the distribution of the remaining Escrow
Amount shall be as set forth in the Escrow Agreement.

 

(ix) From and after the Closing, any indemnification to which a member of the
Parent Group is entitled under this Agreement, subject to the applicable
limitations set forth in _Section 8(b)(iv)_, as a result of any Loss shall be
first satisfied by recouping all of such Loss from the Indemnity Escrow Fund
by such member of the Parent Group in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement until the Indemnity Escrow Amount is exhausted or released pursuant
to the terms of the Escrow Agreement subject to the Applicable Limitation
Dates and subject to the last sentence of this _Section 8(b)(viii)_; 
_provided_ that all payments made to the Parent Group from the Indemnity
Escrow Fund shall reduce each Responsible Persons contribution to the
Indemnity Escrow Fund pro rata based on such Responsible Persons Pro Rata
Share. If the Indemnity Escrow Amount is not sufficient to pay the entire
amount of any such claim, other than with respect to claims made under
_Section 8(b)(i)(A)_ for any Losses arising from or as a result of a breach
of representations and warranties set forth in _Section 5_ (other than
representations and warranties described in _Sections 8(a)(i)_ and _8(a)(ii)_
), such member of the Parent Group shall have all other rights and remedies
available to it to recover any remaining amount directly from the Responsible
Persons in accordance with each such Responsible Persons Pro Rata Share,
subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 8(b)(iv)_ and the Applicable
Limitation Dates.

 

(x) All indemnification payments made pursuant to this _Section 8_ will be
deemed to be adjustments to the Merger Consideration (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, for Tax purposes).

(xi) For purposes of calculating the amount of Loss incurred by an
Indemnified Party for purposes of this Agreement, such amount shall be
reduced by (A) the amount of any insurance proceeds actually paid to such
Indemnified Party in respect of such Loss, net of any deductible amounts, any
increase in premiums related thereto and any costs associated with obtaining
such insurance proceeds, (B) the amount of any net Tax benefit actually
realized by such Indemnified Party in respect of such Loss in the taxable year
of such Loss or the next succeeding taxable year, as calculated on a with and
without basis, and (C) the amount of any indemnification, contribution, and
other similar payment proceeds actually recovered by such Indemnified Party in
respect of such Loss, net of any costs associated with obtaining such
proceeds.

 



-50- (xii) Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the indemnification
provisions set forth in this _Section 8_ shall be the exclusive remedy of
the Parties with respect to any breaches of the representations, warranties,
covenants, or agreements set forth in this Agreement, it being agreed that
nothing herein shall limit or impair any Partys right to obtain specific
performance or other injunctive relief with respect to any such breach of any
such representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement.

 

(xiii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Losses for purposes of
this _Section 8_ shall not include any amounts actually taken into account
in the final determination of Merger Consideration and in each case resulting
in a corresponding decrease to the Merger Consideration (it being understood
and agreed that the intent of this _Section 8(b)(xiii)_ is to avoid
duplication or "double counting" of the same liability hereunder).

(xiv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no member of the
Parent Group shall be entitled to indemnification or recovery for, and Losses
shall not include, (A) except for any Losses for Taxes attributable to a
breach of a representation or warranty contained in _Sections 5(l)(ix)_ ,
_(x)_ , _(xi)_ , _(xv)_ , _(xvii)_ and _(xviii)_ , any Taxes of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any taxable period or portion
thereof beginning after the Closing Date, (B) any limitation or diminution of
or on any Tax attribute of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (C) any
Taxes described on _Schedule 8(b)(xiv)(C)_ or (D) any Taxes included in the
calculation of the 336(e) Adjustment to the extent such Taxes do not exceed
the 336(e) Adjustment Cap.

Section 9\. _Additional Agreements_.

 

(a) _Press Releases_. The Parties agree that no press release or other public
announcement (including in any trade journal or other publication) of the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be made (i) prior to the Closing
without the prior written consent of each of the Parties or (ii) after the
Closing without the prior written consent of Parent, except as provided in
the Representative Side Letter; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _Section 9(a)_ or otherwise, the filing with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and issuance, as applicable, by
Actua of (A) a Form 8-K in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit L_ disclosing
the terms of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (and
attaching thereto a copy of this Agreement and a press release in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent) and (B) the Financial Statements
(as defined in the Representative Side Letter) to the extent permitted under
the Representative Side Letter shall, in each case, be expressly permitted by
this  _Section 9(a)_; _provided_ , _further_ , that such Form 8-K shall be
filed on the earliest to occur of (1) prior to market open on the fourth (4th)
Business Day following the date of this Agreement, (2) prior to market open
on September 26, 2016 and (3) at any such time following the date hereof that
Actua and its counsel reasonably determines that such timing of such filing is
necessary or advisable in order to comply with the disclosure requirements of
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and/or any applicable stock
exchange, and Actua shall notify Parent of any such determination as promptly
as practicable as such determination is made.

 



-51- (b) _Transaction Expenses_. Each Party shall be solely responsible for and
shall bear all of its own costs and expenses incident to its obligations
under and in respect of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby; _provided_ that the Equityholders shall be responsible for the
Transaction Expenses.

 

(c) _Tax Matters_. The following provisions shall govern the allocation of
responsibility as between Parent and the Company, on the one hand, and the
Equityholders, on the other hand, for certain Tax matters following the
Closing Date (it being understood that for purposes of this _Section 9(c)_,
the term "Company" shall be deemed to refer to and include the Company and
each of the Companys Subsidiaries).

(i) _Apportionment of Taxes_. In the case of any taxable period that
includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "),
the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income, payroll or receipts of
the Company for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an
interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date
(and for such purpose, the taxable period of any partnership or other pass-
through entity in which the Company holds a beneficial interest shall be
deemed to terminate at such time), and the amount of other Taxes of the
Company for a Straddle Period which relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall
be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of days in such Straddle Period.

(ii)  _Cooperation_. Parent, the Company and the Equityholders
Representative shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, cooperate fully, as
and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Parties, in connection
with the preparation and filing of Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other Partys request) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return, audit,
litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder.

 

(iii) _Preparation of Tax Returns_.

 

(A) The Equityholders Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared
and file or cause to be filed all income Tax Returns of the Affiliated Group
which includes the Company and the common parent of which is Actua (the "
_Seller Tax Returns_ "). Such Seller Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practice to the extent related to the Company, except as
otherwise required by applicable law. At least twenty (20) days prior to the
due date of any Seller Tax Return (taking into account extensions), the
Equityholders Representative shall provide a draft of the portions of such
Seller Tax Return related to the Company to Parent for the Parents review and
comment. The Equityholders Representative shall take into consideration any
changes to such Seller Tax Returns reasonably requested by Parent.

 

(B) Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
all Tax Returns of the Company that are first due after the Closing Date
(taking into account any extensions) for any taxable period of the Company
ending on or before the Closing Date and for any Straddle Period of the
Company, other than Seller Tax Returns (the 

 



-52-  " _Company Tax Returns_ "). Such Company Tax Returns shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with the Companys past practice except as otherwise
required by applicable law; provided, that, , any Company Tax Returns that
are income Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with Seller
Tax Returns as provided by the Equityholders Representative pursuant to
_Section 9(c)(iii)(A)_, to the extent such Seller Tax Returns are related to
the Company. At least twenty (20) days prior to the due date of any Company
Tax Return (taking into account extensions), Parent shall provide a draft of
such Company Tax Return to the Equityholders Representative for the
Equityholders Representatives review and written approval (such approval not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Parent shall, or shall
cause the Company, to make all changes to such Company Tax Returns reasonably
requested by the Equityholders Representative. Any disputes as to such
changes shall be submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm, the decision of
which shall be final, binding and conclusive and the expenses of which shall
be shared equally between the Parent, on the one hand, and the Equityholders,
on the other hand. If the Independent Accounting Firm is unable to make a
determination with respect to any disputed item prior to the due date for the
filing of Company Tax Return in question, then (i) the Company may file such
Company Tax Return in accordance with the Companys reasonable position ("
_Reasonable Position Returns_ ") and (ii) if the Independent Accounting
Firm subsequently determines that such Company Tax Return should be amended,
the Company shall file an amended Company Tax Return reflecting the
Independent Accounting Firms determination. No member of Parent Group shall
be entitled to indemnification or recovery for, and Losses shall not include,
(i) Taxes paid in connection with the filing of Reasonable Position Returns to
the extent such Taxes are a disputed item subject to the Independent
Accounting Firms review, (ii) interest, penalties or other charges, fees or
expenses arising out of or related to late payment or late filing of Company
Tax Returns and (iii) Taxes paid in connection with filing Tax Returns that
serve as requests for extension of time to file (including IRS Form 7004 and
comparable or analogous other Tax forms, " _Extension Returns_ "). For the
avoidance of doubt, the indemnification provided in _Section 8(b)(G)(1)_
shall apply (subject to any qualifications and limitations set forth in this
Agreement) to disputed Taxes that were paid in connection with Reasonable
Position Returns and Taxes paid in connection with Extension Returns as and
when the amount of such Taxes are finally determined (and only to the extent
of such Taxes as finally determined) following the filing of the applicable
Company Tax Return that includes such Taxes as finally determined pursuant to
the procedures set forth in this  _Section 9.3(c)(iii)(B)_ (i.e., after the
filing of such Company Tax Return as mutually agreed upon by Parent and
Equityholders Representative or after the filing of such Company Tax Return
following determination of all disputes by the Independent Accounting Firm).

(C) Without the Equityholders Representatives prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Parent will
not, and will not cause the Company or any of their Affiliates to, take any of
the following actions that could have an effect with respect to Taxes or Tax
Returns in each case for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, if such action could
reasonably be expected to give rise to an indemnification claim against the
Responsible Persons under this Agreement or otherwise result in amounts for
which Responsible Persons could become liable or responsible: (1) amend,
file, re-file or otherwise modify any Tax Return of the Company or (2) except
for the Section 336(e) Elections, make, revoke or modify any Tax election with
respect to the Company, in each case, unless as a condition or result of the
judgment or settlement of a Tax Proceeding resolved in accordance with the
procedures set forth in _Section 9.3(c)(v)_ or made or done in accordance
with VDA Procedures as set forth in  _Section 9(c)(v)_.

 



-53- (iv) _Closing Date Course of Business_. For the portion of the Closing Date
after the time of Closing, Parent shall cause the Company to carry on its
business only in the ordinary course in the same manner as previously
conducted and shall not make or cause to be made or permit any extraordinary
transaction that would result in Losses with respect to Taxes for which
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement would be required or for which the
Equityholders would otherwise be responsible.

 

(v) _Tax Proceedings_. Parent shall give reasonably prompt written notice to
Equityholders Representative of any dispute or claim or the commencement of
any audit, suit, action or proceeding (excluding any VDA Procedure, which
shall be addressed in paragraph (C) of this Section 9(c)(v)) related to Taxes
with respect to the Company with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (in each
case, a " _Tax Proceeding_ ").

(A) The Equityholders Representative shall have the right to control the
defense of any Tax Proceeding to the extent related to Losses with respect to
which the Responsible Persons could reasonably be expected to have to provide
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement (a " _Seller Proceeding_ "); 
_provided_ that (x) Parent shall have the right to participate in any such
Seller Proceeding, (y) the Equityholders Representative shall keep the Parent
reasonably informed of the status of such Tax Proceeding (including providing
Parent with copies of all written correspondence regarding such matter), and
(z) to the extent that any Seller Proceeding (other than a Seller Proceeding
related to income Taxes of the Affiliated Group which includes the Company
and the common parent of which is Actua) (1) is related to a taxable period
(or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date or (2) could reasonably
be expected to affect the Tax liability of the Parent or the Company in a
taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date,
Equityholders Representative shall not consent to the entry of any judgment
or enter into any settlement without the consent of Parent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(B) Parent shall control the defense of any Tax Proceeding other than a Seller
Proceeding (a " _Company Proceeding_ "); _provided_ that to the extent an
indemnification claim against the Responsible Persons under this Agreement
could reasonably be expected to result from any such Company Proceeding, (x)
the Equityholders Representative shall have the right to participate in any
such Company Proceeding, (y) Parent shall keep the Equityholders
Representative reasonably informed of the status of such Company Proceeding
(including providing Equityholders Representative with copies of all written
correspondence regarding such matter), and (z) neither Parent nor the Company
shall consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
without the consent of the Equityholders Representative, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(C) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each of Parent and the
Company shall, subject to the provisions of this _Section 9.3(c)(v)(C)_, have
the right to (i) enter into and control "voluntary disclosure agreements" or
other similar programs with applicable taxing authorities for all Pre-Closing
Tax Periods (such programs, " _VDA Procedures_ ") with respect to income or
sales and use Taxes and/or (ii) file a sales and use Tax 

 



-54-  Return with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period in a jurisdiction in which
the Company had not previously filed sales and use Tax Returns in such Pre-
Closing Tax Periods. Prior to Parent or the Company initiating any contact
with a taxing authority with respect to any VDA Procedures, or filing any such
sales and use Tax Return for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, Parent shall notify
the Equityholders Representative and obtain the Equityholders
Representatives written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed). Any dispute regarding the initiation of such contact or VDA
Procedures or the filing of any such sales and use Tax Return shall
be submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm, and if the Independent
Account Firm reaches a finding that it is "more likely than not" that an
outstanding Tax liability exists with respect to the applicable Pre-Closing
Tax Period in the applicable jurisdictions where Parent intends to initiate
contact or VDA Procedures or file any such sales and use Tax Return, then
Parent or the Company shall be able to proceed with such VDA Procedures or the
filing of such sales and use Tax Returns (notwithstanding any lack of consent
from the Equityholders Representative). The decision of the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be final, binding and conclusive and the expenses of the
Independent Accounting Firm be shared equally between the Parent, on the one
hand, and the Equityholders, on the other hand. With respect to any VDA
Procedures initiated pursuant to this paragraph (C), the Equityholders
Representative shall have the right to participate in any such proceedings
and to employ counsel at its own expense, and with respect to any such sales
and use Tax Returns filed pursuant to this paragraph (C), Parent or the
Company shall submit such Tax Return to the Equityholders Representative for
its review and comment at least twenty (20) days before filing such Tax
Return. In connection with any VDA Procedure related to sales and use Taxes or
filing of a sales and use Tax Return pursuant to this _Section 9.3(c)(v)(C)_,
Parent and the Company shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
collect the applicable sales and use Taxes to mitigate the sales and use Taxes
at issue to the greatest extent possible. In connection with any VDA Procedure
related to income Taxes, to the extent the result of the VDA Procedure
includes the assessment of income Taxes arising out of or related to the
Section 336(e) Election, no member of Parent Group shall be entitled to
indemnification or recovery for, and Losses shall not include, such income
Taxes to the extent the total amount of Section 336(e) Adjustment paid
pursuant to this Agreement is less than the 336(e) Adjustment Cap.

 

(D) To the extent that the provisions of this _Section 9(c)(v)_ overlap or
contradict the provisions of  _Section 8(b)(vi)_, the provisions of this
_Section 9(c)(v)_ shall govern.

(vi) _Tax Refunds_. Any refunds of Taxes, including any interest received
from a Governmental Authority thereon and net of any Taxes imposed thereon or
reasonable expenses incurred with respect thereto, attributable to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period of the Company shall be for the account of the
Equityholders, except to the extent such refund is attributable to a Tax
attribute arising in a taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the
Closing Date or was taken into account as a Current Asset in the determination
of Final Working Capital. Promptly upon the Companys (or any of its
Affiliates) receipt of any such refund, Parent shall pay over, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, any such refund, including any
interest received by an applicable Governmental Authority thereon and net of
any Taxes imposed thereon or reasonable expenses incurred with respect
thereto, to the Paying Agent (for the benefit of the Stockholders) and the
Company (for the benefit of the Optionholders), in each case, to be
distributed in accordance with the applicable Pro Rata Shares set forth in the

 



-55-  Distribution Waterfall. All such amounts for which a refund could be claimed
shall be claimed as a cash refund rather than as a credit against future Tax
liabilities. Upon the Equityholders Representatives request and at the
Equityholders expense, Parent shall take any reasonable action necessary for
the Company to promptly claim refunds attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period and cause the Company to claim refunds attributable to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period within the statutorily required time period. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that any such refund
of Taxes is subsequently determined by any Governmental Authority to be less
than the amount paid to the Equityholders, the Equityholders shall promptly
return any such disallowed amounts (plus any interest in respect of such
disallowed refund owed to a Governmental Authority) to Parent. All Transaction
Tax Deductions shall be considered to arise in the Pre-Closing Tax Period to
the extent permitted by applicable Tax law. All items of loss, deduction and
credit of the Company attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be used
for income Tax purposes first to offset items of income and gain attributable
to such Pre-Closing Tax Period and thereafter shall be carried back to the
extent permitted by applicable Tax law.

 

(vii) _Other Tax Matters_. All Tax-sharing agreements or similar agreements
(other than agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business and
not primarily related to Taxes) with respect to or involving the Company shall
be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the Company
shall not be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

 

(viii) _Section 336(e) Election_.

 

(A) Actua, Seller and the Company hereby agree to make timely elections under
Code Section 336(e) (and any corresponding election under state Tax law) with
respect to the purchase and sale of the Company Capital Stock and with respect
to the indirect purchase and sale of the equity interests of each of the
Companys U.S. Subsidiaries for income Tax purposes hereunder (collectively,
the " _Section 336(e) Elections_ "). The first sentence of this paragraph (A)
is intended by the Parties hereto to meet the requirements of Treasury
Regulation Sections 1.336-2(h)(l)(i). Each of Seller, Actua, and the Company
shall take any and all actions necessary in order complete the Section 336(e)
Elections in the manner described in Treasury Regulation Sections
1.336-2(h)(l) (and any corresponding requirements under applicable state Tax
law). No later than twenty (20) days prior to the applicable due date for
timely filing, the Equityholders Representative shall deliver to Parent the
election statement for each Section 336(e) Election described in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.336-2(h)(5) for Parents review, comment and approval
(not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Promptly following
the consummation of the Section 336(e) Elections, the Equityholders
Representative shall provide evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent that
the Section 336(e) Elections have been properly executed and filed (including
a copy of such election and any related schedules, forms or other
documentation) to the extent the Equityholders Representative is responsible
for such filing.

(B) The Merger Consideration and other items properly includible in the
aggregate deemed asset disposition price (" _ADADP_ ") of the Company pursuant
to the Section 336(e) Election shall be allocated among the assets of the
Company in accordance with Section 336(e) of the Code, the regulations
thereunder and the principles set forth in _Exhibit I_ attached hereto (the "
_Allocation Methodology_ ").

 



-56- (C) Within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, the
Equityholders Representative shall provide Parent with (i) a statement
setting forth an allocation of the ADADP among the assets of the Company in
accordance with the Allocation Methodology for Tax Purposes (the " _Purchase
Price Allocation_ ") and (ii) a statement setting forth a calculation of the
336(e) Adjustment as of the Closing Date prepared in good faith and in
accordance with the Purchase Price Allocation (the " _Closing Date 336(e)
Adjustment_ ") (in each case, to the extent components of the Merger
Consideration have not yet been finally determined pursuant to _Section
1(j)_, using such components as calculated for purposes of the Initial Merger
Consideration). If, within fifteen (15) days following the date of receipt of
the Purchase Price Allocation and the Closing Date 336(e) Adjustment, Parent
does not dispute the Equityholders Representatives calculation of either,
then the Purchase Price Allocation and Closing Date 336(e) Adjustment shall
be final, binding and conclusive upon the Parties for purposes of Tax
reporting and determining the payment contemplated in this _Section
9(c)(viii)(C)_. If Parent disagrees with the Equityholders Representatives
calculation of either the Purchase Price Allocation or the Closing Date 336(e)
Adjustment, then, within such fifteen (15) days, the Parent shall notify the
Equityholders Representative of such disagreement in writing. The parties
shall negotiate in good faith for five (5) days to attempt to resolve such
disagreement. Any disagreement unresolved at the end of this period shall be
promptly submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm, whose resolution shall
be provided within fifteen (15) days of receipt of such submission, shall be
final, binding and conclusive on the parties and the costs of which shall be
split equally between Parent, on the one hand, and the Equityholders, on the
other hand. The Closing Date 336(e) Adjustment, as determined pursuant to
this _Section 9(c)(viii)(C)_ after all actions and procedures described
herein have been completed, is hereinafter referred to as the " _Final Closing
Date 336(e) Adjustment_." The Final Closing Date 336(e) Adjustment shall be
paid by the Parent (as provided in Section 9(c)(ix)) to the Equityholders
Representative for remittance to the appropriate Governmental Authorities (or
shall be paid directly by Parent or the Company to the appropriate
Governmental Authorities, as applicable). Except as otherwise required by law,
(1) none of the Parties will take a position on any Tax Return or in any Tax
proceeding inconsistent with the Purchase Price Allocation, and (2) the
Parties shall file all Tax Returns and forms consistently with the Purchase
Price Allocation; _provided_ , _however_ , the Parties acknowledge that the
allocation may be different between ADADP and "adjusted grossed up basis
(AGUB)" as required by the regulations under Code Section 336(e).

(ix) _Payment of Final Closing Date 336(e) Adjustment_. The Final Closing
Date 336(e) Adjustment shall be paid by Parent to the Equityholders
Representative for remittance to the appropriate Governmental Authorities (or
shall be paid directly by Parent or the Company to the appropriate
Governmental Authorities, as applicable) promptly after the determination of
such amount becomes final in accordance with _Section 9(c)(viii)(C)_. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Equityholders Representative shall not be entitled
to any payment of the Final Closing Date 336(e) Adjustment pursuant to
_Section 9(c)(viii)(C)_ and this _Section 9(c)(ix)_ for more than an amount
equal to the 336(e) Adjustment Cap.

 



-57- (x) For purposes of this Agreement, " _336(e) Adjustment_ " means the
amount determined in a manner consistent with the methodology and sample
calculation included in _Exhibit J_ equal to the sum of (1) the excess of the
amount of Tax imposed as a result of the Merger by virtue of the Section
336(e) Elections over the amount of Tax that would have been imposed in the
absence of such elections, and (2) a "gross-up" amount to reflect additional
Taxes imposed as a result of receiving the 336(e) Adjustment. For the
avoidance of doubt, no 336(e) Adjustment will be paid to Equityholders other
than Seller.

(xi) Notwithstanding _Section 9(c)(viii)(C)_ and  _Section 9(c)(ix)_, in
the event the Final Closing Date 336(e) Adjustment as determined and paid
pursuant to such Sections used components as calculated for purposes of the
Initial Merger Consideration instead of components used for calculation of
the Merger Consideration as finally determined pursuant to _Section 1(j)_,
the parties shall re-determine the Final Closing Date 336(e) Adjustment using
only components for calculation of the Merger Consideration as
finally determined pursuant to _Section 1(j)_ as soon as practicable, but no
later than twenty (20) days, after such components are finally determined. Any
disagreement between the parties at the end of this period shall be promptly
submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm, whose resolution shall be
provided within fifteen (15) days of receipt of such submission, shall be
final, binding and conclusive on the parties and the costs of which shall be
split equally between Parent, on the one hand, and the Equityholders, on the
other hand. The re-determined Final Closing Date 336(e) Adjustment pursuant to
this _Section 9(c)(xi)_ shall be called the " _Re-determined Final Closing
Date 336(e) Adjustment_." In the event the Re-determined Final Closing Date
336(e) Adjustment is greater than the Final Closing Date 336(e) Adjustment,
the difference shall be paid by Parent to the Equityholders Representative
for remittance to the appropriate Governmental Authorities (or shall be paid
directly by Parent or the Company to the appropriate Governmental Authorities,
as applicable); _provided_ , that the Equityholders Representative shall not
be entitled to any payment of the sum of (x) the Final Closing Date 336(e)
Adjustment plus (y) the difference between the Re-determined Final Closing
Date 336(e) Adjustment and Final Closing Date 336(e) Adjustment, in excess of
the 336(e) Adjustment Cap. In the event the Re-determined Final Closing Date
336(e) Adjustment is less than the Final Closing Date 336(e) Adjustment, the
portion of the difference between the two which had previously been paid by
Parent to the Equityholders Representative for remittance to the appropriate
Governmental Authorities shall be paid by the Equityholders Representative to
Parent.

(d) [Intentionally Omitted.]

(e) _Confidentiality_. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, the Parties shall keep, and shall cause each of their respective
Affiliates, employees, equityholders, advisors, agents and representatives to
keep, confidential all information and materials regarding any other Party. If
the transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated, Parent and each of
its Affiliates, employees, equityholders, advisors, agents and representatives
shall maintain the confidentiality of all non-public, proprietary information
obtained during its due diligence review of the Company and destroy all
documents received from the Company and all copies thereof containing any such
information. Each Equityholder shall not, and shall not permit its Affiliates,
employees, stockholders, advisors, agents and representatives to, disclose
the terms and provisions of this Agreement without the prior written consent
of Parent. If the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated,
the Equityholders shall treat and hold as confidential any information
concerning the Business and/or the affairs of the Company and each of the
Companys Subsidiaries that is not already

 



-58-  generally available to the public (the " _Confidential Information_ ") and
refrain from using any of the Confidential Information except in connection
with this Agreement, and deliver promptly to Parent or destroy, at the
request of Parent, all tangible embodiments (and all copies) of the
Confidential Information which are in its possession or under its control;
_provided_ that the Equityholders may disclose the Confidential Information
to the extent necessary to complete federal, state or local personal income
Tax Returns. This Agreement shall not be deemed to restrict the Parties or
their respective Affiliates, employees, equityholders, advisors, agents and
representatives from complying with a lawfully issued governmental order or
other legal requirement, including by reason of filings with securities
regulators, to produce or disclose any documents or information subject to
this  _Section 9(e)_ (including as contemplated by _Section 9(a)_).

(f) _Release_. Effective upon the Closing, and except as set forth in the
final sentence of this _Section 9(f)_, each Equityholder hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably waives, releases and forever discharges the
Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries and their respective past
and present directors, officers, employees, agents, predecessors, successors,
assigns, equityholders, partners, insurers, and Affiliates (the " _Released
Parties_ ") from any and all Liabilities of any kind or nature whatsoever,
in each case whether absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated,
known or unknown, and such Equityholder shall not seek to recover any amounts
in connection therewith or thereunder from such Released Parties. Such
released Liabilities shall include any right to recover against the Released
Parties for any indemnification claims made against or paid by an Equityholder
pursuant to _Sections 8_ or _9(c)_. Each Equityholder understands that this is
a full and final release of all claims, demands, causes of action and
Liabilities of any nature whatsoever, whether or not known, suspected or
claimed, that could have been asserted in any legal or equitable proceeding
against the Released Parties, except as expressly set forth in this _Section
9(f)_. Each Equityholder represents that it is not aware of any claim by it
other than the claims that are waived, released and forever discharged by this
_Section 9(f)_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing
contained in this _Section 9(f)_ shall operate to discharge, release or waive
(i) the obligations, covenants and agreements of Parent or Merger Sub arising
under this Agreement or any other agreement, document, instrument or
certificate entered into or executed in connection herewith, (ii) any
indemnification coverage or protections under the DandO Tail Policy or under the
provisions of the Companys Charter and Bylaws, or (iii) any earned but
unpaid employment compensation or benefits owed to such Equityholder by the
Company as of the date of this Agreement and the Closing in connection with
services provided by such Equityholder to the Company as an employee.

 

(g) _Further Assurances_. As a material obligation of each Party to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, from time to time after the
Closing, each Party shall at its own expense use commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) cooperate with the other Party, (ii) perform any further act
and (iii) execute and deliver such documents, instruments or certificates as
may be reasonably requested by the other Parties to this Agreement in order to
effectuate any transaction, act or agreement contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(h) _Specific Performance_. The Parties acknowledge that irreparable damage
would occur in the event of a breach of this Agreement or any other
agreement, document, instrument or certificate contemplated hereby, by any
such Person, money damages may be

 



-59-  inadequate and the non-breaching Party may have no adequate remedy at law.
Accordingly, each of the Parties hereto agrees that the other Parties shall
have the right, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in such
Partys favor, to enforce such Partys rights and each other Partys
obligations hereunder not only by an action or actions for damages but also by
an action or actions for specific performance, injunctive and/or other
equitable relief. If any such action is brought by a Party to enforce this
Agreement or any other agreement, document, instrument or certificate
contemplated hereby, each of the other Parties hereto hereby waives the
defense that there is an adequate remedy at law.

(i) _Equityholders  Representative_.

 

(i) Each Equityholder hereby authorizes, directs and appoints (and each other
holder of Company Capital Stock pursuant to the terms of such Stockholders
Transmittal Letter and the Joinder Agreement and each other Optionholder
pursuant to the terms of such Optionholders Option Cancellation Agreement
shall authorize direct and appoint) Actua USA Corporation to act as sole
and exclusive agent, attorney-in-fact and representative of the Equityholders
(the " _Equityholders  Representative_") and authorizes and directs the
Equityholders Representative to (A) take any and all actions
(including executing and delivering any documents, incurring any costs and
expenses on behalf of the Equityholders and making any and all determinations)
which may be required or permitted by this Agreement to be taken by the
Equityholders, (B) exercise such other rights, power and authority, as are
authorized, delegated and granted to the Equityholders Representative
pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Paying Agent Agreement,
any Transmittal Letter or any Option Cancellation Agreement, and (C) exercise
such rights, power and authority as are incidental to the foregoing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Equityholders Representative shall have no
obligation to act on behalf of the Equityholders, except as provided herein,
in the Escrow Agreement, in the Paying Agent Agreement and the documents
contemplated hereby and thereby. Any such actions taken, exercises of rights,
power or authority, and any decision or determination made by
the Equityholders Representative consistent therewith, shall be absolutely
and irrevocably binding on each Equityholder, and such Equityholders
successors, as if such holder personally had taken such action, exercised such
rights, power or authority or made such decision or determination in such
holders capacity and all defenses which may be available to any Equityholder
to contest, negate or disaffirm the action of the Equityholders
Representative taken in good faith under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement are waived. The powers, immunities and rights to indemnification
granted to the Equityholders Representative Group (as defined below)
hereunder (x) are coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable and
survive the death, incompetence, bankruptcy or liquidation of any Equityholder
and shall be binding on any successor thereto and (y) shall survive the
delivery of an assignment by any Equityholder of the whole or any fraction
of his, her or its interest in the Escrow Fund.

(ii) Each Equityholder agrees that neither the Equityholders Representative
nor its members, managers, directors, officers, contractors, agents and
employees (collectively, the " _Equityholders  Representative Group_"), shall
be liable for any actions taken or omitted to be taken under or in connection
with this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Paying Agent Agreement or any
Equityholders Representative engagement agreement, or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, except for such actions taken or omitted to be
taken resulting from the Equityholders Representatives willful misconduct.
Furthermore, each

 



-60-  Equityholder shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless, severally (and not
jointly), pro rata based upon such Equityholders Pro Rata Share, from and
against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees, costs,
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses of other skilled
professionals and in connection with seeking recovery from insurers),
judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement (collectively, "
_Representative Expenses_ ") paid or incurred by the Equityholders
Representative in connection with the performance of its obligations as
Equityholders Representative, including in the defense of any indemnification
claim brought against the Responsible Persons under _Section 8_. The payment
of such expenses shall first be made by the Equityholders Representative out
of the Reserve Account, second, from any distribution of the Indemnity Escrow
Fund otherwise distributable to the Equityholders at the time of
distribution, and thereafter the Equityholders Representative shall have the
right to demand payment with respect to such expenses from each Equityholder
severally (and not jointly), pro rata based upon each such Equityholders Pro
Rata Share.

(iii) The Reserve Account shall be held by the Equityholders Representative
as agent and for the benefit of the Equityholders in a segregated client
account and shall be used (A) for the purposes of paying directly or
reimbursing the Equityholders Representative for any Representative
Expenses incurred pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any
Equityholders Representative letter agreement, or (B) as otherwise determined
by the Equityholders Representative Group. The Equityholders Representative
is not providing any investment supervision, recommendations or advice and
shall have no responsibility or liability for any loss of principal of the
Reserve Account other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Equityholders Representative is not acting as a withholding
agent or in any similar capacity in connection with the Reserve Account, and
has no tax reporting or income distribution obligations hereunder. The
Equityholders Representative shall release all amounts remaining in the
Reserve Account to the Paying Agent (for further distribution to the
Stockholders) and the Company (for further distribution to the Optionholders)
for further distribution to the Equityholders, in each case in accordance
with the Distribution Waterfall, upon the later of the Release Date (as
defined in the Escrow Agreement) or the resolution of all indemnification
claims against the Responsible Persons still pending as of the Release Date.

 

(iv) The Parties agree that Parent and Merger Sub and, following the Closing,
the Surviving Corporation, shall be entitled to rely on any action taken by
the Equityholders Representative, on behalf of each of the Equityholders,
pursuant to this _Section 9(i)_ (each, an " _Authorized Action_ "), and that
each Authorized Action shall be binding on each Equityholder as fully as if
such Equityholder had taken such Authorized Action. The Equityholders agree to
pay, based on their respective Pro Rata Shares, and to indemnify and hold
harmless, based on their respective Pro Rata Shares, the Parent Group from
and against any Losses which they may suffer, sustain, or become subject to,
as the result of any claim by any Person that an Authorized Action is not
binding on, or enforceable against, any Equityholder.

 

(v) The Equityholders Representative shall be entitled to: (A) rely upon the
Distribution Waterfall, (B) rely upon any signature believed by it to be
genuine, and (C) reasonably assume that a signatory has proper authorization
to sign on behalf of the applicable Equityholder or other party. The
Equityholders Representative may resign at any time following the Closing
Date, and may be removed or replaced by the vote of the Equityholders

 



-61-  who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, held at least a majority of
the outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock, in each case upon five (5)
days prior written notice to Parent. The immunities and rights to
indemnification shall survive the resignation or removal of the Equityholders
Representative and the Closing and/or any termination of this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement and the Paying Agent Agreement. 

(j) _Termination of Certain Contracts_. Each of the Equityholders hereby
agrees that each contract, agreement, or arrangement (other than this
Agreement) between the Company, on the one hand, and such Equityholder on the
other hand identified on _Schedule 9(j)_ shall be terminated effective as of
and conditioned on the Closing and such Equityholder, as applicable,
shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, any further
documentation reasonably requested by Parent to give effect to or evidence the
foregoing.

 

(k) _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, conveyance or similar Taxes or charges arising out of the
transactions contemplated hereby and all charges for or in connection with the
recording of any document, instrument or certificate contemplated hereby shall
be paid fifty percent (50%) by the Equityholders and fifty percent (50%)
by Parent if and when due. Parent will file all necessary Tax Returns and
other documentation in connection with the Taxes and charges encompassed in
this _Section 9(k)_ and, if required by applicable law or to the extent
reasonably requested, each Party shall cooperate in the preparation and
filing and join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation.

 

Section 10\. _Miscellaneous_.

 

(a) _No Third Party Beneficiaries; No Recourse_. Except for (i) the rights of
the Equityholders to receive the applicable portion of the Merger
Consideration, (ii) _Section 4(g)_, which is for the benefit of the DandOs,
and (iii) as otherwise expressly provided herein, the Agreement is not
intended to and shall not confer upon any Person other than the Parties
hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.

(b) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the appendices,
exhibits, schedules and other documents referred to herein) constitutes the
entire agreement among the Parties and supersedes any prior understandings,
agreements or representations by or among the Parties, written or oral, that
may have related in any way to the subject matter hereof.

(c) _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the Parties named herein and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. No Party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval
of the other Parties; _provided_ that Parent may (i) assign any of its rights
and interests hereunder to any affiliate of Parent or any successor to Parent,
the Company or the Business that agrees to or is otherwise responsible for
Parents obligations hereunder (whether by express agreement, operation of
law or otherwise), and (ii) assign its rights under this Agreement to any
lender (or agent on behalf of such lenders) as collateral security for the
obligations of Parent to such lenders.

 



-62- (d) _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart of
a signature page to this Agreement by telecopy or by electronic delivery in
Adobe Portable Document Format or other electronic format based on common
standards will be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of
this Agreement

(e)  _Headings_. The section headings contained in this Agreement are

(g) _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the domestic laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the
application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 

(h) _Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT
JURISDICTION AND VENUE IN ANY ACTION BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY PURSUANT TO THIS
AGREEMENT SHALL PROPERLY AND EXCLUSIVELY LIE IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT
LOCATED IN WILMINGTON, DELAWARE. BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT,
EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS FOR

REQUIRED BY ANY SUCH COURT SHALL CONSTITUTE VALID AND LAWFUL SERVICE OF

RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION RELATED TO OR ARISING OUT OF
THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENT OR ANY

-64- (i) _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment of any provision of this Agreement
shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by each of the
Parties hereto. All waivers of rights under this Agreement shall be in
writing, and no waiver by any Party of any default, misrepresentation, or
breach of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall
be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or
breach of warranty, covenant or agreement hereunder or affect in any way any
rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.

(j) _Incorporation of Appendices, Exhibits and Schedules_. The appendices,
exhibits and schedules identified in this Agreement (including the Disclosure
Schedules delivered in connection herewith) are incorporated herein by
reference and made a part hereof.

 

(k) _Cumulative Remedies_. Subject to the provisions of _Section 8(b)(xii)_,
all rights and remedies of any Party are cumulative of each other and of
every other right or remedy such Party may otherwise have at law or in equity,
and the exercise of one or more rights or remedies shall not prejudice or
impair the concurrent or subsequent exercise of other rights or remedies. 

(l) _Construction_.

 

(i) Each Party agrees that they have been represented by counsel during the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the
application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing
that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against
the party drafting such agreement or document. The Parties intend that
each representation, warranty and covenant contained herein shall have
independent significance. If any Party has breached any representation,
warranty or covenant contained herein (or is otherwise entitled to
indemnification) in any respect, the fact that there exists another
representation, warranty or covenant (including any indemnification provision)
relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of
specificity) which such Party has not breached (or is not otherwise entitled
to indemnification with respect thereto) shall not detract from or mitigate
the fact that such Party is in breach of the first representation, warranty or
covenant (or is otherwise entitled to indemnification pursuant to a
different provision).

(ii) Where specific language is used to clarify by example a general statement
contained herein (such as by using the word "including"), such specific
language shall not be deemed to modify, limit or restrict in any manner the
construction of the general statement to which it relates. The definitions
contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the
plural forms of such terms. Whenever required by the context, any pronoun used
in this Agreement shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine or
neuter forms, and the singular form of nouns, pronouns and verbs shall include
the plural and vice versa. The words "include" and "including," and other
words of similar import when used herein shall not be deemed to be terms of
limitation but rather shall be deemed to be followed in each case by the
words "without limitation." The word "if and other words of similar import
when used herein

 



-65-  shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the phrase "and only if." The
words "herein," "hereto," and "hereby" and other words of similar import
in this Agreement shall be deemed in each case to refer to this Agreement as
a whole and not to any particular Article, Section or other subdivision of
this Agreement. Any reference herein to "dollars" or "$" shall mean
United States dollars. The term "or" shall be deemed to mean "and/or". Any
reference to any particular Code section or any other law will be interpreted
to include any revision of or successor to that section regardless of how it
is numbered or classified and any reference herein to a Governmental
Authority shall be deemed to include reference to any successor thereto. Any
reference herein to "delivered", "provided" or "made available" to
Parent means, with respect to any document or information, that the same has
been made available to Parent with unrestricted access for a continuous period
of at least one (1) Business Day prior to the date of this Agreement by means
of the virtual data room located at Intralinks
(https://services.intralinks.com) under the title "Project Monument".

(iii) The disclosure schedules dated as of the date of this Agreement and
delivered to Parent herewith (the " _Disclosure Schedules_ ") are hereby
incorporated by reference into the sections in which they are directly
referenced; _provided_ that the disclosures and responses set forth in a
particular section of the Disclosure Schedule shall also qualify other
Sections or Subsections of _Section 5_ solely to the extent that it is
reasonably apparent on its face from the text of an exception or response
that such exception or response is applicable to such other Section or
Subsection. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the provision of
monetary or other quantitative thresholds for disclosure on the
Disclosure Schedules does not and shall not be deemed to create or imply a
standard of materiality hereunder.

(m) _Severability of Provisions_. If any term or other provision of this

Company, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that subject to the terms of _Section 8_, the foregoing clauses

-66- (o) _Waiver of Conflicts; Privilege_.

 

(i) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that Pepper Hamilton
LLP (" _Pepper Hamilton_ ") has acted as counsel to the Company, the
Equityholders Representative and each of the Equityholders in connection with
the negotiation of this Agreement and consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. Parent hereby agrees that Pepper Hamilton shall
be deemed to be acceptable counsel pursuant to _Section 8(b)(vi)(A) _hereof.

(ii) Parent hereby consents and agrees to, and agrees to cause the Company to
consent and agree to, Pepper Hamilton representing the Equityholders
Representative and/or any of the Equityholders (collectively, the " _Seller
Parties_ ") after the Closing, including with respect to disputes in which
the interests of the Seller Parties may be directly adverse to Parent and its
Affiliates (including Parent and the Company), so long as doing so will
neither enable nor cause Pepper Hamilton to breach its duty of confidentiality
to the Company.

(iii) In connection with the foregoing, Parent hereby irrevocably waives and
agrees not to assert, and agrees to cause the Company to irrevocably waive
and not to assert, any conflict of interest arising from or in connection with
(A) Pepper Hamiltons prior representation of the Company or (B) Pepper
Hamiltons representation of the Seller Parties prior to and after the
Closing.

(iv) Parent further agrees, on behalf of itself and, after the Closing, on
behalf of the Company, that all communications in any form or format
whatsoever between or among any of Pepper Hamilton, the Company, any of the
Seller Parties, or any of their respective directors, officers employees or
other representatives that directly relate to the negotiation, documentation
and consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
dispute arising under this Agreement (collectively, the " _Deal
Communications_ ") shall be deemed to be retained and owned collectively by
the Equityholders, shall be controlled by the Equityholders Representative on
behalf of the Equityholders and shall not pass to or be claimed by Parent or
the Company. All Deal Communications that are attorney-client privileged (the
" _Privileged Deal Communications_ ") shall remain privileged after the
Closing and the privilege and the expectation of client confidence relating
thereto shall belong solely to the Equityholders Representative and
the Equityholders, shall be controlled by the Equityholders Representative
on behalf of the Equityholders and shall not pass to or be claimed by Parent
or the Company.

 

(v) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
Parent or the Company on the one hand, and a third party other than the
Equityholders Representative or any Equityholders, on the other hand, Parent
or the Company may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent the
disclosure of the Privileged Deal Communications to such third party;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that none of Parent or the Company may waive such
privilege without the prior written consent of the Equityholders
Representative. In the event that Parent or the Company is legally required by
governmental order or otherwise to access or obtain a

 



-67-  copy of all or a portion of the Deal Communications, Parent (x) shall, to
the extent legally permissible, reasonably promptly notify the Equityholders
Representative in writing (including by making specific reference to this
_Section 10(o)_), (y) agrees that the Equityholders Representative can seek
a protective order and (z) agrees to use, at the Equityholders
Representatives sole cost and expense, commercially reasonable efforts to
assist therewith.

(vi) To the extent that files or other materials maintained by Pepper
Hamilton constitute property of its clients, only the Equityholders
Representative and the Equityholders shall hold such property rights and
Pepper Hamilton shall have no duty to reveal or disclose any such files or
other materials or any Deal Communications by reason of any attorney-client
relationship between Pepper Hamilton, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand.

 

(vii) Parent agrees that it will not, and that it will cause the Company not
to, (A) access or use the Deal Communications, including by way of review of
any electronic data, communications or other information, or by seeking to
have the Equityholders Representative or any Equityholders waive the
attorney-client or other privilege, or by otherwise asserting that Parent or
the Company has the right to waive the attorney-client or other privilege or
(B) seek to obtain the Deal Communications from Pepper Hamilton. In
furtherance of the foregoing, it shall not be a breach of any provision of
this Agreement if prior to the Closing the Company, the Equityholders
Representative and/or any Equityholders, or any of their respective directors,
officers employees or other representatives takes any action to protect from
access or remove from the premises of the Company (or any offsite back-up or
other facilities) any Deal Communications, including by segregating,
encrypting, copying, deleting, erasing, exporting or otherwise taking
possession of any Deal Communications (any such action, a " _Permitted
Removal_ "). In the event that, notwithstanding any good faith attempts by the
Equityholders Representative or any Equityholders, or any of their respective
directors, officers, employees or other representatives to achieve a
Permitted Removal of any Deal Communication, any copy, backup, image, or other
form or version or electronic vestige of any portion of such Deal
Communication remains accessible to or discoverable or retrievable by Parent
(each, a " _Residual Communication_ "), Parent agrees that it will not, and
that it will cause the Company and its respective directors, officers,
employees or other representatives not to intentionally use or attempt to use
any means to access, retrieve, restore, recreate, unarchive or otherwise gain
access to or view any Residual Communication for any purpose.

(viii) In the event that Parent or the Company receives a subpoena or other
discovery request pursuant to state or federal law that calls for the search
for documents that may include Deal Communications, nothing herein shall
preclude Parent or the Company from complying with its legal obligations to
do so.
