and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;



WHEREAS, in order to induce the Company to enter into this Agreement,
concurrently herewith, Parent and the Company are entering into a line of
credit agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ (the " _Credit

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger;



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties hereto agree
as follows:



ARTICLE I



The Merger



Section 1.01 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into
the Company at the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue
as the surviving entity in the Merger (the " _Surviving Entity_ ") in
accordance with the DGCL.



Section 1.02 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will
take place at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be specified by the parties (the "
_Closing Date_ "), which shall be no later than the second business day after

those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time), at
the offices of Dorsey and Whitney LLP, 50 South Sixth Street, Minneapolis,
Minnesota 55402, unless another date or place is agreed to in writing by the
parties hereto.

 Section 1.03 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file a certificate
of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") executed in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the DGCL and, as soon as practicable on or after the
Closing Date, shall make all other filings or recordings required under the
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of
Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or
at such other time as Parent and the Company shall agree and shall specify in
the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the "
_Effective Time_ ").



Section 1.04 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.



Section 1.05 _Certificate of Incorporation; By-Laws_.



(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company
shall be amended so as to read in its entirety in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit D_ , and, as so amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation of
the Surviving Entity until thereafter amended in accordance with its terms
and applicable Law.



(b) At the Effective Time, the by-laws of the Company shall be amended so as
to read in its entirety in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_ , and, as
so amended, shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Entity until thereafter
amended in accordance with their terms, the certificate of incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation and applicable Law.



Section 1.06 _Directors and Officers_. The directors of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall submit their resignations to be
effective as the of the Effective Time. Immediately after the Effective Time,
Parent shall take the necessary actions to cause the directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time to be the directors of the Surviving
Entity, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Entity. The officers of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Entity, each to hold office until the earlier of his or her resignation or
removal.



ARTICLE II



Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the Constituent 

Entities; Exchange of Certificates; Company Stock Options



Section 2.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common
Stock_ ") or of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger
Sub (" _Merger Sub Common Stock_ "): 



(a) _Shares of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of Merger Sub
Common Stock immediately prior to the Merger shall be converted into one
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Entity.



 

2 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock that
is owned by the Company (as treasury stock or otherwise), automatically shall
be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no shares of Parent
Common Stock, cash or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.



(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.02(e), each
share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b) and
other than as provided in Section 2.02(k) with respect to shares of Company
Common Stock held by persons who object to the Merger and comply with all
provisions of the DGCL concerning the right of such holders to dissent from
the Merger and demand appraisal for their shares) shall be converted into and
become the right to receive (i) $1.125 in cash (the " _Cash Consideration_
"); plus (ii) a number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_
") at an exchange ratio (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") as determined in
accordance with this Section 2.01 (the " _Stock Consideration_ "). The Cash
Consideration and the Stock Consideration, together with any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid pursuant to Section
2.02(e), is referred to collectively herein as the " _Merger Consideration_."



(i) If the Average Parent Stock Price (as defined below) is equal to or more
than $ 31.7055 (the "Upper Limit"), then the Exchange Ratio shall be .0828
shares of Parent Common Stock for each share of Company Common Stock.



(ii) If the Average Parent Stock Price is less than the Upper Limit, but more
than $23.4345 (the "Lower Limit"), then the Exchange Ratio shall be equal to
a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock for each share of Company Common
Stock determined by dividing 2.625 by the Average Parent Stock Price.



(iii) If the Average Parent Stock Price is equal to or less than the Lower
Limit, then the Exchange Ratio shall be 0.1120 shares of Parent Common Stock
for each share of Company Common Stock.



For the purposes of this Agreement, " _Average Parent Stock Price_ " means the
average of the closing sales price per share of Parent Common Stock as
reported by NASDAQ National Market (" _NASDAQ_ ") (or, if not reported
thereby, as reported by any other authoritative source) on each of the five
consecutive trading days immediately preceding the third trading day prior to
the Closing Date.



As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate which immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock
(each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any
dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.02(c), in each case to be issued or paid in consideration therefor
upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.02(b), without
interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or
Company  



 

3  Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class, by reason of the occurrence or record date of any
stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction, the Merger
Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange
of shares or similar transaction.



Section 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates_.



(a) _Exchange Agent_. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. or such other bank or trust company as may be
designated by Parent, with the Companys prior written consent, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for
exchange in accordance with this Article II (i) cash and certificates
representing the shares of Parent Common Stock to be delivered pursuant to
Section 2.01(c) in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock,
(ii) and from time to time as needed, additional cash sufficient to pay cash
in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.02(e) hereof and any
dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.02(c) hereof (such
cash and shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or other
distributions with respect thereto with a record date after the Effective Time
and any cash payments in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").



(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record
of a Certificate whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c), (i) a
form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in
customary form and shall have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates in
exchange for cash and/or certificates representing the Merger Consideration,
any dividends or other distributions to which holders of Certificates are
entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holders are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.02(e). Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed, and such other documents as may be reasonably required by
the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor (A) a certificate representing that number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive
as Stock Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Article II after
taking into account all the shares of Company Common Stock then held by such
holder under all such Certificates so surrendered and (B) a check for the
cash that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to the provisions of
this Article II, including any Cash Consideration, any dividends or other
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c)
and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e), and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer
of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, (w) a certificate representing the proper
number of shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, (x) a check for the
cash that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to the  



 

4  provisions of this Article II, including any Cash Consideration, any
dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.02(c) and (y) cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e), may
be issued to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if, upon presentation to the Exchange Agent, such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the issuance of cash and/or shares of
Parent Common Stock to a person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this Section 2.02(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at
any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions
to which the holder of such Certificate is entitled pursuant to Section
2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e). No interest will be
paid or will accrue on the Merger Consideration or on any cash payable to
holders of Certificates pursuant to Section 2.02(c) or (e).



(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the share of Parent Common Stock that the holder
thereof has the right to receive upon the surrender thereof, and no cash
payment in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
Section 2.02(e), shall be paid to any such holder, in each case until the
holder of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with
this Article II. Following surrender of any Certificate, there shall be paid
to the holder thereof (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of cash
payable in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e), and the amount of dividends
or other distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and paid with respect
to Parent Common Stock prior to such surrender and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date
subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of
Parent Common Stock.



(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Stock
Consideration issued and cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II (including any
Cash Consideration, any dividends or other distributions paid pursuant to
Section 2.02(c) and cash paid in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.02(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common
Stock previously represented by such Certificates, and at the close of
business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Entity
of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time. Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.02(f), if, at
any time after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this Article II.



 

5 (e) No Fractional Shares.



(i) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no
dividends or other distributions of Parent shall relate to such fractional
share interests and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of Parent.



(ii) In lieu of such fractional share interests, Parent shall pay to each
former holder of shares of Company Common Stock an amount in cash equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (1) the fractional share interest to which
such former holder (after taking into account all shares of Company Common
Stock held at the Effective Time by such holder) would otherwise be entitled
by (2) the Average Parent Stock Price. As promptly as practicable after the
determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of
fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Entity to deposit such amount with the Exchange
Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders
of fractional interests subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof.



(f)  _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for nine months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders
of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for the Merger
Consideration, any dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of
Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock in accordance with this Article II. If any Certificate shall not
have been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which any Merger
Consideration (and all dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.02(c) and all cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.02(e)) would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority (as defined below), any such Merger Consideration (and
all dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and
all cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.02(e)) in
respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto.



(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any shares of Parent Common
Stock (or dividends or other distributions with respect thereto) or cash in
lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or cash from the Exchange
Fund, in each case delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.



(h) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be the
property of, and shall be paid to, Parent. Any losses resulting from such
investments shall not in any way diminish Parents and Merger Subs obligation
to pay the full amount of the Merger Consideration.



 

6 (i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as
Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration, any
dividends or other distributions to which the holder of such Certificate
would be entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any
fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would be entitled
pursuant to Section 2.02(e), in each case in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement.



(j)  _Withholding Rights_. The Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
or under any provision of state or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for the purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the former holder of the shares of Company Common Stock. The
Exchange Agent shall sell in the open market such shares of Parent Common
Stock on behalf of the former holder of Company Common Stock as is necessary
to satisfy such withholding obligation and shall pay such cash proceeds to the
appropriate taxing authority.



(k) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding Section 2.01(c), any shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
held by a person who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto
in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with
the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into a right to
receive the Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect or
withdraws or otherwise loses its rights to appraisal or it is determined that
such holder does not have appraisal rights in accordance with Delaware Law.
If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or
loses its right to appraisal, or if it is determined that such holder does
not have appraisal rights, such shares shall be treated as if they had been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. The Company shall give Parent and Merger Sub prompt notice of
any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares, and Parent and
Merger Sub shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands except as required by applicable Law.
The Company shall not, except with prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands,
unless and to the extent required to do so under applicable Law.



Section 2.03 _Company Equity Awards and Warrants_.



(a) All stock options (the " _Company Stock Options_ ") and restricted stock
units (" _Company RSUs_ " and, collectively, with Company Stock Options, "
_Company Equity Awards_ ") outstanding, whether or not exercisable and whether
or not vested, at the Effective Time granted under the Companys 1993 and
1998 Employee Share Option and Restricted Share Plans, the Companys Directors
Option Plan, the Companys 2002 Plan, the Companys 2002 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan and the Dean J. Mitchell Employment  



 

7  Inducement Equity Plan (collectively, the " _Company Stock Plans_ ") and
under agreements with consultants shall vest in full thirty (30) days prior
to the Effective Time, and the holders shall have the right (subject to
applicable limits in the Company Stock Plans) to exercise the Company Stock
Options until immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that, these
events shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. At the
Effective Time, all of the Company Equity Awards shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any further action on the part of the Company or the holder
thereof, be terminated, and Parent shall have assumed the Company Stock Plans
as of the Effective Time by virtue of this Agreement and without any further
action by Parent. From and after the Effective Time, all references to the
Company in the Company Stock Plans shall be deemed to refer to Parent. To the
extent that the holder of a Company Equity Award is eligible to receive awards
of stock options or restricted stock units for Parent Common Stock under the
terms of the assumed Company Stock Plans, the holder shall receive an option
or restricted stock unit for shares of Parent Common Stock, in such numbers of
shares of Parent Common Stock, and with such vesting terms and exercise prices
as Parent shall determine (each, a " _New Equity Award_ "). Parent shall
promptly file a Form S-8 or a post-effective amendment to the Companys Forms
S-8s to register all shares underlying New Equity Awards. __



(b) At the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed between Parent and the
holders thereof, all outstanding warrants to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock (all such warrants of a warrant holder having the same exercise
price, a " _Company Warrant_ ") shall be converted into a warrant to acquire
shares of Parent Common Stock on the terms and conditions as are applicable
under such Company Warrant (all such new warrants of a warrant holder, a "
_Substitute Warrant_ "). At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all reasonable action, if any, necessary with respect to the applicable
warrants or warrant agreements to permit the replacement of the outstanding
Company Warrants by Parent pursuant to this Section.



(c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
deliver, or cause to be delivered, to each holder of a New Equity Award or
Substitute Warrant a notice setting forth such holders rights pursuant
thereto. Except as provided herein, Parent shall comply with the terms of all
such New Equity Awards and Substitute Warrants. Parent shall take all
actions with respect to the Company Stock Plans, the Company Equity Awards
and the Company Warrants that are necessary to implement the provisions of
this Section 2.03, including all corporate action necessary to reserve for
issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery
upon exercise of New Equity Awards or Substitute Warrants pursuant to the
terms set forth in this Section 2.03.

any section of such disclosure letter in such a way as to make its relevance
to a representation or representations made elsewhere in this Agreement or
information called for by another section of such disclosure letter
reasonably  



 

8  apparent shall be deemed to be an exception to such representation or
representations or to be disclosed on such other section of such disclosure
letter notwithstanding the omission of a reference or cross reference
thereto) delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the execution of this
Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") or in the Company SEC
Documents filed since January 31, 2005 (other than any information included
in or provided as part of any risk factors, cautionary statements or other

all requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now being
conducted. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or
licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which
the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than in
such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed
individually or in the aggregate has not resulted in, and would not reasonably
be expected to result in, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has
made available to Parent complete and correct copies of its Certificate of
Incorporation (the " _Company Certificate_ ") and By-laws (the " _Company By-
laws_ ") and the certificate of incorporation and by-laws (or comparable
organizational documents) of each of its Subsidiaries, in each case as amended

Section 3.02 _Subsidiaries_. Section 3.02 of the Company Disclosure Letter
lists all the Subsidiaries of the Company and, for each such Subsidiary, the
jurisdiction of formation and each jurisdiction in which such Subsidiary is
qualified or licensed to do business. All the outstanding shares of capital
stock of, or other equity interests in, each Subsidiary have been validly
issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned directly or
indirectly by the Company free and clear of all pledges, claims, liens,
charges, encumbrances or security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever
(collectively, " _Liens_ "), and free of any restriction on the right to
vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other equity
interests. Except for the capital stock or other equity or voting interests of
its Subsidiaries and publicly traded securities held for investment which do
not exceed 5% of the outstanding securities of any entity, the Company does
not own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock or other equity or voting
interests in any person.

shares of Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans or
otherwise, the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto,
whether or not a stock option is an incentive stock option, expiration dates

Company are, and all shares which may be issued pursuant to the Company Stock
Plans will be, when issued in accordance with the terms thereof, duly

preemptive rights.



 

(c) Except for the Convertible Notes, there are no bonds, debentures, notes or
other indebtedness of the Company having the right to vote (or convertible
into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters
on which stockholders of the Company may vote. Except as set forth above in
this Section 3.03, (i) there are not issued, reserved for issuance
or outstanding (A) any securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) there are not
any outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any such securities or to
issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, any such

voting agreement with respect to the voting of any such securities.



Section 3.04 _Authority; Noncontravention_.



(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
this Agreement and, subject to the adoption of this Agreement and the Merger
by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of Company Common  



 

10  Stock (the " _Company Stockholder Approval_ "), to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of
the Company, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company
are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, subject, in the case of the Merger, to receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery by each of the other parties hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, solvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other Laws affecting
creditors rights generally from time to time in effect and by general
principles of equity). The Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held at
which all of the directors of the Company were present in person or by
telephone, unanimously adopted resolutions (i) declaring that this Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
advisable and in the best interests of the Company and the Companys
stockholders, (ii) approving and adopting this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) directing that the
adoption of this Agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of the
stockholders of the Company and (iv) recommending that the stockholders of the
Company adopt this Agreement. The Company Board has taken all action
necessary to render the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL inapplicable to
this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. No "fair price", "merger moratorium", "control share acquisition"
or other anti-takeover or similar statute or regulation applies or purports to
apply to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The Company has amended the Stockholder Rights Agreement
between the Company and American Stock Transfer and Trust Company dated
September 26, 1995, as amended to date (the " _Company Rights Plan_ ") so that
(i) neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (i) cause the Rights
(as defined therein) to become exercisable, (ii) cause Parent or any of its
Affiliates or Associates (as each such term is defined in the Company Rights
Plan) to become an Acquiring Person (as such term is defined in the Company
Rights Plan) or (iii) give rise to a Stock Acquisition Date or a Distribution
Date (as each such term is defined in the Company Rights Plan), and (b) the
Rights will expire immediately prior to the Effective Time without any
payment being made in respect thereof. The Company has made available to
Parent a true and complete copy of such amendment.



(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement do not, and the consummation
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
compliance with the provisions of this Agreement will not, conflict with, or
result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or without notice or
lapse of time or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a benefit
under, or result in the creation of any Lien in or upon any of the properties
or other assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under, (i)
the Company Certificate or the Company By-laws or the comparable
organizational documents of any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any loan or credit
agreement, bond, debenture, note, mortgage, indenture, lease or other
contract, agreement, obligation, commitment, instrument or license (each, a "
_Contract_ "), to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or
any of their respective properties or other assets is subject or  



 

11  (iii) subject to the governmental filings and other matters referred to in
Section 3.05, any Law applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or their respective properties or other assets, other than, in the case of
clauses (ii) and (iii), any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults,
rights, losses or Liens that individually or in the aggregate (A) have not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect, (B) would not reasonably be expected to impair in any material respect
the ability of the Company to perform its obligations hereunder and (C) would
not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



(c) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ "
shall mean any effect that is materially adverse to the business, financial
condition or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, other than any effect relating to or resulting from (a) the
economy or the financial markets in general, (b) the industry in which
the Company and its Subsidiaries operate in general, or (c) the announcement
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (provided that the
exclusion set forth in this clause (c) shall not apply to Section 3.04(b)
hereof); _provided_  that with respect to clauses (a) and (b), such effect
(i) does not specifically relate to (or have the effect of specifically
relating to) the Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) is not more adverse to
the Company and its Subsidiaries than to other companies operating in the
industry in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the occurrence of one or more of the following events or
conditions between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date shall not
give rise to a Company Material Adverse Effect: (A) adverse developments in
the Companys business due to losses from operations, inadequate cash reserves
or reduced sales levels; (B) matters reasonably foreseeable resulting from
the Companys clinical trials, including adverse events or serious adverse
events; and (C) loss of key personnel.



Section 3.05 _Governmental Approvals_. No consent, approval, order or
authorization of, action by or in respect of, or registration, declaration
or filing with, any Federal, state, local or foreign government, any court,
administrative, regulatory or other governmental agency, commission or
authority or any non-governmental self-regulatory agency, commission or
authority (each, a " _Governmental Authority_ ") is required by or with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company or the consummation by
the Company of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except for those required under or in relation to (a) the premerger
notification and report form under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust

(the " _Securities Act_ "), (c) the Exchange Act, (d) the Certificate of
Merger to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and
appropriate documents to be filed with the relevant authorities of other
states in which the Company is qualified to do business, (e) any appropriate
filings with and approvals of NASDAQ, (f) state securities or "blue sky" laws
and (g) the applicable requirements of antitrust or other competition laws of
other jurisdictions or investment laws relating to foreign ownership, if any,
and (h) such other consents, approvals, orders, authorizations,
registrations, declarations and filings the failure of which to be obtained
or made individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to
(x) have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (y) impair in any material respect
the ability of the Company to perform its obligations hereunder or (z)
prevent or materially delay the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.  



 

12  The consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations
and filings set forth in (a) through (h) above or listed in Section 3.05 of
the Company Disclosure Letter are referred to herein as " _Necessary
Consents_."



Section 3.06 _Company SEC Documents; No Undisclosed Liabilities_.



(a) The Company has filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements,
certifications and other documents (including exhibits and other information
incorporated therein) required to be filed by the Company with the SEC since
December 31, 2001 (the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). No Subsidiary of the
Company is required to file, or files, any form, report or other
document with the SEC. As of their respective dates, the Company SEC
Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act, or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, applicable to such
Company SEC Documents, and none of the Company SEC Documents contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, unless such information contained in any Company SEC Document has
been corrected by a later-filed Company SEC Document. The financial statements
of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents comply as to form in all
material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") (except,

16  adverse modification of any such Permit that individually or in the

Section 3.12 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

complete list of: all "employee benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(3) of
the  



 

17  Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "),
and all other employee benefit plans, programs, agreements,
policies, arrangements or payroll practices, including bonus plans,
employment, consulting or other compensation agreements, collective bargaining
agreements, Company Stock Plans, individual stock option agreements to which
the Company is a party granting stock options to acquire Company Common Stock
that have not been granted under a Company Stock Plan, incentive and other
equity or equity-based compensation, or deferred compensation arrangements,
change in control, termination or severance plans or arrangements, stock
purchase, severance pay, sick leave, vacation pay, salary continuation for

IRS determination letter; (iv) summary plan descriptions; and (v) material
written communications to employees generally.

terms and with all provisions of ERISA, the Code and other applicable Laws,
and neither the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries) nor any "party in
interest" or "disqualified person" with respect to the Company Plans has
engaged in a non-exempt "prohibited transaction" within the meaning of
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA, except as individually or in
the aggregate have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. No fiduciary has any liability for breach

expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code or (ii) any

requirements, with such exceptions that  



 

18  individually or in the aggregate have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.



(f) All contributions (including all employer contributions and employee
salary reduction contributions) required to have been made under any of the

lawsuits that have been asserted or instituted against the Company Plans, the
assets of any of the trusts under the Company Plans or the sponsor or
administrator of any of the Company Plans, or against any fiduciary of the
Company Plans with respect to the operation of any of the Company Plans (other
than routine benefit claims), nor does the Company have any Knowledge of
facts that could form the basis for any such action, claim or lawsuit, other
than such actions, claims or lawsuits that individually or in the aggregate
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

participant, except as may be required under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (" _COBRA_ "), or applicable state law,
and at the expense of the participant or the participants beneficiary. Each

within the meaning Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code has complied with the notice
and continuation requirements of Section 4980B of the Code, COBRA, Part 6 of
Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and the regulations thereunder, except where
the failure to comply individually or in the aggregate has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.



 

(i) Except as set forth in Section 3.12(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter
(to the extent applicable, in each case broken down as to each item, and the
individual and amount involved), neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Company Stockholder Approval or the Merger, will (i) result in
any payment becoming due to any Employee, (ii) increase any benefits
otherwise payable under any Company Plan, (iii) result in the acceleration of
the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits under any Company Plan or
(iv) result in any obligation to fund any trust or other arrangement with
respect to compensation or benefits under a Company Plan. Except as set forth

Subsidiaries (other than through a contract with an organization other than

of its Subsidiaries for Federal income tax purposes by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is not an employee for such purposes, except as individually

good standing, has not been revoked, rescinded, amended or modified, and
to Parents and its Subsidiaries Knowledge, no event has occurred or
notification received by Parent or its Subsidiaries from the FDA, a notified
body or any other party that would materially adversely affect or otherwise
jeopardize the FDA or other regulatory approval status of such products or

be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements contained
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

Subsidiaries, they own free and clear of all Liens or have a valid license to

Subsidiaries as currently conducted, does not infringe or misappropriate the
Intellectual Property rights of any third party in any material respect, and
to the Knowledge of the Parent and its Subsidiaries, no claim is pending or

foregoing. The patents (excluding patent applications) included in the Parent
Intellectual Property are, to the Knowledge of the Parent and its

or unenforceable in whole or part. No legal proceedings are pending or, to the

Subsidiaries (i) challenging or seeking to deny or restrict the use of any of
the Parent Intellectual Property, or (ii) alleging that any services provided
by, processes used by, or products manufactured or sold or to be manufactured
or sold by the Parent or any Subsidiary infringe or misappropriate
any Intellectual Property right of any third party. To the Knowledge of the

transactions contemplated hereby on a timely basis in accordance with this
Agreement.

 



Section 4.19 _No Other Representations or Warranties_.



(a) Except for the representations and warranties contained in Article IV of
this Agreement, the Company acknowledges that none of Parent, Merger Sub or
any other person on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub makes any other express or
implied representation or warranty with respect to Parent or Merger Sub
with respect to any other information provided to the Company. Except in the
case of fraud or willful misrepresentation, none of Parent, Merger Sub or any
other person will have or be subject to any liability or indemnification
obligation to the Company or any other person resulting from the distribution
to the Company, or use by the Company of, any such information, including any
information, documents, projections, forecasts  



 

41  or other material made available to the Company in certain "data rooms,"

Subsidiaries, the Company has received or may receive from Parent and/or its
Subsidiaries certain projections, forward-looking statements and other
forecasts and certain business plan information. The Company acknowledges that

projections and other forecasts and plans, that the Company is familiar with
such uncertainties, that the Company is taking full responsibility for making
its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections
and plans so furnished to it (including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts and plans), and that,
absent fraud or willful misrepresentation, the Company shall have no claim
against anyone with respect thereto. Accordingly, the Company acknowledges
that Parent makes no representation or warranty with respect to such
estimates, projections, forecasts or plans (including the reasonableness of
the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts or plans.)

Agreement, the Company and Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of their
respective Subsidiaries to, take any action that would reasonably be expected

of Parent, made by Merger Sub) contained in this Agreement that is qualified
as to materiality, Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material
Adverse Effect, as the case may be, becoming untrue or inaccurate in any

in the case of Parent, of Merger Sub) to comply with or satisfy in any
respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ that no such notification
shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall
promptly provide the other copies of all filings made by such party with any
Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement and the transactions

Section 5.02 _No Solicitation by the Company_.



(a) From and after the date hereof, the Company shall not, nor shall it
authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries, any of its or their respective
directors, officers, employees or any investment banker, financial advisor,
attorney, accountant or other advisor, agent or representative retained by the
Company or any Subsidiary in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to, directly or
indirectly through another person, (i) solicit, initiate, cause, knowingly
encourage, or knowingly facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any
proposal that constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Company
Takeover Proposal or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding any Company Takeover Proposal, or furnish to any person any
information in connection with or in furtherance of any Company Takeover
Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of
the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any Representative of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be a breach of this Section
5.02(a) by the Company. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
and instruct its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any person
conducted heretofore with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal and
request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
previously furnished. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (and in no event after obtaining
such Company Stockholder  



 

46  Approval), in response to an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Company
Takeover Proposal made after the date hereof that the Company Board determines
in good faith (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation and outside counsel and in light of all circumstances
that the Company Board deems reasonably relevant, including, without
limitation, the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement)
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Company Superior Proposal,
the Company may, if the Company Board determines in good faith (after
receiving advice of its outside counsel) that its failure to do so could
reasonably be expected to be considered a breach of its fiduciary duties to
the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, and subject to
compliance with Section 5.02(c) after giving Parent at least 24 hours
prior written notice of such determination, (A) furnish information with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the person making such Company
Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of such person than the
Confidentiality Agreement (except for such changes specifically necessary in
order for the Company to be able to comply with its obligations under this
Agreement), _provided_ that all such information (to the extent that such
information has not been previously provided or made available to Parent) is
provided or made available to Parent, as the case may be, prior to or
substantially concurrent with the time it is provided or made available to
such person, as the case may be, and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the person making such Company Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives) regarding such Company Takeover Proposal.



For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Takeover Proposal_ " shall mean
any inquiry, proposal or offer, whether or not conditional and whether or not
withdrawn, (a) for a merger, consolidation, dissolution, recapitalization or
other business combination involving the Company, (b) for the issuance of 20%
or more of the equity securities of the Company as consideration for the
assets or securities of another person or (c) to acquire in any manner,
directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the equity securities of the Company or
assets (including equity securities of any Subsidiary of the Company) that
represent 20% or more of the total consolidated assets of the Company, other
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the divestiture by
the Company of the Aggrastat product. 



For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Superior Proposal_ " shall mean
any _bona fide_ written offer made by a third party, that if consummated would
result in such person (or its stockholders) owning, directly or indirectly,
greater than 50% of the shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding (or
of the surviving entity in a merger or the direct or indirect parent of the
surviving entity in a merger) or all or substantially all of the total
consolidated assets of the Company which the Company Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and outside counsel and in light of all circumstances that the
Company Board deems reasonably relevant, including, without limitation, the
terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement) (i) to be more
favorable to the stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view
than the Merger and (ii) is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into
account any financing and approval requirements and all other financial,
legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal.



(b) Subject to Section 6.01(b), neither the Company Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the
approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by such Company Board
or any such committee thereof of this Agreement or the Merger or (B)
recommend, adopt or approve, or  



 

47  propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Company Takeover
Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a "
_Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ " or (ii) approve or recommend, or
propose to approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or
other similar agreement constituting or related to, any Company Takeover
Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement pursuant to Section
5.02(a)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Board may make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change if such Company Board determines in good faith
(after receiving advice of its outside counsel) that its failure to do so
could reasonably be expected to be considered a breach of its fiduciary duties
to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no Company Adverse Recommendation Change may be made in
response to a Company Takeover Proposal until after the fifth business day
following Parents receipt of written notice from the Company (an " _Adverse
Recommendation Notice_ ") advising Parent that the Company Board has
determined that such Company Takeover Proposal is a Company Superior
Proposal, that the Company Board intends to make such Company Adverse
Recommendation Change and containing all information required by Section
5.02(c), together with copies of any written offer or proposal in respect of
such Company Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of such Company
Superior Proposal shall require a new Adverse Recommendation Notice and a
new five (5) business day period). In determining whether to make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Company Superior Proposal, the
Company Board shall take into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent (in response to an Adverse Recommendation
Notice) in determining whether such third party Company Takeover Proposal
shall constitute a Company Superior Proposal.



(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a)
and (b) of this Section 5.02, the Company shall promptly advise Parent orally
and in writing of any request for information or other inquiry that the
Company reasonably believes could lead to any Company Takeover Proposal, the
terms and conditions of any such request, Company Takeover Proposal or
inquiry (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the person making
any such request, Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall
promptly keep Parent fully informed of the status and details (including
any change to the terms thereof) of any such request, Company Takeover
Proposal or inquiry.



(d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 shall prohibit the Company from (i)
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any required disclosure to the stockholders of the
Company if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board (after receiving
advice of its outside counsel), failure to so disclose would be inconsistent
with its obligations under applicable Law.

Additional Agreements



Section 6.01 _Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement; Stockholder
Meetings_.



(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall file with the SEC the Proxy Statement and Parent shall prepare and
Parent shall file with the SEC the Form S-4, in which the Proxy Statement will
be included as a prospectus. Each of the Company and Parent will
respond promptly to any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC on the
Proxy Statement or Form S-4. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its
reasonable efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and keep the Form
S-4 effective for so long as necessary to consummate the Merger. The Company
shall use its reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to
the stockholders of the Company as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4
is declared effective under the Securities Act. Parent shall also take any
action required to be taken under any applicable state securities Laws in
connection with the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger,
and the Company shall furnish all information concerning the Company and the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock as may be reasonably requested by
Parent in connection with any such action. No filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, the Form S-4 will be made by Parent, and no filing of, or
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company,
without providing the other party and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by the Company or
Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either the
Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement, so that either such document would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company. The parties shall notify each other promptly of
the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any
request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to
the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or for additional information and shall
supply each other with copies of (i) all correspondence between it or any of
its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC,
on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement, the Form S-4 or the
Merger and (ii) all orders of the SEC relating to the Form S-4.



(b) The Company shall, as soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, establish a record date for and promptly take any and all actions
in connection therewith, and as soon as practicable after the Form S-4 is
declared effective, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold, a meeting of
its stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") solely for
the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval. Subject to Section
5.02(b), the Company shall, through the Company Board, recommend to its
stockholders adoption of this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this  



 

49  Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if,
at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the
Companys stockholders in accordance with this Agreement, the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation and outside counsel and in light of all
circumstances that the Company Board deems reasonably relevant, including,
without limitation, the terms and conditions of such proposal and this
Agreement), in response to a bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal that
was unsolicited and did not otherwise result from a material breach of
Section 5.02(a), that such proposal is a Company Superior Proposal and the
Company Boards failure to terminate this Agreement to accept such Company
Superior Proposal and/or recommend such Company Superior Proposal to
the stockholders of the Company could reasonably be expected to be considered
a breach of its fiduciary duties, the Company may terminate this Agreement
and/or the Company Board may approve or recommend such Company Superior
Proposal to its stockholders, and immediately prior to or concurrently with
the termination of this Agreement enter into any agreement, understanding,
letter of intent or arrangement with respect to such Company Superior
Proposal, as applicable; provided, however, that the Company shall not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this sentence or approve or recommend
such Company Superior Proposal until after the fifth business day following
Parents receipt of written notice from the Company advising Parent that the
Company Board has determined to terminate this Agreement or approve or
recommend such Company Superior Proposal and containing all information
required by Section 5.02(c) together with copies of any written offer or
proposal in respect of such Company Superior Proposal (it being understood
and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or other material terms
of such Company Superior Proposal shall require a new notice from the Company
and a new five business day period), and any purported termination pursuant
to this sentence shall be void and of no force or effect, unless concurrently
with such termination pursuant to this Section 6.01(b) the Company pays to
Parent the Company Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section 8.02(a)(iv).



Section 6.02 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.



(a) Each party shall afford to the other parties hereto, and the other
parties Representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours
during the period prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this
Agreement to all its and its Subsidiaries properties, books, contracts,
commitments, personnel and records and, during such period, each party shall
furnish promptly to the others (a) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed by such party during such
period pursuant to the requirements of Federal or state securities Laws and
(b) consistent with its legal obligations all other information concerning
such party and its Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel as
the other party may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that either
party may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that any law, treaty,
rule or regulation of any Governmental Authority applicable to such party
requires such party or its Subsidiaries to restrict access to any properties
or information. Except for disclosures expressly permitted by the terms of the
confidentiality agreement, dated as of April 28, 2005, between Parent and the
Company (as it may be amended from time to time, the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), each party shall hold, and shall cause its Representatives to
hold, all information received from the other party, directly or indirectly,
in confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. No
investigation pursuant to this Section 6.02 or information provided, made
available or received by any party hereto pursuant to this Agreement will
affect any of the representations or warranties of the  



 

50  parties hereto contained in this Agreement or the conditions hereunder to
the obligations of the parties hereto.



(b) In addition to and without limiting the foregoing, from the date hereof
until the Effective Time, the Company shall furnish to Parent, within eighteen
(18) business days after the end of each month, the standard monthly reporting
package set forth in Section 6.02(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter. 



Section 6.03 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (a) the taking of
all acts necessary to cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as
promptly as practicable, (b) the obtaining of all necessary actions or
nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Authorities and
the making of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with
Governmental Authorities, if any) and the taking of all steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by any Governmental Authority, (c) the obtaining of all necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from third parties and (d) the execution and
delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this
Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the first sentence of this
Section 6.03, each of the Company and the Company Board and Parent and the
Parent Board shall (i) take all action reasonably necessary to ensure that no
state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes
applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any state takeover statute or
similar statute becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, take all action reasonably
necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Parent, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) take all
actions necessary to make the filings required of it or its Affiliates under
the HSR Act or any other antitrust Law with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable following the date
of this Agreement, (ii) comply with any request for additional information
received from the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") or the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other
Governmental Authority pursuant to the HSR Act or any other antitrust Law,
(iii) cooperate with each other in connection with filings under the HSR Act
or any other antitrust Law, (iv) request early termination of the applicable
waiting period, and (v) notify each other of any material communication from
the FTC, DOJ, or any foreign Governmental Authority concerning any antitrust
filings, consult with each other concerning responses to the same, and permit
the other to participate in any material conversations and meetings with any
Governmental Authority regarding the same (if the Governmental Authority
permits such participation by the other party). Notwithstanding the foregoing
or anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing shall be deemed to
require Parent to (A) agree to, or proffer to, divest  



 

51  or hold separate any assets or any portion of any business of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries or, assuming the consummation of the Merger, the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) not compete in any geographic area or line of
business, (C) restrict the manner in which, or whether, Parent, the Company,
the Surviving Entity or any of their respective Affiliates may carry on
business in any part of the world or (D) agree to any terms or conditions
that would impose any obligations on Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or,
assuming the consummation of the Merger, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, to maintain facilities, operations, places of business,
employment levels, products or businesses, which, in the case of any of
clauses (A) through (D), (i) would have, or would be reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or on Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (it being agreed that in the case of measuring
the effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries in this clause (i), (A)
"Subsidiaries" shall not include the Company or its Subsidiaries, (B)
"material adverse effect" shall be the level of, and shall be measured as to,
what would have, or would be reasonably likely to have, a "material adverse
effect" on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and not the
level or measure of what would have, or would be reasonably likely to have, a
"material adverse effect" on Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
and (C) the effect shall be with respect to Parent and its Subsidiaries) or
(ii) would, or would be reasonably likely to, materially impair the benefits
sought to be derived by Parent from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger.



Section 6.04 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 



(a) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor
of the current or former directors, officers and employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in the Company
Certificate or the Company By-laws or in any Company indemnification agreement
(in each case, as in effect on the date hereof) shall be assumed by the
Surviving Entity in the Merger, without further action, as of the Effective
Time and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect
in accordance with their terms. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless, and
provide advancement of expenses to the Indemnified Parties to the same extent
such persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as
of the date hereof by the Company pursuant to the Company Certificate and the
Company By-laws.



(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain in effect
the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance in respect
of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, (including
for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby)
covering the Indemnified Parties currently covered by the Companys directors
and officers liability insurance policy (a correct and complete copy of which
has been heretofore made available to Parent), on terms with respect to such
coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on
the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may substitute therefor
policies of Parent containing terms with respect to coverage and amount no
less favorable to such Indemnified Parties; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_
, that in satisfying its obligation under this Section 6.04(b) Parent shall
not be obligated to pay aggregate premiums in excess of 200% of the amount
paid by the Company in its last full fiscal year (which premiums are hereby
represented and warranted by the Company to be approximately $500,000), it
being  



 

52  understood and agreed that Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to provide
such coverage as may be obtained for such 200% amount.



(c) The covenants contained in this Section 6.04 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and
their respective heirs and legal representatives, and shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is
entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise.



Section 6.05  _Fees and Expenses_. All fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees
or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated, except that (a) each
of the Company and Parent shall bear and pay one-half of the costs and
expenses incurred in connection with filing, printing and mailing the Form S-4
and (b) Parent shall bear and pay the filing fees for the premerger
notification and report forms under the HSR Act.



Section 6.06 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall consult with
each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior
to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, court
process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national

(a) In the event that:



(i) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 8.01(b)(i), and (A) a vote to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval
has not been held, (B) after the date of this Agreement a Company Takeover
Proposal shall have been made or communicated to the Company or shall have
been made directly to the stockholders of the Company generally (and that
Company Takeover Proposal shall not have been withdrawn prior to the event
giving rise to the right of termination under Section 8.01(b)(i)) and (C)
within twelve (12) months after such termination the Company shall have
reached a definitive agreement to consummate, or shall have consummated, that
Company Takeover Proposal;



(ii) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 8.01(b)(iii) and (A) after the date of this Agreement a Company

been willful, (B) after the date of this Agreement a Company Takeover Proposal
shall have been made or communicated to the Company or shall have been made

(12) months after such termination the Company shall have reached a definitive
agreement to consummate, or shall have consummated, a Company Takeover

deemed to be references to "50% or more;"



(iv) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
8.01(d)(ii), or



(v) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(e) (but
only if after the date of this Agreement a Company Takeover Proposal shall
have been made and the Company Adverse Recommendation Change is made in
response thereto);



then the Company shall (1) in the case of a Company Termination Fee payable
pursuant to clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of this Section 8.02(a), upon the
earlier of the date of such definitive agreement and such consummation of a
Company Takeover Proposal or (2) in the case of a Company Termination Fee

described above prior to such termination by the Company. Notwithstanding the
foregoing in Section 8.02(a)(i) or Section 8.02(a)(ii), if a Company
Termination Fee would have been payable under Section 8.02(a)(i) or Section
8.02(a)(ii) but for the fact that the person (or any of its Affiliates) with
whom the Company shall have reached a definitive agreement to consummate, or
shall have consummated, a Company Takeover Proposal within twelve (12) months
after termination of this Agreement withdrew a Company Takeover Proposal
prior to the event giving rise to the right of termination of this Agreement
under Section 8.01(b)(i) or Section 8.01(b)(iii), then the Company shall upon
the earlier of such definitive agreement and such consummation of a Company
Takeover Proposal pay Parent the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of
same-day funds. In the case of a Termination Fee payable pursuant to clause
(iii) of this Section 8.02(a), the parties hereby agree that the Company
Termination Fee (including the right to receive such fee or the payment of
such fee) shall not limit in any respect any rights or remedies available to
Parent and Merger Sub relating to any willful breach or failure to perform
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement resulting, directly or indirectly, in the right to receive the
Company Termination Fee.



 

61 (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 8.01(d)(i), Parent shall pay to the Company a fee equal to $6,000,000
(the " _Parent Termination Fee_ " and together with the Company Termination
Fee, the " _Termination Fees_ ") on the date of termination by wire
transfer of same-day funds. The parties hereby agree that the Parent
Termination Fee (including the right to receive such fee or the payment of
such fee) shall not limit in any respect any rights or remedies available to
the Company relating to any willful breach or failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement
resulting, directly or indirectly, in the right to receive the Parent
Termination Fee.



(c) Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges and agrees that the
agreements contained in this Section 8.02 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, neither Parent nor the Company would enter into this Agreement. If
either party (the "defaulting party") fails promptly to pay the amount due
pursuant to Section 8.02, and, in order to obtain such payment, the other
party commences a suit that results in a judgment against the defaulting party
for the Termination Fee, the defaulting party shall pay to the non-defaulting
party its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses) incurred in connection with such suit, together with interest on
the amount of the Termination Fee from the date such payment was required to
be made until the date of payment at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made.



Section 8.03 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 8.01, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company,
other than the provisions of the penultimate sentence of Section
6.02(a), Sections 6.05 and 8.02, this Section 8.03 and Article IX, which
provisions shall survive such termination; _provided_ that nothing herein
shall relieve any party from any liability for any willful breach hereof.



Section 8.04 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
at any time before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval;
_provided_ , _however_ , that after such approval has been obtained, there
shall be made no amendment that by Law requires further approval by the
stockholders of the Company without such approval having been obtained. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto.



Section 8.05 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto or (c) subject to the proviso to the first sentence of
Section 8.04, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert
any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a
waiver of such rights.



 

62 Section 8.06 _Procedure for Termination or Amendment_. A termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01 or an amendment of this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.04 shall, in order to be effective, require, in the case of
Parent or the Company, action by the Parent Board or the Company Board, as
applicable, or, with respect to any amendment of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.04, the Parent Board or the Company Board, as applicable, or the
duly authorized committee or other designee of the Parent Board or the Company
Board, as applicable, to the extent permitted by Law.

_Form of Affiliate Letter_

 _ _, 2005



TO COME

TO COME

TO COME

TO COME



Ladies and Gentlemen:



I have been advised that as of the date of this letter, I may be deemed to be
an "affiliate" of Guilford Pharmaceuticals Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), as the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c)
and (d) of Rule 145 of the rules and regulations (the "Rules and Regulations")
of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"). Pursuant to the terms of the
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 20, 2005 (as may be amended and
restated from time to time, the "Agreement"), by and among MGI PHARMA, INC.,
a Minnesota corporation ("Parent"), Granite Acquisition, Inc., a corporation
organized under the laws of the State of Delaware and a direct wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and the Company, pursuant to which
the Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company, with the Company
continuing as the surviving entity (the "Merger"), I have been asked to
deliver this letter. Capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein
shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Agreement.



As a result of the Merger, I will receive shares of Parent Common Stock in
exchange for shares of Company Common Stock owned by me or purchasable
upon exercise of options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock or
vesting of certain other New Equity Awards.



I hereby represent, warrant and covenant that in connection with the Parent
Common Stock that I will receive as a result of the Merger:



A. I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of the Parent
Common Stock in violation of the Act or of the Rules and Regulations.



B. I have carefully read this letter and the Agreement and discussed the
requirements of such documents and other applicable limitations on my ability
to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Parent Common Stock to the extent I
felt necessary, with my counsel or counsel for the Company.

 [ ], 2005

Page 2



 

C. I have been advised that the issuance of Parent Common Stock to me pursuant
to the Merger has been registered with the Commission under the Act on a
Registration Statement on Form S4\. However, I have also been advised that,
because at the time the Merger is submitted for a vote of the stockholders of
the Company, I may be deemed to be an affiliate of the Company, and the
distribution by me of the Parent Common Stock will not have been registered
under the Act, I may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares of
Parent Common Stock issued to me in the Merger, unless (i) such sale,
transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the volume and other
limitations of Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under the Act, (ii) such
sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered under the Act or
(iii) I deliver a written opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to Parent,
or pursuant to a "no action" letter or interpretive letter obtained by the
undersigned from the staff of the Commission, stating that such
sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt from registration
under the Act.



D. I understand that Parent is under no obligation to register the sale,
transfer or other disposition of Parent Common Stock by me or on my behalf
under the Act or to take any other action necessary in order to make
compliance with an exemption from such registration available; provided,
however, that Parent agrees that it shall meet the requirements of paragraph
(c) of Rule 144 promulgated under the Act.



E. I understand that Parent may give stop-transfer instructions to its
transfer agent with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock to enforce the
restrictions set forth herein and that there will be placed on the
certificates for the Parent Common Stock issued to me, or any substitutions
therefor, a legend stating in substance:



"THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION TO
WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED,
APPLIES. THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY ONLY BE TRANSFERRED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF AN AGREEMENT DATED __, 2005, BETWEEN THE
REGISTERED HOLDER HEREOF AND MGI PHARMA, INC., A COPY OF WHICH AGREEMENT IS ON
FILE AT THE PRINCIPAL OFFICES OF MGI PHARMA, INC.



F. I understand that unless a sale or transfer is made in conformity with the
provisions of Rule 145, or pursuant to a registration statement, Parent
reserves the right to put the following legend on the certificates issued to
any transferee:



"THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND WERE ACQUIRED FROM A PERSON WHO
RECEIVED SUCH SHARES IN A TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, APPLIES. THE SHARES HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED BY
THE HOLDER NOT WITH A VIEW TO, OR FOR RESALE IN CONNECTION WITH, ANY
DISTRIBUTION THEREOF WITHIN THE MEANING  

 [ ], 2005

Page 3



 

 OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND MAY NOT BE SOLD, PLEDGED OR
OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION
STATEMENT OR IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION
REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED."



G. Execution of this letter should not be considered an admission on my part
that I am an "affiliate" of the Company as described in the first paragraph
of this letter, nor as a waiver of any rights I may have to object to any
claim that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.



It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth in paragraphs E and F
above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such
legend if (i) one year shall have elapsed from the date the undersigned
acquired the Parent Common Stock received in the Merger and the provisions of
Rule 145(d)(2) are then available to me, (ii) two years shall have elapsed
from the date the undersigned acquired Parent Common Stock received in the
Merger and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(3) are then available to me, or (iii)
Parent has received either an opinion of counsel, which opinion shall
be reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or a "no action" letter obtained by me
from the staff of the Commission, to the effect that the restrictions imposed
by Rule 145 under the Act no longer apply to me or that the legend is
otherwise not required for purposes of the Act.



This letter agreement constitutes the complete understanding between Parent
and me concerning the subject matter hereof. This letter agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New
York.

_Form of Certificate of Incorporation of Surviving Entity _

 AMENDED AND RESTATED

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

OF

GUILFORD PHARMACEUTICALS INC.



The undersigned, Eric P. Loukas, being the Secretary of Guilford
Pharmaceuticals Inc., does hereby certify as follows:



The name of the corporation is Granite, Inc. The name under which the
corporation was formed is Granite, Inc. The Certificate of Incorporation of
the corporation was filed in the State of Delaware on July 14, 1993. The
corporation was the surviving corporation in a merger with Granite
Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation, effective as of  _
_ _ _, 2005. This Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
of the corporation was duly adopted in accordance with Sections 242 and 245
of the Delaware General Corporation Law. The text of the Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation of the corporation is further amended and
restated as of  _ _ _ _, 2005 to read as set
forth in full as follows:



1\. _Name_. The name of the corporation is Guilford Pharmaceuticals Inc. 



2\. _Registered Office and Registered Agent_. The address of the registered
office of the corporation in Delaware is The Corporation Trust Company,
Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, DE 19801, County of
New Castle, and the name of its registered agent at that address is
The Corporation Trust Company.



3\. _Purposes_. The purpose of the corporation is to engage in any lawful act
or activity for which corporations may be organized under the General
Corporation Law.



4\. _Capital Stock_. The total number of shares of stock that the corporation
is authorized to issue is 100 shares, par value $.01 per share, all of which
shares are designated as common stock.



5\. _Bylaws_. The board of directors of the corporation is expressly
authorized to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws of the corporation.



6\. _Limitation of Directors  Liability_. No director of the corporation
shall be liable to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages
for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, _provided_ that nothing contained
in this Article 6 shall eliminate or limit the liability of a director (i) for
any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the corporation or
its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which
involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under
Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or (iv) for any
transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. If
the Delaware General Corporation Law is amended after approval of this article
to authorize corporate action further limiting or eliminating the personal
liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the corporation
shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware
General Corporation Law, as amended.

 Any repeal or modification of the foregoing paragraph by the stockholders of
the corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a
director of the corporation existing at the time of such repeal or
modification.



7\. _Indemnification_.



7.1. _Authorization of Indemnification_. Each person who was or is a party or
is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any threatened, pending
or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative and whether by or in the right of the
corporation or otherwise (a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he
or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was
a director or officer of the corporation or is or was serving at the request
of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter, an
"indemnitee"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an
official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other
capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be
(and shall be deemed to have a contractual right to be) indemnified and held
harmless by the corporation (and any successor to the corporation by merger
or otherwise) to the fullest extent authorized by, and subject to the
conditions and (except as provided herein) procedures set forth in the
Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be
amended (but any such amendment shall not be deemed to limit or prohibit the
rights of indemnification hereunder for past acts or omissions of any such
person insofar as such amendment limits or prohibits the indemnification
rights that said law permitted the corporation to provide prior to such
amendment), against all expenses, liabilities and losses (including attorneys
fees, judgments, fines, ERISA taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be
paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in
connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to an
indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and
shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitees heirs, executors
and administrators; _provided_ , _however_ , that except as provided in
paragraph 7.2 hereof with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to
indemnification, the corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee seeking
indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated
by such indemnitee (except for a suit or action pursuant to subsection 7.2)
only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the board of
directors of the corporation. Persons who are not directors or officers of
the corporation may be similarly indemnified in respect of such service to the
extent authorized at any time by the board of directors of the corporation.
The right to indemnification conferred in this subsection 7.1 shall be a
contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the corporation (and
such successor) the expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred in the
defense of or other involvement in any such proceeding in advance of its
final disposition (hereinafter an "advancement of expenses"); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, if and to the extent the Delaware General Corporation Law
requires, the advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her
capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which
services was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation,
service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the
corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter, an "undertaking") by or on behalf
of such indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be
determined by a final adjudication from which there is no  



 

2  further right to appeal (hereinafter a "final adjudication") that such
indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified under this subsection 7.1
or otherwise.



7.2. _Reimbursement of Expenses_. If a claim under subsection 7.1 of this
Article is not paid in full by the corporation within sixty days after a
written claim has been received by the corporation, except in the case of a
claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period
shall be twenty days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit
against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If
successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by
the corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms
of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the
expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by the
indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit
brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it
shall be a defense that, and (ii) in any suit by the corporation to recover an
advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking the
corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final
adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law. Neither
the failure of the corporation (including its board of directors, independent
legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the
commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in
the circumstance because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual
determination by the corporation (including its board of directors,
independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not
met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the
indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of
such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit
brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an
advancement of expenses hereunder, or by the corporation to recover an
advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of
proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such
advancement of expenses, under this Article or otherwise shall be on the
corporation.



7.3. _Non-exclusivity_. The rights to indemnification and to the advancement
of expenses conferred in this Article shall not be exclusive of any other
right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, the
corporations Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, any by-law,
agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.



7.4. _Insurance_. The corporation may maintain insurance at its expense, to
protect itself and any person who is a director, officer, employee or agent of
the corporation or another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise, against any liability, loss or expenses, whether
or not the corporation would have the power to indemnity such person against
such liability, loss or expense under the provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law.



7.5. _Employees_. The corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to
time by the board of directors, grant rights to indemnification and to the
advancement of expenses to any employee or agent of the corporation to the
fullest extent of the provisions of  



 

3  this Article with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses
of directors and officers of the corporation.



8\. _Elections of Directors_. Elections of directors need not be by written
ballot unless the bylaws of the corporation shall so provide.



9\. _Effectiveness_. This Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
shall be effective at 11:59 p.m. EDT on __________ ___, 2005.



IN WITNESS WHEREOF, said corporation has caused this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation to be signed by Eric P. Loukas, its Secretary,
this  _ _ day of _ _ 2005\.

Article 1. Stockholders Meetings



1.1 _Place of Meetings_. Meetings of the stockholders shall be held at such
place, either within or without the State of Delaware, as the board of
directors shall determine. Rather than holding a meeting at any place, the
board of directors may determine that a meeting shall be held solely by means
of remote communications, which means shall meet the requirements of the
Delaware General Corporation Law.



1.2 _Annual Meeting_. The annual meeting of the stockholders for the election
of the directors and the transaction of such other business as may properly
be brought before the meeting shall be held on the date and at the time
designated by the board of directors.



1.3 _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the stockholders for any purpose
or purposes may be called by the board of directors. No other person
or persons may call a special meeting. The business to be transacted at any
special meeting shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice.



1.4 _Remote Communications_. The board of directors may permit the
stockholders and their proxy holders to participate in meetings of
the stockholders (whether such meetings are held at a designated place or
solely by means of remote communication) using one or more methods of remote
communication that satisfy the requirements of the Delaware General
Corporation Law. The board of directors may adopt such guidelines and
procedures applicable to participation in stockholders meetings by means of
remote communication as it deems appropriate. Participation in a stockholders
meeting by means of a method of remote communication permitted by the board
of directors shall constitute presence in person at the meeting.



1.5 _Notice of Meetings_. Notice of the place, if any, date and hour of any
stockholders meeting shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote.
The notice shall state the means of remote communications, if any, by which
stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed present in person and vote at the
meeting. If the voting list for the meeting is to be made available by means
of an electronic network or if the meeting is to be held solely by remote
communication, the notice shall include the information required to access the
reasonably accessible electronic network on which the corporation will make
its voting list available either prior to the meeting or, in the case of a
meeting held solely by remote communication, during the meeting. Notice of a
special meeting shall also state the purpose or purposes for which the meeting
has been called. Unless otherwise provided in the Delaware General  

  Corporation Law, notice shall be given at least 10 days but not more than 60
days before the date of the meeting. Without limiting the manner by which
notice may otherwise be given, notice may be given by a form of electronic
transmission that satisfies the requirements of the Delaware General
Corporation Law and has been consented to by the stockholder to whom notice is
given. If mailed, notice shall be deemed given when deposited in the U.S.
mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholders address as it appears in
the corporations records. If given by a form of electronic transmission
consented to by the stockholder to whom notice is given, notice shall be
deemed given at the times specified with respect to the giving of notice by
electronic transmission in the Delaware General Corporation Law. An affidavit
of the corporations secretary, an assistant secretary or an agent of the
corporation that notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be
prima facie evidence of the facts stated in the affidavit.



1.6 _Quorum_. The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a
majority of the voting power of the stock entitled to vote at a meeting
shall constitute a quorum. Where a separate vote by a class or series or
classes or series of stock is required at a meeting, the presence, in person
or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the voting power of each such
class or series shall also be required to constitute a quorum. In the absence
of a quorum, either the chairperson of the meeting or the holders of a
majority of the voting power of the stock present, in person or by proxy, and
entitled to vote at the meeting may adjourn the meeting in the manner
provided in Section 1.7 until a quorum shall be present. A quorum, once
established at a meeting, shall not be broken by the withdrawal of the holders
of enough voting power to leave less than a quorum. If a quorum is present at
an original meeting, a quorum need not be present at an adjourned session of
that meeting.



1.7 _Adjournment of Meetings_. Either the chairperson of the meeting or the
holders of a majority of the voting power of the stock present, in person or
by proxy, and entitled to vote at the meeting may adjourn any meeting of
stockholders from time to time. At any adjourned meeting the stockholders may
transact any business that they might have transacted at the original meeting.
Notice of an adjourned meeting need not be given if the time and place,
if any, or the means of remote communications to be used rather than holding
the meeting at any place are announced at the meeting so adjourned, except
that notice of the adjourned meeting shall be required if the adjournment is
for more than 30 days or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed
for the adjourned meeting.



1.8 _Voting List_. At least 10 days before every meeting of the stockholders,
the secretary of the corporation shall prepare a complete alphabetical list of
the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting showing each stockholders
address and number of shares. This voting list does not need to include
electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information for any
stockholder nor need it contain any information with respect to beneficial
owners of the shares of stock owned, although it may do so. For a period of at
least 10 days before the meeting, the voting list shall be open to the
examination of any stockholder for any purpose germane to the meeting either
on a reasonably accessible electronic network ( _provided that_ the
information required to gain access to the list is provided with the notice of
the meeting) or during ordinary business hours at the corporations principal
place of business. If the list is made available on an electronic network,
the corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that it is available only
to stockholders. If the stockholders meeting is held at a place, the voting
list shall be produced and kept at that place during the whole time of the
meeting. If the stockholders meeting is held solely by means of remote
communications, the voting list shall be made available for inspection  



 

2  on a reasonably accessible electronic network during the whole time of the
meeting. In either case, any stockholder may inspect the voting list at any
time during the meeting.



1.9 _Vote Required_. Subject to the provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law requiring a higher level of votes to take certain specified
actions and to the terms of the corporations certificate of incorporation
that set special voting requirements, the stockholders shall take action on
all matters other than the election of directors by a majority of the voting
power of the stock present, in person or by proxy, at the meeting and entitled
to vote on the matter. The stockholders shall elect directors by a plurality
of the voting power of the stock present, in person or by proxy, at the
meeting and entitled to vote on the matter.



1.10 _Chairperson; Secretary_. The following people shall preside over any
meeting of the stockholders: the chairperson of the board of directors,
if any, or, in the chairpersons absence, the vice chairperson of the board
of directors, if any, or in the vice chairpersons absence, the chief
executive officer, or, in the absence of all of the foregoing persons, a
chairperson designated by the board of directors, or, in the absence of a
chairperson designated by the board of directors, a chairperson chosen by the
stockholders at the meeting. In the absence of the secretary and any assistant
secretary, the chairperson of the meeting may appoint any person to act as
secretary of the meeting.



1.11 _Rules of Conduct_. The board of directors may adopt such rules,
regulations and procedures for the conduct of any meeting of the stockholders
as it deems appropriate including rules, regulations and procedures
regarding participation in the meeting by means of remote communication.
Except to the extent inconsistent with any applicable rules, regulations or
procedures adopted by the board of directors, the chairperson of any meeting
may adopt such rules, regulations and procedures for the meeting, and take
such actions with respect to the conduct of the meeting, as the chairperson of
the meeting deems appropriate. The rules, regulations and procedures adopted
may include, without limitation, ones that (i) establish an agenda or order
of business, (ii) are intended to maintain order and safety at the meeting,
(iii) restrict entry to the meeting after the time fixed for its commencement
and (iv) limit the time allotted to stockholder questions or comments. Unless
otherwise determined by the board of directors or the chairperson of the
meeting, meetings of the stockholders need not be held in accordance with the
rules of parliamentary procedure.



1.12 _Inspectors of Elections_. The board of directors or the chairperson of
a stockholders meeting may appoint one or more inspectors of election and any
substitute inspectors to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof.
Inspectors may be officers, employees or agents of the corporation.
Each inspector, before entering on the discharge of the inspectors duties,
shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with
strict impartiality and according to the best of the inspectors ability.
Inspectors shall have the duties prescribed by the Delaware General
Corporation Law. At the request of the chairperson of the meeting, the
inspector or inspectors shall prepare a written report of the results of the
votes taken and of any other question or matter that that inspector or
inspectors determined.



 

3 1.13 _Record Date_. If the corporation proposes to take any action for which
the Delaware General Corporation Law would permit it to set a record date,
the board of directors may set such a record date as provided under the
Delaware General Corporation Law.



 

1.14 _Written Consent_. Any action required or permitted to be taken at a
meeting of the stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior
notice and without a vote by means of a stockholder written consent meeting
the requirements of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Prompt notice of the
taking of action without a meeting by less than a unanimous written consent
shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented as required by
the Delaware General Corporation Law.

outstanding any classes or series or class or series of stock that have or has
the right, alone or with one or more other classes or series or class or

elected, by a sole remaining director so elected or, if no director so

all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other. Participation in
a meeting in this manner shall constitute presence in person at the meeting.

 



2.12 _Action Without a Meeting_. Any action required or permitted to be taken
at any meeting of the board of directors may be taken without a meeting if all
of the directors consent to the action in writing or by electronic
transmission. The writing or writings or electronic transmission or

of directors or of the relevant committee.

the member or members present at any meeting and not disqualified from
voting, whether or not such member or members constitute a quorum, may

meeting in place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any committee

represented by certificates, _provided that_ the board of directors may,

that some or all of any or all classes or series shall be uncertificated
shares. Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution, every holder of
shares of stock represented by certificates and every holder of uncertificated

chairperson, if any, of the board of directors, the president or a vice
president _and_ (ii) the treasurer, an assistant treasurer, the secretary or

is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if such
person were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.

restriction or a statement of the existence of the restriction.

representing those shares properly endorsed or accompanied by a duly executed
stock power. The board of directors may make further rules and regulations

need not specify the purposes of the meeting.

any meeting of the stockholders, members or other owners of any other
corporation or organization the securities or ownership interests of which are
owned by the corporation.
