43

    

Section 4.5 _Not an Interested Stockholder_. None of the Parent Parties
or any of their respective Affiliates, within the past five years, has
beneficially owned (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) any
Company Capital Shares or Partnership Units or any securities that are
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Company Capital Shares or
Partnership Units, or holds any rights to acquire or vote any Company Capital
Shares or Partnership Units, other than pursuant to this Agreement. None of
the Parent Parties or any of their Subsidiaries, or the "Affiliates" or, to
the knowledge of the Parent Parties, the "associates" of any such person,
within the past five years, has been an "interested stockholder" of the
Company, in each case as defined in Section 3-601 of the MGCL.

Section 4.6 _Equity Financing_.

(a) [Reserved].

 

(b) Parent has delivered to the Company a true, accurate and complete copy of
the executed commitment letter (the "Equity Commitment Letter" and, together
with the Debt Commitment Letter, the "Financing Commitments") from the
Investor pursuant to which the Investors (or any of its assignees as permitted
thereunder) has committed to fund, subject to the terms and conditions
therein, the amount set forth therein (including after giving effect to any
permitted reduction of such commitment set forth therein, the "Equity
Financing" and together with the Debt Financing, the "Financing"). The Equity
Commitment Letter provides, and shall continue to provide, that the Company is
a third-party beneficiary thereof.

 

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter is in full
force and effect and have not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise
amended, supplemented or modified in any respect. As of the date of this
Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter, in the form so delivered, is a legal,
valid and binding obligation of Parent, and, to the knowledge of Parent, the
other parties thereto, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except, in
each case, as enforcement may be limited by the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no agreements, side
letters or arrangements relating to the Equity Commitment Letter that could
affect the conditionality of the Equity Financing, and the Equity Commitment
Letter contains all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the
parties thereunder to make the Equity Financing available to Parent on the
terms therein. Except for any Debt Commitment Letter (including any customary
fee and engagement letters with respect to any Debt Financing) contemplated by
_Section 5.22_ and as otherwise set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter,
there are no other agreements, side letters or arrangements relating to the
funding of the Equity Commitment Letter that could affect the amount or
availability of the Equity Financing. As of the date of this Agreement, no
event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would: (i) constitute a default or breach of Parent, or to the knowledge of
Parent, of any other party thereto, under any term or condition of the Equity
Commitment Letter; (ii) make any of the assumptions or any of the statements
set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter inaccurate in any material respect;
(iii) reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions in the Equity
Commitment Letter not being satisfied; or (iv) otherwise result in or would
reasonably be expected to result in any portion of the Equity Financing not
being available. The Investor has not notified Parent of its intention to
terminate the Equity Commitment Letter or not to provide the Equity
Financing. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions in _Section 6.1_ and
_Section 6.2_, as of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger
Sub has reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy, on a timely
basis, any term or condition of the Closing to be satisfied by it with respect
to the Equity Commitment Letter or that the full amount of the Equity
Financing will not be available as of the Closing. Assuming (A) that the
Equity Financing is funded in accordance with the Equity Commitment Letter,
and to the extent applicable, the Debt Financing is funded, (B) the accuracy
in all material respects of the representations and warranties set forth in
_Article 3_ of this Agreement (and accuracy in all respects of the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.3_) and (C) the
performance by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries of the covenants and 

 



44

    

 agreements contained in this Agreement, the Equity Financing (together with
any Available Cash Amount) is sufficient to satisfy, all of Parents and
Merger Subs obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of the
Merger Consideration, the payment of the amounts contemplated by _Section
2.8_ and _Section 5.8_ and the payment of all associated fees, costs and
expenses contemplated by this Agreement or payable in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the Parent Parties.

Section 4.7 _Brokers_. There are no investment bankers, brokers or finders
that have been retained by or are authorized to act on behalf of the Parent
Parties who are entitled to any banking, brokers, finders or similar fee or
commission payable by the Company or any of its Affiliates or any of their
respective shareholders in connection with the Mergers and the other
Transactions based upon arrangements made by and on behalf of the Parent
Parties.

 

Section 4.8 _Absence of Certain Agreements_. As of the date hereof, except the
Voting Agreements, none of the Parent Parties nor any of their respective
controlled Affiliates has entered into any agreement, arrangement or
understanding (in each case, whether oral or written), or authorized,
committed or agreed to enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding
(in each case, whether oral or written), (i) pursuant to which any
shareholder of the Company or limited partner of the Operating Partnership
would be entitled to receive, in respect of any Company Capital Share or
Partnership Unit, consideration of a different amount or nature than the
Merger Consideration or pursuant to which any shareholder of the Company or
limited partner of the Operating Partnership has agreed to vote to adopt this
Agreement or has agreed to vote against any Superior Proposal or (ii)
pursuant to which any shareholder of the Acquired Companies has agreed to make
an investment in, or contribution to, any of the Parent Parties in connection
with the Transactions, in each case that would not terminate and be void
concurrently with any termination of this Agreement. Other than this
Agreement, the Voting Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement, as of the
date hereof, there are no Contracts or any commitments to enter into any
Contract between Parent, Merger Sub or Merger OP or any of their respective
controlled Affiliates, on the one hand, and any trustee, officer, employee or
shareholder of the Company or the Operating Partnership, on the other hand,
relating to the Transactions or the operations of the Surviving Entity after
the Company Merger Effective Time or the Surviving Partnership after the
Partnership Merger Effective Time.

 

Section 4.9 _Compliance_. Each of the Parent Parties is in, and since their
formation has been in, compliance with all Laws applicable to its businesses,
except where the failure to comply with such Laws has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. None of the
Parent Parties has, since their formation: (a) received any written notice
from any Governmental Entity regarding any material violation by the Parent
Parties of any Law; or (b) provided any written notice to any Governmental
Entity regarding any material violation by any of the Parent Parties of
any Law, which notice in either case remains outstanding or unresolved as of
the date hereof, except for such notices that would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement:

(i) at any time prior to the earlier of (x) obtaining the Company Shareholder
Approval and (y) 30 days following the date of this Agreement, the Company
Board may make a Change in Recommendation and terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_ if and only if: (A) an unsolicited bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ that the Acquisition Proposal did
not result from or arise in connection with a breach or violation of this
_Section 5.2_) is made to the Company and not withdrawn; (B) the Company
Board has determined in good faith after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel and financial advisor, (1) that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (2) failure to make a Change in
Recommendation and terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 7.1(h)_,
would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of the Company Boards
duties set forth in Section 2-405.1 of the MGCL; (C) the Company delivers to
Parent a written notice (a "Superior Proposal Notice") that includes (1) a
statement that the Company Board intends to make a Change in Recommendation
and terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_ and the
reasons relating thereto, (2) the identity of the Third Party making the
Acquisition Proposal and (3) all material terms and conditions of the
Acquisition Proposal (including therewith copies of all material and relevant
documents and agreement unredacted relating to such Acquisition Proposal and

such financing commitments that, pursuant to the terms of the engagement
letter with the financing source thereto, cannot be provided in unredacted
form); (D) during the four-Business Day period commencing on the date of
Parents receipt of such Superior Proposal Notice, the Company shall have
made its Representatives reasonably available for the purpose of engaging in
negotiations and shall have negotiated, and shall have caused its
Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent
desires to negotiate) regarding a possible amendment of this Agreement or a
possible alternative transaction so that the Acquisition Proposal that is the
subject of the Superior Proposal Notice ceases to constitute a Superior
Proposal; (E) after the expiration of the negotiation period described in
clause "(D)" above, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, and
after taking into account any amendments to this Agreement proposed in
writing by the Parent Parties as a result of the negotiations contemplated by
clause "(D)" above, that such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal; and (F) in the event of any change to any of the financial

shall instead be equal to three Business Days during which time the Company
shall be required to comply with the requirements of this _Section 5.2_ anew
with respect to such additional notice); or

 



52

    

(ii) at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the
Company Board may make a Change in Recommendation not related to an
Acquisition Proposal if: (A) a Change in Circumstances has occurred; (B) the
Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Change in Circumstances, a
failure to effect a Change in Recommendation would reasonably be expected to
constitute a breach of the Company Boards duties set forth in Section 2-405.1
of the MGCL; (C) such Change in Recommendation is not effected prior to the
fifth Business Day after Parent receives written notice from the Company that
includes (1) a statement confirming that the Company Board intends to effect
such Change in Recommendation and (2) a reasonably detailed description of
the Change in Circumstances; (D) during the four Business Day period after
Parent receives such written notice, if requested by Parent, the Company
engages in good faith negotiations, and shall have caused its Representatives
to engage in good faith negotiations, with Parent to amend this Agreement, or
to enter into an alternative transaction in order to obviate the need to make
such Change in Recommendation; and (E) at the end of such four Business Day
period, the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and after taking into account any amendments to this
Agreement proposed in writing by the Parent Parties as a result of the
negotiations contemplated by clause "(D)" above, that, in light of such Change
in Circumstances, a failure to effect a Change in Recommendation would
reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of the Company Boards duties
set forth in Section 2-405.1 of the MGCL.

(f) The Company agrees (i) that it will promptly instruct its and its
Subsidiaries respective Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this
_Section 5.2_ and (ii) any violation or breach of the restrictions set forth
in this  _Section 5.2_ by any employee, officer, director, trustee or
equivalent, or other Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall be deemed to be a breach or violation of this _Section 5.2_ by the
Company for purposes of this Agreement.

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.2_ shall prohibit the Company from:
(i) taking and disclosing to the shareholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a

promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (ii) issuing a "stop, look and listen"
statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder,  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the disclosure therein does not in and itself constitute a
Change in Recommendation. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company Board may
not make a Change in Recommendation unless in compliance with  _Section
5.2(e)_.

(h) Notwithstanding any Change in Recommendation, unless such Change in
Recommendation is with respect to a Superior Proposal and this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)_, the Company shall cause the approval
of the Merger to be submitted to a vote of its shareholders at the Shareholder
Meeting.

 

Section 5.3 _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Shareholders Meeting_.

its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall cooperate with the
Company in connection with the preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement,
including promptly furnishing to the Company in writing upon request any and
all information relating to the Parent Parties and their respective Affiliates

of such event, and Parent and the Company shall cooperate in the prompt filing
with the SEC of any necessary amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement,
and as required by Law, in disseminating the information contained in such
amendment or supplement to the Companys shareholders. Nothing in this
_Section 5.3(b)_ shall limit the obligations of any party under _Section
5.3(a)_.

(c) If prior to the Effective Time any event occurs with respect to any
Acquired Company, or any change occurs with respect to other information
supplied by the Company for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, which is
required to be described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy
Statement, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of such event, and the
Company shall as promptly as practicable file any necessary amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement with the SEC and, as required by Law,
disseminate the information contained in such amendment or supplement to the
Companys stockholders. Nothing in this _Section 5.3(c)_ shall limit the
obligations of any party under _Section 5.3(a)_.

Statement by the SEC, the Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law
and the Companys Organizational Documents, duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold a special meeting of the Companys shareholders (including any
adjournments and postponements thereof, the "Shareholders Meeting") for the
purpose of (i) obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval and (ii) in
accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable rules and
regulations issued thereunder, seeking advisory approval of a proposal to the
Companys shareholders for a non-binding, advisory vote to approve certain
compensation that may become payable to the Companys named executive officers

notwithstanding anything else to the contrary herein, that the Company may
postpone or adjourn the Shareholders Meeting after consultation with Parent
(A) with the consent of Parent, (B) for the absence of a quorum, (C) to
ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is
provided to the holders of Company Common Shares within a reasonable amount of
time in advance of the Shareholders Meeting, or (D) to allow additional
solicitation of votes in order to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval;
_provided_ that, in the case of clause (B) and this clause (D), without the
written consent of Parent, in no event shall the Shareholders Meeting (as so

date for which the Shareholders Meeting was originally scheduled. Unless the
Company Board has withdrawn the Company Board 

 



54

and the Transactions so that the Company may obtain the Company Shareholder

solicit the Company Shareholder Approval (including by soliciting proxies
from the Companys shareholders) and shall take all other action necessary or
advisable to secure the Company Shareholder Approval. The Company shall keep

Acquisition Proposal and (y) the obligation of the Company to duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Shareholders Meeting and mail the Proxy
Statement (and any amendment or supplement thereto that may be required by
Law) to the Companys shareholders shall not be affected by a Change in
Recommendation.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement

examinations or studies with respect to any Company Real Property that Parent
deems to be reasonably necessary, so long as such access does not unduly
interfere with the Companys ordinary conduct of business; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the Acquired Companies shall not be required to permit any
inspection or other access, or to disclose any information, that in the
reasonable judgment of the Company could: (a) violate any obligation of the
Acquired Companies with respect to confidentiality, non-disclosure or privacy
to a Third Party or (b) jeopardize protections afforded to any of the Acquired

otherwise making any public statements with respect to this Agreement or any
of the Transactions and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement without the prior consent of the other parties hereto,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) a party (or their respective Affiliates) may, without the
prior consent of the other parties hereto, issue such press release or make
such public statement as may be required by Law or Order or the applicable
rules of any stock exchange or quotation system if it has provided the other
party with an opportunity to review and comment (and the parties shall
cooperate as to the timing and contents of any such press release or public
statement) upon any such press release or public statement, and (ii) the
Company will not be obligated to engage in such consultation with respect to
communications that are (1) principally directed to employees, customers,

other party) regarding this Agreement and the Transactions, or (2) relating to

public disclosures or public statements made jointly by the parties (or
individually, if approved by the other party) regarding this Agreement and the
Transactions. The parties have agreed upon the form of a joint press release
announcing the Mergers and the execution of this Agreement and shall make such

survive the Mergers) from the Companys current insurance carrier or an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier, of at least the same coverage and amounts and
containing terms and conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are
no less favorable than the Companys and its Subsidiaries existing policy or
policies, for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties with a claims period of
six years from the Effective Time with respect to directors and officers
liability, employment practices liability and errors and omissions liability
insurance for claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or prior
to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the
aggregate premium payable for such "tail" insurance policy or policies for its
or their entire period exceed an amount equal to 300% of the most recent
aggregate annual premiums paid by the Company prior to the date of this
Agreement for such insurance (such amount being the "Maximum Premium"). If the
Company is unable to obtain the "tail" insurance described in the first
sentence of this _Section 5.9(a)_ for an amount equal to or less than the
Maximum Premium, the Company shall be entitled to obtain as much comparable
"tail" insurance as reasonably available for an aggregate cost equal to the
Maximum Premium.

 



57

    

(b) For a period of six years following the Effective Time, each of Parent and
the Surviving Entity shall: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual
who at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was,
a trustee, director or officer of the Company or of a Subsidiary of the
Company and acting in such capacity (each an "Indemnified Party") for any and
all costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of legal

is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party was not entitled to
indemnification under this _Section 5.9(b))_, judgments, fines, penalties or
liabilities (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) imposed upon
or reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with or arising
out of any action, suit or Legal Proceeding (whether civil or criminal) in
which such Indemnified Party may be involved or with which he or she may be
threatened (regardless of whether as a named party or as a participant other
than as a named party, including as a witness) (an "Indemnified Party
Proceeding") by reason of such Indemnified Partys being or having been such
trustee, director or officer of the Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company
or otherwise in connection with any action taken or not taken at the request
of the Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company at, or at any time prior to,
the Effective Time, whether or not the Indemnified Party continues in such
position at the time such Indemnified Party Proceeding is brought or
threatened (including any Indemnified Party Proceeding relating in whole or in

any other indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified Party), to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ , that Parent
and the Surviving Entity shall not be (x) liable for any settlement effected
without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) or (y) obligated under this _Section
5.9(b)_ to pay the fees and expenses of more than one legal counsel (selected
by a plurality of the applicable Indemnified Parties) for all Indemnified

two or more of such Indemnified Parties shall have conflicting interests in
the outcome of such Legal Proceeding; and (ii) fulfill and honor in all
respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to: (1) each indemnification
agreement set forth on _Part 5.9(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule and in
effect as of the date hereof between the Company and any Indemnified Party;
and (2) any indemnification provision (including advancement of expenses) and
any exculpation provision set forth in the Organizational Documents of the
Acquired Companies as in effect on the date hereof. Parent shall pay all
expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by
Indemnified Parties in connection with their enforcement of their rights
provided under this _Section 5.9_. Parents and the Surviving Entitys
obligations under the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) shall continue in full
force and effect for a period of six years from the Effective Time; _provided_
, _however_ , that all rights to indemnification, exculpation and advancement
of expenses in respect of any claim asserted or made within such period shall
continue until the final disposition of such claim.

consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or Entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and

Section 5.10 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall, and shall be permitted to, take all such steps as may reasonably be
necessary to cause any dispositions of Company Capital Shares (including
derivative securities with respect to Company Capital Shares) resulting from
the Mergers or the other Transactions by each Person who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

Section 5.11 _Transaction Litigation_. The Company shall as promptly as

opportunity to participate in the defense, negotiations and settlement of, any
Transaction Litigation brought or, to the Knowledge of the

respect to the status thereof and shall give consideration to Parents advice
with respect to such Transaction Litigation. The Company shall give Parent and
its Representatives a reasonable opportunity to review, and shall consider in

selected by such Indemnified Parties prior to the Effective Time to defend
any Transaction Litigation.

Section 5.12 _Confidentiality_. All information provided by or on behalf of
the Acquired Companies pursuant to this Agreement during the Interim Period
will be kept confidential in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, and if this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time,
the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with its respective terms prior to giving effect to the execution
of this Agreement.

 

Section 5.13 _Distribution by Company of REIT Taxable Income_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to the Closing Date, any of
the Company and its Subsidiary REITs may declare and pay a dividend to their
shareholders distributing cash in such amounts determined by the Company in
its sole discretion exercised in good faith to be required to be distributed
in order for the Company or the Subsidiary REIT to qualify as a REIT for such
year and to avoid to the extent reasonably possible the incurrence of income
or excise Tax by the Company or the Subsidiary REIT. If the Company declares
a distribution to its shareholders pursuant to this _Section 5.13_, the
Merger Consideration shall be decreased by an amount equal to such
distribution.

 

Section 5.14 _Certain Tax Matters_.

 

(a) The Company shall take such actions as the Company determines are
reasonably necessary to ensure that the Company and any Subsidiary REIT (i)
will qualify for taxation as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes for
its current taxable year, and (ii) will not become liable for U.S. federal
income Tax under Section 857(b) or 4981 of the Code for its current
taxable year. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall promptly notify
Parent if the Company becomes aware of any issue that it believes would
adversely impact the maintenance of the REIT status of the Company and its
Subsidiary REITs for the Companys 2019 taxable year and cooperate and
consult in good faith with Parent with respect thereto.

 



59

    

(b) All transfer, stamp, documentary, sales, use, registration, value-added
and other similar Taxes (including all applicable real estate transfer Taxes)
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions ("Transfer
Taxes") will be borne by Parent. Parent and the Company shall cooperate to
file or cause to be filed in a timely manner all necessary documents
(including, but not limited to, all Tax Returns) with respect to such Transfer
Taxes.

 

(c) On the Closing Date, prior to the Company Merger, the Company shall
deliver to Parent a duly executed certificate, dated as of the Closing Date,
that the Company has been a "domestically controlled qualified investment
entity" within the meaning of Section 897(h)(4)(B) of the Code during its
entire existence, and therefore, the Company Capital Shares are not
"United States real property interests." The Operating Partnership shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to Merger Sub at or
prior to the Partnership Merger, dated as of the Closing Date, from each
holder of Partnership Common Units (other than the Company or any Subsidiary
of the Company), (i) a duly executed certificate of non-foreign status
substantially in the form of the sample certification set forth in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iv)(A) or (B), as applicable, in compliance
with Code Sections 1445 and 1446(f) and IRS Notice 2018-29, or (ii) a
properly completed and executed IRS Form W-9 meeting the requirements of
Proposed Treasury Regulations Sections 1.1445(b)(2)(v) and
1.1446(f)-2(b)(2)); provided, however, that in the event that any such
certificate of non-foreign status is not delivered to Merger Sub at or prior
to the Partnership Merger, Parents remedy shall be limited to
withholding pursuant to this Agreement.

(d) Parent and the Company shall, upon written request, use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Entity or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with respect to
the transactions contemplated in this Agreement).

 

Section 5.15 _Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration_. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and shall use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
applicable Law and rules and policies of the NYSE American to cause
the delisting by the Surviving Entity of the Company Capital Shares from the
NYSE American as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time and the
deregistration of the Company Capital Shares under the Exchange Act as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.

Section 5.16 _Takeover Statutes_. The Company Parties shall not take any
action that would cause the Transactions, including the Mergers, to be
subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Statute. If any Takeover
Statute may become, or may purport to be, applicable to this Agreement, the
Mergers or the Transactions, the Company shall grant such approvals and take
such actions as are necessary so that the Mergers and the Transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such Takeover
Statute on the Mergers and the Transactions.

Section 5.17 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

 

(a) At all times during the Interim Period, the Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of any
notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Entity in connection with this Agreement, the Mergers or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) At all times during the Interim Period, the Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, upon
becoming aware (i) that any representation or warranty made by it contained in
this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate, such that the applicable
closing conditions would reasonably be expected to be incapable of being
satisfied by the End Date or (ii) of any failure to comply with or satisfy in
any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with
or satisfied by it under this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such notification shall affect or be deemed to modify the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement and shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such
notice.

Section 5.18 _Financing and Cooperation_.

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, upon the request of the Company, Parent shall
keep the Company reasonably informed in reasonable detail of the status of
its efforts to arrange the Financing. The Parent Parties acknowledge and agree
that the obtaining of the Debt Financing is not a condition to Closing and the
consummation of the Transactions shall not be conditioned on, or delayed or
postponed as a result of the obtaining of (or the failure to obtain) the Debt
Financing.

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause each its
Subsidiaries to, use its and their commercially reasonable efforts to cause
its and their respective Representatives to, provide to the Parent Parties and

requested by Parents and/or its Affiliates to assist them in connection with
the arrangement of Financing, to the extent not unreasonably interfering with
the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including: (i) upon
reasonable notice, cause management of the Acquired Companies with appropriate
seniority and expertise to participate in a reasonable number of meetings and

contain disclosure and financial statements with respect to the Company or the
Surviving Entity and/or its Subsidiaries as the obligor, (iii) (A) using
commercially reasonable efforts to furnish Parent in a timely manner with
customary financial and other information regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries, including non-public financial information, as may be reasonably
required by Parent in connection with due diligence relating to the
Financing, (B) using commercially reasonable efforts to assist Parent in
connection with the preparation of pro forma financial information and
financial statements to the extent reasonably required by Parent or any
Financing Source, it being agreed that neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries or Representatives shall be responsible in any manner for
information relating to the proposed debt and equity capitalization that
is required for such pro forma financial information or financial statements,
(C) cooperating with Parent in Parent equity capitalization that is required
for such pro forma financial information or financial statements, (D) as
promptly as practicable, informing Parent if the chief executive officer,
chief financial officer, treasurer or controller of the Company shall have
actual knowledge of any facts as a result of which a restatement of any
financial statements of the Company in order for such financial statements to
comply with GAAP, (E) make available to Parent the financial and operating
data and other information with respect to the Acquired Company as Parents (or
its Affiliates) may from time to time reasonably request in connection with

connection with the filing of the Offering Document, and (F) using
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Companys auditors and certain
directors and senior officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
reasonably determined by Parent to participate in oral due diligence sessions
to take place

 



61

notice (iv) reasonably facilitating the transactions described in this
_Section 5.18_ and assist with the preparation of customary definitive loan
documentation contemplated by the Financing (including schedules), including

Financing Sources ( _provided_ that any such documents or agreements and any
obligations contained in such documents shall be effective no earlier than as
of the Effective Time); (v) provide to Parent upon written request all
documentation and other information with respect to the Company and the
Acquired Companies required by regulatory authorities under applicable "know

requested by Parent to facilitate the Financing, following the obtainment of
the Company Shareholder Approval, form new direct and indirect wholly owned
Subsidiaries of the Company and the other Acquired Companies pursuant to
documentation reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company, (vii) as may
be reasonably requested by Parent, and no earlier than immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and provided such actions would not adversely affect the
Tax status of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or cause the Company to
be subject to additional Taxes that are not indemnified by Parent under
_Section 5.18(d)_, transfer or otherwise restructure its ownership of
existing Acquired Companies, properties or other assets, in each case,
pursuant to documentation reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company,
(viii) subject to the confidentiality requirements of _Section 5.18(e)_,

the Effective Time) (the "Payoff Letters"), (xii) to the extent reasonably
requested by Parent, obtain customary accountants comfort letters and
consents to the use of accountants audit reports relating to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, including any comfort letters that are in a form and
substance that is customarily given to underwriters and Governmental
Authorities, as the case may be, in an underwritten public offering in Canada,
with such "long form" comfort letter being addressed to Parent and the
underwriters, provided that such "long form" comfort letter shall only relate
to the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Company Capital Shares and the Financial
Statements (xiii) cooperate with obtaining title insurance with respect to
each Owned Real Property and Ground Leased Real Property and (xiv) to the
extent reasonably requested by a Financing Source, permit Parent and its
Representatives to conduct survey, appraisal and environmental and

obtaining required third party consents with respect thereto (which the
Company shall use reasonable efforts to obtain), leased by the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section
5.18(b)_ to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to provide, or
cause its Subsidiaries to provide, cooperation under this _Section 5.18_ to

reimbursement) in connection with the Financing prior to the Closing (except
those fees and expenses that are reimbursed promptly or advanced by Parent);
(B) except with respect to clauses (v), (vi) and (vii), requires the Acquired

documents and instruments pursuant to which the Financing is obtained that is
not contingent upon the Closing or that would be effective at or prior to the
Effective Time; (C) provide access to or disclose information that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries determines would result in a loss or waiver
of or jeopardize any attorney-client privilege, attorney work product or other
legal privilege (provided that the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that
does not result in the events set out in this clause (C)); (D) results in any
officer, trustee or director of the Acquired Companies incurring personal
Liability with respect to any matter relating to the Financing or requires
any officer, trustee, director or other Representative of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to deliver any certificate that such officer, trustee,
director or other Representative reasonably believes, in good faith, contains
any untrue certifications; or (E) requires the Acquired Companies or their
Representatives, as applicable, to waive or amend any terms of this Agreement.
In no event shall the Company be in breach of this Agreement because of the
failure to deliver any financial or other information that is not currently
readily available to the Acquired Companies (other than information which an
Acquired Company is entitled to receive and actually receives
following request pursuant to Management Agreement Documents or Franchise
Agreement Documents) on the date hereof or is not otherwise prepared in the
ordinary course of business of Acquired Companies at the time requested by
Parent or for the failure to obtain review of any financial or other
information by its accountants. In no event shall the Acquired Companies be
required to pay any commitment or other fee or give an indemnity or incur any
Liability (including due to any act or omission by the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives) or
expense (including legal and accounting expenses) in connection with assisting
Parent and Merger Sub in arranging the Debt Financing or as a result of
any information provided by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives in connection with the Financing
(except those fees and expenses reimbursed promptly by Parent). None of the
representations, warranties or covenants of the Company set forth in this
Agreement shall be deemed to apply to, or deemed breached or violated by, any
of the actions taken by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their
respective Representatives at the request of Parent pursuant to this _Section
5.18(b)_.

(c) The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries logos
in connection with the Financing; _provided_ that such logos are used solely
in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage
the Acquired Companies or the reputation or goodwill of the Acquired
Companies.

 

(d) Parent shall reimburse the Acquired Companies promptly upon demand for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
and accountants fees) incurred by the Acquired Companies in connection with
the cooperation under this _Section 5.18_, any action taken by them at the
request of Parent pursuant to this _Section 5.18_ (including the dissolution
and termination of any subsidiaries formed and documentation entered into
pursuant to this _Section 5.18_) and shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Acquired Companies from and against any and all out-of-pocket costs, expenses,
losses, damages, claims, judgments, fines, penalties, interest, settlements,
awards and Liabilities suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with
the arrangement and consummation of the Debt Financing and any information
used in connection therewith (other than the information provided in writing
by the Company or the Acquired Companies to Parent specifically in connection
with their obligations pursuant to _Section 5.18(b))_. This _Section
5.18(d)_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement (and in the
event the Mergers and the other Transactions are not consummated, Parent
shall promptly reimburse the Company for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs
incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with the
cooperation under this _Section 5.18_ and not previously reimbursed).

 



63

    

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Confidentiality Agreement,
the Company agrees that Parent and its Representatives may initiate contact
with and pursue potential lenders in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case subject to the
confidentiality and use restrictions applicable to "Representatives" (as
defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) set forth in the Confidentiality
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, without the prior written consent of
the Company, in no event will Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates (which for this purpose will be deemed to include each direct
investor in Parent or Merger Sub) enter into any agreement, arrangement or any
other understanding, whether written or oral, with any potential debt
financing source or sources that would reasonably be expected to limit,
restrict, restrain, otherwise impair in any manner, directly or indirectly,
the ability of such debt financing source or sources (including any lender of
the Acquired Companies) to provide debt financing or other assistance to any
other party in any other transaction involving the Acquired Company (provided
that the foregoing shall not prohibit the establishment of customary
"tree" arrangements).

Section 5.19 _Capital Expenditures_. Between the date hereof and the Closing,
the Acquired Companies will execute in all material respects the capital
expenditure plan it described on _Part 5.19_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (the "Cap Ex Plan"), including with respect to the amount of spending
indicated thereon;  _provided_ , _however_ , that it shall not be deemed to
be a breach of this covenant to the extent such breach is reasonably
attributable to delays caused by fire, earthquakes, floods, wind or other acts
of God, acts of public enemies, riot, insurrection, government regulation,
labor disputes, general market shortages of materials or labor or other causes
beyond the Companys and its Affiliates reasonable control (including to the
extent related to a third partys failure to timely perform obligations on
which such capital expenditures are conditioned); _provided_ _further_ , and
without limiting the immediately preceding proviso, that the Company shall
obtain the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) in connection with any material deviation
from such plan.

 

Section 5.20 _Atlanta JV_. Between the date hereof and the Closing, the
Company shall cause its applicable Subsidiary to exercise its right to
acquire the equity interest of the Atlanta JV (the "Buy / Sell") from Three
Wall Capital LLC ("TWC") pursuant to Section 13.5 of the Limited Liability
Company Agreement of the Atlanta JV (the "Transfer"). Parent consents to the
refinancing of the indebtedness of the Atlanta JV pursuant to the financing
term sheet set forth on _Part 5.20A_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the
"Atlanta JV Financing") or such other financing on substantially the same
terms provided that Parent consents to such other financing not to be
unreasonably withheld. The purchase price for the Transfer shall be as set
forth on _Part 5.20B_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the "Atlanta JV
Equity Interest Purchase Price") and shall be financed under the Companys
existing line of credit. The Company shall (a) provide drafts of all
documentation relating to the Transfer in advance of sharing such documents
with counsel for TWC, (b) provide Parent with a reasonable amount of time to
review such documents and (c) the Company shall incorporate all timely and
reasonable comments provided by Parent and Parents legal counsel in such
documents. The Company shall not agree to any indemnification or financial
obligations that will be binding on Parent following the Closing, without
Parents written consent.

 

Section 5.21 _Repairs_. Between the date hereof and the Closing, the Company
shall use best efforts to make, or shall cause to be made, the repairs set
forth on Part 5.21 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the "Requested
Repairs"). Upon the request of Parent, the Company shall keep Parent informed
in reasonable detail of the status of the Requested Repairs. Further, Parent
shall have the right to review and comment on all plans relating to the
Required Repairs (and the Company shall consider in good faith such comments)
and to inspect the Required Repairs in advance of final payments to
the contractors performing such Required Repairs, provided however if Parent
does not approve the work or if there is a contractor lien because Parent has
not approved final payment then neither event will be a condition not to
consummate the Mergers. All contractors performing the Requested Repairs
shall be approved in writing by Parent, prior to any contractor commencing the
Requested Repairs.

 



64

    

Section 5.22 _Debt Commitment Letter_. After the date hereof, Parent may, in
its discretion, deliver to the Company, an executed commitment letter,
together with all schedules and exhibits thereto, from the lender party
thereto (as modified, amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Debt
Commitment Letter"), pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and
conditions thereof, the lender party thereto has committed to lend the amount
set forth therein to Parent for the purpose of funding a portion of the Merger
Consideration and the obligations of the Parent Parties set forth herein. To
the extent the Debt Commitment Letter is so delivered by Parent, is customary
in form and substance, and does not include any condition that is a "diligence
out," the amount set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter shall
automatically and irrevocably be reduced by the amount set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter. The Company Parties agree to provide all information
necessary and cooperate with Parent in providing any necessary diligence
items to complete the lenders due diligence and underwriting process in order
to execute the Debt Commitment Letter.

Agreement, in order to concurrently enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal in compliance with _Section

such termination and entry into such Alternative Acquisition Agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal; or

 

(i) subject to _Section 7.4_, by the Company upon written notice to Parent,
if (i) the conditions set forth in  _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ have
been and continue to be satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing Date, each of which is then
capable of being satisfied); (ii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed by
written notice to Parent at least three Business Days prior to such

_Section 8.11_, _Section 8.12_ and this _Section 7.2_ (including, in each

not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs). For the
avoidance of doubt, the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect
in accordance with its terms; provided that the Parent Parties shall each be
treated as if they were a party thereto to the same extent as Parent.

 

Section 7.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

the date of termination of this Agreement, the Company enters into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement that is later consummated or an Acquisition
Proposal is consummated within 12 months after the date of termination of this
Agreement (provided that, for purposes of this clause (C), the references to
"15%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be
references to more than "50%").

(c) Any Company Termination Fee (i) due under  _Section 7.3(b)(ii)_ shall be
paid to Parent (or one or more of its designees) by wire transfer of same-day
funds on the date the transactions contemplated by the Alternative Acquisition

paid, to Parent the Parent Expense Amount, by wire transfer to an account
designated by Parent, within five Business Days after the date of such
termination; _provided_ , that the payment by the Company of the Parent
Expense Amount pursuant to this _Section 7.3(d)_ shall not relieve the
Company of any subsequent obligation to pay the Company Termination Fee
pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)_ (but in the event such Company Termination Fee
is or becomes payable, it shall be reduced on a dollar for dollar basis for
the Parent Expense Amount actually paid to Parent pursuant to this _Section
7.3(c))_. In no event shall the Company be required to pay the Parent Expense
Amount on more than one occasion.

(e) _Parent Termination Fee_. Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the

of same day funds within five Business Days after termination of this

on the one hand, or any Company Party, on the other hand, commences a suit
that results in a final and non-appealable judgment against any Company Party
or Parent Party, as applicable, for payment of amounts owed pursuant to this
_Section 7.3_, then the Company shall pay to the Parent Parties, or
Parent shall pay to the Company Parties, as applicable, its reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket attorneys fees) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on such amount at the prime lending rate prevailing
during such period as published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition,
calculated on a daily basis from the date that such amounts were required to
be paid to the date of actual payment. Any amount payable pursuant to this
_Section 7.3(f)_ shall be paid by the applicable party by wire transfer of
same-day funds prior to or on the date such payment is required to be made
under this _Section 7.3(f)_.

 

(g) The parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in this
_Section 7.3_ are an integral part of this Agreement, and that, without
these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement. Each of the
parties further acknowledges that the payment of the amounts by the Company or
Parent specified in this _Section 7.3_ is not a penalty, but, in each case,
is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Parent
Parties or the Company Parties, as applicable, in the

 



70

    

 circumstances in which such amounts are payable for the efforts and
resources expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the Mergers and the other Transactions, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. In no event shall the
Company Parties or Parent Parties be required to pay an amount in
connection with the termination of this Agreement more than once.

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document, but subject to _Section 8.11_, each of the parties acknowledges
and agrees that the Companys right to terminate this Agreement and to receive
payment of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 7.3_
shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company Parties and
their respective Affiliates and any of their respective former, current or
future general or limited partners, stockholders, equityholders, members,
managers, directors, officers, employees, agents or Affiliates (collectively,
the "Company Related Parties") against the Parent Parties, the Investor, NHT,
and their respective Affiliates, any potential debt financing source and any
of their respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, equityholders, members, managers, directors, officers,
employees, agents or Affiliates or any former, current or future general or
limited partner, stockholder, equityholder, member, manager, director,
officer, employee, agent, Affiliate, successor or assignee of any of the
foregoing (collectively, the "Parent Related Parties") for all losses and
damages in respect of this Agreement or the Transactions, any breach of any
covenant or agreement or otherwise in respect of this Agreement, or the
failure to consummate the Transactions, and upon payment of the Parent
Termination Fee to the Company, none of the Parent Related Parties shall have
any further liability to any of the Company Related Parties relating to or
arising out of this Agreement, the Financing Commitments, the Limited Guaranty
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (except that the Parent
Parties will remain subject to  _Section 7.3(e))_ and no Company Related
Party shall seek to recover any other damages or seek any other remedy,
whether based on a claim at law or in equity, in contract, tort or otherwise,
with respect to any losses or damages suffered in connection with this
Agreement or the Transactions or any oral representation made or alleged to
have been made in connection with this Agreement (except that the Parent
Parties will remain subject to _Section 7.3(e))_. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, in no event shall any of
the Parent Related Parties be subject to (and no Company Related Party shall
seek to recover) monetary damages or other payments whatsoever (including
multiple, consequential, indirect, special, statutory, exemplary or punitive
damages) in excess of an amount equal to the Parent Termination Fee for any
losses or other liabilities arising out of or in connection with breaches by
any Parent Party of their representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement or arising from any claim or cause of
action that any Company Related Party may have or in respect of any oral
representation made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or
therewith.

(i) While the Company or Parent, as applicable, may pursue both a grant of
specific performance or other equitable relief under _Section 8.11_ and,
following termination of this Agreement, the payment of the Parent Termination
Fee or the Company Termination Fee, as applicable, under no circumstances
shall the Company or Parent be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant
of specific performance or other equitable relief and any money damages
(including the Parent Termination Fee or the Company Termination Fee, as
applicable) in connection with this Agreement or any termination of this
Agreement.

Section 7.4 _Extension Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement (including Section 2.3(a), Section 7.1(i) and Section 8.11),
the Company shall provide written notice that the conditions set forth in
Article 6 are satisfied ("Conditions Satisfied Notice"), and within three
Business Days of the receipt of such Conditions Satisfied Notice, Parent, in
its sole discretion, may extend the Closing Date ("Extension") for an
additional 30-day period upon written notice to the 

 



71

    

 Company (or such shorter period so as not to extend beyond December 31,
2019), provided, that no Parent Party is then in breach of this Agreement in
any material respect. Parent may exercise such Extension up to three times
during the term of this Agreement. Notwithstanding Section 5.1(b)(ii), if at
any time following the exercise of an Extension, the Company shall be
permitted to declare and pay a dividend to its shareholders during the month
in which such Extension is exercised, subject to and upon the conditions set
forth in Part 7.4 of the Company Disclosure Schedule; provided, such dividend
may not to exceed the amounts set forth in Part 7.4 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event Parent has
elected to extend the Closing Date pursuant to this Section 7.4 and the
Closing has not occurred by the End Date, each of Parent and the Company shall
retain the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b).

ARTICLE 8

All notices, requests, claims, consents, demands and other communications
under this Agreement shall be deemed duly given (i) if delivered in person,
on the date delivered, (ii) if sent by electronic mail, on the same day it was
received if received no later than 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on a Business Day
(if received after 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on a Business Day or on a non-

sent by prepaid overnight courier, on the next Business Day (providing proof
of delivery). For the avoidance of doubt, counsel for a party may send
notices, requests, claims, consents demands or other communications on behalf
of such party.

 

Section 8.8 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or
public policy, (a) such term or other provision shall be fully separable, (b)
this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, and (c) all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as either the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party or such party waives its rights under this
_Section 8.8_ with respect thereto. Upon such

 



75

    

 determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

 

Section 8.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile or .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to
electronic mail (any such delivery, an "Electronic Delivery")) in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that
all parties need not sign the same counterpart. No party hereto shall raise
the use of Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact that any
signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through
the use of Electronic Delivery as a defense to the formation of a contract,
and each party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent
such defense relates to lack of authenticity.

Section 8.10 _Obligation of Parent_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub and
Merger OP to comply in all respects with each of the representations,
warranties, covenants, obligations, agreements and undertakings made or
required to be performed by Merger Sub and Merger OP in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, the Mergers, and the other Transactions. As a
material inducement to the Companys willingness to enter into this Agreement
and perform its obligations hereunder, Parent hereby unconditionally
guarantees full performance and payment by Merger Sub and Merger OP of each
of their respective covenants, obligations and undertakings required to be
performed by Merger Sub and Merger OP under this Agreement and the
Transactions, subject to all terms, conditions and limitations contained in
this Agreement, and hereby represents, acknowledges and agrees that any such
breach of any such representation and warranty or default in the performance
of any such covenant, obligation, agreement or undertaking of Merger Sub and
Merger OP shall also be deemed to be a breach or default of Parent, and the
Company shall have the right, exercisable in its sole discretion, to pursue
any and all available remedies it may have arising out of any such breach or
nonperformance directly against either or both of Parent and Merger Sub in
the first instance. As applicable, references in this _Section 8.10_ to
"Merger Sub" shall also include the Surviving Entity following the Effective
Time and references in this _Section 8.10_ to "Merger OP" shall also include
the Surviving Partnership following the Effective Time.

Section 8.11 _Specific Performance_.

(a) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed by such parties in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached, and that money damages (even if available) would not be an
adequate remedy for any such harm. It is accordingly agreed that the parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement. It is agreed that
the parties are entitled to enforce specifically the performance of terms and
provisions of this Agreement in any court referred to above, without proof of
actual damages (and each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing
or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement
is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor
to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy
for any such breach.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (but subject
to Section 7.4), each of the parties agree that the Company shall only be
entitled to specific performance of the Parent Parties obligations to
consummate the Merger and the Transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents and cause the Equity Financing to be funded if, and only if, (i) all
of the conditions in

 



76

    

  _Article 6_ have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to such
conditions being able to be satisfied); (ii) to the extent the Debt
Commitment Letter is delivered to the Company as contemplated by _Section
5.22_, the Debt Financing will be funded at the Closing if the Equity
Financing is funded at the Closing; and (iii) the Company has irrevocably
confirmed in writing to Parent that if specific performance is granted and the
Debt Financing is funded, then the Company will cause the Closing to occur.

 

Section 8.12 _Non-recourse_. Except in the case of fraud, in no event will
any Company Party seek or obtain, nor will it permit any of its
Representatives to seek or obtain through or on behalf of the Company, nor
will any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or
monetary award against any Non-Recourse Parent Party (as defined in the Equity
Commitment Letter) with respect to this Agreement, the Transaction Documents
or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, or the negotiation or
execution hereof (including any breach by any Parent Party), the termination
of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby or any claims or actions under applicable Laws arising out of any such
breach, termination or failure, other than from a Parent Party to the extent
expressly provided for in this Agreement. Except in the case of fraud, in no
event will any Parent Party seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of their
Representatives or to seek or obtain through or on behalf of any Parent
Party, nor will they permit any of their Representatives to seek or obtain,
nor will any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or
monetary award against any former, current or future director, officer,
employee, manager, member, partner, stockholder, agent, Affiliate or other
Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiary (each such Person,
other than the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company, a "Non-Recourse Company
Party") with respect to this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or the negotiation or execution
hereof (including any breach by the Company or any of its Subsidiary), the
termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or any claims or actions under applicable Laws arising out
of any such breach, termination or failure, other than from the Company or
its Subsidiary to the extent expressly provided for in this Agreement.
