(" _Parent_ "), Serco Inc., a New Jersey corporation (" _U.S. Parent_ "),

the Merger (as defined below), upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement;

  



  

 **WHEREAS** , the respective boards of directors of each of U.S. Parent,

conditions of this Agreement;

  



  

 **WHEREAS** , the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board of
Directors_ ") has (i) determined that this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, taken together, are fair to,
advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders (the

Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger,
declaring its advisability and recommending the adoption by the Company
Stockholders of this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby; and

  



  

 **WHEREAS** , the respective boards of directors of each of U.S. Parent and

transactions contemplated hereby, taken together, are advisable and in the
best interests of Merger Sub and U.S. Parent and (ii) adopted resolutions
approving this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger, declaring its advisability and, in the case of the board of

Agreement, U.S. Parent, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, shall have
adopted this Agreement.

  



  

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the premises and the mutual
promises herein made, and in consideration of the representations, warranties
and covenants herein contained, the parties agree as follows:

        
   

  



  

 **ARTICLE I**

  



  

 ** _THE MERGER_**

  



  

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company in accordance with the DGCL, whereupon the separate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the
Surviving Corporation under the Laws of the State of Delaware.

  



  

Section 1.2 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the Closing will take place at the offices of Morrison and Foerster LLP, 1650
Tysons Boulevard, Suite 400, McLean, Virginia 22102, at 10:00 a.m., local
time, as soon as practicable but in no event later than the third Business
Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) set forth in
_ARTICLE VI_ , or at another time, date or place as is agreed to in writing
by the parties.

  



  

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, on the Closing Date the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to
be consummated by filing all necessary documentation, including a Certificate
of Merger, with the Delaware Secretary, and Parent will deliver, or cause to
be delivered, the Exchange Fund to the Paying Agent in the manner provided in
_Section 2.1_. The Merger shall be effective upon filing of the Certificate
of Merger with the Delaware Secretary, or on such later date as Parent and
the Company agree and is specified therein (the time of such effectiveness
being, the " _Effective Time_ ").

  



  

Section 1.4 _Effect of the Merger_.  The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the DGCL and other Applicable Law. Accordingly, without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall have all the properties, rights,
privileges, powers, interests and franchises and shall be subject to all
restrictions, disabilities, debts, duties and Liabilities of the Company and
Merger Sub. The Surviving Corporation may, at any time after the Effective
Time, take any action (including executing and delivering any document) in
the name and on behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub in order to carry
out and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

Section 1.5 _Conversion of the Shares_.  At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, U.S. Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or any of their respective securities holders:

  



  

(a) Except as provided in _Section 1.5(b)_, each share of Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Shares_ ") (excluding Appraisal Shares) shall be canceled and shall by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof
be converted automatically into the right to receive $32.00 in cash, without
interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), upon surrender of the Certificate
representing such Shares as provided in _ARTICLE II_. All such Shares, when
so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate formerly
representing such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the

  



        
   

  



  

right to receive the Merger Consideration into which such Shares have been
converted, as provided herein.

  



  

(b) Each Share that is owned by the Company (or any Subsidiary of the
Company) as treasury stock or otherwise and each Share owned, directly or
indirectly, by Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled and cease to exist and no payment or distribution shall be made with
respect thereto.

  



  

(c) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become
one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the
only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

Section 1.6 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company,
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation. Thereafter,
subject to _Section 5.10_, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation may be amended in accordance with its terms and as provided by
Law.

  



  

(b) At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Company as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.
 Thereafter, subject to _Section 5.10_, the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation may be amended or repealed in accordance with their terms and the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and as provided by
Law.

  



  

Section 1.7 _Officers and Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. At the
Effective Time (i) the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall become the directors of the Surviving Corporation, and
(ii) the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case
until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with and
subject to Applicable Law and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

Section 1.8 _Company Stock Options_.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option under or pursuant
to any Company Option Plans that is outstanding, unexercised and unexpired,
prior to the Effective Time shall be accelerated in full so that each such
Company Stock Option is fully vested and exercisable immediately prior to the
Effective Time.  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, U.S. Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or
the holders of Company Stock Options, each Company Stock Option which
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested,
unvested, exercisable or not exercisable) shall be canceled and extinguished
and automatically converted into the right to receive from the
Surviving Corporation an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (x) the aggregate number of Shares that were issuable upon
exercise of such Company Stock Option immediately

  



        
   

  



  

prior to the Effective Time and (y) the Merger Consideration less the per
share exercise price of such Company Stock Option (the " _Option
Consideration_ ") (it being understood and agreed that such exercise price
shall not actually be paid to the Company by the holder of a Company Stock
Option). In the event the Option Consideration to any holder of a Company
Stock Option is equal to or less than zero, it shall be understood and agreed
that any such Company Stock Option shall be canceled and extinguished
immediately upon to the Effective Time without any payment. Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to holders of Company
Stock Options the Option Consideration, less applicable Taxes required to be
deducted and withheld from payments of the Option Consideration, as soon as
practicable after the Effective Time and in any case within five Business
Days thereafter.

  



  

(b) Except as otherwise agreed to by the parties, the Company Option Plans
shall terminate as of the Effective Time and the provisions in any other
plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other
interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary
thereof shall be canceled as of the Effective Time.

  



  

(c) The Company shall provide notice (in a form reasonably satisfactory to
Parent) to each holder of an outstanding Company Stock Option describing the
treatment of such Company Stock Option in accordance with this _Section
1.8_.

  



  

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions as may
be necessary or desirable to give effect to the transactions contemplated by
this _Section 1.8_, including satisfaction of the requirements of Rule
16b-3(e) under the Exchange Act and, upon the reasonable written request of
U.S. Parent, using its reasonable efforts to obtain consents from holders of
Company Stock Options.

  



  

Section 1.9 _Restricted Stock; Deferred Compensation Plan_.

  



  

(a) If any Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(determined without regard to the effect of this _Section 1.9(a)_) is
unvested or subject to a repurchase option or forfeiture in favor of
the Company (any such shares, " _Company Restricted Shares_ "), then,
effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, such Company Restricted
Shares shall be fully vested and any repurchase option or forfeiture
restriction shall lapse, and shall, as of the Effective Time, be cancelled
and be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided in _Section 1.5_, less any amounts required to be deducted and
withheld under any Applicable Law as a result of such vesting.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, all accrued account balances under the
Companys Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan (the " _Deferred

Company shall adopt such amendments to the Deferred Compensation Plan as
it may determine to be necessary or appropriate to permit such distributions
to be made without incurring the additional tax or interest penalty imposed
by Section 409A(1)(B) of the Code. Following and subject to the payment of
all accrued account balances under the Deferred Compensation Plan, the

Section 1.10 _Appraisal Shares_.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary (unless otherwise provided in this _Section 1.10_), any
Appraisal Shares shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section 1.5(a)_, but instead such holders of
Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such
shares as determined to be due to the holders of such shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any
such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose
the rights to appraisal under Section 262, or a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to an appraisal
of such holders Shares under Section 262, then the right of such holder to
be paid the fair value of such holders Shares under Section 262 shall cease,
such Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time
into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided in _Section 1.5(a)_, without interest, and such Shares will be
deemed not to be "Appraisal Shares" hereunder. The Company shall
serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any of the
Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to Section 262 received by the Company.  The Company shall
give Parent the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demand for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such
demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

  



  

 **ARTICLE II**

  



  

 ** _EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_**

  



  

Section 2.1 _Paying Agent_.  Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
appoint the Paying Agent to act as paying agent for the payment of the Merger
Consideration upon surrender of the Certificates pursuant to this _ARTICLE
II_. On the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited,
with the Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ ") payable pursuant to _Section 1.5(a) _in exchange for
outstanding Shares. Any income from investment of the Exchange Fund, which
investment shall be in accordance with the instructions of Parent or U.S.
Parent, will be payable solely to Parent or U.S. Parent, as applicable.
 Parent shall, or shall cause U.S. Parent or the Surviving Corporation to,
pay all fees and expenses of the Paying Agent.

  



  

Section 2.2 _Exchange Procedures_.

  



  

(a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall
mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates that,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented outstanding Shares
subsequently converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, as
set forth in _Section 1.5_: (i) a letter of transmittal (a " _Letter of
Transmittal_ ") that (A) shall specify that delivery shall be effected and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent (or an affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof, together with any bond or indemnity agreement, as contemplated
by _Section 2.6_) and (B) shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as the Surviving Corporation may reasonably specify and the
Company shall have reasonably approved and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the applicable
Merger Consideration.

  



        
   

  



  

(b) Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent,
together with a Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and executed, and any
other documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent or the Surviving
Corporation, (i) the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor a check representing the applicable amount of cash that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 1.5_ and (ii) the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.  No interest will be
paid or accrued on the cash payable upon surrender of the Certificates. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_, each such Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the Company Shares represented by such Certificate.

  



  

(c) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered
in the transfer records of the Company, the appropriate amount of the Merger
Consideration may be paid to a transferee if, as a condition of payment, the
Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying
Agent properly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers and
otherwise in proper form for transfer and accompanied by all documents
reasonably required by the Paying Agent to evidence and effect such transfer
and to evidence that any applicable Taxes have been paid.

  



  

Section 2.3 _No Further Ownership Transfers_.  All Merger Consideration paid
upon the surrender for exchange of the Certificates formerly representing
Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares and, at the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this _ARTICLE II_, subject to Applicable Law in
the case of Appraisal Shares.

  



  

Section 2.4 _Termination of Exchange Fund_.  Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest and other income received with respect thereto) that
remains undistributed to the former Company Stockholders on the date nine
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or U.S. Parent,
as applicable, upon demand, and any former holder of Shares who has not
theretofore received any applicable Merger Consideration to which such
Company Stockholder is entitled under this _ARTICLE II_ shall thereafter
look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Laws) for payment of claims with respect thereto and
only as a general creditor thereof.

  



  

Section 2.5 _No Liability_.  None of Parent, U.S. Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or Merger Sub shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for
any part of the Merger Consideration required to be delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. Any amounts of Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by former
holders of any Shares as of immediately prior to the time at which such
amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental
Entity shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property
of Parent or U.S. Parent, as applicable, free and clear of any claims or
interest of any such holders or their successors, assigns or
personal representatives previously entitled thereto.

  



         
 

  



  

Section 2.6 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by and at the discretion of Parent, U.S. Parent,
or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as Parent, U.S. Parent or the Surviving Corporation
may direct, or the execution and delivery by such Person of an indemnity
agreement in such form as Parent, U.S. Parent or the Surviving Corporation
may direct, in each case as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the appropriate
amount of the Merger Consideration without interest.

  



  

Section 2.7 _Withholding of Tax_.  Parent, U.S. Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, any Affiliate thereof or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of Shares or Company Stock Options such amounts as Parent, U.S.
Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate thereof or the Paying Agent
are legally required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under any provision of Law relating to Taxes. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by Parent, U.S. Parent, the Surviving Corporation,
any Affiliate thereof or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be (a)
paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity in accordance with Applicable
Law or Order and (b) treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made.

reasonably to inform Parent or U.S. Parent of the information required to be
disclosed in respect of the other sections to avoid a breach under the
representation and warranty corresponding to such other sections), the
Company represents and warrants to Parent, U.S. Parent and Merger Sub as of
the date of this Agreement as follows:

filed since such date has complied in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, and the Exchange Act, and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, as applicable, each as in effect on

statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates
of mailing, respectively) any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted

normal year-end audit adjustments consistent with GAAP).

  



  

(c) As of the date hereof the Company and its Subsidiaries have implemented
and maintain a system of internal accounting controls designed to provide
reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. As of the
date hereof the Company has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) designed to
ensure that information relating to the Company, including its
consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed in the reports the
Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is made known to the chief
executive officer and the chief financial officer of the Company by others
within those entities.

  



  

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any Liabilities which
are required by GAAP to be set forth on the Company Financial Statements and
are not set forth on the Company Financial Statements, other than Liabilities
(i) reflected or reserved against in the Company Financial Statements, (ii)
incurred on behalf of the Company in connection with this Agreement, (iii)
incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
since December 29, 2007, or (iv) that are not reasonably likely to have a

fiscal years or during the current fiscal year that is currently outstanding
or that has resulted in a past adjustment. The Company has not had
any material dispute with Ernst and Young LLP regarding accounting matters or
policies during any of its past two full fiscal years or during the
current fiscal year that is currently outstanding or that has resulted in
any restatement of the Company Financial Statements.

  



  

Section 3.9 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.  Except as disclosed in
the Company SEC Reports and except as specifically contemplated by, or as
disclosed in, this Agreement, since December 29, 2007 through to the date of
this Agreement, (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their
businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice and (ii) there has not been:

  



  

(a) any action that, if taken after the date of this Agreement, would
constitute a breach of _Sections 5.1(b)(i)_ , _(ii)_ ,  _(iii)_ , _(iv)_ ,
_(viii)_ , _(ix)_ , _(x)_ , _(xii)_ ,  _(xix)_ or _(xx)_ or any agreement to
take any such action; or

  



  

(b) any event, change, circumstance or effect that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or would be reasonably likely to result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 3.10 _Taxes_.

  



  

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have filed with the appropriate
Governmental Entities all material Tax Returns that are required to have been
filed by it.  All such Tax Returns were true, correct and complete in all
material respects. All Taxes (whether or not shown as due on a Tax Return)
that are required to have been paid by the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries have been paid or are currently being disputed in good faith by
appropriate proceedings. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
currently is the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file
any unfiled Tax Return. No claim has been made in writing by a Governmental
Entity in a jurisdiction where the Company or its Subsidiaries do not
currently file Tax Returns that any such company is subject to taxation by
that jurisdiction. There are no security interests or other liens on any of
the assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries that arose in connection with
any failure (or alleged failure) to timely pay any Tax. The most recent
Company Financial Statements reflect a reserve in the amount required by GAAP
for Taxes accruable by each of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all
taxable periods through the date of such financial statements.

  



  

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries have timely withheld and paid to the
appropriate Governmental Entity all material Taxes required to have been
withheld and paid by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with
amounts paid to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder
or other Third Party.

  



  

(c) There is no audit, dispute or other proceeding presently being conducted
on, by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries concerning any
material Tax Liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries raised by
any Governmental Entity, and none of the Company nor its Subsidiaries has
received written notice or otherwise has Knowledge of any

  



        
   

  



  

pending or threatened audits or investigations relating to any Taxes of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries which have not been completed or
terminated.

  



  

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has waived any statute of
limitations in respect of assessment or collection of Taxes or agreed to, or
requested, any extension of time for assessment or collection of any Tax,
which waiver or extension is currently effective.

  



  

(e) There are no agreements relating to the allocating or sharing of Taxes to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party the principal purpose
of which is or was the allocation of Tax Liabilities computed on a
consolidated, combined, unitary or similar basis among entities that have or
will be required to compute their Tax Liability by filing Tax Returns on such
a basis other than agreements solely among the Company and its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(f) None of the Company or its Subsidiaries is or has been a member of an
affiliated group (within the meaning of Section 1504(a) of the Code) or
similar group of entities with which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
joined, or was or may be required to join, for any taxable period through the
date hereof in making a consolidated federal income Tax Return or other Tax
Return in which Tax Liability was or would be computed on a consolidated,
combined, unitary or similar basis, and that would cause the Company or its
Subsidiaries to be liable for Taxes of another Person pursuant to Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-6(a) or any similar provision of Law, other than
such a group of entities including only the Company, its Subsidiaries, and
predecessors thereof.

  



  

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been either a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" within the meaning
of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code in a distribution qualifying (or intended
to qualify) under Section 355 of the Code (or so much of Section 356 as

Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, is bound or affected, except in the case

defaults or other occurrences, individually or in the aggregate, that would
not be reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent, U.S. Parent and
Merger Sub do not, and the performance of this Agreement, through and
including the Effective Time, by Parent, U.S. Parent and Merger Sub will not,

notification to, or registration or qualification with, any Governmental
Entity, except for applicable requirements, if any, of (i) the Securities
Act, (ii) the Exchange Act, (iii) any Antitrust Law, (iv) Exon-Florio, (v)
the filing and recordation of the Certificate of Merger, as required by the
DGCL, and (vi) such other items required solely by reason of the
participation of Parent (as opposed to any United States domiciled entity) in
the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(c) Following the Effective Time, the operation and performance of the
Government Contracts of the Surviving Corporation will require (i) approval
of DSS to operate

  



        
   

  



  

the business of the Company pursuant to U.S. Parents Special Security
Agreement (" _SSA_ ") or such other arrangement requested by DSS, and (ii)
the absence of indications from any customer with respect to certain
Government Contracts that such customer will not grant or support a favorable
National Interest Determination to or for the benefit of the Company after
the Merger in response to the request for such National Interest
Determination (or similar determinations under any applicable national or
industrial security regulations) in accordance with the NISPOM, authorizing
access to proscribed or other information by the Company following the
Closing as may be necessary for the Company to continue to perform such
Government Contracts.

  



  

Section 4.4 _Litigation_. There are no suits, actions or proceedings pending
or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, including Merger Sub, which question the validity of
this Agreement or seek to prohibit, enjoin or otherwise challenge the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement.

conditions are capable of being satisfied) (the " _Financing Date_ "), all

Affiliates under this Agreement and to pay all related fees and expenses.

copy of a draft commitment and mandate letter (as the same may be modified
before execution) (the " _Draft Commitment Letter_ ") from the lenders named
therein in connection with funding the transactions contemplated by this

closing to be satisfied by it contained in the Draft Commitment Letter or
that the Financing will not be made available to Parent as of the Effective
Time.

  



  

Section 4.6 _Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to

employees, for which the Company may become liable.

request withdrawal and resubmission in response to such offer by CFIUS, then

Knowledge of the making or commencement of any request, inquiry,

to the other parties under this section as "outside counsel only." Such
materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the
outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such

imposed by any Governmental Entity on (i) the conduct or structure of any
business or operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) access
by Parent to technology, operations, products or other activities of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) such other restrictions or
conditions imposed on the operations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or limitations on Parents control of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, in each case as a result or consequence of the CFIUS review or
review under Antitrust Laws.  Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, (A) none of Parent, U.S. Parent or the Company
shall be required to agree to any restrictions or conditions which would have
(x) a Company Material Adverse Effect, or (y) an Effect that is materially
adverse to the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or
the business of U.S. Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (B)
neither Parent nor U.S. Parent, nor any of their respective Affiliates, shall
be required to litigate, pursue or defend any filed lawsuit or formal
administrative proceeding by any Governmental Entity challenging the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust
Laws. As used in this _Section 5.3_, the term "Company Material Adverse
Effect" shall be defined without regard to (x) the exceptions in clause (D)
of the first proviso to the definition of such term in _Section 8.3_
and (y) the exception in clause (i) of the second proviso to the definition
of such term in _Section 8.3_, and, for the avoidance of doubt, the

  



        
   

  



  

matters described in such exceptions shall be taken into account in
determining whether there has been a Company Material Adverse Effect for
purposes of this _Section 5.3(d)_.

  



  

(e) To the extent reasonably requested by U.S. Parent, the Company shall use
its best efforts to work together with U.S. Parent to obtain assurances that,
in accordance with the NISPOM, the Surviving Corporation will be granted
National Interest Determinations required for authorizing continued access to
proscribed or other classified or unclassified controlled information
following the Effective Time to the extent necessary for the Surviving
Corporation to continue to perform certain of the Companys Government
Contracts; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required to
use or otherwise engage direct charge personnel in the furtherance hereof.
For the avoidance of doubt, Parent, U.S. Parent and Merger Sub shall continue
to be obligated to consummate the Merger on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in _ARTICLE VI_ , regardless of whether (x) Parent, U.S. Parent or
Merger Sub receives DSS approval to operate under U.S. Parents SSA under the
NISPOM or such other arrangement requested by DSS or (y) indications are
received from any customer with respect to any Government Contract that such
customer will not grant or support a favorable National Interest
Determination to or for the benefit of the Company after the Merger in
response to the request for such National Interest Determination (or similar
determinations under any applicable national or industrial security
regulations) in accordance with the NISPOM.

  



  

(f) Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent, U.S. Parent and Merger
Sub, on the other, shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law and
subject to all privileges (including the attorney client privilege), promptly
(and in any event within two Business Days) notify the other party in writing
of:

  



  

(i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  



  

(ii) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  



  

(iii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or,
to its Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent and any of its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that, if pending on the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to any of
the representations and warranties contained herein, or that relate to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  



  

(iv) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement at any time during the term hereof that would reasonably be
expected to cause the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE VI_  hereto not to be
satisfied; and

  



  

(v) any failure of that party to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder.

  



        
   

  



  

(g) In the event that the Company earnings announcement for either the third
quarter or fourth quarter of 2008 would be lower than the Companys then
published earnings guidance, the Company shall provide notice of such event
to Parent at least two Business Days prior to the scheduled announcement of
earnings for the Companys third quarter or fourth quarter of 2008, as
applicable. Any notice provided pursuant to this _Section 5.3(g) _shall
be deemed "Evaluation Material" under the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement.

  



  

Section 5.4 _Proxy Statement_.

  



  

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, the Company shall, in
consultation with U.S. Parent, prepare and file with the SEC preliminary
proxy materials that shall constitute the Proxy Statement. The Company agrees
that none of the information supplied by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will, at the date first
mailed to the Company Stockholders and at the time of the Company
Stockholders Meeting or at the time of any amendment or supplement thereof,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The Proxy Statement shall comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes
no representation or warranty with respect to the information supplied by or
on behalf of Parent, U.S. Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective
Representatives that is contained in the Proxy Statement. Parent and U.S.
Parent agree that none of the information supplied by them for inclusion in
the Proxy Statement will, at the date first mailed to the Company
Stockholders and at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

  



  

(b) As promptly as practicable after comments are received from the SEC
thereon and after the furnishing by the Company, Parent and U.S. Parent of
all information required to be contained therein, the Company shall, in
consultation with U.S. Parent, prepare and the Company shall file any
required amendments and the definitive Proxy Statement with the SEC. The
Company shall notify U.S. Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from
the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional
information and shall consult with U.S. Parent regarding, and supply U.S.
Parent with copies of, all correspondence between the Company or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other
hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as
promptly as reasonably practicable and shall thereafter mail to the Company
Stockholders as promptly as possible the Proxy Statement and all other proxy
materials for such meeting. If at any time prior to the Company Stockholders
Meeting there shall occur any event that should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that such document would not include
any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the Company shall promptly prepare and
mail to its stockholders such an amendment or supplement.

  



        
   

  



  

(c) Parent shall furnish the Company with all information concerning Parent
and its Affiliates required for use in the Proxy Statement, and Parent shall
take such other action as the Company may reasonably request in connection
with the preparation of the Proxy Statement, including any amendments or
supplements thereto.

  



  

(d) The Company and Parent shall make any necessary filings with respect to
the Merger under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

  



  

(e) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Company
Financial Advisor to consent to the inclusion of the Fairness Opinion in the
Proxy Statement.

  



  

Section 5.5 _Company Stockholders Meeting_.  The Company shall take all
actions in accordance with Applicable Law, the Company Certificate of
Incorporation, the Company Bylaws and the rules of Nasdaq to duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold as promptly as practicable the Company
Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of considering and voting upon the
adoption of this Agreement.  Subject to _Section 5.6(c)_, to the fullest
extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Company Board of Directors shall
declare this Agreement advisable and recommend adoption of this Agreement and
approval of the Merger by the Company Stockholders and include such
recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Unless this Agreement has been duly
terminated in accordance with the terms herein (including payment of any
termination fees payable under _ARTICLE VII_), the Company shall, subject to
the right of the Company Board of Directors to modify its recommendation in a
manner adverse to Parent under certain circumstances as specified in _Section
5.6(c)_, take all lawful action to solicit from the Company Stockholders
proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt this Agreement and approve the
Merger and shall take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the
vote or consent of the Company Stockholders that are required by the rules of
Nasdaq or the DGCL. In the event that subsequent to the date hereof, the
Company Board of Directors determines that this Agreement is no longer
advisable and makes a Change of Recommendation, the Company
shall nevertheless submit this Agreement to the Company Stockholders for
adoption at the Company Stockholders Meeting unless this Agreement shall have
been terminated in accordance with _ARTICLE VII_ prior to the
Company Stockholders Meeting. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Company, after consultation with Parent, may
adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting to the extent necessary
to ensure that any legally required supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement is provided to the Company Stockholders or, if as of the time for
which the Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth
in the Proxy Statement), there are insufficient Shares represented (either in
person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business
of the Company Stockholders Meeting.

  



  

Section 5.6 _Acquisition Proposals_.

  



  

(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_.  The Company agrees that, except as
expressly permitted by this _Section 5.6_, neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of it or any of its
Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall use its reasonable best efforts to
instruct and cause its and its Subsidiaries Representatives not to, directly
or indirectly:

  



         
 

  



  

(i) initiate, solicit or intentionally encourage any inquiries or the making
of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below);

  



  

(ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or provide any non-public information or data to any
Person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal; or

  



  

(iii) otherwise intentionally facilitate any effort or attempt to make an
Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, prior to the time
that, but not after, the Company Stockholder Vote is obtained, if the Company
has otherwise complied in all material respects with this _Section 5.6_
with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, the Company may (A)
provide information in response to a request therefor by a Person who has
made an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board of
Directors believes in good faith to be bona fide providing for the
acquisition of more than 50% of the assets (on a consolidated basis) or total
voting power of the equity securities of the Company if the Company receives
from the Person so requesting such information an executed confidentiality
agreement on terms not more favorable in all material respects to such other
Person than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (except that
such confidentiality agreement shall contain additional provisions that
expressly permit the Company to comply with the provisions of this _Section
5.6_ and such confidentiality agreement need not prohibit the making of an
Acquisition Proposal), and promptly discloses (and, if applicable, provides
copies of) any such information to Parent to the extent not previously
provided to Parent; (B) engage or participate in any discussions or
negotiations with any Person who has made such an unsolicited bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal of the type described in clause (A) above; or
(C) after having complied with _Section 5.6(c)_, approve, recommend, or
otherwise declare advisable or propose to approve, recommend or declare
advisable (publicly or otherwise) such an Acquisition Proposal, if and only
to the extent that, (x) prior to taking any action described in clause (A) or
(B) above, the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under Applicable
Law; (y) in each such case referred to in clause (A) or (B) above, the
Company Board of Directors has determined in good faith based on the
information then available (after consultation with the Company Financial
Advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal either
constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined below) or is reasonably likely to
result in a Superior Proposal; and (z) in the case referred to in clause (C)
above, the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith (after
consultation with the Company Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel)
that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal.

  



  

(b) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

  



  

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means (x) any proposal or offer with respect
to a merger, joint venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution,
liquidation, tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange,
business combination or similar transaction involving the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries and (y) any acquisition by any

  



        
   

  



  

Person of, or proposal or offer, which if consummated would result in any
Person becoming the beneficial owner of, directly or indirectly, in one or a
series of related transactions, 20% or more of the total voting power or
of any class of equity securities of the Company or those of any of
its Subsidiaries, or 20% or more of the consolidated total assets (including
equity securities of its Subsidiaries) of the Company, in each case other
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that
would result in any Person becoming the beneficial owner, directly or
indirectly, of more than 50% of the assets (on a consolidated basis) or more
than 50% of the total voting power of the equity securities of the Company
that the Company Board of Directors has determined in its good faith judgment
is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms, taking
into account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal and
the Person making the proposal, and if consummated, would result in a
transaction more favorable to the Company Stockholders from a financial point
of view than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (after taking
into account any revisions to the terms of the transaction pursuant to
_Section 5.6(c)_ and the time likely to be required to consummate such
Acquisition Proposal).

  



  

(c) _No Change of Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. The
Company Board of Directors and each committee of the Company Board of
Directors shall not:

  



  

(i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Recommendation with respect to the Merger; or

  



  

(ii) except as expressly permitted by, and after compliance with, _Section
7.3(a)_ hereof, cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement or other agreement (other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to in _Section 5.6(a)_ entered into in compliance with
_Section 5.6(a)_) (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") relating
to any Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior
to the time, but not after, the Company Stockholder Vote is obtained, (x)
in response to a Superior Proposal, the Company Board of Directors may
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify the Company Recommendation (or publicly
propose or resolve to do so) or approve, recommend or otherwise declare
advisable any Superior Proposal not solicited, entered into or agreed to in
breach of this _Section 5.6_ and made after the date of this Agreement, if
the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary obligations under Applicable Law (a " _Change of
Recommendation_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that no such Change of
Recommendation may be made until at least 72 hours following Parents receipt
of notice from the Company advising that management of the Company currently
intends to recommend to the Company Board of Directors that it take such
action and the material terms of the Superior Proposal, including all
required information under _Section 5.6(f)_ (which period may run
concurrently with the period contemplated in _Section 7.3(a)_) and (y) other
than in response to a Superior Proposal, the

  



        
   

  



  

Company Board of Directors may withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify the
Company Recommendation (or publicly propose or resolve to do so) if
the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, that it is required by its fiduciary obligations
to do so. In determining whether to make a Change of Recommendation in
response to a Superior Proposal, the Company Board of Directors shall take
into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent
and any other information provided by Parent. Any material amendment to any
Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for
purposes of this _Section 5.6(c)_.

  



  

(d) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this _Section 5.6_
shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from complying with its disclosure
obligations under United States federal or state Law; _provided_ , _however_
, that if such disclosure has the substantive effect of withdrawing or
adversely modifying the Company Recommendation, such disclosure shall be
deemed to be a Change of Recommendation and Parent shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement as set forth in _Section 7.4_ (it being understood
that any "stop, look or listen" communication that contains only the
information set forth in Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall not be
deemed a Change of Recommendation or be deemed to have the substantive effect
of withdrawing or adversely modifying the Company Recommendation).

  



  

(e) _Existing Discussions_. The Company agrees that it will immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it will take the necessary
steps to promptly inform the individuals or entities referred to in the first
sentence of this _Section 5.6(e)_ of the obligations undertaken in this
_Section 5.6_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the filing of this Agreement
with the SEC under the Exchange Act by the Company shall be deemed to
promptly inform such individuals and entities for the purposes of this
provision. To the extent that it has not done so prior to the date hereof,
the Company also agrees that it will promptly request each Person that has
heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with such
Persons consideration of acquiring the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
return or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such
Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(f) _Notice_. The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event,
within 24 hours) notify Parent if any proposals or offers with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal are received by, any such information is requested from,
or any such discussions or negotiation are sought to be initiated or
continued with, the Company or any of its Representatives indicating, in
connection with such notice, the material terms and conditions of any
proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of any written
requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and thereafter
shall keep Parent informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the status and
terms of any such proposals or offers (including any amendments thereto).

  



  

Section 5.7 _Public Announcements_.

  



  

(a) The initial press release issued by the Company and U.S. Parent
announcing the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be a joint press release and in a form that is mutually acceptable to
the Company and Parent. The initial press release issued by Parent
announcing the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this

  



        
   

  



  

Agreement shall be in a form that is mutually acceptable to the Company and
Parent. Thereafter, the Company, U.S. Parent and Parent shall consult with
each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statements with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the
other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
_provided_ , _however_ , that a party may, without the prior consent of the
other party, issue such press release or make such public statement as may be
required by Law or Order or the applicable rules of Nasdaq or the London
Stock Exchange or any listing agreement if it has used its reasonable best
efforts to consult with the other party and to obtain such partys consent
but has been unable to do so prior to the time such press release or public
statement is so required to be issued or made. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the restrictions contained in this _Section 5.7_ shall not apply to
any Company communications regarding any Acquisition Proposal or a Change
of Recommendation.

  



  

(b) Parent and the Company shall agree on the content of all general
announcements made to the Companys and its Subsidiaries employees regarding
the execution of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including any employee "QandA," group e-mails, group voicemail and any other
form of communication).

  



  

Section 5.8 _Litigation_. Subject to _Section 5.3(d)_, each of Parent, U.S.
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts
to defend any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging, or seeking damages or other relief as a result
of, the Merger, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Documents, including seeking to have any Order adversely
affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents entered by any court or other
Governmental Entity promptly vacated or reversed. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company shall provide Parent the opportunity to participate in
the defense or settlement of any lawsuit or legal proceeding against the
Company and its directors referred to in the first sentence of this  _Section
5.8_ and no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior written
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  



  

Section 5.9 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

  



  

(a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor and provide for
payment of all accrued obligations and benefits under all Company Benefit
Plans set forth, and identified as such, in the Company Disclosure Schedules
(including employment or severance agreements between the Company and Persons
who are or had been employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at or
prior to the Effective Time), all in accordance with their respective terms.

  



  

(b) For 12 months following the Effective Time, Parent will provide, or cause
the Surviving Corporation to provide, each Company Employee with
compensation (including bonus and incentive compensation opportunities other
than equity compensation) and employee benefits (i) that, in the aggregate,
are substantially similar in all material respects with the compensation
and employee benefits provided to U.S. Parents similarly-situated employees
as of the Closing Date, as the same may be modified or adjusted from time to
time thereafter, or (ii) that are, in the aggregate, substantially similar
in all material respects to the compensation

  



        
   

  



  

and employee benefits received by such Company Employees immediately prior to
the Closing Date. Company Employees shall receive credit for past service
with the Company for purposes of accrual of vacation time, determination of
severance benefits, and for purposes of eligibility for participation and
vesting under the applicable Parent Benefit Plans under which they become
covered from and after the Effective Time; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition
would result in a duplication of benefits. In the event that, following the
Closing but prior to the date of payment (the " _Bonus Payment Date_ ") of
annual performance bonuses for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2008
pursuant to the terms of the Companys annual incentive plan as in effect on
the date hereof (the " _Company Incentive Plan_ "), a Company Employees
employment with the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates is terminated by
the Surviving Corporation without "cause", the Surviving Corporation shall,
on the Bonus Payment Date, pay such Company Employee the annual performance
bonus, if any, that would have been payable to such Company Employee pursuant
to the Company Incentive Plan on the Bonus Payment Date had such Company
Employee been employed by the Surviving Corporation on the Bonus Payment
Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such bonus, if any, shall be (x) based
on the Companys and the Surviving Corporations actual performance for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2008 and (y) pro-rata based on the number of
days during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008 that such Company
Employee was actually employed by the Company or the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(c) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause all actively-at-
work or similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of
insurability requirements under any Parent Benefit Plan that is a group
health plan to be waived with respect to such Company Employees and their
eligible dependents, in each case, to the same extent as service with the
Company or its Subsidiaries was taken into account under the comparable
Company Benefit Plan, and cause credit to be provided for any co-payments,
deductibles and offsets (or similar payments) made under Company Benefit
Plans for the portion of the applicable plan year prior to the Effective Time
for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket or
similar requirements under any Parent Benefit Plans in which they become
eligible to participate after the Effective Time.

  



  

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement, express or implied: (i) shall be
construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement
or arrangement, (ii) shall alter or limit the ability of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored
or maintained by any of them, (iii) is intended to confer upon any Person any
right to employment or continued employment for any period of time by reason
of this Agreement, or any right to a particular term or condition of
employment or (iv) is intended to confer upon any Person any other right as a
third-party beneficiary of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 5.10 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

  



  

(a) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, each of Parent, U.S.
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify
and hold harmless all past and present officers and directors of the Company
for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including
acts or omissions occurring in connection with the transactions contemplated
herein, to the fullest extent (x) permitted by the DGCL; (y) provided

  



        
   

  



  

under the Company Certificate of Incorporation and the Company Bylaws in
effect on the date hereof (and shall also advance expenses as incurred in
defense of any action, suit or proceeding to the fullest extent permitted
under the DGCL; _provided_ , that the Person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
that such Person is not entitled to indemnification); or (z) provided
pursuant to each indemnification agreement in existence as of the date
hereof; _provided_ , that such indemnification under (x) and (y) shall be
subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under the DGCL.  Parent
shall cause the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation to contain provisions with respect to
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses that are at least as
favorable to the indemnified parties as those contained in the Company
Certificate of Incorporation and the Company Bylaws as in effect on the date
hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
for a period of not less than six years from the Effective Time in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees
or agents of the Company, except to the extent such a modification is
required by the DGCL.

  



  

(b) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent and U.S. Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect (or Parent may
instead elect to maintain pursuant to Parents policy or policies) for the
benefit of the Companys current directors and officers an insurance and
indemnification policy that provides coverage for acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time that is substantially equivalent to the Companys
existing policy on terms with respect to coverage in the aggregate no less
favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof, or, if
substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best
available coverage; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation
shall not be required to pay an annual premium for such insurance in excess
of 300% of the last annual premiums paid prior to the date hereof (which
premiums the Company has disclosed to Parent), and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that, if the premium for such coverage exceeds such amount, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall purchase a policy with the greatest coverage
available for such annual premium.

  



  

(c) This  _Section 5.10_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger,
is intended to benefit the Company, the Surviving Corporation and each
indemnified party, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation, U.S. Parent and Parent, and shall be enforceable by
the indemnified parties. The provisions of this _Section 5.10_ are intended
to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party,
his or her heirs, and his or her representatives and are in addition to, and
not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution
that any such Person may have by law, charter, statute, bylaw, contract or
otherwise.

  



  

(d) Parent shall pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that
may be incurred by the persons referred to in this _Section 5.10_
in connection with their enforcement of their rights provided in this
_Section 5.10_.

  



  

(e) In the event Parent, U.S. Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in

such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall expressly
assume and succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.10_.

  



  

Section 5.11 _Financing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
enter into the Draft Commitment Letter; (ii) arrange for the Financing on the

shall be in effect as promptly as practicable after the date hereof; (iv)
satisfy all conditions precedent applicable to Parent in such definitive
agreements; and (v) consummate the Financing no later than the Financing
Date. Parent may, in its sole discretion, obtain or seek to obtain substitute
or replacement Financing from one or more alternative lenders. In the event
that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
and conditions contemplated in the Draft Commitment Letter, Parent shall
obtain any such unavailable portion from alternative sources as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event but in no event later than
the Financing Date. Parent shall promptly provide the Company with the

contemplated by this Agreement and subject only to the satisfaction or waiver

earlier date), except where the failure of such representations and
warranties to be true and correct (without giving effect to any limitation as

(b) The Company shall have performed or complied in all material respects
with all agreements and covenants required by this Agreement to be performed

each of them, respectively, to the foregoing effect.

  



  

(b) Parent, U.S. Parent and Merger Sub shall have performed or complied in

Section 7.5 _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_.

  



  

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) below, in the event of termination of
this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this _ARTICLE
VII_ , this Agreement shall become void and of no effect with no liability to
any Person on the part of any party hereto (or of any of its Representatives
or Affiliates); _provided_ , _however_ , and notwithstanding anything in the
foregoing to the contrary, that (i) no such termination shall relieve (x) any
party hereto of any liability or damages to the other party hereto resulting
from any willful or intentional material breach of this Agreement or (y)
Parent, U.S. Parent or Merger Sub of any liability or damages to the Company

any termination pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_) and (B) 10 Business Days prior
to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting (with respect to termination
pursuant to _Section 7.2(b))_) and thereafter this Agreement is terminated
by either Parent or the Company pursuant to (x) _Section 7.2(a) _(Outside
Termination Date), provided that none of Parent, U.S. Parent or Merger Sub

Acquisition Agreement with respect to, or shall have consummated, or there

enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay
the amount due pursuant to this _Section 7.5(b) _or _Section 7.6(b)_, and,
in order to obtain such payment, Parent, U.S. Parent or Merger Sub commences
a suit that results in a final judgment against the Company for the fee set
forth in this _Section 7.5(b) _or any portion of such fee or for Parent
Expenses set forth in _Section 7.6(b) _or any portion of such expenses, the
Company shall pay to Parent, U.S. Parent or Merger Sub its costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amount of the fee and expenses at the prime rate published in
the Money Rates section of The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, the parties hereby acknowledge that in the event that
the Company Termination Fee and Parent Expenses become payable and are paid
by the Company pursuant to this _Section 7.5(b)_, the Company
Termination Fee and Parent Expenses shall be Parents and Merger Subs sole
and exclusive remedy and shall constitute liquidated damages with respect to
this Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.6 _Expenses_.

such cost or expense. Each of the Company and Parent shall
have responsibility for its respective costs associated with preparation of

counsel, accountants, financial advisors, other consultants, financial
printers and financing sources) incurred in connection with the Merger and

exceed $5,000,000 (" _Parent Expenses_ "). For purposes of this _Section
7.6(b)_, prompt reimbursement means two days after the date on which Parent
provides documentation with respect to Parent Expenses, but, except in the
event that this Agreement is terminated in the circumstances described in
Section _7.5(b)(i)(x) _(No Stockholder Approval), in no event prior to the
date on which the Company Termination Fee is due under _Section 7.5(b)_.

  



  

Section 7.7 _Amendment_.  This Agreement may be amended by the parties in
writing by action of their respective boards of directors at any time before
or after the Company Stockholder Vote has been obtained and prior to the
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, after the Company Stockholder Vote shall have been
obtained, no such amendment, modification or supplement shall be made which
by Applicable Law requires further approval by the Company Stockholders
without obtaining such approval. This Agreement may not be amended, changed
or supplemented or otherwise modified except by an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of all of the parties.

the other party contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered
pursuant to this Agreement, and (c) subject to the provisions of _Section
7.7_, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other
parties contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any
party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

  



  

Section 7.9 _Notice_.  The party desiring to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Sections 7.2_ , _7.3_ or _7.4_ shall give written notice of such
termination to the other party in accordance with _Section 8.2_, specifying
the provision or provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination
