a portion of such holder's Phoenix Warrants be exchanged at the Combination
Merger Effective Time for shares of General Non-Voting Common Stock by so
indicating in a duly executed and properly completed Letter of Transmittal
delivered to General prior to the Closing, each of the Phoenix Warrants of
such holder in respect of which such election is duly made shall instead be
automatically exchanged for a number of fully paid, validly issued and
nonassessable shares of General Non-Voting Common Stock equal to the number of
shares of Phoenix Class A Common Stock subject to issuance pursuant to the
terms of such Phoenix Warrant immediately prior to the Combination Merger
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, subject to _Section 1.8_.

Reclassification Merger Effective Time, an option (a " _General Exchange
Option_ ") to purchase, on the same terms and conditions (including applicable
vesting requirements) as applied to each such General Stock Option immediately
prior to the Reclassification Merger Effective Time, the number of shares of
General Voting Common Stock that is equal to the number of shares of General
Class A Common Stock subject to such General Stock Option immediately prior to
the Reclassification Merger Effective Time, at an exercise price per share of
General Voting Common Stock equal to the exercise price for each such share of
General Class A Common Stock subject to such General Stock Option immediately
prior to the Reclassification Merger Effective Time (including applicable
vesting, exercise and expiration provisions); and

 



 



 

 



   



 

(ii) each share of General Restricted Stock and each right of any kind,
contingent or accrued, to receive shares of General Class A Common Stock or
benefits measured in whole or in part by the value of a number of shares of
General Class A Common Stock granted by General outstanding immediately prior
to the Reclassification Merger Effective Time (including General DSUs,
restricted stock units, phantom units, deferred stock units, stock equivalents
and dividend equivalents), other than General Stock Options (each, other than
General Stock Options, a " _General Stock-Based Award_ "), shall become, as of
the Reclassification Merger Effective Time, an award, on the same terms and
conditions (including applicable vesting requirements and deferral provisions)
as applied to each such General Stock-Based Award immediately prior to the
Reclassification Merger Effective Time, with respect to the number of shares
of General Voting Common Stock that is equal to the number of shares of
General Class A Common Stock subject to the General Stock-Based Award
immediately prior to the Reclassification Merger Effective Time (a " _General
Exchange Stock-Based Award_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, shares of General
Class A Common Stock issued in connection with the settlement of General
Stock-Based Awards which vest on or prior to the Reclassification Merger
Effective Time (including vested General Restricted Stock) shall be treated in
the manner set forth in _Section 1.6(a)(i)_.

 



 

(b) Surviving General agrees, from and after the Reclassification Merger
Effective Time, to use its reasonable efforts to maintain on file with the SEC
an effective registration statement on Form S-8 or other appropriate form
under the Securities Act to register shares of General Voting Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of the General Exchange Options and settlement of
General Exchange Stock-Based Awards.

 



 

Section 1.8 _Stock Certificates; Book Entry Shares; Letters of
Transmittal, Etc_.

 



 

(a) Each certificate that immediately prior to the Reclassification Merger
Effective Time represented shares of General Class A Common Stock or shares of
General Class B Common Stock and all shares of General Class A Common Stock
and General Class B Common Stock held in book-entry form immediately prior to
the Reclassification Merger Effective Time, in each case other than General
Cancelled Shares and shares of General Class B Common Stock in respect of
which appraisal rights are properly demanded and perfected in accordance with
the VSCA, shall from and after the Reclassification Merger Effective Time
represent an equal number of shares of General Voting Common Stock, except
that certificates representing shares of General Class A Common Stock of the
BH Persons that are converted into shares of General Non-Voting Common Stock
in accordance with _Section 1.6(a)(i)_ shall from and after the
Reclassification Merger Effective Time represent an equal number of shares of
General Non-Voting Common Stock.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, Phoenix shall (i)
mail or otherwise deliver to each Phoenix Equityholder a Letter of
Transmittal, substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_ (a "
_Letter of Transmittal_ "), for use in making the election to receive shares
of General Non-Voting Common Stock as contemplated by _Section 1.6(b)(i)_ and
_1.6(b)(iv)_ , and effecting the surrender of the certificates representing
shares of Phoenix Common Stock or Phoenix Warrants (" _Phoenix Certificates_
") or shares of Phoenix Common Stock or Phoenix Warrants held in book-entry
form (" _Phoenix Book-Entry Securities_ ") in exchange for certificates or
evidence of shares in book-entry form representing the General Stock
Consideration (together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
_Section 1.8(f)_ that such Phoenix Equityholder will have the right to receive
upon the Combination Merger Effective Time), and (ii) prepare and mail or
otherwise deliver to each holder of shares of Phoenix Common Stock the
notices, if any, required to be delivered to such holder pursuant to Sections
228(e) and 262(d)(2) of the DGCL (the " _DGCL Notices_ "), together with any
required information statement describing the Combination Merger and this
Agreement (a " _Phoenix Information Statement_ "). General shall, upon
request, furnish to Phoenix all information concerning General, its
Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably requested by Phoenix for inclusion in the DGCL Notices
and/or any Phoenix Information Statement. In preparing the DGCL Notices and
any Phoenix Information Statement, Phoenix shall consult with General, and
prior to mailing or otherwise delivering any DGCL Notice or Phoenix
Information Statement to any holder or holders of shares of Phoenix Common
Stock, Phoenix shall provide General with a an opportunity to review and
comment on such documents (including the proposed final version of such
documents).

 



 

(c) Promptly following the Combination Merger Effective Time, Surviving
General shall (i) issue to each former Phoenix Equityholder that has
surrendered prior to the Combination Merger Effective Time Phoenix
Certificates and/or Phoenix Book-Entry Securities, in each case together with
a duly executed and properly completed Letter of Transmittal, certificates or
evidence of shares in book-entry form representing the General Stock
Consideration that such former Phoenix Equityholder is entitled to receive
pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)_ , and (ii) shall make to such Phoenix
Equityholder any cash payment that such former Phoenix Equityholder is
entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 1.8(f)_.

 



 

(d) Upon Surviving General's receipt from a former Phoenix Equityholder at
any time following the Combination Merger Effective Time of Phoenix
Certificates and/or Phoenix Book-Entry Securities, in each case together with
a duly executed and properly completed Letter of Transmittal, Surviving
General shall promptly (i) issue to such former Phoenix Equityholder
certificates or evidence of shares in book-entry form representing the General
Stock Consideration that such former Phoenix Equityholder is entitled to
receive pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)_ , and (ii) shall make to such Phoenix
Equityholder any cash payment that such former Phoenix Equityholder is
entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 1.8(f)_.

 



 

 



   



 

(e) From and after the Combination Merger Effective Time, until
surrendered as contemplated by _Section 1.8(d)_ , each Phoenix Certificate
and/or Phoenix Book-Entry Security shall be deemed to represent only the right
to receive upon such surrender, in each case together with a duly executed and
properly completed Letter of Transmittal, certificates or evidence of shares
in book-entry form representing the General Stock Consideration that the
holder of such Phoenix Certificate and/or Phoenix Book-Entry Security is
entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)_ , and any cash payment that
such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 1.8(f)_. No interest
will be paid or will accrue on any such consideration. The issuance of General
Stock Consideration and the payment of any cash payment required to be made
pursuant to _Section 1.8(f)_ in respect of shares of Phoenix Common Stock
and/or Phoenix Warrants in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall
be deemed issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of Phoenix Common Stock and or Phoenix Warrants (other than the
right to receive dividends or other distributions, if any, in accordance with
_Section 1.8(h)_ ).

 



 

(f) No certificates or book-entry securities representing less than one
share of General Voting Common Stock or General Non-Voting Common Stock shall
be issued in the Combination Merger as a result of the conversion provided for
in _Section 1.6(b)_ , but in lieu thereof each Phoenix Equityholder otherwise
entitled to a fractional share of General Voting Common Stock (after
aggregating the total number of shares of General Voting Common Stock that
such Phoenix Equityholder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section
1.6(b)_ ) and/or a fractional share of General Non-Voting Common Stock (after
aggregating the total number of shares of General Non-Voting Common Stock that
such Phoenix Equityholder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section
1.6(b)_ ) shall be entitled to receive from Surviving General, in accordance
with the provisions of this _Section 1.8(f)_ , a cash payment in lieu of such
fractional shares equal to (i) the fraction of a share of General Voting
Common Stock or General Non-Voting Common Stock, as applicable, that such
Phoenix Equityholder would otherwise be entitled to multiplied by (ii) the
closing price of the General Class A Common Stock on the NYSE on the trading
day immediately prior to the Closing Date. The parties acknowledge that
payment of the cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares was not
separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical
rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to
Surviving General that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional
shares.

 



 

(g) After the Combination Merger Effective Time, there shall be no further
transfer on the records of Phoenix of shares of Phoenix Common Stock or
Phoenix Warrants which have been converted, pursuant to this Agreement, into
the right to receive the consideration set forth herein, and if any Phoenix
Certificates and/or Phoenix Book-Entry Securities are presented to Surviving
General or the Surviving Company for transfer, together with a duly executed
and properly completed Letter of Transmittal, they shall be cancelled against
delivery of shares of General Common Stock representing the General Stock
Consideration of the applicable former Phoenix Equityholder in respect of such
shares or Phoenix Warrants (together with any cash in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to _Section 1.8(f)_ ).

 



 

 



   



 

(h) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
shares of General Common Stock with a record date after the Combination Merger
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Phoenix
Certificate and/or Phoenix Book-Entry Securities, unless and until the former
Phoenix Equityholder shall surrender such Phoenix Certificate and/or Phoenix
Book-Entry Securities. Subject to the effect of abandoned property, escheat or
other applicable Laws, following Surviving General's receipt from a former
Phoenix Equityholder of a Phoenix Certificate and/or Phoenix Book-Entry
Securities, in each case together with a duly executed and properly completed
Letter of Transmittal, there shall be paid to the holder thereof the General
Stock Consideration issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (i)
promptly, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Combination Merger Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to
such General Stock Consideration and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions, with a record date after the
Combination Merger Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment
date subsequent to such surrender, payable with respect to such General Stock
Consideration.

 



 

(i) None of Surviving General, Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2, Merger Sub 3
nor Phoenix shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of Phoenix
Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or Phoenix
Warrants for any amount required to be delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

 



 

(j) If any consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the applicable Phoenix Certificate and/or Phoenix Book-Entry
Security surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a
condition to such exchange that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay
to General any transfer Taxes or other Taxes required by reason of the payment
of such consideration to a Person other than that of the registered holder of
the Phoenix Certificate and/or Phoenix Book-Entry Security so surrendered, or
such Person shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of General that
such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

 



 

(k) If any Phoenix Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon such Person's (i) making of an affidavit of that fact claiming such
certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, (ii) delivery to General of a
bond of indemnity in an amount and upon terms reasonably satisfactory to
General, and (iii) execution and delivery of a Letter of Transmittal, General
will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the
amount and type of consideration to be paid in respect of each share of
Phoenix Common Stock or Phoenix Warrant represented by such certificate in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

 



   



 

(l) _Legends_. Each certificate representing General Stock Consideration
shall bear a legend in the following form (in addition to any other legend
required under applicable state and foreign securities Laws):

 



 

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED. SUCH SHARES MAY NOT BE SOLD OR
TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION OR UNLESS THE ISSUER RECEIVES
AN OPINION OF COUNSEL REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE TO IT STATING THAT SUCH SALE OR
TRANSFER IS EXEMPT FROM THE REGISTRATION AND PROSPECTUS DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS
OF SAID ACT."

 



 

In addition, with respect to any General Stock Consideration, including any
General Stock Consideration issued in book-entry form, a notation comparable
to the foregoing legend shall be reflected on the books and records of
Surviving General (in addition to any other notation required under applicable
state and foreign securities Laws).

 



 

Section 1.9 _Withholding Rights_. Each of Surviving General, the
Surviving Intermediate Corporation and the Surviving Company (and any agent
acting on behalf of any of them) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement such amounts as are
required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of federal, state, local or non-U.S. Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

 



 

Section 1.10 _Dissenters ' Rights_.

 



 

(a) Shares of Phoenix Common Stock in respect of which the holders thereof
have complied with all requirements for demanding and perfecting appraisal
rights as set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL (such holders, " _Phoenix
Dissenting Stockholders_ ") shall not be converted into or represent the right
to receive the consideration provided for in _Section 1.6(b)_. Phoenix
Dissenting Stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised
value of such shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL. Each share of Phoenix Common Stock held by holders who shall
have failed to timely perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost
their rights to appraisal of such shares under Section 262 of the DGCL shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, as of the Combination Merger
Effective Time, the right to receive the consideration provided for in
_Section 1.6(b)_ , without any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the manner
provided in _Section 1.8_ , of such shares together with delivery of a duly
executed and properly completed Letter of Transmittal. Phoenix shall give
General prompt written notice of any assertions of, or withdrawals of
assertions of, appraisal rights by holders of shares of Phoenix Common Stock
in connection with the Combination Merger and any instrument in respect
thereof received by Phoenix, and Phoenix shall provide General the opportunity
to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal under the DGCL. Prior to the Combination Merger Effective Time,
except as required by Law, Phoenix shall not without the prior written consent
of General make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands, or agree to any of the foregoing.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) Shares of General Class B Common Stock in respect of which the holders
thereof have complied with all requirements for demanding and perfecting
appraisal rights as set forth in Article 15 of the VSCA (such holders, "
_General Dissenting Shareholders_ ") shall not be converted into or represent
the right to receive the consideration provided for in Section 1.6(a). General
Dissenting Shareholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised
value of such shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of the
VSCA. Each share of General Class B Common Stock held by holders who shall
have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their
rights to appraisal of such shares under the VSCA shall thereupon be deemed to
have been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, as of the
Reclassification Merger Effective Time, the right to receive the consideration
provided for in Section 1.6(a), without any interest thereon. General shall
give Phoenix prompt written notice of any assertions of, or withdrawals of
assertions of, appraisal rights by holders of General Class B Common Stock in
connection with the Reclassification Merger and any instrument in respect
thereof received by General. General shall provide Phoenix the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal under the VSCA. Prior to the Combination Merger Effective Time,
except as required by Law, General shall not without the prior written consent
of Phoenix make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands, or agree to any of the foregoing.

 



 

(c) The parties hereto agree that, if General determines that it would be
advantageous to do so, the parties will work together in good faith to
restructure the business combination of General and Phoenix contemplated
hereby ( _provided_ that such restructured business combination shall provide
the General Shareholders and Phoenix Equityholders with the same relative
economic ownership in the combined company as provided by the business
combination contemplated by this Agreement as in effect on the date hereof),
and the parties hereto shall enter into such amendments as are necessary or
appropriate to reflect any such restructuring. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, such restructured business combination may be effected by
means of (i) an amendment to the Phoenix Charter, (ii) the creation of a
holding company that would acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of capital
stock of Phoenix pursuant to a merger effected in accordance with Section
251(g) of the DGCL and (iii) the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of such
holding company with and into General.

 



 

 



   



 

ARTICLE II 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PHOENIX_

 



 

Except as specifically disclosed in a correspondingly numbered section of the
disclosure letter (the " _Phoenix Disclosure Letter_ ") delivered by Phoenix
to General prior to the execution of this Agreement (it being acknowledged and
agreed that disclosure of any item in any section or subsection of the Phoenix
Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosed with respect to any section or
subsection of this Agreement to the extent the applicability of such
disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face), Phoenix hereby represents and
warrants to General as follows:

 



 

Section 2.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 

(a) Phoenix is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware. Phoenix has the corporate
power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or
qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary,
in each case, except where the failure to have such power or authority or to
be so licensed or qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Phoenix.

 



 

(b) True, correct and complete copies of the certificate of incorporation
of Phoenix (the " _Phoenix Charter_ "), the bylaws of Phoenix (the " _Phoenix
Bylaws_ "), the Phoenix Equityholders Agreement, the Phoenix Registration
Rights Agreement, the Phoenix Warrant Agreement, and any similar agreements
relating to the shares of Phoenix Common Stock or Phoenix Warrants to which
Phoenix or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, as in effect as of the date of
this Agreement, have previously been made available to General, and none of
such documents or agreements has been amended after the date hereof except as
expressly permitted by this Agreement (including pursuant to the Phoenix
Support Agreement and the Phoenix Registration Rights Amendment).

 



 

(c) Each of Phoenix's Subsidiaries (i) is duly organized and validly

any benefit or compensation otherwise payable or required to be provided to
any such director, employee or independent contractor, (iii) result in the

respects in form and substance adequate for preparing audited financial
statements in accordance with GAAP, and fairly and accurately reflect in all
material respects all of the assets and liabilities of Phoenix and its
Subsidiaries and all contracts and transactions to which Phoenix or any of its

of internal accounting controls which provide reasonable assurances that (i)
all transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or
specific authorization, and (ii) access to their property and assets is
permitted only in accordance with management's general or specific
authorization. None of Phoenix or any of its Subsidiaries has received any

its Subsidiaries have used any improper accounting practice that would have
the effect of not reflecting or incorrectly reflecting in the books and
records of Phoenix and its Subsidiaries any properties, assets, liabilities,
revenues, expenses, equity accounts or other accounts. No material weaknesses
or significant deficiencies in the internal control environment of Phoenix and
its Subsidiaries have been identified. The minute books of the meetings of the
board of directors, members and/or stockholders of Phoenix and each of its
Subsidiaries (including the committees thereof), as applicable, as previously
made available to General, contain complete and correct records of all such
meetings and accurately reflect all material corporate or limited liability
company actions of the board of directors, members, and/or stockholders of
Phoenix or applicable Subsidiary.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) Since January 1, 2010, (i) neither Phoenix nor any of its Subsidiaries
nor any of their respective directors or officers has received or otherwise
had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing
practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of Phoenix or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Phoenix or any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and
(ii) no attorney representing Phoenix or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or
not employed by Phoenix or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a
material violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation by Phoenix or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
officers, directors, employees or agents to the Phoenix Board or any committee
thereof or to any director or officer of Phoenix.

 



 

Section 2.18 _Insurance_. Phoenix has made available to General true and
complete copies of all material insurance policies covering the assets,
businesses, equipment, properties, operations, employees, officers and
directors of Phoenix and its Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement, a
list of which is set forth on _Section 2.18_ of the Phoenix Disclosure Letter.
Each such policy is in full force and effect and enforceable in accordance
with its terms. All premiums payable under all such policies have been paid or
accrued, when due or within applicable grace periods, and Phoenix and its
Subsidiaries are otherwise in compliance in all material respects with the
terms and conditions of all such policies.

 



 

Section 2.19 _Intellectual Property_.

 



 

(a) _Section 2.19_ of the Phoenix Disclosure Letter sets forth a true,
correct and complete list of patents and trademarks that are owned by and
material to Phoenix or the Phoenix Subsidiaries and that are registered or
subject to pending applications for registration. Phoenix or the Phoenix
Subsidiaries own all right, title and interest in and to, free of all Liens
other than Permitted Liens, or have a right to use, all Intellectual Property
necessary for the conduct of the businesses of Phoenix and the Phoenix
Subsidiaries taken as a whole as now being conducted (the " _Phoenix IP_ ").
To the Knowledge of Phoenix, each item of Phoenix IP set forth in _Section
2.19_ of the Phoenix Disclosure Letter is valid, subsisting and enforceable.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) (i) To the Knowledge of Phoenix, no Phoenix IP owned by Phoenix or a
Phoenix Subsidiary is being infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated
by any third party and (ii) neither Phoenix nor any Phoenix Subsidiary is
infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating any Intellectual Property
owned by any third party, in each case with respect to clauses (i) and (ii),
that would reasonably be expected to result in a material liability for
Phoenix or any Phoenix Subsidiary. Neither Phoenix nor any Phoenix Subsidiary
has received written notice of any such claims (as set forth in clauses (i)
and (ii) above) during the past year and there are no claims against Phoenix
or any Phoenix Subsidiary presently pending or, to the Knowledge of Phoenix,
threatened, alleging infringement, misappropriation or other violation of any
third-party Intellectual Property. There is no outstanding Order that
restricts, in a way material to the business of Phoenix and the Phoenix
Subsidiaries, the use or ownership of any Phoenix IP issued directly to
Phoenix or any Phoenix Subsidiary, neither Phoenix nor any Phoenix Subsidiary
is a party to any such outstanding Order and, to the Knowledge of Phoenix,
Phoenix and the Phoenix Subsidiaries are not otherwise subject to any such
outstanding Order.

 



 

(c) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Phoenix, there is no pending or,
to the Knowledge of Phoenix, threatened claim or dispute regarding or
disputing the ownership, registrability or enforceability of, or use by,
Phoenix or any Phoenix Subsidiary, of any Phoenix IP owned by Phoenix or a
Phoenix Subsidiary, except with respect to office actions in connection with
applications in the ordinary course of prosecution of any applied for
Intellectual Property.

 



 

Section 2.20 _Related Party Transactions_. Except for Contracts,
transactions and other arrangements that are solely among Phoenix and its
wholly owned Subsidiaries, or that relate solely to director or employee
compensation and/or benefits in the ordinary course of business, no (x)
equityholder, officer or director of Phoenix or any of its Subsidiaries, or
(y) to the Knowledge of Phoenix, Affiliate of Phoenix or any of its
Subsidiaries, or equityholder, officer or director of such Affiliate, (i) is a
party to any Contract, transaction or other arrangement with Phoenix or any of
its Subsidiaries or has any interest in any property or asset of Phoenix or
any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) to the Knowledge of Phoenix, beneficially
owns a controlling equity interest in a party of the type described in clause
(i) above (any Contract, transaction or other arrangement of the type
described in the preceding sentence, a " _Phoenix Related Party Transaction_
"). Any Phoenix Related Party Transaction is on terms that are not less
favorable, in the aggregate, to Phoenix and its Subsidiaries than those that
would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by Phoenix and its
Subsidiaries with an unrelated Person.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 2.21 _Disclosure_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of Phoenix for inclusion or incorporation by

ARTICLE III 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF GENERAL_

 



 

Except (a) as specifically disclosed in a correspondingly numbered section of
the disclosure letter (the " _General Disclosure Letter_ ") delivered by
General to Phoenix prior to the execution of this Agreement (it being
acknowledged and agreed that disclosure of any item in any section or
subsection of the General Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosed with
respect to any section or subsection of this Agreement to the extent the
applicability of such disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face), or (b)
as disclosed in the General SEC Documents publicly available, filed with, or
furnished to, as applicable, the SEC on or after January 1, 2012 and prior to
the date of this Agreement (excluding any risk factor disclosures contained in
such documents under the heading "Risk Factors" and any disclosure of risks or
other matters included in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or other
statements that are cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature),
General hereby represents and warrants to Phoenix, as follows:

 



 

Section 3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 

(a) General is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, Merger Sub 1 is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, Merger Sub 2 is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State
of Delaware, and Merger Sub 3 is a limited liability company duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware.
General has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, in each case, except where the
failure to have such power or authority or to be so licensed or qualified
would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on General.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) True, correct and complete copies of the General Charter and the
General Bylaws, as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously
been made available to Phoenix, and neither of such documents have been
amended after the date hereof except as expressly permitted by this Agreement
(including pursuant to the General Charter Amendment).

 



 

(c) Each of General's Subsidiaries (i) is duly organized and validly
existing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is duly
qualified to do business and in good standing in all jurisdictions where its
ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of its business requires it to
be so qualified, and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to
own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now
conducted, in each case, except where the failure to be so duly organized,
validly existing, duly licensed or qualified or to have such power or
authority would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect on General. _Section 3.1(c)_ of the General
Disclosure Letter sets forth as of the date of this Agreement the name of each
General Subsidiary, the number of shares or other equity interests and classes
of capital stock or other equity ownership interests held in such General
Subsidiary by General, the percentage ownership represented by such capital
stock or other equity ownership interest and the jurisdiction of incorporation
or formation of such General Subsidiary.

 



 

(d) Each of Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 and Merger Sub 3 was formed solely
for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. All of the equity interests of Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2, and
Merger Sub 3 are owned directly by General. For U.S. federal and applicable
state income tax purposes, Merger Sub3 is, and has been at all times since its
formation, disregarded as an entity separate from General within the meaning
of Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3(b). Except for the obligations or
liabilities incurred in connection with its organization and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, each of Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 has not,
and will not have prior to the Combination Merger Effective Time, and Merger
Sub 3 has not, and will not have prior to the Conversion Merger Effective
Time, incurred, directly or indirectly through any subsidiary or Affiliate,
any obligations or liabilities or engaged in any business activities of any

all transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or
specific authorization, and (ii) access to their property and assets is
permitted only in accordance with management's general or specific

revenues, expenses, equity accounts or other accounts. No material weaknesses
or significant deficiencies in the internal control environment of General and
its Subsidiaries have been identified. The minute books of the meetings of the

accrued, when due or within applicable grace periods, and General and its
Subsidiaries are otherwise in compliance in all material respects with the
terms and conditions of all such policies.

 



 

Section 3.20 _Intellectual Property_.

 

(a) _Section 3.20_ of the General Disclosure Letter sets forth a true,
correct and complete list of patents and trademarks that are owned by and

3.20_ of the General Disclosure Letter is valid, subsisting and enforceable.

 



 

(b) (i) To the Knowledge of General, no General IP owned by General or a
General Subsidiary is being infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated
by any third party, and (ii) neither General nor any General Subsidiary is
infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating any Intellectual Property
owned by any third party, in each case with respect to clauses (i) and (ii),
that would reasonably be expected to result in a material liability for
General or any General Subsidiary. Neither General nor any General Subsidiary
has received written notice of any such claims (as set forth in clauses (i)
and (ii) above) during the past year and there are no claims against General
or any General Subsidiary presently pending or, to the Knowledge of General,
threatened, alleging infringement, misappropriation or other violation of any
third-party Intellectual Property. There is no outstanding Order that
restricts, in a way material to the business of General and the General
Subsidiaries, the use or ownership of any General IP issued directly to
General or any General Subsidiary, neither General nor any General Subsidiary
is a party to any such outstanding Order and, to the Knowledge of General,
General and the General Subsidiaries are not otherwise subject to any such
outstanding Order.

controlling equity interest in a party of the type described in clause (i)
above (any Contract, transaction or other arrangement of the type described in
the preceding sentence, a " _General Related Party Transaction_ "). Any
General Related Party Transaction is on terms that are not less favorable, in
the aggregate, to General and its Subsidiaries than those that would have been
obtained in a comparable transaction by General and its Subsidiaries with an
unrelated Person.

 



 

Section 3.22 _Disclosure_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of General for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Form S-4 (including the Proxy Statement), the DGCL Notices or

deny, objections, actions or other proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, by or before any Governmental Entity challenging this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or that would otherwise
prevent or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation
of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by
any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, (iii) executing
settlements, undertakings, consent decrees, stipulations or other agreements,

waive existing, or to create new, relationships, ventures, contractual rights,
obligations or other arrangements of General, Phoenix or any of their
Subsidiaries, and (vi) otherwise taking or committing to take actions that
after the Closing Date would limit the freedom of action of General, Phoenix
or any of their respective Subsidiaries with respect to, or its or their
ability to retain, one or more of its or their businesses, product lines or
assets; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) General, Phoenix or any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall not be required to take or agree to take any
such actions contemplated in clauses (i) through (vi) above which would bind
General, Phoenix or any of their respective Subsidiaries in respect of any
matter if the Closing does not occur, and (b) notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, the parties hereto agree and acknowledge that this _Section
5.3_ shall not require, or be construed to require, any party hereto or their
respective Affiliates to take or agree to take any action or agree or consent
to any limitations or restrictions on freedom of action with respect to, or
its ability to retain, or make changes in, any such businesses, assets,
licenses, services or operations of General, Phoenix or any of their
respective Subsidiaries that individually or in the aggregate, are reasonably
likely to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, business
or results of operations of General and its Subsidiaries after giving effect
to the Combination Merger.

 



 

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.3(a)_ and _Section
5.3(b)_ above:

 



 

(i) Within twelve (12) Business Days of the date of this Agreement,
General and Phoenix shall, and as necessary or advisable cause their
respective Subsidiaries (excluding the Shield Companies) to, file the FCC
Applications relating to those FCC Licenses issued under Part 73 of Title 47
of the Code of Federal Regulations. As promptly as practicable from the date
of this Agreement, General and Phoenix shall, and as necessary or advisable
cause their respective Subsidiaries (excluding the Shield Companies) to, file
the remainder of the FCC Applications. General and Phoenix shall use
reasonable best efforts to obtain the FCC Consent as promptly as practicable.
General and Phoenix shall each pay 50% of the FCC filing fees relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby required by the Communications Act and the
FCC Rules to be paid by General, Phoenix or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, irrespective of whether the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated. Except as otherwise contemplated by _Section
5.3(b)_ , no party hereto shall take any action that would, or fail to take
any action the failure of which to take would, reasonably be expected to have
the effect of materially delaying the grant of the FCC Consent.

 



 

 



   



 

(ii) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement,
General and Phoenix shall, and/or shall cause their respective ultimate parent
entities to file Notification and Report Forms with the Federal Trade
Commission and the United States Department of Justice pursuant to the HSR
Act, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall
thereafter promptly respond to all requests received from such agencies for
additional information or documentation. General and Phoenix shall each pay
50% of the filing fees payable under the HSR Act by General, Phoenix or any of
their respective ultimate parent entities relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, irrespective of whether the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are consummated.

 



 

(iii) To avoid disruption or delay in the processing of the FCC
Applications, General and Phoenix shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries (other than the Shield Companies) to, agree (i) as part of the
FCC Applications, to request that the FCC apply its policy of permitting the
assignment or transfer of control of the FCC Licenses in transactions
involving multiple stations to proceed, notwithstanding the pendency of any
Renewal Application, and (ii) to make such representations and undertakings as
are necessary or appropriate to invoke such policy, including undertakings to
assume, as between the parties and the FCC, the position of the applicant
before the FCC with respect to any pending Renewal Application and to assume
the corresponding regulatory risks relating to any such Renewal Application.
In addition, General and Phoenix acknowledge that, to the extent reasonably
necessary to expedite the grant by the FCC of any Renewal Application with
respect to any Station and thereby to facilitate the grant of the FCC Consent
with respect to such Station, each of General, Phoenix and their applicable
Subsidiaries shall be permitted to enter into tolling agreements with the FCC
to extend the statute of limitations for the FCC to determine or impose a
forfeiture penalty against such Station in connection with (i) any pending
complaints that such Station aired programming that contained obscene,
indecent or profane material or (ii) any other enforcement matters against
such Station with respect to which the FCC may permit General or Phoenix (or
any of their respective Subsidiaries) to enter into a tolling agreement.

 



 

 



   



 

(iv) If the Closing shall not have occurred for any reason within the
original effective periods of the FCC Consent, and neither party shall have
terminated this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof, General and Phoenix
shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain one or more extensions of
the effective period of the FCC Consent to permit consummation of the
transactions hereunder. Upon receipt of the FCC Consent, Phoenix and General
shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to maintain in effect the
FCC Consent to permit consummation of the transactions hereunder. No extension
of the FCC Consent shall limit the right of General and Phoenix to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, each of Phoenix and General shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel
and other representatives of the other, reasonable access, during normal
business hours during the period from the date of this Agreement to the
earlier of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms and
the Combination Merger Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts
and records, and, during such period, each of such parties shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to the other all other information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other may reasonably
request. Neither Phoenix nor General nor any of their Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of such party or its
Subsidiaries or contravene any Law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree
or fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement. Each of Phoenix and General shall make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the
preceding sentence apply.

 



 

(b) All information and materials provided pursuant to this Agreement
shall be subject to the provisions of that certain confidentiality agreement,
dated as of November 21, 2012, by and between General and Phoenix (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 



 

(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect the representations and warranties of the other
set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.5 _Employee Matters_.

 

 



   



 

(a) From and after the Conversion Merger Effective Time, the employees of
General and its Subsidiaries who are employed by General and its Subsidiaries
(excluding the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries) as of the
Reclassification Merger Effective Time and who remain employed by General and
its Subsidiaries thereafter (the " _General Continuing Employees_ ") and the
employees of Phoenix and its Subsidiaries who are employed by the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Conversion Merger Effective Time and
who remain employed by General or any of its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries) thereafter (the " _Phoenix Continuing
Employees_ ", and together with the General Continuing Employees, the "
_Continuing Employees_ ") will continue to participate and have coverage or
will be offered participation and coverage under the applicable General
Benefit Plans, Phoenix Benefit Plans or employee benefit plans adopted or
implemented by General or its Subsidiaries at or following the Closing (each,
a " _New Benefit Plan_ ", and, together with the General Benefit Plans and the
Phoenix Benefit Plans following the Closing, the " _Merger Benefit Plans_ "),
or a combination thereof, as determined by Phoenix and General prior to the
Conversion Merger Effective Time, and without duplication of benefits.

 



 

(b) General shall cause (i) each General Benefit Plan in which Phoenix
Continuing Employees become eligible to participate, (ii) each Phoenix Benefit
Plan in which General Continuing Employees become eligible to participate and
(iii) each New Benefit Plan in which Continuing Employees become eligible to
participate, to take into account for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
benefit accruals (solely, in the case of benefit accruals, with respect to
Merger Benefit Plans that are not defined benefit plans or provide post-
retirement health or welfare benefits, except as required by applicable Law or
under any Merger Benefit Plan that replaces a comparable General Benefit Plan
or Phoenix Benefit Plan, as applicable), the service of such Continuing
Employees with Phoenix and its Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entities) and
General and its Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entities), as applicable, to
the same extent as such service was credited for such purpose, with respect to
a General Continuing Employee, by General and its Subsidiaries and, with
respect to Phoenix Continuing Employees, by Phoenix and its Subsidiaries;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such service shall not be recognized to the
extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits with
respect to the same period of service or with respect to New Benefit Plans for
which prior service is not taken into account or with respect to plans for
which participation and/or service is frozen.

 



 

(c) At and following the Conversion Merger Effective Time, General shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Company, as applicable, to, honor the accrued
and vested obligations of General and Phoenix and their respective
Subsidiaries as of the Conversion Merger Effective Time under the provisions
of the General Benefit Plans, General Employment Agreements, Phoenix Benefit
Plans, Phoenix Employment Agreements, and New Benefit Plans, as applicable;
_provided_ that this provision shall not prevent General, the Surviving
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries from amending, suspending or
terminating any such plans or agreements to the extent permitted by the
respective terms of such plans or agreements.

 



 

 



   



 

(d) If Phoenix Continuing Employees become eligible to participate in a
General Benefit Plan or a New Benefit Plan or General Continuing Employees
become eligible to participate in a Phoenix Benefit Plan or a New Benefit
Plan, in each case that provides medical, dental or other health care
insurance, General shall cause each such plan to (i) waive any preexisting
condition limitations to the extent such conditions are covered under the
applicable medical, health, or dental plans of General or Phoenix, as
applicable, (ii) honor under such plans any deductible, co-payment and out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by such employees and their beneficiaries during the
portion of the calendar year prior to such participation, and (iii) waive any
waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement which would
otherwise be applicable to such employee on or after the Combination Merger
Effective Time for the year in which the Combination Merger Effective Time or
participation in such medical, dental or other health care insurance plan of
General or Phoenix, as applicable, occurs, in each case to the extent such
employee had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an
analogous medical, dental or other health care insurance plan of Phoenix or
General, as applicable, prior to the Combination Merger Effective Time for the
year in which the Combination Merger Effective Time or participation in such
medical, dental or health care insurance plan occurs.

 



 

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent any Phoenix Employment
Agreement expressly requires the successor of Phoenix, its business or its
assets to expressly assume and agree to perform such agreement in the same
manner and to the same extent that Phoenix would be required to perform it if
no such succession had taken place (or such words of like import), the
Surviving Company expressly so assumes and agrees.

 



 

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent any Phoenix Labor Agreement,
which covers any Phoenix Continuing Employee and which exists as of the
Combination Effective Merger Time, expressly requires the successor of
Phoenix, its business or its assets to expressly assume and agree to perform
such agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that Phoenix would be
required to perform it if no such succession had taken place (or such words of
like import), the Surviving Company expressly so assumes and agrees.

 



 

(g) Without limiting the generality of _Section 8.9_ , this _Section 5.5_
shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party to this
Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 5.5_ , express or implied, is intended
to confer upon any other Person, including any current or former director,
officer or employee of Phoenix, General or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this _Section 5.5_. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent General,
Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2, Merger Sub 3, Surviving General or the Surviving
Company from amending, suspending or terminating any Phoenix Benefit Plans,
Phoenix Employment Agreements, General Benefit Plans or General Employment
Agreements to the extent permitted by the respective terms of such plans or
agreements. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall constitute or be deemed
to be an amendment to any Phoenix Benefit Plan, Phoenix Employment Agreement,
General Benefit Plan, General Employment Agreement or any other compensation
or benefit plan, program or arrangement of General, Phoenix or any of their
respective Subsidiaries.

 



 

 



   



 

(h) The parties hereto anticipate that, in connection with the 2014 annual
meeting of shareholders of General, the General Board will propose that the
shareholders of General approve an increase in the number of shares of General
Common Stock available for grant under General's equity incentive plans to
such amount as may be agreed upon by a majority of the post-Combination Merger
General Board, including a majority of the Phoenix Designees (as defined on
Exhibit B hereto) and a majority of the General Designees (as defined on
Exhibit B hereto). Phoenix Continuing Employees shall be eligible to
participate in the General LTIP on and after the Combination Merger Effective
Time on the same terms and conditions as similarly situated General Continuing
Employees.

 



 

(i) The parties hereto intend that General will make a $50 million
contribution to the Media General Advantage Retirement Plan after the
completion of a Refinancing, subject to available liquidity and any other
factors deemed relevant at such time by the General Board, and consistent with
General's obligations under its financing documents.

 



 

Section 5.6 _Directors ' and Officers' Insurance_.

 



 

 



   



 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any manager, director,
officer, trustee, agent, or fiduciary may have under any indemnification
agreement or under the General Charter, the General Bylaws, the Phoenix
Charter or the Phoenix Bylaws or, if applicable, similar organizational
documents or agreements of any General Subsidiary or Phoenix Subsidiary
(collectively, the " _Organizational Documents_ "), from and after the
Conversion Merger Effective Time, Surviving General and the Surviving Company
(the " _D andO Indemnifying Parties_"), jointly and severally, shall, and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries (other than the Shield Companies) to: (i)
indemnify and hold harmless each person who is at the date hereof, was
previously, or during the period from the date hereof through the date of the
Combination Merger Effective Time serving as a manager, director, officer,
trustee or fiduciary of General or Phoenix or any of their respective
Subsidiaries and acting in its capacity as such (collectively, the " _D andO
Indemnified Parties_") to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by
applicable Law, as now or hereafter in effect, in connection with any DandO
Claim and any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, Claim Expenses,
judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all
interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or
in respect of any thereof) relating to or resulting from such DandO Claim; and
(ii) promptly pay on behalf of or, within ten (10) Business Days after any
request for advancement, advance to each of the DandO Indemnified Parties, in
each case to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable Law, as
now or hereafter in effect, any Claim Expenses incurred in defending, serving
as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating with respect to any
DandO Claim in advance of the final disposition of such DandO Claim, including
payment on behalf of or advancement to the DandO Indemnified Party of any Claim
Expenses incurred by such DandO Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing
any rights with respect to such indemnification and/or advancement, in each
case without the requirement of any bond or other security, but subject to
Surviving General and the Surviving Company's receipt of a written undertaking
by or on behalf of such DandO Indemnified Party to repay such Claim Expenses if
it is ultimately determined under applicable Law that such DandO Indemnified
Party is not entitled to be indemnified. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
DandO Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one law firm to represent
them with respect to each such DandO Claim unless there is, under applicable
standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any significant issue between
the positions of any two or more DandO Indemnified Parties. To the extent
authorized or permitted by applicable Law, the indemnification and advancement
obligations of the DandO Indemnifying Parties pursuant to this _Section 5.6(a)_
shall extend to acts or omissions occurring at or before the Combination
Merger Effective Time and any DandO Claim relating thereto (including with
respect to any acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of
this Agreement, the Combination Merger and the consummation of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the consideration and
approval thereof and the process undertaken in connection therewith and any
DandO Claim relating thereto), and all rights to indemnification and advancement
conferred hereunder shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
director, officer, trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary of General or
Phoenix or any of their respective Subsidiaries after the date hereof and
shall inure to the benefit of such Person's heirs, successors, executors, and
personal and legal representatives. As used in this _Section 5.6(a)_ : (x) the
term " _D andO Claim_" means any threatened, asserted, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding or inquiry or investigation, whether instituted by
any party hereto, any Governmental Entity or any other Person, that any DandO
Indemnified Party in good faith believes might lead to the institution of any
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative,
investigative or other, including any arbitration or other alternative dispute
resolution mechanism, arising out of or pertaining to matters that relate to
(A) such DandO Indemnified Party's duties or service as a manager, director,
officer, trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary of General or Phoenix or any
of their respective Subsidiaries or (B) to the extent such person is or was
serving at the request or for the benefit of General or Phoenix or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, any other entity or any benefit plan maintained
by any of the foregoing at or prior to the Combination Merger Effective Time;
and (y) the term " _Claim Expenses_ " means reasonable attorneys' fees and all
other reasonable out-of-pocket costs, expenses and obligations (including
experts' fees, travel expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript fees,
duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well as telecommunications,
postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in connection with
investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in (including on
appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness in or participate
in, any DandO Claim for which indemnification is authorized pursuant to this
_Section 5.6(a)_ , including any action relating to a claim for
indemnification or advancement brought by a DandO Indemnified Party. No DandO
Indemnifying Party shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any actual or threatened DandO Claim in respect of which
indemnification has been sought by such DandO Indemnified Party hereunder unless
such settlement, compromise or judgment includes an unconditional release of
such DandO Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such DandO Claim,
or such DandO Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Surviving General and the Surviving
Company agree that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Combination
Merger Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, officers, agents or fiduciaries of General or Phoenix or any of
their respective Subsidiaries as provided in the Organizational Documents and
indemnification agreements of General and Phoenix and their respective
Subsidiaries shall survive the Reclassification Merger, the Combination Merger
and the Conversion Merger, as applicable, and shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms. For a period of six (6) years from the
Conversion Merger Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws
of Surviving General and the Surviving Company LLC Agreement shall contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification and limitations
on liability of directors and officers than are set forth in the
Organizational Documents of General, as applicable, or Phoenix, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of six (6) years from the Combination Merger Effective Time in any manner that
would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior
to the Combination Merger Effective Time, were directors, officers, trustees,
agents or fiduciaries of General or Phoenix or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, unless such modification shall be required by applicable Law and
then only to the minimum extent required by applicable Law.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) At General's option and expense, prior to the Combination Merger
Effective Time, General may purchase (and pay in full the aggregate premium
for) a six-year prepaid "tail" insurance policy (which policy by its express
terms shall survive the Combination Merger) of at least the same coverage and
amounts and containing terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the
directors, officers, agents or fiduciaries of General or any of its
Subsidiaries as General's and its Subsidiaries' existing directors' and
officers' insurance policy or policies, covering without limitation the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, with a claims period of six (6)
years from the Combination Merger Effective Time for DandO Claims arising from
facts or events that occurred on or prior to the Combination Merger Effective
Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the premium for such tail policy shall not
exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the aggregate annual amounts currently
paid by General and its Subsidiaries for such insurance (such amount being the
" _General Maximum Premium_ "). If General shall obtain such tail policy prior
to the Combination Merger Effective Time, Surviving General shall cause such
policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and honor
all obligations thereunder. If General fails to obtain such tail policy prior
to the Combination Merger Effective Time, Surviving General shall obtain such
a tail policy, _provided_ , _however_ , that the premium for such tail policy
shall not exceed the General Maximum Premium; _provided_ , _further_ , that if
such tail policy cannot be obtained or can be obtained only by paying
aggregate premiums in excess of the General Maximum Premium, Surviving General
shall only be required to obtain as much coverage as can be obtained by paying
a premium equal to the General Maximum Premium. At Phoenix's option and
expense, prior to the Combination Merger Effective Time, Phoenix may purchase
(and pay in full the aggregate premium for) a six-year prepaid "tail"
insurance policy (which policy by its express terms shall survive the
Combination Merger and the Conversion Merger) of at least the same coverage
and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are no less favorable to
the directors, officers, agents or fiduciaries of Phoenix or any of its
Subsidiaries as Phoenix's and its Subsidiaries' existing directors' and
officers' insurance policy or policies, covering without limitation the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, with a claims period of six (6)
years from the Combination Merger Effective Time for DandO Claims arising from
facts or events that occurred on or prior to the Combination Merger Effective
Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the premium for such tail policy shall not
exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the aggregate annual amounts currently
paid by Phoenix and its Subsidiaries for such insurance (such amount being the
" _Phoenix Maximum Premium_ "). If Phoenix shall obtain such tail policy prior
to the Combination Merger Effective Time, Surviving General shall cause such
policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and shall
cause Phoenix to honor all its obligations thereunder. If Phoenix fails to
obtain such tail policy prior to the Combination Merger Effective Time,
Surviving General shall obtain, or cause the Surviving Company to obtain, such
a tail policy, _provided_ , _however_ , that the premium for such tail policy
shall not exceed the Phoenix Maximum Premium; _provided_ , _further_ , that if
such tail policy cannot be obtained or can be obtained only by paying
aggregate premiums in excess of the Phoenix Maximum Premium, Surviving General
or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall only be required to obtain
as much coverage as can be obtained by paying a premium equal to the Phoenix
Maximum Premium.

 



 

 



   



 

(d) If any of Surviving General or the Surviving Company or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving company,
partnership or other entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
liquidates, dissolves or winds-up, or transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Surviving General or the Surviving Company, as applicable, assume
the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.6_.

 



 

(e) Surviving General and the Surviving Company shall be jointly and
severally obligated to pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by any DandO Indemnified Party in
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 5.6_ ;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such DandO Indemnified Party provides an
undertaking to repay such expenses if it is determined by a final and non-
appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Person is
not legally entitled to indemnification under Law.

 



 

(f) The provisions of this _Section 5.6_ are intended to be for the
express benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each DandO Indemnified Party
(who are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.6_ ), his
or her heirs and his or her personal representatives, shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of Surviving General, General, Phoenix and the
Surviving Company and shall not be amended after the Reclassification Merger
Effective Time in a manner that is adverse to any DandO Indemnified Party
(including their successors, assigns and heirs) without the prior written
consent of such DandO Indemnified Party (including the successors, assigns and
heirs) affected thereby. The exculpation and indemnification provided for by
this _Section 5.6_ shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to
which a DandO Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to applicable Law,
contract or otherwise.

 



 

Section 5.7 _Advice of Changes_. Each of General, on the one hand, and
Phoenix, on the other hand, shall promptly advise the other of any change or
event (i) having or reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Phoenix, in the case of Phoenix, or a Material Adverse Effect on General, in
the case of General, or (ii) that it believes would or would be reasonably
likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations,
warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or
the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement;
_provided_ , _further_ , that a failure to comply with this _Section 5.7_
shall not constitute the failure of any condition set forth in _Article VI_
to be satisfied unless the underlying Material Adverse Effect or material
breach would independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in
_Article VI_ to be satisfied.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Tax Matters_. 

 

(a) Phoenix shall use its reasonable best efforts to deliver to Debevoise
and Plimpton LLP, counsel to Phoenix (" _Debevoise_ "), and Fried, Frank,
Harris, Shriver and Jacobson LLP, counsel to General (" _Fried Frank_ "), a "Tax

as of the date the Form S-4 shall have been declared effective by the SEC),
signed by an officer of Phoenix, and containing representations of Phoenix,
and General shall use its reasonable best efforts to deliver to Fried Frank
and Debevoise a "Tax Representation Letter," dated as of the Closing Date
(and, if requested, dated as of the date the Form S-4 shall have been declared
effective by the SEC), signed by an officer of General, and containing
representations of General, in each case, as shall be reasonably necessary or
appropriate to enable Fried Frank to render the opinion described in _Section
6.2(c)_ and Debevoise to render the opinion described in _Section 6.3(c)_.

efforts to obtain from Fried Frank the opinion described in _Section 6.2(c)_
(and any similar opinion to be attached as an exhibit to the Form S-4).

to cause the Combination Transaction to qualify as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii) not to, and not permit or
cause any Affiliate to, take or cause to be taken any action that would cause
the Combination Transaction to fail to qualify as a "reorganization" under
Section 368(a) of the Code.

 



 

(d) On or prior to the Closing Date, Phoenix shall deliver to General a
certificate (i) dated as of the Closing Date, (ii) substantially in the form
provided for in Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1445-2(c)(3) and 1.897-2(h) and
(iii) certifying that the shares of Phoenix Common Stock are not United States
real property interests within the meaning of Section 897(c) of the Code.

 



 

Section 5.9 _Stockholder Approval Actions_.

 



 

(a) Phoenix shall use reasonable best efforts by enforcing its rights
under the Phoenix Support Agreement to cause the Phoenix Equityholders party
to the Phoenix Support Agreement (i) to execute irrevocable written consents
granting the Phoenix Equityholders Approval immediately (and in any event
within 24 hours) and to otherwise grant the Phoenix Approvals after the

their respective obligations under the General Support Agreement.

 



 

(b) General shall use reasonable best efforts by enforcing its rights

(a) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Combination Merger
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, (i) Phoenix shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and

making, submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal with respect to

(v) enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger,
acquisition, purchase or joint venture agreement or other similar agreement
for any Acquisition Transaction with respect to Phoenix.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.10(a)_ , Phoenix
shall be permitted to perform its obligations in respect of the administration
of any transfer of Phoenix Common Stock or Phoenix warrants by the holders
thereof permitted under the Phoenix Support Agreement.

 



 

(b) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Combination Merger
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, (i) General shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and
(ii) General shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use its and their
respective reasonable best efforts to cause the Representatives of General and
of its Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly:

 



 

(i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate the
making, submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal with respect to

(ii) furnish any information regarding General or any of its Subsidiaries
to any Person in connection with or in response to an Acquisition Proposal
with respect to General or Acquisition Inquiry with respect to General;

 



 

(iii) engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person relating to
any Acquisition Proposal with respect to General or Acquisition Inquiry with
respect to General;

 



 

(iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal with respect

 _provided_ , _however_ , that if after the date hereof but prior to the time
that all Required General Votes are obtained (the " _Approval Time_ "), the
General Board receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal made after the
date hereof but prior to the Approval Time and which has not resulted from a
violation of this _Section 5.10_ , General may, at any time prior to the
Approval Time, contact the Person who made such Acquisition Proposal to
clarify the terms and conditions thereof, and if the General Board determines
in its good faith judgment, after consulting with outside counsel and
nationally recognized third party financial advisors, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a General
Superior Offer (it being understood that, for purposes of determining whether
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead
to a General Superior Offer, the General Board may assume that such
Acquisition Proposal will receive the necessary support of holders of General
Class B Common Stock), and, after consultation with outside counsel, that the
failure to take the actions described in clauses (A) and (B) below would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the General Board's fiduciary duties
to General Shareholders under applicable Law, then General may, at any time
prior to the Approval Time (A) furnish information with respect to General and
its Subsidiaries to the Person or Persons (and its or their Representatives
and potential financing sources) making such Acquisition Proposal, but only
after such Person or Persons enter into a customary confidentiality agreement
with General (which confidentiality agreement must be no less restrictive with
respect to the confidential treatment of information by such Person than the
Confidentiality Agreement) and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations
with such Person or Persons (and its or their Representatives and potential
financing sources) regarding any Acquisition Proposal made by such Person or
Persons; _provided_ , that General shall give written notice to Phoenix after
any such determination by the General Board and before taking any of the
actions described in the foregoing clauses (A) and (B). General shall promptly
(and in any event, within 48 hours) provide Phoenix with all non-public
information regarding General and its Subsidiaries that is provided by General
to a Person or Persons (or its or their Representatives or potential financing
sources) making such Acquisition Proposal that shall not have been previously
provided to Phoenix or its Representatives.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.10(c)_ , the General
Board shall not (i) (A) fail to make or withdraw or qualify, amend or modify
in any manner adverse to Phoenix, or propose publicly to withdraw, or to
qualify, amend or modify, in any manner adverse to Phoenix, the General Board
Recommendation or (B) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in this clause (i)
being referred to as a " _General Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") (it being
understood that (x) subject to and without limitation of _Section 5.10(d)_ ,
taking a neutral position or no position with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal for General shall be considered a General Adverse Recommendation
Change, and (y) the following shall not constitute a General Adverse
Recommendation Change prohibited hereunder: (1) any "stop, look and listen"
disclosure in compliance with Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, and (2) any
communication by General that expressly continues to recommend the
transactions contemplated hereby), (ii) take any action to make the provisions
of any "fair price", "moratorium", "control share acquisition", "business
combination" or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation (including
approving any transaction under, or a third party becoming an "interested
shareholder" under, Section 13.1-725 of the VSCA) inapplicable to any
transaction contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) approve or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, or cause or authorize
General or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into, any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, merger, acquisition, purchase or joint venture
agreement or Contract or other instrument in respect of or relating to an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to General (other than a confidentiality
agreement in accordance with _Section 5.10(b)_ ). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time before the Approval Time, the General Board may
withdraw the General Board Recommendation (other than in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to General) if the General Board determines
in its good faith judgment, after consulting with outside counsel, that the
failure to make such withdrawal or recommendation would be reasonably likely
to be inconsistent with the General Board's fiduciary duties to the General
Shareholders under applicable Law, _provided_ , that General has provided
Phoenix three Business Days' prior written notice advising Phoenix that it
intends to take such action and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons
for such action, it being understood that the delivery of such notice shall
not itself constitute a General Adverse Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.10(c)_, if the General Board
receives after the date hereof but before the Approval Time a bona fide
unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal with respect to General (which has
not resulted from a violation of this _Section 5.10_ ) that the General Board
determines in its good faith judgment, after consulting with outside counsel
and nationally recognized third party financial advisors, constitutes a
General Superior Offer (it being understood that, for purposes of determining
whether such Acquisition Proposal is a General Superior Offer for purposes of
clause (ii) below,

 



 

 



   



 

the General Board may assume that such Acquisition Proposal will receive the
necessary support of holders of General Class B Common Stock), (i) General may
(but in no event from and after the Approval Time) terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)_ to enter into a definitive agreement to accept
such General Superior Offer (and take an action described in clause (ii) of
the first sentence of this _Section 5.10(c)_ contemporaneously therewith), if
General pays the General Termination Fee required to be paid by it pursuant to
_Section 7.3_ in connection with such termination, or (ii) the General Board
may make a General Adverse Recommendation Change in connection with such
General Superior Offer, but in each case described in this sentence only (1)
after the third (3rd) Business Day (such three (3) Business Day period, the "
_Notice Period_ ") following General's delivery to Phoenix of written notice,
a " _Notice of General Superior Offer_ ", advising Phoenix that the General
Board is prepared to accept such General Superior Offer (which notice shall
include the most current versions of such proposal, any other information and
material required to be delivered under _Section 5.10(b)_ that has not yet
been provided to Phoenix, and the identity of the Person or Persons making
such Acquisition Proposal) and terminate this Agreement or make a General
Adverse Recommendation Change in connection with such General Superior Offer
(it being understood that any such Notice of General Superior Offer regarding
a General Adverse Recommendation Change shall not itself constitute a General
Adverse Recommendation Change for purposes of this Agreement) (and during such
Notice Period, to the extent requested by Phoenix, General and its
Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Phoenix and Phoenix's
Representatives with respect to any revisions to the terms of this Agreement
or any other Transaction Documents proposed by Phoenix so that such
Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a General Superior Offer), and (2)
if after taking into consideration any revisions to the terms of this
Agreement or any other Transaction Documents proposed in writing by Phoenix by
5 p.m. Eastern Time on the last day of such Notice Period, the General Board
continues to believe in its good faith judgment, after consulting with outside
counsel and nationally recognized third party financial advisors, that such
Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a General Superior Offer (it
being understood that, for purposes of determining whether such Acquisition
Proposal is a General Superior Offer for purposes of clause (ii) below, the
General Board may assume that such Acquisition Proposal will receive the
necessary support of holders of General Class B Common Stock), and that, after
consultation with outside counsel, the failure to (i) terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)_ or (ii) make a General Adverse Recommendation
Change in connection with such General Superior Offer would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with the General Board's fiduciary duties to the
General Shareholders under applicable Law. Any (i) amendment to the financial
or other material terms of such General Superior Offer or (ii) amendment to an
Acquisition Proposal that the General Board had determined no longer
constitutes a General Superior Offer, shall constitute a new Acquisition
Proposal and shall require General to deliver to Phoenix a new Notice of
General Superior Offer and a new Notice Period (which shall be two (2),
instead of three (3), Business Days in length) shall commence thereafter.
Except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Section 5.10(c)_ ,
General shall have no right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(g)_.

 



 

 



   



 

(d) Nothing in this _Section 5.10_ shall prohibit the General Board from
taking and disclosing to General's shareholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under
the Exchange Act or making any disclosure to its shareholders required
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC if the General Board
determines, in its good faith judgment, after consultation with outside
counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties or applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such disclosure of a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act other than (i) a
"stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) an express rejection of
an applicable Acquisition Proposal or (iii) an express reaffirmation of its
General Board Recommendation, shall be deemed a General Adverse
Recommendation.

 



 

(e) Each of General and Phoenix shall promptly advise the other party to
this Agreement orally and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Inquiry (including the identity of the Person making or submitting
such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry and the terms thereof and all
material modifications thereto) that is made or submitted by any Person during
the period beginning on the date hereof until the Combination Merger Effective
Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms. If General receives an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry, it
shall (i) promptly notify Phoenix (within no more than 48 hours) of the
communication or receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, Acquisition Inquiry, or
any request for discussions or negotiations that could reasonably be expected
to be related to an Acquisition Inquiry or Acquisition Proposal, indicating,
in connection with such notice, the identity of the person making such
Acquisition Proposal or request and the material terms and conditions thereof,
and (ii) keep Phoenix reasonably informed on a current basis of any material
developments in the status and terms of any such Acquisition Proposal,
Acquisition Inquiry or request (including whether such Acquisition Proposal,
Acquisition Inquiry or request has been withdrawn or rejected and any material
change to the terms thereof).

 



 

 



   



 

(f) Each of General and Phoenix shall immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any discussions existing as of the date of this Agreement with any
Person that relate to any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry in
respect of General (in the case of General) or Phoenix (in the case of
Phoenix).

 



 

Section 5.11 _Refinancing_.

 



 

The parties shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain and consummate a Refinancing (it being understood that obtaining such
financing is not a condition to the parties' obligations to consummate any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in connection with the
Closing, including providing and causing their respective Subsidiaries to
provide, and using commercially reasonable efforts to cause their
Representatives to provide, all cooperation reasonably requested by any other
party in connection with obtaining any Refinancing ( _provided_ that such
requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the parties and their respective Subsidiaries and _provided_
that none of the parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be
required to enter into any agreements in connection therewith that would be
binding if the Closing does not occur). Each party shall provide such
information as is reasonably necessary to prepare customary offering documents
for the Refinancing, and each such party shall, to the extent it is aware of
any applicable developments, promptly update any such information provided by
it for use in such offering documents to the extent such information would
otherwise contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading.

 



 

Section 5.12 _Section 16 Matters_.

 



 

Prior to the Reclassification Merger Effective Time, General shall take all
such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispositions of General Class A
Common Stock or General Class B Common Stock (including derivative securities
with respect to such General Class A Common Stock or General Class B Common
Stock) or acquisitions of General Common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to such General Common Stock) resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject
to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with
respect to General, or who will become subject to such reporting requirements
with respect to General, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 5.13 _2014 General Shareholders Meeting_. Prior to the
Combination Merger Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, General shall not (i) hold its annual meeting of
shareholders for the 2014 calendar year, or (ii) call a special meeting of the
General Shareholders for the purpose of electing directors.

 



 

Section 5.14 _Transaction Litigation_. Each of General and Phoenix shall
promptly notify the other of any actions, suits, claims, investigations or
proceedings commenced or, to its knowledge, threatened, against it and/or its
directors or officers relating to this Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents or any of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
(collectively, " _Transaction Litigation_ "). Each of General and Phoenix
shall cooperate with the other in the defense or settlement of any Transaction
Litigation, shall give the other party the opportunity to consult with it
regarding the defense or settlement of such Transaction Litigation and shall
give the other party's advice due consideration with respect to such
Transaction Litigation. Neither Phoenix, General nor any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall agree to any settlement of Transaction Litigation without
the prior written consent of the other party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld).

 



 

Section 5.15 _Obligations of Merger Subsidiaries_. General shall take
all action necessary to cause Merger Sub 1, Merger Sub 2 and Merger Sub 3 to
perform their respective obligations under this Agreement and the
Reclassification Plan of Merger and to consummate the Mergers on the terms and
conditions contemplated hereby and by the Reclassification Plan of Merger.

 



 

Section 5.16 _Shield Companies_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary (including in respect of _Sections_ _4.1_ , _4.2_ ,
_5.4_ , _5.6_ , _5.11_ and _8.8)_ , (i) Phoenix and its Subsidiaries shall
have no duty or obligation hereunder or in the transactions contemplated
hereby to cause the Shield Companies to take any action or forego from taking
any action, except to the extent that Phoenix or its Subsidiaries (other than
the Shield Companies) have a right to cause the Shield Companies to take any
action or forego from taking any action under any Contracts in effect between
Phoenix or its Subsidiaries (other than the Shield Companies), on the one
hand, and any of the Shield Companies, on the other hand (each a " _Shield
Agreement_ "), (ii) the Shield Companies have no duties or obligations
hereunder or in the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) the terms and
phrases, "shall cause each of its respective Subsidiaries to," "shall not
permit any of its Subsidiaries to," "shall permit any of their Subsidiaries,"
and similar terms and phrases shall not imply or be interpreted to suggest
that any of Phoenix and its Subsidiaries (other than the Shield Companies) has
any control over the action or inaction of any of the Shield Companies or that
Phoenix and its Subsidiaries have any obligations in respect thereof, except
to the extent set forth in the Shield Agreements.

Section 8.10 _Specific Performance_. The parties acknowledge and agree
that each of the parties would be irreparably damaged if any of the provisions
of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
are otherwise breached and that any non-performance, breach or threatened
breach of this Agreement by any party could not be adequately compensated by
monetary damages alone and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy
at law. Accordingly, each party shall be entitled (in addition to any other
remedy that may be available to it whether in law or equity, including
monetary damages) to seek and obtain (a) enforcement of any provision of this
Agreement by a decree or order of specific performance and (b) a temporary,
preliminary and/or permanent injunction to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of any provisions of this Agreement without posting any bond or
undertaking. The parties hereto further agree that they shall not object to
the granting of injunctive or other equitable relief on the basis that there
exists adequate remedy at law. Each of the parties hereby expressly further
waives (a) any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at
law would be adequate or that an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity and (b) any requirement
under any Law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining equity relief.
Each party agrees that its initial choice of remedy will be to seek specific
performance of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. If a court of
competent jurisdiction denies such relief, the parties may seek alternative
remedies, including damages in the same or another proceeding.

 



 

Section 8.11 _Non-Survival of Representations, Warranties and
Agreements_. None of the representations, warranties, covenants, and other
agreements in this Agreement, including any rights arising out of any breach

agreements contained herein that by their terms apply or are to be performed
in whole or in part after the Combination Merger Effective Time including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the covenants contained in _Section 5.6_.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 8.12 _Non-Recourse_. Except to the extent otherwise set forth in
the other Transaction Documents, all claims, obligations, Liabilities, or
causes of action (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or
granted by statute) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or
by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to this Agreement, or
the negotiation, execution, or performance of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement
to, this Agreement), may be made by the parties hereto only against (and such
representations and warranties are those solely of) the Persons that are
expressly identified as parties in the preamble to this Agreement (the "
_Contracting Parties_ "). No Person who is not a Contracting Party, including
any current, former or future director, officer, employee, incorporator,
member, partner, manager, stockholder, Affiliate, or assignee of any
Contracting Party, or any current, former or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder, Affiliate, or

equity, or granted by statute) for any claims, causes of action, obligations,
or Liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with, or related in any
manner to this Agreement or based on, in respect of, or by reason of this
Agreement or its negotiation, execution, performance, or breach (other than as
set forth in the other Transaction Documents), and, to the maximum extent
permitted by Law, each Contracting Party hereby waives and releases all such
Liabilities, claims, causes of action, and obligations against any such
Nonparty Affiliates of another Contracting Party. Without limiting the
foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted by Law (other than as set forth in
the other Transaction Documents), (a) each Contracting Party hereby waives and
releases any and all rights, claims, demands, or causes of action that may
otherwise be available at law or in equity, or granted by statute, to avoid or
disregard the entity form of a Contracting Party or otherwise impose Liability
of a Contracting Party on any other Contracting Party's Nonparty Affiliate in
respect of this Agreement, whether granted by statute or based on theories of
equity, agency, control, instrumentality, alter ego, domination, sham, single
business enterprise, piercing the veil, unfairness, undercapitalization, or
otherwise; and (b) each Contracting Party disclaims any reliance upon any
other Contracting Party's Nonparty Affiliates with respect to the performance
of this Agreement or any representation or warranty made in, in connection
with, or as an inducement to this Agreement.

and ninety-nine hundredths percent (4.99%) of the then outstanding shares of

Each share of General Class B Common Stock held by holders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such shares under the VSCA shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Merger Effective Time, the right to receive the consideration provided for in _Section 5(a)_ , without any interest thereon.

 _(1) Preferred Shares_

 



 

(a) The Board of Directors is authorized, without shareholder action, to
classify or reclassify any or all of the unissued Preferred Shares from time
to time in one or more series and to provide for the designation, preferences,
limitations and relative rights of the shares of each series by the adoption
of Articles of Amendment to these Articles of Incorporation setting forth:

 



 

(i) The maximum number of shares in the series and the designation of the
series, which designation shall distinguish the shares thereof from the shares
of any other series or class;

 



 

(ii) Whether shares of the series shall have special, conditional or limited
voting rights, or no right to vote, except to the extent prohibited by law;

 



 

(iii) Whether shares of the series are redeemable or convertible (x) at the
option of the Corporation, a shareholder or another person or upon the
occurrence of a designated event, (y) for cash, indebtedness, securities or
other property, and (z) in a designated amount or in an amount determined in
accordance with a designated formula or by reference to extrinsic data or

 

events;

 



 

(iv) Any right of holders of shares of the series to distributions, calculated
in any manner, including the rate or rates of dividends, and whether dividends
shall be cumulative, noncumulative or partially cumulative;

 



 

(v) The amount payable to holders of shares of the series in the event of
voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs
of the Corporation;

 



 

 



   



 

(vi) Any preference of the shares of the series over the shares of any other
series or class with respect to distributions, including dividends, and with
respect to distributions upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
the affairs of the Corporation; and

 



 

(vii) Any other preferences, limitations or specified rights (including a
right that no transaction of a specified nature shall be consummated while any
shares of such series remain outstanding except upon the assent of all or a
specified portion of such shares) now or hereafter permitted by the Virginia
Stock Corporation Act (as it exists on the date hereof or as it may be amended
from time to time, the " _VSCA_ ").

 



 

(b) Before the issuance of any shares of a series of Preferred Shares,
Articles of Amendment establishing such series shall be filed with and made
effective by the State Corporation Commission of Virginia, as required by the
VSCA.

 



 

(c) Each series of Preferred Shares shall be so designated as to distinguish
the shares thereof from the shares of all other series. Different series of
Preferred Shares shall not be considered to constitute different voting groups
of shares for the purpose of voting by voting groups except as required by the
VSCA or as otherwise specified by the Board of Directors with respect to any
series at the time of the establishment thereof.

 



 

 _(2) Common Shares._ __

 

 _ _

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in the Articles of Amendment establishing any
series of Preferred Shares, the holders of outstanding Voting Common Shares
shall, to the exclusion of the holders of any other class of shares of the
Corporation, have the sole power to vote for the election of directors and for
all other purposes without limitation. Notwithstanding any provision in the
VSCA to the contrary, the holders of the Non-Voting Common Shares shall not
have any voting power with respect to the election of directors, the adoption
of any amendment to or restatement of these Articles, the authorization of any
plan of merger, share exchange or entity conversion or the authorization of
any disposition of assets or dissolution or for any other purpose, and shall
not have the right to participate in any meeting of shareholders, except as
may be required by the VSCA. In the event that the approval of the holders of
the Voting Common Shares shall be required by the VSCA for the adoption of an
amendment to or restatement of these Articles, the authorization of any plan
of merger, share exchange or entity conversion or the authorization of any
disposition of assets or dissolution, then, unless the Board of Directors
requires a greater vote, such approval shall require a majority of all votes
cast in respect thereof by holders of the Voting Common Shares, in lieu of
such vote as would otherwise be required by the VSCA at a meeting at which a
quorum of the Voting Common Shares exists.

 



 

(b) Except as may be otherwise specifically provided in these Articles, in all
other respects, including, but not by way of limitation, the right to receive
the payment of cash dividends, the right to share in the property or business
of the Corporation in event of its liquidation in whole or in part, and the
right to share in the assets of the Corporation in event of its dissolution
and the distribution of such assets by way of return of capital, each Voting
Common Share and each Non-Voting Common Share shall rank equally and be
identical.

 



 

 



   



 

 _(3) Other Rights._

 



 

(a) The holders of the Voting Common Shares and Non-Voting Common Shares shall
be treated equally, according to the number of Voting Common Shares or Non-
Voting Common Shares they hold, as applicable, in the payment of any share
dividend or other distribution of shares, but the holders of the Voting Common
Shares shall be issued only Voting Common Shares in respect of their shares of
Voting Common Shares in the payment of any such share dividend or
distribution, while the holders of the Non-Voting Common Shares shall be
issued only Non-Voting Common Shares in respect of their shares of Non-Voting
Common Stock in the payment of any such share dividend or other distribution
of shares.

 



 

(b) No holder of shares of any class of the Corporation shall, as such holder,
have any right to subscribe for or purchase (i) any shares of any class of the
Corporation, or any warrants, options or other instruments that shall confer
upon the holder thereof the right to subscribe for or purchase or receive from
the Corporation any shares of any class, whether or not such shares, warrants,
options or other instruments are issued for cash or services or property or by
way of dividend or otherwise, or (ii) any other security of the Corporation
that shall be convertible into, or exchangeable for, any shares of the
Corporation of any class or classes, or to which shall be attached or
appurtenant any warrant, option or other instrument that shall confer upon the
holder of such security the right to subscribe for or purchase or receive from
the Corporation any shares of any class or classes, whether or not such
securities are issued for cash or services or property or by way of dividend
or otherwise, other than such right, if any, as the Board of Directors, in its
sole discretion, may from time to time determine. If the Board of Directors
shall offer to the holders of shares of any class of the Corporation, or any
of them, any such shares, options, warrants, instruments or other securities
of the Corporation, such offer shall not, in any way, constitute a waiver or
release of the right of the Board of Directors subsequently to dispose of
other securities of the Corporation without offering the same to said holders.

 



 

(c) (i) Subject to Section B(3)(c)(iii) of this Article II and Article III,
each Voting Common Share shall be convertible, at the option of the holder
thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share into one fully
paid and nonassessable Non-Voting Common Share; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such conversion shall not be permitted if, following and after giving effect
to such conversion, no Voting Common Shares would remain issued and
outstanding.

 



 

(ii) Subject to Section B(3)(c)(iii) of this Article II and Article III, each
Non-Voting Common Share shall be convertible, at the option of the holder
thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share into one fully
paid and nonassessable Voting Common Share.

 



 

 



   



 

(iii) To effect a conversion of Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting Common
Shares permitted by this Section B(3)(c) of this Article II, a holder of
Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares shall deliver to the transfer
agent for the Voting Common Shares or the Non-Voting Common Shares, as the
case may be, the certificate or certificates representing the Voting Common
Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares to be converted, duly endorsed in blank or
accompanied by duly executed proper instruments of conversion and transfer,
or, in the case of shares held in book-entry form, deliver written notice to
the transfer agent for the Voting Common Shares or the Non-Voting Common
Shares, as the case may be, with a copy to the Secretary of the Corporation at
its principal corporate office, stating that such holder elects to convert
such shares and stating the name or names of the person or persons in which
the shares issued upon such conversion are to be issued (and setting forth the
addresses of such persons), together with proper instruments of conversion and
transfer in accordance with the procedures of the transfer agent and The
Depository Trust Company or any successor depositary (" _DTC_ "), as
applicable. Subject to Article III, conversion shall be deemed to have been
effected at the time and date when the conversion is reflected in the books of
the transfer agent following compliance with the requirements described in the
immediately preceding sentence, as applicable, with respect to the shares to
be converted, and the person exercising such conversion (or, if the notice
specifies another person to whom shares are to be issued upon conversion, such
other person) shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the class and
number of shares issuable upon such conversion at such time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, if any such conversion should require the prior approval
from the Federal Communications Commission or any successor governmental
agency (the " _FCC_ "), such approval shall have been received prior to any
such conversion; and _provided further_ , that, if, as a result of such
requested conversion, the holder seeking conversion or any holder of Voting
Common Shares would acquire or be deemed to hold an interest subject to FCC
media ownership and qualifications reporting requirements (including without
limitation an "attributable interest" in the Corporation within the meaning of
Federal Communications Laws (as hereinafter defined)), the conversion shall
not become effective until the Corporation shall have requested and received,
pursuant to Section B of Article III, information sufficient in the
Corporation's reasonable judgment to determine whether to exercise its rights
under Section C of Article III with respect to the conversion and the
Corporation in its reasonable judgment shall have determined not to exercise
such rights. If a requested conversion would cause any holder other than the
converting holder (" _Other Holder_ ") to acquire or be deemed to hold an
attributable interest in the Corporation under the Federal Communications
Laws, the Corporation shall have the discretion to convert shares of Voting
Common Shares held by such Other Holders to Non-Voting Common Shares but only
to the extent reasonably necessary to ensure that such Other Holders will
remain non-attributable in the Corporation, _provided_ , _however_ , that (1)
each such Other Holder will be given prior written notice indicating the
number of shares of such Other Holder's Voting Common Shares that the
Corporation proposes to convert to Non-Voting Common Shares, (2) each such
Other Holder will be given a reasonable opportunity to make a showing that
such Other Holder may hold an attributable interest in the Corporation
consistent with the Federal Communications Laws, (3) at the request of any
such Other Holder, the proposed conversion to Non-Voting Common Shares shall
not be made with respect to such Other Holder if the showing required in the
preceding clause (2) is made to the reasonable satisfaction of the Corporation
and (4) the Corporation shall have no other authority in the circumstances set
forth in this subsection (c) to alter the Voting Common Stock holdings of any
such Other Holder without such Other Holder's prior written consent. As
promptly as practicable following any holder's conversion of Voting Common
Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares as aforesaid, the Corporation shall (1) in
the case of conversions of certificated Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting
Common Shares, issue and deliver to the converting holder, or to such holder's
transferee, as the case may be, one or more certificates (as such holder may
request) evidencing the Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares
issuable upon such conversion and if the certificates surrendered by the
converting holder evidence more Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting Common
Shares than the holder has elected to convert, one or more certificates (as
such holder may request) evidencing the Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting
Common Shares, as applicable, which have not been converted and (2) in the
case of conversions of book-entry Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting Common
Shares, cause the transfer agent to effect (directly or through DTC) a book-
entry deposit of Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares issuable
upon such conversion to the converting holder, or to such holder's transferee,
as the case may be. Subject to Article III, in the case of certificated Voting
Common Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares, after the conversion is reflected
in the books of the transfer agent and pending the issuance and delivery of
such certificates, the certificate or certificates evidencing the Voting
Common Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares that have been surrendered for
conversion shall be deemed to evidence the Non-Voting Common Shares or Voting
Common Shares, as applicable, issuable upon such conversion. Any dividends
declared and not paid on Voting Common Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares
prior to their conversion as provided above shall be paid, on the payment
date, to the holder or holders entitled thereto on the record date for such
dividend payment notwithstanding such conversion, and no holder of Voting
Common Shares or Non-Voting Common Shares issued upon a conversion occurring
after a record date for a declared and unpaid dividend shall be entitled to
receive any payment of such dividend with respect to such Voting Common Shares
or Non-Voting Common Shares, as applicable. The Corporation shall at all times
reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued Voting Common
Shares and Non-Voting Common Shares, solely for the purpose of effecting the
conversions provided for in this Section B(3)(c) of this Article II, such
number of Voting Common Shares and such number of Non-Voting Common Shares,
respectively, as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect any
conversion provided for in this Section B(3)(c) of this Article II and shall
take all such corporate action as may be necessary to assure that such Voting
Common Shares and such Non-Voting Common Shares shall be validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable upon such conversion.

 



 

 



   



 

C. _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the shareholders of the
Corporation may be called solely by the Chairman of the Board of Directors,
the President of the Corporation or the Board of Directors.

 



 

D. _Control Share Acquisitions._ The provisions of Article 14.1 of the
VSCA shall not apply to acquisitions of shares of any class of capital stock
of the Company.

 



 

ARTICLE III

 



 

A. _Restrictions on Stock Ownership or Transfer._ As contemplated by this
Article III, the Corporation may restrict the ownership, conversion, or
proposed ownership, of shares of the Corporation by any person if such
ownership, conversion or proposed ownership, either alone or in combination
with other actual or proposed ownership (including due to conversion) of
shares of capital stock of any other person, would give rise to an FCC
Regulatory Limitation (as hereinafter defined). Ownership, conversion, or
proposed ownership shall be deemed to give rise to an " _FCC Regulatory
Limitation_ " if it (1) is inconsistent with, or in violation of, any
provision of the Federal Communications Laws (as hereinafter defined), (2)
materially limits or impairs or could reasonably be expected to materially
limit or impair any existing business activity or proposed business activity
of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries under the Federal Communications
Laws, (3) materially limits or impairs under the Federal Communications Laws
the acquisition of an attributable interest in a full-power television station
or a full-power radio station by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries
for which the Corporation or its subsidiary has entered into a definitive
agreement with a third party, (4) subjects or could reasonably be expected to
subject the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries to any rule, regulation,
order or policy under the Federal Communications Laws having or which could
reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the Corporation or any
subsidiary of the Corporation to which the Corporation or any subsidiary of
the Corporation would not be subject but for such ownership, conversion or
proposed ownership, or (5) requires prior approval from the FCC and such
approval has not been obtained. For purposes of Section B(3)(c)(iii) of
Article II and this Article III, the term " _Federal Communications Laws_ "
shall mean any law administered or enforced by the FCC, including, without
limitation, the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Communications
Act_ "), and the rules, regulations, orders and policies of the FCC. The
Corporation may, but is not required to, take any action permitted under this
Article III; and the grant of specific powers to the Corporation under this
Article III shall not be deemed to restrict the Corporation from pursuing,
alternatively or concurrently, any other remedy or alternative course of
action available to the Corporation.

 



 

 



   



 

B. _Requests for Information_. If the Corporation believes that the
ownership or proposed ownership of shares of the Corporation by any person
(whether by reason of a change in such person's ownership, a change in the
number of shares outstanding overall or in any class, or for any other reason)
may give rise to an FCC Regulatory Limitation or subject the Corporation to
FCC reporting requirements, such person shall furnish promptly to the
Corporation such information (including, without limitation, information with
respect to its citizenship, ownership structure, and other ownership interests
and affiliations) as the Corporation shall reasonably request.

 



 

C. _Denial of Rights, Refusal to Transfer_. (1) If (a) any person from
whom information is requested pursuant to Section B of this Article III does
not provide all the information requested by the Corporation completely and
accurately in a timely manner or (b) the Corporation shall conclude that a
person's ownership, conversion, or proposed ownership of, or that a person's
exercise of any rights of ownership with respect to, shares of the
Corporation, either alone or in combination with other existing or proposed
ownership of shares of any other person, would give rise to an FCC Regulatory
Limitation, then in the case of either clause (a) or any provision of clause
(b) of this Section C(1), the Corporation may (A) refuse to permit the
transfer to such proposed share owner or conversion by such person of shares
of the Corporation, (B) suspend those rights of share ownership the exercise
of which causes or could cause any situation described in any provision of
clause (b) of this Section C(1) to occur, (C) require the conversion of any or
all shares held by such holder into shares of any other class of shares in the
Corporation with equivalent economic value (it being understood that for such
purposes a Voting Common Share and a Non-Voting Common Share are deemed to
have an equivalent economic value), (D) require the exchange of any or all
shares held by such holder for warrants to acquire, at a nominal exercise
price, the same number and class of shares of the Corporation, (E) condition
the acquisition (including due to conversion) of such shares on the prior
consent of the FCC, to the extent such consent is required, (F) to the extent
that the remedies in the foregoing clauses (A) through (E) are not reasonably
feasible, redeem any or all such shares of the Corporation held by such holder
in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in Section C(2) of this
Article III, and/or (G) exercise any and all appropriate remedies, at law or
in equity, in any court of competent jurisdiction, against any such holder or
proposed holder, with a view towards obtaining such information or preventing
or curing any situation described in clause (a) or in any provision of clause
(b) of this Section C(1); _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent
reasonably feasible without materially adversely affecting the ability of the
Corporation to prevent or cure the situation described in clause (a) and/or
(b) of this Section C(1), the Corporation shall use its good faith efforts (x)
to cause any of the remedies listed in the preceding clauses (A) through (G)
to be imposed in a substantially similar manner when imposed on similarly
situated persons or stockholders at substantialy the same timeand (y) to
minimize the impact of the exercise of any such remedy on the interests in the
Corporation of the subject holders or persons or other shareholders of the
Corporation or other persons with an interest in the Corporation, subject in
all cases to the primary goal of preventing or curing any situation described
in clause (a) or any provision of clause (b) of this Section C(1); _provided_
, _further_ , that in the circumstances set forth in Section B(3)(c)(iii) of
Article II, the only remedy available to the Corporation with respect to Other
Holders will be the remedy set forth therein. Any such refusal of transfer or
suspension of rights pursuant to clause (A) or (B) of the immediately
preceding sentence shall remain in effect until the requested information has
been received and the Corporation has determined that such transfer, or the
exercise of such suspended rights, as the case may be, will not result in any
of the situations described in clause (b) of this Section C(1).

 



 

 



   



 

(2) Without limiting the foregoing, the terms and conditions of redemption
pursuant to Section C (1)(F) of this Article III shall be as follows:

 



 

(a) the redemption price of any shares of the Corporation to be redeemed
pursuant to Section C(1)(F) of this Article III shall be equal to the Fair
Market Value (as hereinafter defined) of such shares;

 



 

(b) the redemption price of such shares will be paid in cash;

 



 

(c) if less than all such shares are to be redeemed, the shares to be redeemed
shall be selected in such manner as shall be determined by the Board of
Directors in good faith, which may include selection first of the most
recently purchased shares thereof, selection by lot or selection in any other
manner determined by the Board of Directors in good faith;

 



 

(d) at least 15 days' prior written notice of the Redemption Date (as
hereinafter defined) shall be given to the record holders of the shares
selected to be redeemed (unless waived in writing by any such holder);
_provided_ _that_ the Redemption Date shall be the date on which written
notice shall be given to record holders if the cash necessary to effect the
redemption shall have been indefeasibly deposited in trust for the benefit of
such record holders and is then subject to immediate payment to them upon
surrender of the share certificates or compliance with DTC policies and
procedures for the redemption of book-entry securities for their redeemed
shares;

 



 

(e) from and after the Redemption Date, any and all rights of whatever
nature in respect of the shares selected for redemption (including, without
limitation, any rights to vote or participate in dividends declared on shares
(including declared and unpaid dividends) of the same class or series as such
shares), shall cease and terminate and the holders of such shares shall
thenceforth be entitled only to receive the cash payable upon redemption; and

 



 

 



   



 

(f) such other terms and conditions as the Board of Directors shall
determine in good faith.

 



 

(3) For purposes of this Section C:

 



 

(a) " _Fair Market Value_ " shall mean, with respect to a share of the
Corporation of any class or series, the volume weighted average sales price
for such a share on the national securities exchange (if any) on which such
capital stock is then listed during the 20 most recent days on which shares of
stock of such class or series shall have been traded preceding the day on
which notice of redemption shall be given pursuant to Section C(2)(d) of this
Article III; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such shares are not traded on
any national securities exchange, Fair Market Value shall mean the average of
the reported bid and asked prices in any over-the-counter quotation system
selected by the Corporation during the 20 most recent days during which such
shares were traded immediately preceding the day on which notice of redemption
shall be given pursuant to Section C(2)(d) of this Article III, or if trading
of such shares is not reported in any over-the-counter quotation system, Fair
Market Value shall be determined by the Board of Directors in good faith.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Non-Voting Common Share shall be deemed to
have a Fair Market Value equal to the Fair Market Value of a Voting Common
Share determined in accordance with the foregoing sentence.

 



 

(b) " _person_ " shall mean an individual, a corporation, a general or limited
partnership, an association, a limited liability company, a governmental
entity, a trust or other entity or organization.

 



 

(c) " _Redemption Date_ " shall mean the date fixed by the Board of Directors
for the redemption of any shares of the Corporation pursuant to or on the date
specified in Section C(2)(d) of this Article III, as the case may be.

 



 

(4) The Corporation shall instruct the Corporation's transfer agent that the
shares of the Corporation are subject to the restrictions set forth in this
Article III and such restrictions shall be noted conspicuously on the
certificate or certificates representing such shares or, in the case of
uncertificated securities, contained in the notice or notices sent as required
by law or pursuant to the policies and procedures of DTC in the case of book-
entry securities.

 



 

D. _Authority of Board of Directors_. In the case of an ambiguity in the
application of any of the provisions of Section B(3)(c)(iii) of Article II or
this Article III, including any definition used herein, the Board of Directors
shall have the power to determine the application of such provisions with
respect to any situation based on its reasonable belief, understanding or
knowledge of the circumstances. In the event Section B(3)(c)(iii) of Article
II or this Article III permits any action by the Corporation but fails to
provide specific guidance with respect to such action, the Board of Directors
shall have the power to determine whether to take any action and the action to
be taken (if any) so long as such action is not contrary to the provisions of
Section B(3)(c)(iii) of Article II or this Article III. All such actions,
calculations, interpretations and determinations which are done or made by the
Board of Directors in good faith shall be conclusive and binding on the
Corporation and all other persons for all other purposes of Section
B(3)(c)(iii) of Article II and this Article III. The Board of Directors may
delegate all or any portion of its powers under Section B(3)(c)(iii) of
Article II and this Article III to a committee of the Board of Directors as it
deems necessary or advisable and, to the fullest extent permitted by the VSCA,
may exercise the authority granted by Section B(3)(c)(iii) of Article II and
this Article III through duly authorized officers or agents of the
Corporation. Nothing in Section B(3)(c)(iii) of Article II or this Article III
shall be construed to limit or restrict the Board of Directors in the exercise
of its fiduciary duties under the VSCA.

 



 

 



   



 

E. _Reliance_. To the fullest extent permitted by the VSCA, the
Corporation and the members of the Board of Directors shall be fully protected
in relying in good faith upon any information provided by any person pursuant
to Section B(3)(c)(iii) of Article II or this Article III (including, without
limitation, Section B of this Article III) and the information, opinions,
reports or statements prepared or presented by (1) one or more officers or
employees of the Corporation whom the Director believes, in good faith, to be
reliable and competent in the matters presented, (2) legal counsel, public
accountants, or other persons as to matters the director believes, in good
faith, are within the person\'s professional or expert competence, or (3) a
committee of the Board of Directors of which he is not a member if the
Director believes, in good faith, that the committee merits confidence. The
members of the Board of Directors shall not be responsible for any good faith
errors made in connection therewith. For purposes of determining the existence
and identity of, and the amount of any shares of the Corporation owned by any
holder, the Corporation is entitled to rely on the existence or absence of
filings of Schedule 13D or 13G or Form 13F under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (or similar filings), as of any date, subject to its
actual knowledge of the ownership of shares of the Corporation.

 



 

F. _Severability_. If any provision of Section B(3)(c)(iii) of Article II
or this Article III or the application of any such provision to any person
under any circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Section
B(3)(c)(iii) of Article II or Article III or the application of such provision
to any other person.

 



 

ARTICLE IV

 



 

A. _Number of Directors_. From the period beginning on the Combination
Merger Effective Time (as hereinafter defined) until the election of Directors
at the 2014 annual meeting of shareholders of the Corporation (the " _2014
Annual Meeting_ "), the number of Directors constituting the Board of
Directors shall be 14, unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors
in accordance with Section D of this Article IV. As of the election of
Directors at the 2014 Annual Meeting, the number of Directors constituting the
Board of Directors shall be reduced to 11. After the election of Directors at
the 2014 Annual Meeting, the number of Directors constituting the Board of
Directors shall be such number as may be fixed from time to time in the bylaws
or by resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of
Directors, but shall not be fewer than three (3); _provided_ , that during the
Nominating Committee Designation Period the number of Directors constituting
the Board of Directors shall continue to be 11 unless such change is approved
by a majority of the Phoenix Designees serving as Directors.

 



 

B. _Vacancies_. If a vacancy occurs on the Board of Directors, including
a vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of Directors constituting
the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors shall have the sole authority
to fill such vacancy, subject to Section C(2) of this Article IV.

 



 

 



   



 

C. _The Nominating Committee Designation Period_.

 



 

(1) During the period beginning on the Combination Merger Effective Time
through the 2017 annual meeting of shareholders of the Corporation (such
period, the " _Nominating Committee Designation Period_ "), the Board of
Directors shall maintain a Nominating and Governance Committee (the "
_Nominating Committee_ "). The Nominating Committee shall be comprised of five
Directors, three of whom shall initially be Phoenix Designees (as hereinafter
defined) who are Independent Directors (as hereinafter defined) and two of
whom shall initially be General Designees (as hereinafter defined) who are
Independent Directors, each appointed by the Board of Directors in accordance
with Section 1.2(e) of the Merger Agreement. In the event that at any time
during the Nominating Committee Designation Period, the Nominating Committee
shall be comprised of fewer than three Phoenix Designees, the remaining
Phoenix Designees who are members of the Nominating Committee (and, in the
absence of any Phoenix Designees then serving on the Nominating Committee, the
Directors who are Phoenix Designees), acting by a majority vote of such
members or Directors, shall have the power and authority to recommend to the
Board of Directors an Independent Director to fill such vacancy on the
Nominating Committee who shall be a Phoenix Designee, and such recommended
Independent Director shall thereafter be a member of the Nominating Committee
upon the commencement of the next meeting of the Board of Directors, unless
the first agenda item of such meeting relates to the ratification or rejection
of such nominee (which agenda item may cover any other matter contemplated by
this Section C to be the first agenda item), in which case such Independent
Director shall become a member of the Nominating Committee immediately after
the consideration of such agenda item (unless such nomination is rejected by
vote of a majority of the Board of Directors that includes the affirmative
vote of at least one Phoenix Designee). In the event that at any time during
the period beginning on the Combination Merger Effective Time through the 2014
annual meeting of shareholders of the Corporation, the Nominating Committee
shall be comprised of fewer than two General Designees, the remaining General
Designees who are members of the Nominating Committee (and, in the absence of
any General Designees then serving on the Nominating Committee, the Directors
who are General Designees), acting by a majority vote of such members or
Directors, shall have the power and authority to recommend to the Board of
Directors an Independent Director to fill such vacancy on the Nominating
Committee who shall be a General Designee, and such recommended Independent
Director shall thereafter be a member of the Nominating Committee upon the
commencement of the next meeting of the Board of Directors, unless the first
agenda item of such meeting relates to the ratification or rejection of such
nominee (which agenda item may cover any other matter contemplated by this
Section C to be the first agenda item), in which case such Independent
Director shall become a member of the Nominating Committee immediately after
the consideration of such agenda item (unless such nomination is rejected by
vote of a majority of the Board of Directors that includes the affirmative
vote of at least one Phoenix Designee). During the Nominating Committee
Designation Period, (i) the Board of Directors shall not have authority to
fill any vacancy on the Nominating Committee that is contemplated to be filled
in accordance with this Section C(1) other than with an Independent Director
recommended in accordance with the foregoing, and such appointment shall
require a vote of a majority of the Board of Directors that includes the
affirmative vote of at least one Phoenix Designee or a deemed appointment in
accordance with this Section C(1) and (ii) no member of the Nominating
Committee shall be removed without the vote of a majority of the Board of
Directors that includes the affirmative vote of at least one Phoenix Designee.

 



 

 



   



 

(2) At all times during the Nominating Committee Designation Period, but
subject to Section C(3) of this Article IV, (x) the Nominating Committee,
acting by a majority vote of its members, shall have the power and authority
to recommend to the Board of Directors (i) the persons to be nominated by the
Board of Directors for election as Directors in connection with each meeting
of shareholders of the Corporation at which the election of Directors will
occur (but no greater number of persons than the number of Directors that will
comprise the Board of Directors as of such meeting of shareholders) and (ii)
persons to be appointed to fill vacancies occurring on the Board of Directors,
and (y) such nominated persons and appointees shall thereafter become the
Board of Director's nominees or appointees upon the commencement of the next
meeting of the Board of Directors, unless the first agenda item of such
meeting relates to the ratification or rejection of such nominee or
appointment (which agenda item may cover any other matter contemplated by this
Section C to be the first agenda item), in which case such nominated persons
or appointees shall become the Board of Director's nominees or appointees
immediately after the consideration of such agenda item (unless such
nomination or appointment is rejected by a vote of a majority of the Board of
Directors that includes the affirmative vote of at least one Phoenix
Designee). During the Nominating Committee Designation Period, the Board of
Directors shall not have the authority to nominate persons for election as
Directors in connection with a meeting of shareholders of the Corporation or
to appoint persons to fill vacancies on the Board of Directors, unless such
persons are recommended by the Nominating Committee in accordance with the
foregoing, and such persons are nominated or appointed by the Board of
Directors by vote of a majority of the Board of Directors that includes the
affirmative vote of at least one Phoenix Designee or deemed nominated or
appointed in accordance with this Section C(2). Furthermore, during the
Nominating Committee Designation Period, at least two Phoenix Designees must
be in attendance at any meeting of the Nominating Committee in order for a
quorum to be present for the conduct of business.

 



 

(3) The Nominating Committee shall recommend to the Board of Directors eleven
(11) persons as nominees for election as Directors at the 2014 Annual Meeting
(a majority of which must be Independent Directors or persons who would be
Independent Directors if elected), including (i) five Phoenix Designees
selected by the Nominating Committee, (ii) five General Designees selected by
the Nominating Committee, who shall include the Chairman of the Board of
Directors at the time of such nomination (if the Chairman of the Board of
Directors is a General Designee), the Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors
at the time of such nomination (if the Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors
is a General Designee), and the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation at
the time of such nomination (if the Chief Executive Officer is a General
Designee), and (iii) one additional person (as determined by the Nominating
Committee in its discretion).

ARTICLE V

 



 

A. Every reference in this Article V to a Director or Officer shall
include every Director or Officer or former Director or Officer of the
Corporation and every person who served at the request of the Corporation or
one of its subsidiaries as a Director, Officer, partner or trustee of any
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise, and, in all of such cases, his or her heirs, executors and
administrators. In addition, in this Article V, the terms "applicant",
"expenses", "liability", "party", and "proceeding" shall have the respective
meanings set forth in Section 13.1-696 of the VSCA.

 



 

B. In any proceeding brought by or in the right of the Corporation or
brought by or on behalf of shareholders of the Corporation, no Director or
Officer of the Corporation shall be liable to the Corporation or its
shareholders for monetary damages with respect to any transaction, occurrence
or course of conduct, whether prior or subsequent to the effective date of
this Article V, except for liability resulting from such person's having
engaged in willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the criminal law or
any federal or state securities law.

 



 

C. The Corporation shall indemnify (a) any person who was or is a party to
any proceeding, including a proceeding brought by a shareholder in the right
of the Corporation or brought by or on behalf of shareholders of the
Corporation, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a Director or
Officer of the Corporation, or (b) any Director or Officer who is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a Director, trustee, partner or
Officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee
benefit plan or other enterprise, against any liability incurred by him in
connection with such proceeding unless he or she engaged in willful misconduct
or a knowing violation of the criminal law. A person is considered to be
serving an employee benefit plan at the Corporation's request if his duties to
the Corporation also impose duties on, or otherwise involve services by, him
to the plan or to participants in or beneficiaries of the plan. The Board of
Directors is hereby empowered, by a majority vote of a quorum of disinterested
Directors, to enter into a contract to indemnify any Director or Officer in
respect of any proceedings arising from any act or omission, whether occurring
before or after the execution of such contract.

 



 

 



   



 

D. The provisions of this Article V shall be applicable to all proceedings
commenced after the adoption hereof by the shareholders of the Corporation,
arising from any act or omission, whether occurring before or after such
adoption. No amendment or repeal of this Article V shall have any effect on
the rights provided under this Article V with respect to any act or omission
occurring prior to such amendment or repeal. The Corporation shall promptly
take all such actions, and make all such determinations, as shall be necessary
or appropriate to comply with its obligation to provide any indemnity under
this Article V and shall promptly pay or reimburse all reasonable expenses,
including attorneys' fees, incurred by any such Director or Officer in
connection with such actions and determinations or proceedings of any kind
arising therefrom.

 



 

E. The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement,
conviction or upon a plea of _nolo contendere_ or its equivalent, shall not of
itself create a presumption that the applicant did not meet the standard of
conduct described in Section B or C of this Article V.

 



 

F. Any indemnification under Section C of this Article V (unless ordered
by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the
specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the applicant is
proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard
of conduct set forth in Section C of this Article V.

 



 

The determination shall be made:

 



 

(1) if there are two or more disinterested directors, by the Board of
Directors by a majority vote of disinterested directors, a majority of whom
shall constitute a quorum, or by a majority of the members of a committee of
two or more disinterested directors appointed by such a vote;

 



 

(2) by special legal counsel:

 



 

(a) selected by the Board of Directors or its committee in the manner
prescribed in Section F(1) of this Article V; or

 



 

(b) if there are fewer than two disinterested directors, selected by the Board
of Directors, in which selection Directors who do not qualify as disinterested
directors may participate; or

 



 

(3) by the shareholders, but shares owned by or voted under the control of a
Director who at the time does not qualify as a disinterested director may not
be voted on the determination.

 



 

Any evaluation as to reasonableness of expenses shall be made in the same
manner as the determination that indemnification is appropriate, except that
if the determination is made by special legal counsel, such evaluation as to
reasonableness of expenses shall be made by those entitled under Section F(2)
of this Article V to select counsel.

 



 

 



   



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event there has been a change in the
composition of a majority of the Board of Directors after the date of the
alleged act or omission with respect to which indemnification is claimed, any
determination as to indemnification and advancement of expenses with respect
to any claim for indemnification made pursuant to this Article V shall be made
by special legal counsel agreed upon by the Board of Directors and the
applicant. If the Board of Directors and the applicant are unable to agree
upon such special legal counsel the Board of Directors and the applicant each
shall select a nominee, and the nominees shall select such special legal
counsel. If the nominees are unable to agree upon such special legal counsel,
such special legal counsel shall be selected upon application to a court of
competent jurisdiction.

 



 

G. (1) The Corporation shall pay for or reimburse the reasonable expenses
incurred by any applicant who is a party to a proceeding in advance of final
disposition of the proceeding or the making of any determination under Section
C of this Article V if the applicant furnishes the Corporation:

 



 

(a) a written statement of his or her good faith belief that he or she has met
the standard of conduct described in Section C of this Article V; and

 



 

(b) a written undertaking, executed personally or on his or her behalf, to
repay the advance if it is ultimately determined that he or she did not meet
such standard of conduct.

 



 

(2) The undertaking required by Section G(1)(b) of this Article V shall be an
unlimited general obligation of the applicant but need not be secured and may
be accepted without reference to financial ability to make repayment.

 



 

(3) Authorizations of payments under this section shall be made by the persons
specified in Section F of this Article V.

 



 

H. The Corporation may indemnify or contract to indemnify any person not
specified in Section B or C of this Article V who was, is or may become a
party to any proceeding, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was an
employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise, to the same extent as if such person were specified as one to whom
indemnification is granted in Section C of this Article V.

 



 

I. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance to indemnify it
against the whole or any portion of the liability assumed by it in accordance
with this Article V and may also procure insurance, in such amounts as the
Board of Directors may determine, on behalf of any person who is or was a
Director, Officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving
at the request of the Corporation as a Director, Officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan
or other enterprise, against any liability asserted against or incurred by him
in any such capacity or arising from his or her status as such, whether or not
the Corporation would have power to indemnify him against such liability under
the provisions of this Article V.

 



 

 



   



 

J. The indemnification hereby provided and provided hereafter pursuant to
the power hereby conferred by this Article V on the Board of Directors shall
not be exclusive of any other rights to which any person may be entitled,
including any right under policies of insurance that may be purchased and
maintained by the Corporation or others, with respect to claims, issues or
matters in relation to which the Corporation would not have the power to
indemnify such person under the provisions of this Article V. Such rights
shall not prevent or restrict the power of the Corporation to make or provide
for any further indemnity, or provisions for determining entitlement to
indemnity, pursuant to one or more indemnification agreements, bylaws, or
other arrangements (including, without limitation, creation of trust funds or
security interests funded by letters of credit or other means) approved by the
Board of Directors (whether or not any of the Directors of the Corporation
shall be a party to or beneficiary of any such agreements, bylaws or
arrangements); _provided, however_ , that any provision of such agreements,
bylaws or other arrangements shall not be effective if and to the extent that
it is determined to be contrary to this Article V or applicable laws of the
Commonwealth of Virginia.

 



 

K. Each provision of this Article V shall be severable, and an adverse
determination as to any such provision shall in no way affect the validity of
any other provision.

Article I 
Meetings of Shareholders

 



 

Section 1. _Place of Meetings_. Meetings of Shareholders shall be held at
the principal office of the Corporation in Richmond, Virginia or at such other
place, either within or without the Commonwealth of Virginia, as from time to
time may be fixed by the Board of Directors. The Board may, in its sole
discretion, permit Shareholders to participate in any meeting of Shareholders
by means of remote communication as authorized by the Virginia Stock
Corporation Act (as it exists on the date hereof or as it may be amended from
time to time, the " _VSCA_ ") and subject to any guidelines and procedures as
may be adopted by the Board.

 



 

Section 2. _Annual Meetings_. The Annual Meetings of Shareholders shall
be held on a date fixed by the Board of Directors.

 



 

Section 3. _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the Shareholders may
be called solely by the Chairman of the Board, the President or the Board of
Directors. At a special meeting of Shareholders, no business shall be
transacted and no corporate action taken other than that stated in the notice
of the special meeting.

 



 

Section 4. _Notice of Meetings_. Written notice stating the place, day
and hour of the meeting and, in case of a special meeting, the purpose or
purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be given not less than ten nor
more than 60 days before the date of the meeting (except as a different time
is specified in these Bylaws or by the VSCA) either personally or by mail, by
or at the direction of the Chairman of the Board, a Vice Chairman, the
Secretary, or the Officer or persons calling the meeting, to each Shareholder
of record entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be
deemed to be given when deposited in the United States mail addressed to the
Shareholder at his address as it appears on the stock transfer books of the
Corporation, with postage thereon prepaid. Without limiting the manner by
which notice otherwise may be given effectively to Shareholders, any notice to
a Shareholder given by the Corporation may be given by a form of electronic
transmission consented to by the Shareholder to whom the notice is given. Any
such consent shall be revocable by the Shareholder by written or electronic
notice to the Corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked (a) if the
Corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive
notices given by the Corporation in accordance with such consent and (b) such
inability becomes known to the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the
Corporation or to the transfer agent or other person responsible for the
giving of notice, _provided, however_ , the inadvertent failure to treat such
inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action.
For purposes of these Bylaws, "electronic transmission" means any form or
process of communication, not directly involving the physical transfer of
paper or other tangible medium that (i) is suitable for the retention,
retrieval and reproduction of information by the recipient, and (ii) is either
(A) retrievable in paper form by the recipient through an automated process
used in conventional commercial practice or (B) retrievable in perceivable
form and the sender and the recipient have consented in writing to the use of
such form of electronic transmission.

 



 

Notice of a Shareholders' meeting to act on an amendment of the Articles of
Incorporation, on a plan of merger or exchange of shares, on a sale of assets
of the Corporation that requires shareholder approval, a plan of
redomestication or conversion or the dissolution of the Corporation shall be
given, in the manner provided above, not less than 25 nor more than 60 days
before the date of the meeting. Any such notice shall be accompanied, as
appropriate, by such additional documents as may be required by law.

 



 

 



   



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a written waiver of notice signed by the person
or persons entitled to such notice, either before or after the time stated
therein, shall be equivalent to the giving of such notice. A Shareholder who
attends a meeting shall be deemed to have (A) waived objection to lack of
notice or defective notice of the meeting, unless at the beginning of the
meeting he or she objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at
the meeting, and (B) waived objection to consideration of a particular matter
at the meeting that is not within the purpose or purposes described in the
meeting notice, unless he or she objects to considering the matter when it is
presented. 

 



 

Section 5. _Quorum_. A majority of the shares entitled to vote,
represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of
Shareholders; _provided however,_ that when any specified action is required
to be voted upon by a class of stock voting as a class or series, holders of a
majority of the shares of such class or series shall constitute a quorum for
the transaction of such specified action. If a quorum is present, action on a
matter is approved if the votes cast in favor of the action exceed the votes
cast opposing the action, except when a larger vote or a vote by class or
series is required by the VSCA and except that in elections of Directors those
receiving the greatest number of votes shall be deemed elected even though not
receiving a majority. Less than a quorum may adjourn, without notice other
than by announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall attend.

 



 

Section 6. _Organization and Order of Business_. At all meetings of the
Shareholders, the Chairman of the Board or, in the Chairman's absence, the
Vice Chairman (if any), the President (if one shall have been elected by the
Board) or, in the absence of all of the foregoing, the most senior Executive
Vice President, shall act as chairman of the meeting. In the absence of all of
the foregoing officers or, if present, with their consent, a majority of the
shares entitled to vote at such meeting, may appoint any person to act as
chairman. The Secretary of the Corporation or, in the Secretary's absence, an
Assistant Secretary, shall act as secretary at all meetings of the
Shareholders. In the event that neither the Secretary nor any Assistant
Secretary is present, the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to
act as secretary of the meeting.

 



 

The chairman of the meeting shall have the right and authority to prescribe
such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts and things as
are necessary or desirable for the proper conduct of the meeting, including,
without limitation, the establishment of procedures for the dismissal of
business not properly presented, the maintenance of order and safety,
limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments on the affairs of
the Corporation, restrictions on entry to such meeting after the time
prescribed for the commencement thereof, the opening and closing of the voting
polls and any recess or adjournment of the meeting.

 



 

Section 7. _Voting_. A Shareholder may vote his or her shares in person
or by proxy. Any proxy shall be delivered to the secretary of the meeting at
or prior to the time designated by the chairman of the meeting or in the order
of business for so delivering such proxies. No proxy shall be valid after
eleven months from its date, unless otherwise provided in the proxy. Each
holder of record of stock of any class or series shall, as to all matters in
respect of which stock of such class or series has voting power, be entitled
to such vote as is provided in the Articles of Incorporation for each share of
stock of such class or series standing in the holder's name on the books of
the Corporation. Unless required by the VSCA or determined by the chairman of
the meeting to be advisable, the vote on any question need not be by ballot.
On a vote by ballot, each ballot shall be signed by the Shareholder voting or
by such Shareholder's proxy, if there be such proxy.

 



 

 



   



 

Section 8. _Written Authorization_. A Shareholder or a Shareholder's duly
authorized attorney-in-fact may execute a writing authorizing another person
or persons to act for him or her as proxy. Execution may be accomplished by
the Shareholder or such Shareholder's duly authorized attorney-in-fact or
authorized officer, director, employee or agent signing such writing or
causing such Shareholder's signature to be affixed to such writing by any
reasonable means including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature.

 



 

Section 9. _Electronic Authorization_. The President or the Secretary may
approve procedures to enable a Shareholder or a Shareholder's duly authorized
attorney-in-fact to authorize another person or persons to act for him or her
as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram,
cablegram, internet transmission, telephone transmission or other means of
electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or
to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent
duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive
such transmission, _provided_ that any such transmission must either be set
forth or submitted with information from which the inspectors of elections can
determine that the transmission was authorized by the Shareholder or the
Shareholder's duly authorized attorney-in-fact. If it is determined that such
transmissions are valid, the inspectors shall specify the information upon
which they relied. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable
reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to this may be
substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any
and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used,
_provided_ that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction
shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or
transmission.

No person shall be eligible for election as a Director of the Corporation

under the Exchange Act and included in the Corporation's proxy statement) for
consideration by the Shareholders at any Annual Meeting of Shareholders.

 



 

In addition to any other applicable requirements, for business to be properly
brought before an Annual Meeting by a Shareholder, such Shareholder must have
given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the Secretary of the
Corporation.

 



 

To be timely, a Shareholder's notice to the Secretary must be delivered to or
mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not
earlier than the close of business on the 120th and not later than the close

anniversary date, notice by the Shareholder in order to be timely must be
delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to

directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding,
relationship or otherwise, has the opportunity to profit or share in any
profit derived from any decrease in the value of the subject security), (D)
any rights to dividends on the shares of capital stock of the Corporation
owned beneficially by such Shareholder, by such beneficial owner, if any, or
by any Associated Person of such Shareholder or beneficial owner, in each case
that are separated or separable from the underlying shares of capital stock of
the Corporation, (E) any proportionate interest in shares of capital stock of
the Corporation or Derivative Instruments held, directly or indirectly, by a

owner is entitled to based on any increase or decrease in the value of shares
of capital stock of the Corporation or Derivative Instruments, (iv) a
description of all arrangements or understandings between such Shareholder,
beneficial owner, if any, or any Associated Person of such Shareholder or

Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Any such
notice shall be supplemented not later than five business days after the
record date for the applicable meeting to disclose the information referred to

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no disclosure shall be required with respect to
ordinary course business activities of any broker, dealer, commercial bank,
trust company or other nominee who is proposing business solely as a result of
being the Shareholder of record or nominee holder that is directed to prepare
and submit the Shareholder's notice required by these Bylaws on behalf of a
beneficial owner.

 



 

The foregoing notice requirements shall be deemed satisfied by a Shareholder
if the Shareholder has notified the Corporation of such Shareholder's
intention to present a proposal at an Annual Meeting in compliance with Rule
14a-8 (or any successor thereof) promulgated under the Exchange Act and such
Shareholder's proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been
prepared by the Corporation to solicit proxies for such Annual Meeting.

 



 

 



   



 

No business shall be conducted at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders except
business brought before the Annual Meeting in accordance with the procedures
set forth in this _Section 11_ of _Article 1_ ; _provided, however,_ that once
business has been properly brought before the Annual Meeting in accordance
with such procedures, nothing in this _Section 11_ of _Article 1_ shall be
deemed to preclude discussion by any Shareholder of any such business. If the
Chairman of an Annual Meeting determines that business was not properly
brought before the Annual Meeting in accordance with the foregoing procedures,
the Chairman shall declare to the meeting that the business was not properly
brought before the meeting, and such business shall not be transacted. If the
Shareholder or its proxy does not appear at the meeting to present its
proposed business, such proposed business shall not be transacted,
notwithstanding that proxies with respect to such vote may have been received
by the Corporation.

 



 

Section 12. _Inspectors_. The Corporation shall appoint one or more
inspectors to act at a meeting of Shareholders and make a written report of
the inspector's determinations. The Corporation may designate one or more
persons as alternate inspector to replace any inspector who fails to act. If
no inspector or alternate is able to act at any meeting of Shareholders, the
chairman of such meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the
meeting. Each inspector shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the
duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of such
inspector's ability. The inspectors shall (a) ascertain the number of shares
outstanding and the voting power of each, (b) determine the shares represented
at the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, (c) count all votes,
(d) determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition
of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors, and (e) certify
their determination of the number of shares represented at the meeting and
their count of all votes. The inspectors may appoint or retain other persons
or entities to assist the inspectors in the performance of the duties of the
inspectors.

Article VI 
Certificates of Stock

 



 

Section 1. _Form_. The shares of capital stock of the Corporation may be
certificated or uncertificated as provided under the VSCA. Certificates
representing shares of the capital stock of the Corporation shall be in such
form as is permitted by law and prescribed by the Board of Directors and shall
be signed by the President or a Vice President and the Secretary or an
Assistant Secretary or any other Officer authorized by a resolution of the
Board of Directors. Transfer agents and/or registrars for one or more classes
of the stock of the Company may be appointed by the Board and may be required
to countersign certificates representing stock of such class or classes.
Certificates may, but need not, be sealed with the seal of the Corporation or
a facsimile thereof. The signatures of the Officers upon such certificates may
be facsimiles if the certificate is countersigned by a Transfer Agent or
registered by a Registrar other than the Corporation itself or an employee of
the Corporation. In the event that any officer, transfer agent or registrar
whose signature or facsimile thereof shall have been used on a stock
certificate shall for any reason cease to be such officer, transfer agent or
registrar of the Corporation before such certificate is issued, such
certificate may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if such
person was such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issuance.
Within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of uncertificated
shares of the Corporation, the Corporation shall send, or cause to be sent, to
the holder a written statement that shall include the information required by
the VSCA to be set forth on certificates for shares of capital stock.

 



 

 



   



 

In case any Officer who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been
placed upon a stock certificate shall have ceased to be such Officer before
such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same
effect as if he were such Officer at the date of its issue.

 



 

Section 2. _Transfer Agents and Registrars_. Transfer Agents and/or
Registrars for the stock of the Corporation may be appointed by the Board of
Directors and may be required to countersign stock certificates.

 



 

Section 3. _Lost, Destroyed and Mutilated Certificates_. Holders of the
stock of the Corporation shall immediately notify the Corporation of any loss,
destruction or mutilation of the certificate therefor, and the Board of
Directors may in its discretion, or any Officer of the Corporation appointed
by the Board of Directors for that purpose may in his discretion, cause one or
more new certificates for the same number of shares in the aggregate to be
issued to such Shareholder upon the surrender of the mutilated certificate or
upon satisfactory proof of such loss or destruction and the deposit of a bond
in such form and amount and with such surety as the Board of Directors may
require.

 



 

Section 4. _Transfer of Stock_. The stock of the Corporation shall be
transferable or assignable only on the books of the Corporation by the holders
in person or by attorney, and in the case of shares of stock of the
Corporation represented by certificates, on surrender of the certificates for
such shares duly endorsed and, if sought to be transferred by attorney,
accompanied by a written power of attorney to have the same transferred on the
books of the Corporation. Uncertificated shares shall be transferable or
assignable only on the books of the Corporation upon proper instruction from

Section 5. _Closing of Transfer Books and Fixing Record Date_. For the
purposes of determining Shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any
meeting of Shareholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive
payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination of Shareholders
for any other proper purpose, the Board of Directors of this Corporation may
fix in advance a date as the record date for any such determination of
Shareholders, such date in any case to be not more than 70 days prior to the
date on which the particular action requiring such determination of
Shareholders is to be taken. If no record date is fixed for the determination
of Shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of Shareholders,
or Shareholders entitled to receive payment of a dividend, the date on which
the notice of the meeting is mailed or the date on which the resolution of the
Board of Directors declaring such dividend is adopted, as the case may be,
shall be the record date for such determination of Shareholders. When a
determination of Shareholders has been made as provided in this section with
respect to any meeting, such determination shall apply to any adjournment
thereof.

This letter of transmittal (this " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") is being sent to

ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.

 



 

At the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the "
_Closing_ ", and the date on which the Closing occurs, the " _Closing Date_
"), General will reclassify each outstanding share of its existing Class A
Common Stock, par value $5.00 per share, of General (the " _General Class A

Class B Non-Voting Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Phoenix ("
_Phoenix Class B Common Stock_ ", and together with the Phoenix Class A Common
Stock, the " _Phoenix Common Stock_ ") that you hold will be converted into
the right to receive 730.6171 shares of General Voting Common Stock; and 

---|---|--- 

 



 

      |  

● __ __

 |  

each outstanding warrant (each, a " _Warrant_ " and collectively, the "
_Warrants_ ") to acquire shares of the Phoenix Class A Common Stock you hold
will be automatically converted into the right to receive 730.6171 shares of
General Voting Common Stock for each share of Phoenix Class A Common Stock
subject to such Warrant. 

---|---|--- 

 



 

However, you may, by indicating below, elect to receive shares of General Non-
Voting Common Stock in lieu of any or all of the shares of General Voting
Common Stock you are otherwise entitled to receive.

 



 

The whole number of shares of General Voting Common Stock and/or General Non-
Voting Common Stock which you will have the right to receive pursuant to the
Merger Agreement for your shares of Phoenix Common Stock and Warrants is
referred to herein as the " _Merger Consideration_ ".

 



 

No fractional shares of General Voting Common Stock or General Non-Voting
Common Stock will be issued to you. In lieu of any fractional share you would
otherwise be entitled to receive, you will receive a cash payment in lieu of
such fractional shares equal to (1) the fraction of a share that you would
otherwise be entitled to multiplied by (2) the closing price of the General
Class A Common Stock on the NYSE on the trading day immediately prior to the
Closing Date.

 



 

This Letter of Transmittal is to be used by you for the surrender of
certificates representing shares of Phoenix Common Stock and/or certificates
representing Warrants. In order to receive the Merger Consideration with
respect to the shares of Phoenix Common Stock and/or Warrants that you hold,
you must (1) complete and sign this Letter of Transmittal in accordance with
the instructions in this Letter of Transmittal, and (2) mail or deliver this
Letter of Transmittal, together with certificates representing shares of
Phoenix Common Stock and/or certificates representing Warrants being

additional letters or statements reasonably requested by General in respect
thereof, to Media General Inc., 333 E. Franklin Street, Richmond, Virginia
23219, Attention: [__]. 

 



 

 



   



 

The General Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger Agreement will
not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
_Securities Act_ "), or under any state securities laws. Under the Securities
Act, such securities will not be eligible for transfer unless they are (i)
registered under the Securities Act or (ii) are eligible to be transferred
without restriction in accordance with Rule 144 or another exemption from
registration under the Securities Act.

 



 

In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Written Consent and Voting
Agreement, dated as of June 5, 2013, by and among General, Phoenix and the
Equityholders party thereto (the " _Phoenix Support Agreement_ "), the
Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of June 24, 2010, by and among Phoenix
and the Equityholders party thereto, was amended and restated and you are now
party to an Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of
June 5, 2013, by and among General, Phoenix, and the other parties thereto
(the " _General Registration Rights Agreement_ "), attached hereto as _Exhibit
A_ , unless you indicate below (or upon other notice to General, pursuant to
Section 10(b) of the General Registration Rights Agreement), that you elect to
remove yourself as a party to the General Registration Rights Agreement. If
you elect to remove yourself as a party to the General Registration Rights
Agreement, you will not be eligible to receive certain rights specified
therein including: demand registration rights, takedown rights under a "shelf"
registration statement, and "piggyback" registration rights. If you do not
elect to opt out of the General Registration Rights Agreement, you will not be
able to short or, after the Closing, sell or short any shares of General
Common Stock until the six-month anniversary of the Closing unless such sale
occurs in connection with a registered underwritten public offering. You
should consult with your attorney to determine whether remaining a party to
the Registration Rights Agreement makes sense for you.

related matters should be addressed to Media General Inc., 333 E. Franklin

Important Tax Information

 



 

TO COMPLY WITH TREASURY DEPARTMENT CIRCULAR 230, YOU ARE HEREBY NOTIFIED THAT:
(A) ANY DISCUSSION OF FEDERAL TAX ISSUES IN THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL IS NOT
INTENDED OR WRITTEN TO BE USED, AND CANNOT BE USED BY YOU, FOR THE PURPOSE OF
AVOIDING PENALTIES THAT MAY BE IMPOSED ON YOU UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE
OF 1986, AS AMENDED (THE "CODE"); (B) ANY SUCH DISCUSSION IS INCLUDED HEREIN
IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROMOTION OR MARKETING OF THE TRANSACTIONS DESCRIBED
HEREIN; AND (C) YOU SHOULD SEEK ADVICE BASED ON YOUR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES
FROM AN INDEPENDENT TAX ADVISOR.

 



 

Under the U.S. federal income tax laws, General may be required to withhold
28% of the amount of any cash payments made to certain holders of Phoenix
Common Stock and holders of Warrants who surrender such stock or warrants with
respect to any cash received in lieu of fractional shares of General Common
Stock. In order to avoid such backup withholding, each equityholder that is a
United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes must provide General
with its correct taxpayer identification number (" _TIN_ ") by completing the
attached Form W-9. If General is not provided with the correct TIN, the
equityholder may be subject to a penalty imposed by the Internal Revenue
Service (" _IRS_ ") and cash payments in lieu of fractional shares may be
subject to backup withholding. Any amounts withheld from payments to a holder
under the backup withholding rules are not additional tax and will be allowed
as a refund or credit against the holder's U.S. federal income tax liability,
provided the required information is furnished to the IRS. For further
information concerning backup withholding and instructions for completing the
Form W−9 (including how to obtain a TIN if you do not have one), consult the
attached Form W−9\.

 



 

An equityholder that is not a United States person for U.S. federal income tax
purposes must submit the appropriate completed Form W-8 (available at
www.irs.gov) to avoid backup withholding.

 



 

Failure to complete and return the Form W-9 or an applicable Form W-8 may
require General to withhold 28% of the amount of any cash payment made to you
in lieu of a fractional share of General Common Stock.

ARTICLES OF AMENDMENT

 

OF THE

 

ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION

 

OF

 

MEDIA GENERAL, INC.

 



 

I.

 



 

The name of the corporation is Media General, Inc. (the " _Corporation_ ").

 



 

II.

 



 

Article II of the Corporation's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation
(the " _Articles_ ") is hereby amended as follows (collectively, the "
_Amendment_ "):

 



 

A. Section B(2)(b) of Article II of the Articles is hereby amended by
inserting the following at the end thereof:

 



 

"For the avoidance of doubt, the holders of the Class A Common Stock shall not
have any voting power with respect to the authorization of any plan of merger
(including any amendment to these Articles included in any such plan of
merger), share exchange or entity conversion or the authorization of any
disposition of assets or dissolution and shall not have the right to
participate in any meeting of stockholders held for any such purpose."

 



 

B. Section B(2) of Article II of the Articles is hereby further amended by
inserting the following at the end thereof as a new Section B(2)(d):

 



 

"(d) Pursuant to Section 13.1-638E of the Virginia Stock Corporation Act, the
Corporation may restrict the ownership, conversion, or proposed ownership, of
shares of the Corporation by any person if such ownership, conversion or
proposed ownership, either alone or in combination with other actual or
proposed ownership (including due to conversion) of shares of capital stock of
any other person, would give rise to an FCC Regulatory Limitation (as
hereinafter defined). Ownership, conversion, or proposed ownership shall be
deemed to give rise to an "FCC Regulatory Limitation" if it (1) is
inconsistent with, or in violation of, any provision of the Federal
Communications Laws (as hereinafter defined), (2) materially limits or
materially impairs any existing business activity of the Corporation or any of
its subsidiaries under the Federal Communications Laws, (3) materially limits
or materially impairs under the Federal Communications Laws the acquisition of
an attributable interest in a full-power television station or a full-power
radio station by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries for which the
Corporation or its subsidiary is considering entering into a definitive
agreement with a third party, (4) subjects or could reasonably be expected to
subject the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries to any rule, regulation,
order or policy under the Federal Communications Laws having or which could
reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the Corporation or any
subsidiary of the Corporation to which the Corporation or any subsidiary of
the Corporation would not be subject but for such ownership, conversion or
proposed ownership, (5) it would, in the judgment of the Corporation, delay or
impair the ability of the Corporation to obtain approval or consent of the FCC
in connection with a proposed business combination transaction or (6) requires
the prior approval from the Federal Communications Commission or any successor
governmental agency (the "FCC") for a change of control and such approval has
not been obtained. The term "Federal Communications Laws" shall mean any law
administered or enforced by the FCC, including, without limitation, the
Communications Act of 1934, as amended , and the rules, regulations, orders
and policies of the FCC. The Corporation may, but is not required to, take any
action permitted under this Section B(2)(d) of Article II; and the grant of
specific powers to the Corporation under this Section B(2)(d) of Article II
shall not be deemed to restrict the Corporation from pursuing, alternatively
or concurrently, any other remedy or alternative course of action available to
the Corporation. In furtherance of the foregoing, if in connection with any
proposed plan of merger, share exchange or entity conversion, any holder of
shares of the Corporation would be entitled to receive, or would beneficially
own, voting stock of the Corporation or any other surviving corporation that
would be deemed to give rise to an FCC Regulatory Limitation, then the
Corporation shall have the right to provide in such plan of merger, share
exchange or entity conversion that such holder shall instead receive non-
voting stock of the Corporation or surviving corporation to the extent
necessary to ensure that the transaction will not be deemed to give rise to an
FCC Regulatory Limitation; _provided that_ the shares of non-voting stock
received by such holder, as determined by the Board of Directors in good
faith, shall have all of the same preferences, limitations and relative rights
as the voting stock of the Corporation or such surviving corporation other
than voting rights."

 



 

 



   



 

III.

 



 

The foregoing amendment was duly approved and adopted on June 5, 2013 by the
Board of Directors of the Corporation at a duly called meeting of such Board
at which a quorum was present and acting throughout. The Board of Directors of
the Corporation submitted the amendment to the shareholders of the Corporation
for their approval at a special meeting of shareholders pursuant to Section
13.1-655 of the Virginia Stock Corporation Act. The designation, number of
outstanding shares and number of votes entitled to be cast by each voting
group entitled to vote separately on the amendment were as follows:
