restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Co., all as
provided under this Agreement and the DGCL.

$0.00000001 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock") held by the
Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent or any subsidiary of Parent
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired, and
no payment shall be made with respect thereto;



(ii) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Co. (the
"Merger Co. Common Stock") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become one share of common stock, par value
$0.00000001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation (the "Surviving
Corporation Common Stock"), with the same rights, powers and privileges as the
shares so converted;



(iii) each Common Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.02(a) and Section
2.02(b), be converted into the right to receive from Parent a number of fully
paid and nonassessable shares (each, a "Parent Common Share") of the common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent (the "Parent Common Stock") equal
to the Per Share Ratio (the "Common Exchange Ratio") (together with any cash
paid in respect of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.02(c), the "Common

(iv) each share (each a "Series A Preferred Share" and, together with the

share, of the Company (the "Series A Preferred Stock") outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, except as otherwise provided in

the Liquidation Per Share Ratio _plus_ (B) (x) the Per Share Ratio
_multiplied_ by (y) the number of Common Shares into which such Series A
Preferred Share is convertible as of the Effective Time (the "Series A
Preferred Exchange Ratio") (together with any cash paid in respect of

or consented thereto in writing, (ii) who shall have properly demanded in
writing appraisal of such Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects
with, Section 262 of the DGCL ("Section 262") and (iii) who has neither
effectively withdrawn nor lost the right to such payment (each such share, a
"Dissenting Share" and collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be
converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration as provided in
Section 2.02(a), but rather the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled
to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with
Section 262; provided, however, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect
or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under
Section 262 then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such
holders Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted as of the  



 

15  Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to

Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the

such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.



(c) No certificates or scrip representing less than one Parent Common Share

a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Shares (the "Certificates"). In lieu of any such fractional Parent
Common Share, each holder of Shares who would otherwise have been entitled to
a fraction of a Parent Common Share upon surrender of Certificates for
exchange shall be paid upon such surrender (and after taking into account all
Certificates surrendered by such holder) cash (without interest) in an amount

Amount. The Surviving Corporation shall send, or shall cause the Exchange
Agent to send, to each holder of Shares (i) a letter of transmittal for use in

representing Shares to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions to effect the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

the Merger Consideration, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a
Certificate or Certificates representing such Shares, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal covering such Shares, shall be entitled to

deposit into the Escrow Fund in accordance with this Section 2.03(b) and
Section 10.05(a) of the number of Parent Common Shares representing the
portion of the Escrow Amount allocable to such holder). The holder of such
Certificate, upon its exchange for Parent Common Shares, shall also receive
any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to Section 2.03(c). Certificates surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled
following the Effective Time. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate,
following the Effective Time, shall represent for all purposes only the right
to receive such Merger Consideration. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, and subject to and in accordance with the provisions of
Section 10.05(a), Parent, on behalf of the Stockholders, shall cause to be
delivered to the Escrow Agent Certificates representing 3,356,606 of the
Parent Common Shares that constitute the Merger Consideration (the "Escrow
Amount") allocated among the Stockholders on a pro rata basis determined in
accordance with each Stockholders ownership of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time on an  



 

16  as converted basis and without regard to the liquidation preference
attributable to any shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by any such
Stockholder, which Certificates shall be registered in the name of the Escrow
Agent as nominee for the holders of Certificates canceled pursuant to this
Section 2.03(b). Such Parent Common Shares shall be beneficially owned by such
holders, shall be held in escrow by the Escrow Agent and shall be applied
solely to satisfy indemnification claims under Section 10.01(a) of this
Agreement, all as provided in the Escrow Agreement. To the extent not applied
for such purpose, such Parent Common Shares shall be released from the Escrow
Fund, as and when provided in the Escrow Agreement.



(c) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective
Time with respect to Parent Common Shares with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
with respect to the Parent Common Shares such holder is entitled to receive
until the holder of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.03. Subject to applicable
law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the
record holder of the Certificates representing whole Parent Common Shares
issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole Parent Common
Shares.



(d) If any Certificate for Parent Common Shares is to be issued in a name
other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor
is registered, it shall be a condition to the issuance therefor that the
Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
exchange shall have paid to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes
required as a result of the issuance of a Certificate for Parent Common Shares
in any name other than that of the registered holder of such Shares, or
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been
paid or is not payable. For purposes of this Agreement, "Person" means a
natural person, a corporation, a limited liability company, a partnership, an
association, a trust or any other entity or organization, including a
government or political subdivision or any agency or instrumentality thereof.



(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, such Certificates shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance
with the procedures set forth, in this Article 2.



(f) None of Parent, Merger Co., any Principal Stockholder or the Company or
any of their respective Affiliates shall be liable to any holder of Shares
for any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.



(g) The Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to the Agreement to any holder
of Shares, and from any cash dividends or other distributions that the holder
is entitled to receive under Section 2.03(c), such amounts as the Exchange
Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (together with
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Code"), or any
provision of state, local or non-United States tax law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent, such portion of the Merger
Consideration and other such amounts payable under Section 2.03(c) that are
withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
received by the holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Exchange Agent.



 

17 (h) Any portion of the Certificates evidencing the Parent Common Shares, of
the cash to be paid in respect of fractional Parent Common Shares, of the
cash or other property in respect of dividends or other distributions supplied
to the Exchange Agent or of the cash portion of the Merger Consideration, if
any, which remains unclaimed by the Stockholders six months after the
Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder
who has not exchanged his Shares for the Merger Consideration in accordance
with this Section 2.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration and any dividends or
distributions with respect to Parent Common Shares.



Section 2.04. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, such Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions as
may be required pursuant to this Article 2; provided, however, that Parent
may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof,
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a
bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against Parent or the Exchange Agent with respect to the
Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.



Section 2.05. _Stock Options and Warrants; Stock Restriction Agreements_.



(b) Following the Effective Time, each option to purchase Parent
Common Shares (a "Parent Stock Option") outstanding as of the Effective Time
shall continue in effect in accordance with the terms and conditions of each
such Parent Stock Option. At the Effective Time, each stock option and warrant
to purchase Shares or any other capital stock of the Company or any
Subsidiary outstanding, whether or not vested or exercisable, and each other
commitment or agreement to issue Shares or any other capital stock of the
Company or any Subsidiary, including without limitation, all such stock
options, warrants and commitments or agreements to issue Shares or any other
capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary set forth in Sections 4.05 and
4.06 of the written disclosure schedule previously delivered by the Company
to Parent (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"), shall be cancelled without the
payment of any consideration, and the Company and the Subsidiaries shall
obtain all consents and approvals necessary to effect such cancellation.



(c) At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume the Stock Restriction
Agreements, and the Parent Common Shares issued in the Merger in exchange for
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding under the Stock Restriction
Agreements and unvested at the Effective Time shall vest thereafter
according to the applicable vesting schedule set forth in, and shall
otherwise to be subject to the terms and conditions of, the Stock Restriction
Agreements.



Section 2.06. _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time, the outstanding Parent Common Shares shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or different class by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split up, combination,
exchange of shares or similar event or a stock dividend or dividend on the
Parent Common Shares payable in any securities shall be declared with a
record date within such period, the Per Share Ratio shall be appropriately
adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock and the holders of
Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable, with the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES THE COMPANY



The Company represents and warrants to Parent as follows:



Section 4.01. _Corporate Existence and Power_. The Company is a corporation
duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware, and has all corporate power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now
conducted. The Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character
of the property owned or leased by it or the nature of its activities makes
such qualification necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the
failure to be so qualified, individually or in the aggregate, has not and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has heretofore delivered to Parent or the Parent Representatives true
and complete copies of the Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws
as currently in effect. Such certificate of incorporation and bylaws are in
full force and effect and no other organizational documents are applicable to
or binding upon the Company.



Section 4.02. _Corporate Authorization_.



(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement, and, subject to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and performance by
the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby are within the Companys powers and have been
duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action under the
Companys constituent documents and applicable provisions of Delaware Law
(other than obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and the filing with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware of the  



 

19  certificate of merger as required by Delaware Law). This Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming
this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of the other
parties hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of the
Company enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforcement is limited by bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and for limitations
imposed by general principles of equity.



(b) The Board of Directors of the Company, at a meeting duly called and held,
duly adopted resolutions (i) approving and adopting this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions expressly contemplated hereby and requiring
the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company, (ii) determining that
the terms of the Merger are fair and in the best interests of the Company and
its stockholders and that the other transactions expressly contemplated hereby
and requiring the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company are in the
best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (iii) recommending that
the Companys stockholders adopt this Agreement and (iv) declaring that this
Agreement is advisable.



(c) The only vote of holders of any class or series of Company Common Stock
and Company Preferred Stock necessary to approve and adopt this Agreement
and the Merger (the "Company Stockholder Approval") is the adoption of this
Agreement by (i) the holders of a majority of the outstanding Company Common
Stock and Series A Preferred Stock voting together as a single class, with the
Series A Preferred Stock voting on an as-converted basis, and (ii) the
holders of at least 75% of the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock voting on
an as-converted basis. The Company Stockholder Approval may be obtained by the
written consent of the Companys stockholders listed on Section 4.02(c) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule under the Companys certificate of
incorporation and bylaws and the DGCL. The affirmative vote of the holders of
the Company Common Stock and the Company Preferred Stock, or any of them, is
not necessary to consummate any transaction expressly contemplated hereby
other than the Merger. Promptly (but in no event more than one Business Day)
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement and receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval, the Company shall deliver to Parent a
certificate of the Secretary of the Company certifying that the Company
Stockholder Approval has been obtained by the written consent of the
Companys stockholders.



Section 4.03. _Governmental Authorization_. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, do not
and shall not require any action by or in respect of, consent or approval of,
or filing with, any governmental body, agency, official or authority by or on
behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary other than (a) the filing of the
certificate of merger in accordance with Delaware Law; (b) compliance with
any applicable requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements
Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"); (c) as set forth in Section 4.03 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule; (d) as may be necessary as a result of any
facts or circumstances relating solely to Parent, Merger Co. or the other
Parent Subsidiaries; and (e) other actions, consents, approvals, filings and
notifications, the failure of which to make or obtain would not reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay the Company or any Principal
Stockholder from performing its obligations under this Agreement or prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the Transactions.



Section 4.04. _Non-contravention_. Except as set forth in Section 4.04 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby,  



 

20  including the Merger, do not and shall not (a) contravene or conflict with
the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or the
equivalent organizational documents of any Subsidiary, (b) assuming
compliance with the matters referred to in Section 4.03, contravene or

upon the Company or any Subsidiary or any of their respective properties or
assets or any license, franchise, permit or other similar authorization held

of any Lien on any property or asset of the Company or any Subsidiary, except
in the case of clauses (b), (c) and (d) immediately above for any such
violation, failure to obtain any such consent or other action, default, right,
loss or Lien that, individually or in the aggregate, does not or would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this

lien, pledge, charge, security interest or encumbrance of any kind in respect
of such property or asset.

Section 8.01. _Government and Other Consents and Approvals; Company
Stockholder Approval_.



(a) The Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other (i) in determining
whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body,
agency or official, or authority is required, or any actions, consents,
approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any material
contracts, in connection with or as a result of the consummation of the
Transactions and (ii) in seeking any such actions, consents, approvals or
waivers or making any such filings, furnishing information required in
connection therewith and seeking timely to obtain any such actions, consents,
approvals or waivers.



(b) On or before 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the second Business Day after the
date of execution of this Agreement, the Company shall seek the
Company Stockholder Approval. By executing this Agreement, the parties do not
intend that this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute (i) approval and
adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by the Principal Stockholders under
the DGCL by written consent of the Companys stockholders in lieu of a
meeting or (ii) an agreement by the Principal Stockholders to vote for, or
consent in respect of approval and adoption, of this  



 

58  Agreement and the Merger. In connection with the Company Stockholder
Approval, the Company shall comply with all disclosure and other obligations
to its stockholders under the DGCL and any other applicable laws. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that its
obligations in this Section 8.01(b) shall not be affected by the commencement,
public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any
Acquisition Proposal. Unless Parent and the Company otherwise agree in
writing, the Company shall send to any stockholder of the Company who did not

Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL (the "Appraisal Notice") within 30 days after
the date of the Company Stockholder Approval and (ii) the notice of the
Company Stockholder Approval contemplated in Section 228(e) of the DGCL

Section 8.02.  _Preparation of the Parent Registration Statement; Parent
Stockholders Meeting_.



(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the Parent Registration Statement,
in which the Parent Proxy Statement shall be included as a prospectus. Each
of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the
Parent Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing, and Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Parent Proxy Statement to be mailed
to Parents stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Parent Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act.
The Company shall furnish all information concerning the Company and the
holders of Company Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock as may be
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with any such action. No filing
of, or amendment or supplement to, the Parent Registration Statement or the
Parent Proxy Statement shall be made by Parent without providing the Company
the opportunity to review and comment thereon. Parent shall advise the
Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the
Parent Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or
amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of
the qualification of the Parent Common Shares issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC
for amendment of the Parent Proxy Statement or the Parent Registration
Statement. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating
to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or
directors, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Parent Registration Statement or
the Parent Proxy Statement, so that such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other such party hereto of such information and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated
to the stockholders of the Company and Parent.



(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Parent Registration
Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act, Parent shall duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the
"Parent Stockholders Meeting") in accordance with the DGCL for  



 

59  the purpose of obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval and shall, through
its Board of Directors, recommend to its stockholders the approval of the
Parent Stockholder Proposals. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein
shall limit a partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
11.01.



(c) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause Edwards and
Angell, LLP, counsel to the Company, and Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause Hogan and Hartson L.L.P., counsel to Parent, to deliver a
tax opinion for inclusion in the Parent Registration Statement in the form
required by the SEC. In rendering such opinions, Edwards and Angell, LLP and
Hogan and Hartson L.L.P. may require delivery of and rely upon representation

Agreement; and provided further that no investigation pursuant to this Section
8.03(a) or otherwise in connection with this Agreement and the other
Transaction Agreements shall affect any representation or warranty given by
the Company or any Principal Stockholder hereunder. Any investigation pursuant
to this Section 8.03(a) shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Company and the
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not have access to
personnel records of the Company and the Subsidiaries relating to individual
performance or evaluation records, medical histories or other information
which in the Companys good faith opinion is sensitive or the disclosure of
which could subject the Company or any Subsidiary to risk of liability. From
the date hereof until the Closing, the Company shall furnish, and shall cause
each Subsidiary to furnish, to Parent copies of any notices, documents,
requests, court papers or other materials received from any governmental
agency or third party with respect to the Transactions.

and the Company Representatives such financial and operating data and other

Company Representatives pursuant to this Section 8.03(b) shall be subject to
the Confidentiality Agreement; and provided further that no investigation
pursuant to this Section 8.03(b) or otherwise in connection with this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements shall affect any representation
or warranty given by Parent hereunder. Any investigation pursuant to this
Section 8.03(b) shall be conducted in such manner as not to  



 

60  interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of Parent and the
Parent Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not
have access to personnel records of the Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries
relating to individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories or
other information which in the Parents good faith opinion is sensitive or the
disclosure of which could subject Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to risk of
liability. From the date hereof until the Closing, Parent shall furnish to the
Company copies of any notices, documents, requests, court papers or other
materials received from any governmental agency or third party with respect
to the Transactions.



Section 8.04. _No Solicitation_.



(a) Neither the Company nor any Principal Stockholder shall, nor shall the
Company or any Principal Stockholder authorize or permit any of its Affiliates
or any officer, director, employee, investment banker, attorney or other
adviser or representative of the Company or any Principal Stockholder or any
of their respective Affiliates to, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into any agreement with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or (iii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with the intent of
facilitating the making of, or take any other action to facilitate any
inquiries or the making of, any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably
be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, other than the transactions
contemplated hereby. Without limiting the foregoing, any violation of the
restrictions set forth in the immediately preceding sentence by any
officer, director, employee, investment banker, attorney or other advisor or
representative of (A) the Company, (B) any Principal Stockholder or (C) any of
their respective Affiliates, whether or not such Person is purporting to act
on behalf of the Company, any Principal Stockholder or any of their
respective Affiliates or otherwise, shall be deemed to constitute a willful
breach of this Section 8.04 by the Company for purposes of this Agreement.
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Company and each
Principal Stockholder shall, and each shall cause its Affiliates to,
immediately cease any activities, discussions or negotiations existing as of
the date of this Agreement with any Persons (other than Parent and
its representatives) conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, and shall not pursue, directly or indirectly, an Acquisition
Proposal received on or prior to the date of this Agreement from any Person
(other than Parent and its representatives). The Company shall not release
any third party from, or waive any provisions of, any confidentiality or
standstill agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal to which such party
is a party. For purposes of this Section 8.04, the term "Person" means any
person, corporation, entity or "group," as defined in Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act, other than Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, and the term
"Acquisition Proposal" means (1) any proposal for a merger or other business
combination involving the Company or any Subsidiary or (2) any proposal or
offer to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the
equity securities or any class of the equity securities of the Company or 20%
or more of the assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries taken as a whole,
other than the Merger contemplated by this Agreement.



(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prevent the Company or its Board of Directors or any Principal Stockholder
or any officer, director, employee, investment banker, attorney or other
adviser or representative of the Company, acting at the direction of and on
behalf of the Company, at any time prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the
date of the Company Stockholder Approval from (i) providing information in
response to a request therefor by a Person who has delivered to the Company an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if the Company receives
from the Person so requesting such information an executed confidentiality
agreement the terms of which are (without regard to the terms of the
Acquisition  



 

61  Proposal) (A) no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement and (B) no less restrictive on the Person
requesting such information than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement; or (ii) engaging in negotiations or discussions with a Person who
has delivered to the Company an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal; if, and only to the extent that, in each such case referred to in
clause (i) or (ii) immediately above, prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the
date of the Company Stockholder Approval, (1) the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) that the Acquisition Proposal, if accepted,
is reasonably likely to be consummated, (2) the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor) that the Acquisition Proposal would, if consummated,
result in a transaction that is more favorable to the Companys stockholders
than the Merger from a financial point of view (any Acquisition Proposal as to
which such determination in clauses (1) and (2) immediately above is made
being referred to in this Agreement as a "Superior Proposal") and (3) the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation
with outside legal counsel) that such action is required by the fiduciary
duties of the Board of Directors to the Companys stockholders under
applicable law.



(c) Nothing in this Section 8.04 shall permit the Company to enter into any
agreement, orally or in writing, with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal during the term of this Agreement (other than a confidentiality
agreement as described above). The Company promptly shall advise Parent of any
Acquisition Proposal (including the terms thereof and the identity of the
person making the Acquisition Proposal) and inquiries with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and shall keep Parent informed on a current basis of the
status of any discussions regarding an Acquisition Proposal. Nothing herein
shall prevent the Board of Directors of the Company from complying with Rule
14e-2 under the Exchange Act.

(i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions;

(iv) any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the
part of Parent or Merger Co. contained in this Agreement if any such breach

Section 8.06. _Affiliate Transactions_. Immediately prior to the Closing, the
Company and (with respect to the Contracts referred to in clause
(a) immediately below) each Principal Stockholder agree that, other than the
Contracts listed in Section 8.06 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, all

terminated or settled (without any post-Closing payments by Parent, any Parent
Subsidiary, the Company or any Subsidiary or resulting obligations or
liabilities of Parent, any Parent Subsidiary, the Company or any Subsidiary),
as the case may be, and be of no further force or effect, notwithstanding any
terms thereof to the contrary.



Section 8.07. _Affiliate Letters_. The Company has disclosed in Section 8.07
of the Company Disclosure Schedule all Persons who are, or may be, as of the
date hereof, its "affiliates" as that term is used in Rule 145 of the rules
and regulations of the SEC under the Securities Act. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause each Person who is identified as
an "affiliate" in Section 8.07 of the Company Disclosure Schedule to deliver
to Parent as promptly as practicable, but in no event more than 30 days prior
to the Closing Date, a signed agreement substantially in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit G. Parent shall place the applicable Rule 145 legend on

limiting the foregoing, each of Parent and the Company and the Board
of Directors of each of Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable
best efforts to (x) take all action necessary so that no state takeover
statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the
Merger or any of the other Transactions and (y) if any state takeover statute
or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to any of the foregoing,
take all action necessary so that the Merger and the other Transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements and otherwise to minimize the
effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger and the other Transactions.
In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, if required by the HSR
Act or other Regulatory Law, Parent, each Principal Stockholder and the
Company each shall make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report
Form pursuant to the HSR Act and any other application or notice required

any Parent Subsidiary or the Company or any Subsidiary to sell, hold separate
or otherwise dispose of or conduct their business in a specified manner, or
agree to sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct their business
in a specified manner, or permit the sale, holding separate or other
disposition of any assets of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries or the
Company and the Subsidiaries or the conduct of their business in a specified
manner, whether as a condition to obtaining any approval from a governmental
entity or any other Person or for any other reason. Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Amendment to Parent Credit Facilities
and the Amendment to Parent Capital Leases to remain in full force and effect
from and after the date hereof through the Closing Date.



(b) Each of Parent, the Company and any Principal Stockholder required to make
any filing, application or notice referred to in the penultimate sentence of
Section 8.08(a) each shall, in connection with the efforts referred to in
Section 8.08(a) to obtain all requisite material approvals and authorizations
for the Transactions under the HSR Act or any other Regulatory Law, use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in
connection with any filing or submission in connection with any investigation
or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party,
(ii) promptly inform the other parties of any material communication received
by such party from, or given by such party to, the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice (the "DOJ"), the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC")
or any other governmental entity and of any material communication received
or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case
regarding any of the Transactions, and (iii) permit the other parties to
review any communication given by it to, and consult with each other in
advance of any meeting or conference with, the DOJ, the FTC or any such other
governmental entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party,
with any other Person, and to the extent permitted by the DOJ, the FTC or
such other applicable governmental entity or other Person, give the other
party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences. For purposes of this Agreement, "Regulatory Law" means the
Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal
 



 

64  Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all other federal, state and foreign,
if any, statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative
and judicial doctrines and other laws that are designed or intended to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition.



(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in furtherance
and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in Sections
8.08(a) and 8.08(b), if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding,
including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to
be instituted) challenging any Transaction as violative of any Regulatory
Law, Parent and the Company each shall cooperate in all respects with each
other and use its reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such
action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Section 8.08 shall limit a
partys rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.01.



 

(d) If any objections are asserted with respect to the Transactions under any
Regulatory Law or if any suit is instituted by any governmental entity or any
private party challenging any of the Transactions as violative of any
Regulatory Law, Parent and the Company each shall use its reasonable best
efforts to resolve any such objections or challenge as such governmental
entity or private party may have to such Transactions under such Regulatory
Law so as to permit consummation of the Transactions.



(e) Nothing in this Section 8.08 shall require Parent or any Parent Subsidiary
to agree to any material modification of any material provision of the Parent
Credit Agreement or any security agreement related to the Parent Credit
Agreement.

Transactions without the prior written consent of (a) Parent, if such press
release, public statement or announcement is made by any Principal Stockholder
or the Company, and (b) the Company, if such press release, public statement
or announcement is made by Parent; provided, however, that each party hereto
may make any press release, public statement or public announcement which such
party determines, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, is
required by applicable law or any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange or Nasdaq, in which case the party desiring to make such
disclosure or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult
with the other parties hereto as provided in clauses (a) and (b) immediately
above prior to making such disclosure or announcement.

Companys officers and directors liability insurance policy on terms with
respect to coverage and in such amount that are no less favorable than those
of such policy in effect on the date hereof.



Section 8.15. _Employee Benefits_.



(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, Parent shall
arrange for, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to arrange
for, employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries as of the Closing who
continue employment with Parent or any Parent Subsidiary (including the
Surviving Corporation and any subsidiary thereof) (the "Continuing Employees")
to participate in the employee benefit plans of Parent on terms no less
favorable than those offered to similarly situated employees of Parent, and
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that Continuing
Employees who are actually employed (or on approved absence or leave) and
currently working for the Company or any Subsidiary at the Effective Time do
not have a lapse of coverage in the transition from a Company Plan to any
corresponding employee benefit plans of Parent. For purposes of any length of
service requirements, waiting periods, vesting periods or differential
benefits based on length of service under any such employee benefit plan of
Parent for which a Continuing Employee may be eligible after the Closing Date,
Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that service
by such Continuing Employee with the Company or any Subsidiary shall be deemed
to have been service with Parent. Nothing in this Section 8.15 shall limit the
right of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Parent Subsidiary to
terminate the employment of any employee of the Company or any Subsidiary
(including any Continuing Employees) at any time.



 

66 (b) As soon as practicable prior to the Closing Date, but in no event less

Following the Closing Date, Parent and Merger Co. shall take all steps
necessary to obtain a favorable determination letter with respect to the

documents executed or to be executed in order to consummate the Transactions.
No Principal Stockholder shall be entitled to contribution from, subrogation
to or recovery against the Company or the Surviving Corporation with respect
to any liability of any Principal Stockholder that may arise under or
pursuant to this Agreement, any other Transaction Agreement or any other
agreements or documents executed or to be executed by the parties hereto in

(collectively, the "Releasing Parties") release, as of the Effective Time, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation and their respective officers, directors
and employees (the "Released Parties") from any and all claims, liabilities
and causes of action arising out of the investment by the Releasing Parties in
the Company or any actions or omissions to act by the Released Parties in
connection with the ownership or operation of the Companys business. 



Section 8.19. _Consent of Principal Stockholders_. Each of the Principal
Stockholders hereby consents to (and waives any right to notice or approval

as the Stockholders who hold at least a majority of the Stockholders
interest in the Escrow Fund may appoint from time to time to replace MC
Venture Partners V, L.P., being referred to herein as the "Stockholders
Representative"). The Stockholders Representative shall have full power and
authority to represent all of the Stockholders and their successors with
respect to all matters arising under this Agreement, all actions taken by the
Stockholders Representative hereunder and thereunder shall be binding upon
all of the Stockholders and their successors as if expressly confirmed and

Stockholders Representative harmless from, any loss, liability or expense
incurred by the Stockholders Representative, with respect to any action taken
or omitted to be taken by the Stockholders Representative in his role as
Stockholders Representative under or in connection with this Agreement (all
of which actions and omissions shall be legally binding upon each
Stockholder), unless such action or omission constitutes fraud, gross
negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on the part of the Stockholders
Representative. Parent, Merger Co. and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to rely on such appointment and treat such Stockholders
Representative as the duly appointed attorney-in-fact of each Stockholder for
all purposes of this Agreement. Each Stockholder who executes this Agreement,
by such execution and without any further action, confirms such appointment
and authority. All fees and expenses of the Stockholders Representative shall
be paid by the Principal Stockholders.



Section 8.21. _Section 16_. Assuming that the Company delivers to Parent the
Section 16 Information in a timely fashion, the Board of Directors of Parent,
or a committee of two or more Non-Employee Directors (as such term is defined
for purposes of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act) of the Board of Directors
of Parent, shall adopt resolutions prior to the consummation of the Merger
providing that the receipt by the Company Insiders of Parent Common Shares in
exchange for capital stock of the Company pursuant to the transactions
contemplated hereby, and to the extent such securities are listed in the
Section 16 Information, are intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to
Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act. Such resolutions shall comply with the
conditions of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act for purposes of establishing
such exemption from Section 16(b) liability and, in accordance with such
conditions, shall specify, without limitation, the  



 

68  name of the Company Insiders, the numbers of securities to be acquired or
disposed of for each Company Insider, the material terms of any
derivative securities, and that the approval evidenced by such resolutions is

number of shares of capital stock of the Company held by each such Company
Insider expected to be exchanged for Parent Common Shares in the Merger. The
term "Company Insiders" means those officers and directors of the Company
whom Parent notifies the Company prior to the Merger will be subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16 of the Exchange Act with respect to
Parent and who are listed in the Section 16 Information. 



Section 8.22. _Updated Disclosure Schedules_.

 



(a) Prior to the Closing Date as hereinafter provided, the Company

the corresponding Sections of this Agreement (such Sections of the Company
Disclosure Schedule as supplemented in accordance with this Section 8.22(a),
the "Company Updated Disclosure Schedule") with respect to matters arising
after the date of this Agreement and not in violation of any covenant or
other provision of this Agreement (including, without limitation, any covenant
set forth in Article 7 or Article 8), which matters, if existing as of the
date of this Agreement, should have been set forth in such section of the
Company Disclosure Schedule. After the Company shall have furnished the
Updated Company Disclosure Schedule to Parent, (i) the Updated Company
Disclosure Schedule shall become part of this Agreement and (ii) the
representations and warranties set forth in Article 4 made by the Company as
of the date hereof, (A) together with the Company Disclosure Schedule as
delivered on the date hereof, shall continue to remain part of this Agreement
as if the Updated Company Disclosure Schedule had not become part of this
Agreement and (B) together with the Updated Company Disclosure Schedule, shall
thereupon also be deemed to be made as of the Closing Date. For the avoidance
of doubt: (a) the Updated Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to
have made, and shall not make, (i) true and correct any representation or
warranty set forth in Article 4 made by the Company as of the date hereof that
is qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect or (ii) true in all
material respects any representation or warranty set forth in Article 4 made
by the Company as of the date hereof that is not qualified by materiality or
Material Adverse Effect; and (b) the Company shall not be entitled to include
on any Section of the Updated Company Disclosure Schedule any matters arising
after the date of this Agreement necessary to make the representations and
warranties set forth in Article 4 made by the Company as of the date hereof
true and correct (with respect to any representation or warranty that is
qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect) or in all material
respects (with respect to any representation or warranty that is not qualified
by materiality or Material Adverse Effect) as of the Closing Date if such
matters violated or conflicted with any covenant or other provision of this
Agreement (including, without limitation, any covenant set forth in Article 7
or Article 8) in any respect. The Company shall furnish to Parent a draft of
the Updated Company Disclosure Schedule on the third Business Day prior to
the Closing Date and shall supplement such draft as appropriate up to the
Effective Time. Such draft, as so supplemented, shall constitute the Updated
Company Disclosure Schedule; provided that, if the Company shall supplement
such draft in any material respect, Parent shall have the right, upon written
notice to the Company, to defer the Closing Date by a period not to exceed
five Business Days in order to review the Updated Company Disclosure
Schedule, as so supplemented.



 

69 (b) Prior to the Closing Date as hereinafter provided, Parent may supplement
Sections 5.08, 5.09, 5.10, 5.11, 5.12, 5.13, 5.14, 5.15, 5.16 and 5.18 of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule with respect to representations and warranties made
by Parent as of the date hereof in the corresponding Sections of this

Schedule") with respect to matters arising after the date of this Agreement
and not in violation of any covenant or other provision of this Agreement
(including, without limitation, any covenant set forth in Article 7 or Article
8), which matters, if existing as of the date of this Agreement, should have
been set forth in such section of the Parent Disclosure Schedule. After
Parent shall have furnished the Updated Parent Disclosure Schedule to the
Company, (i) the Updated Parent Disclosure Schedule shall become part of this
Agreement and (ii) the representations and warranties set forth in Article 5
made by Parent as of the date hereof, (A) together with the Parent Disclosure
Schedule as delivered on the date hereof, shall continue to remain part of
this Agreement as if the Updated Parent Disclosure Schedule had not become
part of this Agreement and (B) together with the Updated Parent Disclosure
Schedule, shall thereupon also be deemed to be made as of the Closing Date.
For the avoidance of doubt: (a) the Updated Parent Disclosure Schedule shall
not be deemed to have made, and shall not make, (i) true and correct any
representation or warranty set forth in Article 5 made by Parent as of the
date hereof that is qualified by materiality or Parent Material Adverse Effect
or (ii) true in all material respects any representation or warranty set forth
in Article 5 made by Parent as of the date hereof that is not qualified by
materiality or Parent Material Adverse Effect; and (b) Parent shall not be
entitled to include on any Section of the Updated Parent Disclosure Schedule
any matters arising after the date of this Agreement necessary to make the
representations and warranties set forth in Article 5 made by Parent as of the
date hereof true and correct in all respects (with respect to any
representation or warranty that is qualified by materiality or Parent
Material Adverse Effect) or in all material respects (with respect to any
representation or warranty that is not qualified by materiality or Parent
Material Adverse Effect) as of the Closing Date if such matters violated
or conflicted with any covenant or other provision of this Agreement
(including, without limitation, any covenant set forth in Article 7 or Article
8) in any respect. Parent shall furnish to the Company a draft of the Updated
Parent Disclosure Schedule on the third Business Day prior to the Closing
Date and shall supplement such draft as appropriate up to the Effective Time.
Such draft, as so supplemented, shall constitute the Updated Parent Disclosure
Schedule; provided that, if Parent shall supplement such draft in any
material respect, the Company shall have the right, upon written notice to
Parent, to defer the Closing Date by a period not to exceed five Business Days
in order to review the Updated Parent Disclosure Schedule, as
so supplemented.

ARTICLE 10



INDEMNIFICATION



Section 10.01. _General Indemnification_.



(a) Subject to Sections 10.02 and 10.03, from and after the Closing Date,
the Stockholders (other than those dissenting stockholders exercising rights
of appraisal under Section 262 who do not receive Parent Common Shares in the
Merger) hereby agree, severally and not jointly, to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Parent and its Affiliates (other than each Stockholder and their
respective Affiliates), and each of their respective directors, officers,
employees and agents (each, a "Parent Indemnified Party" and, collectively,
the "Parent Indemnified Parties"), from and against any and all losses,
expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses), damages, liabilities,
fines, penalties, judgments, actions, claims and costs (collectively,
"Losses") incurred or suffered by the Parent Indemnified Parties arising out
of, based upon or resulting from (i) any breach of any representation or
warranty contained in or referred to in  



 

74  Article 4 or Article 6 or in any schedule or exhibit or in the certificate
delivered by or on behalf of any Principal Stockholder or the Company pursuant
to Section 9.02(a), 9.02(c), 9.02(d) or 9.02(e) and (ii) any breach by any
Principal Stockholder or the Company of, or any failure of any Principal
Stockholder or the Company to perform, any of the covenants, agreements or
obligations contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement; provided that in
the case of any breach by any Principal Stockholder of any representation or
warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation of such Principal Stockholder
referred to in clause (i) or (ii) immediately above, only such breaching
Principal Stockholder shall be obligated to indemnify the Parent Indemnified
Parties for Losses resulting from such breach.



(b) Subject to Sections 10.02 and 10.03, from and after the Closing Date,
Parent hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Stockholders
and their Affiliates, and each of their respective directors, officers,
employees and agents (each, a "Company Indemnified Party" and, collectively,
the "Company Indemnified Parties"), from and against any and all Losses
incurred or suffered by the Company Indemnified Parties arising out of, based
upon or resulting from (i) any breach of any representation or warranty
contained in or referred to in Article 5 or in any schedule or exhibit or in
the certificate delivered by or on behalf of Parent pursuant to Section
9.03(a) and (ii) any breach by Parent of, or any failure of Parent or Merger
Co. to perform, any of the covenants, agreements or obligations contained in
or made pursuant to this Agreement.



(c) In the event that a Person entitled to indemnification under this
Article 10 (the "Indemnified Party") shall incur or suffer any Losses in
respect of which indemnification may be sought under this Article 10 against
the Person or, in the case of the Stockholders, Persons required to provide
indemnification under this Article 10 (collectively, the "Indemnifying
Party"), the Indemnified Party shall assert a claim for indemnification by
providing a written notice (the "Notice of Loss") to the Indemnifying Party
stating the nature and basis of such Notice of Loss. The Notice of Loss shall
be provided to the Indemnifying Party as soon as practicable after the
Indemnified Party becomes aware that it has incurred or suffered a Loss.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any failure to provide the Indemnifying Party
with a Notice of Loss, or any failure to provide a Notice of Loss in a timely
manner as aforesaid, shall not relieve any Indemnifying Party from any
liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party under this Section
10.01 except to the extent that the ability of such Indemnifying Party to
defend such claim is materially prejudiced by the Indemnified Partys failure
to give such Notice of Loss. If the Notice of Loss relates to a Third Party
Claim, the procedures set forth in Section 10.01(d) shall be applicable. If
the Notice of Loss does not relate to a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party shall have 30 days from the date of receipt of such Notice of Loss to
object to any of the subject matter and any of the amounts of the Losses set
forth in the Notice of Loss, as the case may be, by causing the Indemnifying
Party to deliver written notice of objection thereof to the Indemnified Party.
If the Indemnifying Party fails to send a notice of objection to the Notice
of Loss within such 30-day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to
have agreed to the Notice of Loss and shall be obligated to pay to the
Indemnified Party the portion of the amount specified in the Notice of
Loss to which the Indemnifying Party has not objected. If the Indemnifying
Party sends a timely notice of objection, the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to settle
(without an obligation to settle) such claim for indemnification. If the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party do not settle such dispute within
30 days after the Indemnified Partys receipt of the Indemnifying Partys
notice of objection, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to seek enforcement of their respective rights under this Article
10.



 

75 (d) Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Party of notice of the assertion
of any claim or the commencement of any action, suit or proceeding by a third
Person (a "Third Party Claim") in respect of which the Indemnified Party shall
seek indemnification hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall so notify in
writing the Indemnifying Party, but any failure so to notify the Indemnifying
Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability that it may
have to the Indemnified Party under this Section 10.01 except to the extent
that the ability of the Indemnifying Party to defend the Third Party Claim is
materially prejudiced by the Indemnified Partys failure to give such notice.
In no event shall the Indemnified Party admit any liability with respect to
such Third Party Claim or settle, compromise, pay or discharge such Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. With
respect to any such claim as to which the Indemnifying Party shall
have acknowledged in writing the obligation to indemnify the Indemnified
Party hereunder, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the
defense (at the expense of the Indemnifying Party) of any such claim through
counsel chosen by the Indemnifying Party by causing the Indemnifying Party to
notify the Indemnified Party within 30 days after the receipt by the
Indemnifying Party of such notice from the Indemnified Party; provided,
however, that any such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof
and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed
by the Indemnifying Party; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to employ counsel to represent it at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party if the Indemnified Party has been advised by its counsel
that there are one or more legal defenses available to it that are different
from or additional to those available to any Indemnifying Party or that there
is otherwise a potential conflict between the interests of the Indemnified
Party and any Indemnifying Party, in which event the reasonable fees and
expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party. The
Company and the Stockholders Representative each agree to render to the other
parties such assistance as may reasonably be requested in order to ensure the
proper and adequate defense of any such claim, which assistance shall include,
to the extent reasonably requested by a party, the retention, and the
provision to such party, of records and information reasonably relevant
to such Third Party Claim, and making employees of the other party available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any materials provided hereunder. The Indemnifying Party may
not settle or otherwise dispose of any Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed unless such settlement includes
only the payment of monetary damages (which are fully paid by the
Indemnifying Party), does not impose any injunctive or equitable relief upon
the Indemnified Party, does not require any admission or acknowledgment of
liability or fault of the Indemnified Party and contains an
unconditional release of the Indemnified Party in respect of such claim. None
of the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates may settle or otherwise
dispose of any Third Party Claim for which the Indemnifying Party may have a
liability under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.



(e) With respect to any claim as to which the Indemnifying Party shall have
acknowledged in writing the obligation of the Indemnifying Party to
indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder, after written notice by the
Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of the election by the
Indemnifying Party to assume control of the defense of any such Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party
hereunder for any costs or fees subsequently incurred by such Indemnified
Party in connection with the defense thereof, except if the Indemnified Party
has the right to employ counsel to represent it at the expense of the
Indemnifying  



 

76  Party as set forth in Section 10.01(d). If the Indemnifying Party does not
assume control of the defense of such Third Party Claim within 30 days after
the receipt by the Indemnifying Party of the notice required pursuant to
Section 10.01(d), the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend such
claim in such manner as it may deem appropriate at the reasonable cost and
expense of the Indemnifying Party.



Section 10.02. _Survival_. Subject to the following sentence, the rights of
the Parent Indemnified Parties to assert a claim under Section 10.01(a)(i),
and the rights of the Company Indemnified Persons to assert a claim under
Section 10.01(b)(i), shall survive the Closing Date for a period (the
"Survival Period") beginning at the Closing Date and ending on the later of
(a) March 15, 2006 and (b) the first anniversary of the Closing Date, and
thereafter shall terminate and expire, except with respect to liabilities for
any item as to which, prior to the expiration of the Survival Period, an
Indemnified Party shall have asserted a claim in writing as required pursuant
to the provisions of this Article 10, in which event the liability for such
claim shall continue until such claim shall have been finally settled,
decided or adjudicated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the right of the
Parent Indemnified Parties to assert a claim under Section 10.01(a)(i) for any
breach of any representation or warranty set forth in Section 4.01, 4.02,
4.05 or 4.11 and (b) the right of the Company Indemnified Parties to assert a
claim under Section 10.01(b)(i) for any breach of any representation or
warranty set forth in Section 5.01, 5.02, 5.05 or 5.11 shall survive
the Closing Date and continue in effect until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations for any claims relating thereto.



Section 10.03. _Limitation on Liability_



(a) Subject to Section 10.03(e), the Stockholders shall not have any liability
pursuant to Section 10.01(a) for any Loss unless and until the
aggregate amount of all such Losses shall exceed $2,000,000 (the "Deductible
Amount"), in which event the Stockholders shall be liable for indemnification
pursuant to Section 10.01(a) for the aggregate amount of all such Losses in
excess of the Deductible Amount up to the maximum amount set forth in Section
10.03(b).



(b) Subject to Section 10.03(e), the maximum liability of the Stockholders
collectively pursuant to Section 10.01(a) shall not exceed $15,000,000. Any
claims asserted by the Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section
10.01(a) for which the liability of the Stockholders is limited as set forth
in this Section 10.03(b) shall be made solely against the Escrow Fund pursuant
to the Escrow Agreement.



(c) Subject to Section 10.03(f), Parent shall not have any liability
pursuant to Section 10.01(b) for any Loss unless and until the aggregate
amount of all such Losses shall exceed the Deductible Amount, in which event
Parent shall be liable for indemnification pursuant to Section 10.01(b) for
the aggregate amount of all such Losses in excess of the Deductible Amount up
to the maximum amount set forth in Section 10.03(d).



(d) Subject to Section 10.03(f), the maximum liability of Parent pursuant to
Section 10.01(b) shall not exceed $15,000,000.



(e) The limitations on liability set forth in Section 10.03(a) or (b)
shall not apply with respect to Losses resulting from fraud or willful
misrepresentation with respect to (i) any breach of a representation or
warranty contained in or referred to in Article 4 or Article 6 or in any
schedule or exhibit or in the certificate delivered by or on behalf of any
Principal Stockholder or the Company  



 

77  pursuant to Section 9.02(a), 9.02(c), 9.02(d) or 9.02(e) or (ii) any breach
by any Principal Stockholder or the Company of, or any failure of any
Principal Stockholder or the Company to perform, any of the covenants,
agreements or obligations contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement,
provided that in no event shall any Stockholders liability pursuant to
Section 10.01(a) for Losses resulting from such fraud or willful
misrepresentation exceed the aggregate value of the Parent Common Shares paid
to such Stockholder in the Merger (valued at their Fair Market Value as of the
date of this Agreement), unless such Stockholder shall have committed such
fraud or made such willful misrepresentation. Any claim for indemnification by
the Parent Indemnified Parties under this Article 10 for Losses with respect
to which the limitations on liability set forth in Section 10.03(a) or (b)
shall not apply, including Losses resulting from fraud or willful
misrepresentation, shall first be made against the Escrow Fund up to the
Escrow Amount remaining therein and available to satisfy claims for
indemnification by the Parent Indemnified Parties before any such claim shall
be made against any Stockholder.



(f) The limitations on liability set forth in Section 10.03(c) or (d) shall
not apply with respect to Losses resulting from fraud or willful
misrepresentation with respect to (i) any breach of a representation
or warranty contained in or referred to in Article 5 or in any schedule or
exhibit or in the certificate delivered by or on behalf of Parent pursuant to
Section 9.03(a) or (ii) any breach by Parent or Merger Co. of, or any failure
of Parent or Merger Co. to perform, any of the covenants, agreements or
obligations contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement, provided that in
no event shall Parents liability pursuant to Section 10.01(b) for Losses
resulting from such fraud or willful misrepresentation exceed (A) with
respect to all Stockholders, the aggregate value of the Parent Common Shares
paid by Parent in the Merger (valued at their Fair Market Value as of the date
of this Agreement) or (B) with respect to any Stockholder, the value of the
Parent Common Shares paid by Parent to such Stockholder in the Merger (valued
at their Fair Market Value as of the date of this Agreement).



(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no
Indemnifying Party shall be obligated under this Agreement to indemnify any
Indemnified Person for any lost profits or consequential, incidental or
punitive damages suffered or incurred by any Indemnified Party, except to the
extent any such damages are recovered against such Indemnified Party in
connection with a Third Party Claim. 



(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Stockholders (or, as applicable, the Principal Stockholders) shall not be
required to indemnify any Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to Section
10.01(a) for any Loss resulting from any breach of any representation or
warranty referred to in clause (i) of Section 10.01(a) or for any breach of
any covenant, agreement or obligation referred to clause (ii) of Section
10.01(a) if any person listed on Section 12.16 of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule had knowledge on or before the Closing Date of facts, events,
occurrences, conditions or circumstances that would reasonably be expected by
such person to constitute such a breach (it being acknowledged and agreed that
each person listed on Section 12.16 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule is
familiar with the representations and warranties and the covenants, agreements
and obligations of the Company and the Principal Stockholders set forth in
this Agreement ), whether or not the Company disclosed such facts,
events, occurrences, conditions or circumstances on the Company Disclosure
Schedule or the Company Updated Disclosure Schedule.



(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall
not be required to indemnify any Company Indemnified Party pursuant
to Section 10.01(b) for any Loss  



 

78  resulting from any breach of any representation or warranty referred to in
clause (i) of Section 10.01(b) or for any breach of any covenant, agreement
or obligation referred to clause (ii) of Section 10.01(b) if any person
listed on Section 12.16 of the Company Disclosure Schedule had knowledge on or
before the Closing Date of facts, events, occurrences, conditions or
circumstances that would reasonably be expected by such person to constitute
such a breach (it being acknowledged and agreed that each person listed on
Section 12.16 of the Company Disclosure Schedule is familiar with the
representations and warranties and the covenants, agreements and obligations
of Parent set forth in this Agreement), whether or not Parent disclosed such
facts, events, occurrences, conditions or circumstances on the Parent
Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Updated Disclosure Schedule.

 



Section 10.04. _Computation of Losses_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the amount of any Losses otherwise payable to an
Indemnified Party shall be reduced by the amount of net insurance proceeds
actually received by such Indemnified Party as compensation for the damage or
Losses caused by the act, omission, fact or circumstance giving rise to such
Losses.



Section 10.05. _Payment; Escrow Fund_.



(a) Each Stockholder (other than any holder of Dissenting Shares) receiving
Parent Common Shares in the Merger shall be deemed to have received and
deposited such Stockholders pro rata share of the Escrow Amount (plus any
additional shares of Parent Common Stock as may be issued upon any stock
split, stock dividend or recapitalization effected by Parent after the
Effective Time with respect to the Escrow Amount) with the Escrow Agent as
provided in Sections 2.03(a) and 2.03(b). The Escrow Amount shall be
deposited with, and shall be held by, an institution mutually acceptable to
Parent and the Stockholders Representative as Escrow Agent (the "Escrow
Agent"). The deposit with the Escrow Agent pursuant to this Section 10.05(a)
shall constitute an escrow fund (the "Escrow Fund") governed by the terms set
forth in the Escrow Agreement.



(b) Any payment by the Stockholders to any Parent Indemnified Party under this
Article 10 shall be made by the Stockholders on a several basis, at
the option of each Stockholder, (i) in cash, (ii) by instructing the
Stockholders Representative to cause, on its behalf, the Escrow Agent to
deliver to Parent all of a portion of such Stockholders Parent Common Shares
constituting part of the Escrow Fund or (iii) in a combination of cash and
such Parent Common Shares. Any Parent Common Shares delivered by any
Stockholder to any Parent Indemnified Party as provided in this Section
10.05(b) shall be valued at their Fair Market Value as of the date of this
Agreement. In connection with any payment by the Stockholders as provided in
this Section 10.05(b) that shall be made by causing the delivery of Parent
Common Shares out of the Escrow Fund, each of the Parent and
the Stockholders Representative shall cooperate in good faith and use its
reasonable best efforts to promptly make and promptly process all necessary
filings and applications and obtain all consents, approvals, orders,
authorizations, registrations and declarations and to comply with all
applicable laws necessary for the Stockholders to make such payment.



(c) Any payment by Parent to any Company Indemnified Party under this Article
10 shall be made, at the option of Parent, (i) in cash, (ii) by
issuing Parent Common Shares to the Company Indemnified Parties or (iii) in a
combination of cash and such Parent Common Shares. Any Parent Common Shares
issued as payment to the Company Indemnified Parties under this Article 10
shall be valued at their Fair Market Value as of the date of this Agreement.
In connection with any payment by Parent as provided in this Section 10.05(c)
that shall be made by issuing Parent Common Shares, each of Parent and each
Company Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith  



 

79  and use its reasonable best efforts to promptly make and promptly process
all necessary filings and applications and obtain all consents, approvals,
orders, authorizations, registrations and declarations or expiration or
termination of any required waiting periods and to comply with all applicable
laws necessary for Parent to make such payment.



(d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement (including,
without limitation, Sections 2.02(b), 2.03(a), 2.03(b) and 10.05) to the
contrary, if Parent and the Stockholders Representative so agree in writing
prior to the Effective Time, (a) all 3,356,606 Parent Common Shares
constituting the Escrow Amount may be withheld solely from the Merger
Consideration payable to the Escrow Fund Stockholders instead of from the
Merger Consideration payable to all Stockholders, in which event such Parent
Common Shares that constitute the Escrow Amount shall be allocated among the
Escrow Fund Stockholders on a pro rata basis determined in accordance with
each Escrow Fund Stockholders ownership of the Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time on an as converted basis and
without regard to the liquidation preference attributable to any shares of
Series A Preferred Stock held by any such Escrow Fund Stockholder, (b) all
references in Section 10.05(b) to any payment by the Stockholders to any
Parent Indemnified Party from the Escrow Amount under this Article 10 shall
be deemed to refer solely to the Escrow Fund Stockholders and (c) the form of
Escrow Agreement attached as Exhibit H hereto shall be modified as appropriate
prior to execution and delivery thereof to reflect the terms of clauses (a)
and (b) immediately above. The parties acknowledge and agree that the
establishment of the Escrow Fund in accordance with the foregoing provisions
of this Section 10.05(d) shall not limit the liability of any Stockholder
for any claims for indemnification under this Article 10 by any Parent
Indemnified Party that may be made other than against the Escrow Fund.



Section 10.06. _Exclusive Remedy._ Subject to Section 12.13, from and after
Closing Date, indemnification pursuant to this Article 10 shall be
the exclusive remedy of the parties hereto for any Loss or Losses arising out
of or related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except in
the case of fraud or a willful breach of this Agreement.

8, 2005 (the "Termination Date"), provided that the party seeking to exercise

under this Agreement;

material breach of any of its material representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement;



(f) by the Company, by action of the Board of Directors of the Company,
if, prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, (i) the Company is
not in material breach of any of its material obligations under this
Agreement, (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company authorizes the Company,
subject to complying with the terms of this Agreement, to enter into a

to such notice if available or, if not available, including all material terms
and conditions of such agreement in the notice, (iii) Parent does not make,
within three Business Days after receipt of the Companys written notice of

is at least as favorable to the Companys stockholders as the Superior
Proposal and (iv) the Company prior to such termination pays to Parent the
Company Termination Fee in accordance with Section 11.02(b), the Company
agreeing hereby that (A) it shall not enter into a binding agreement referred

such notice;



(g) by Parent if, prior to the Company Stockholder Approval, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall have failed to recommend or shall have
withdrawn or modified or changed in a manner adverse to Parent its approval
or recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger or shall have recommended a
Superior Proposal (or the Board of Directors of the Company shall have
resolved to do any of the foregoing);



(h) by the Company if, prior to the Parent Stockholder Approval, the Board of
Directors of Parent shall have failed to recommend or shall have withdrawn or
changed in a manner adverse to the Company its approval or recommendation of
the Parent Stockholder Proposals (or the Board of Directors of Parent shall
have resolved to do any of the foregoing);



 

81 (i) by Parent, if the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been
obtained by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the second Business Day after the date
of execution of this Agreement; provided that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 11.01(i) shall not be available to Parent if
Parent has not complied with its obligations under Section 8.02(b); or



(j) by the Company, if the Parent Stockholder Approval shall not have been
obtained at the Parent Stockholders Meeting; provided that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 11.01(j) shall not be available to
the Company if the Company has not complied with its obligations under
Section 8.01(b).



Section 11.02. _Effect of Termination_. (a) If this Agreement is validly
terminated pursuant to Section 11.01, this Agreement shall become void and of
no effect with no liability on the part of any party hereto, except that
termination of this Agreement shall be without prejudice to any rights any
party may have hereunder against any other party for a willful breach of this
Agreement. The agreements contained in this Section 11.02, Section 8.10 and
Article 12 shall survive the termination hereof.



(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (i) by the
Company pursuant to Section 11.01(f) or (ii) by Parent pursuant to Section
11.01(g), the Company shall (A) promptly, but in no event later than the
earlier of the date of such termination or date of entry into an agreement
concerning an Acquisition Proposal, pay to Parent a termination fee of
$3,000,000 (the "Company Termination Fee") by wire transfer of same day funds
and (B) in no event later than the close of business on the second Business
Day after Parent shall have requested payment of its charges and expenses
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, pay to
Parent the amount of such charges and expenses by wire transfer of same day
funds.



(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant
to Section 11.01(i) for the Companys failure to obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval within the period specified therein, the Company shall
(i) no later than the close of business of the second Business Day after
Parent shall have requested payment of its charges and expenses incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, pay to Parent the amount
of such charges and expenses by wire transfer of same day funds and (ii) if
within nine months of such termination the Company enters into an agreement
concerning an Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall at the time of entering
into such agreement, pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee by wire
transfer of same day funds.



(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant
to Section 11.01(h), Parent shall (i) promptly, but in no event later than
the close of business on the second Business Day after such termination of
this Agreement, pay to the Company a termination fee of $3,000,000 by wire
transfer of same day funds and (ii) in no event later than the close of
business on the second Business Day after the Company shall have requested
payment of its changes and expenses incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, pay to the Company the amount of such
charges and expenses by wire transfer of same day funds.



(e) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 11.01(j), Parent shall, no later than the close of business on the
Second Business Day after the Company shall have requested payment of its
charges and expenses incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, pay to the Company the amount of such charges and
expenses by wire transfer of same day funds.



 

82 (f) The Company and Parent each acknowledge that the agreements contained in
this Section 11.02 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Company and Parent
would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent
fails to promptly pay the amounts due pursuant to this Section 11.02, and, in
order to obtain such payment, Parent or the Company, as the case may be,
commences a suit which results in a judgment against the other party for the
amounts set forth in this Section 11.02, the party against which
such judgment is entered shall pay to the party brining suit the costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees) of the party bringing suit in connection
with such suit, together with interest from the date of termination of this
Agreement on the amounts owed at the rate published as the "Prime Rate" in
_The Wall Street Journal_ in effect from time to time during such period, plus
2%.

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the
Effective Time if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and
signed, in the case of an amendment, by the Company, Parent and the
Stockholders Representative or in the case of a waiver,  



 

84  by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective (or, if any such

Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, no such amendment or waiver
shall, without the further approval of such stockholders, alter or change (i)
the amount or kind of consideration to be received in exchange for any shares
of capital stock of the Company or (ii) any of the terms or conditions of this
Agreement if such alteration or change would adversely affect the rights of
the holders of any shares of capital stock of the Company.



(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by law.



Section 12.03. _Expenses_. Except for filings fees related to compliance with
any applicable requirements of the HSR Act, all of which shall be paid by
Parent, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense, provided that, if a
Closing occurs, all such costs and expenses not theretofore paid by the
Company shall be paid by Parent or the Surviving Corporation.



Section 12.04.  _Successors and Assigns; Benefit_. The provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns, provided that no party may assign
(other than by operation of law following the Closing), delegate or otherwise
transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the
consent of the other parties hereto except that Parent and Merger Co. may make
such an assignment to one or more direct wholly-owned Parent Subsidiaries,
but any such assignment shall not relieve Parent or Merger Co. of its
obligations hereunder. Subsequent to the Effective Time, in the event that any
capital stock or other securities are issued in respect of, in exchange for,
or in substitution of, any Parent Common Shares by reason of any
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation,
spin-off, partial or complete liquidation, stock dividend, split-up, sale of
assets, distribution to holders of Parent Common Shares or combination of the
Parent Common Shares, or any other change in capital structure of Parent,
appropriate adjustments shall be made with respect to the relevant provisions
of this Agreement so as to fairly and equitably preserve, to the extent
practicable, the original rights and obligations of the parties hereto under
this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall confer
on any Person other than the parties hereto, and their respective successors
and assigns, any rights, remedies, obligations, or liabilities under or by
reason of this Agreement, except that Section 8.14 is intended to confer
rights and remedies to the officers and directors of the Company as and to
the extent set forth therein.



Section 12.05.  _Governing Law_. All matters arising out of or relating to
this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the
internal laws of the State of Delaware, except insofar as the Merger is
governed by Delaware Law.



Section 12.06. _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties
hereto irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia located in the City of
Atlanta, or if such court does not have jurisdiction, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the state courts of the State of Georgia located in Fulton
County, for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out
of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby. Each of the parties
hereto further agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or  



 

85  document by U.S. registered mail to such partys respective address set
forth in Section 12.01 shall be effective service of process for any
action, suit or proceeding in Georgia with respect to any matters to which it
has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth above in the immediately preceding
sentence. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives
any objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in (a)
the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia or (b)
the state courts of the State of Georgia located in Fulton County, and hereby
further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or
claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in
any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. 



Section 12.07. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.



Section 12.08. _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement
to Sections, subsections, Schedules or Exhibits, such reference shall be to a
Section, subsection, Schedule or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. The words "include", "includes" and "including" when used herein
shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation".
The word "herein" and similar references mean, except where a specific Section
or Article reference is expressly indicated, the entire Agreement rather than
any specific Section or Article. The table of contents and the headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.



Section 12.09. _Disclosures_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or
the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company Updated Disclosure Schedule, the
Parent Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Updated Disclosure Schedule to the
contrary, the Company and Parent acknowledge that the disclosure by the
Company or Parent of any matter pursuant to such schedules shall not be deemed
to constitute an acknowledgement by the Company or Parent, as applicable, that
such matter is required to be disclosed by the terms of this Agreement or
that such matter is material.



Section 12.10.  _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed
in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the
same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto
shall have received counterparts hereof signed by all of the other parties
hereto.



Section 12.11. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.



Section 12.12. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the other Transaction
Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and supersede all prior agreements and  



 

86  understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof.



Section 12.13. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree
that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof in (a) the United States District Court for the Northern
District of Georgia or (b) the state courts of the State of Georgia located in
Fulton County, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at
law or in equity.



Section 12.14.  _Nature of Liability_.



(a) Parent and Merger Co. shall be jointly and severally liable for all
covenants, agreements, obligations and representations and warranties made by
either of them in this Agreement.



(b) The Principal Stockholders shall be severally liable for all covenants,
agreements, obligations and representations and warranties made by any of
them or by the Company in this Agreement, and no Principal Stockholder shall
be liable for any breach, noncompliance or violation by any other Principal
Stockholder of such other Principal Stockholders covenants, agreements,
obligations or representations and warranties.



Section 12.15. _Binding Appointment_. The provisions of this Agreement,
including, without limitation, Article 10, shall be binding upon each
Principal Stockholder and the executors, heirs, legal representatives and
successors of each Principal Stockholder, and any references in this
Agreement to a Principal Stockholder or the Principal Stockholders shall mean
and include the successors to the Principal Stockholders rights hereunder,
whether pursuant to testamentary disposition, the laws of descent
and distribution or otherwise.



Section 12.16. _Definition of Knowledge_. As used herein, the word
"knowledge" shall, with respect to (i) the Company or any Subsidiary or (ii)
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, as the case may be, mean the actual knowledge
