not having been terminated in accordance with its terms (the "

has not been satisfied or, to the extent waivable by Parent or
Acquisition Sub pursuant to this Agreement, waived by Parent or Acquisition
Sub, Acquisition Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to) extend
the Offer for successive periods of up to five (5) Business Days each (or such
longer period of up to twenty (20) Business Days if Parent so desires and the
Company consents in writing prior to such extension), the length of each
such period to be determined by Parent in its sole discretion in order to
permit the satisfaction of the Offer Conditions; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,

scheduled Expiration Date without the prior written consent of the Company,
except if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_. If this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_, Acquisition Sub shall
(and Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to) promptly terminate the Offer and
shall not acquire the shares of Common Stock pursuant thereto. If the Offer
is terminated by Acquisition Sub, or this Agreement is terminated prior to the

and, subject to the provisions of _Section 6.4_, the Company Recommendation.
The Company agrees to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to holders

Laws, including the Exchange Act. The Company, on the one hand, and
Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9, if and to the

to holders of shares of Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent
required by all applicable Laws, including the Exchange Act.
Parent, Acquisition Sub and their counsel shall be given a reasonable

counsel. In addition, the Company shall provide Parent, Acquisition Sub and
their counsel promptly with copies of any written comments, and shall inform
them of any oral comments, that the Company or its counsel may receive from
time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9
promptly after receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses
thereto. Parent, Acquisition Sub and their counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review any proposed written or oral responses and the Company
shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested thereto by Parent, Acquisition Sub and their counsel, and
to participate in any substantive telephonic communications with the staff of
the SEC related thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations of the
Company in this _Section 2.2(a)_ shall not apply from and after the time the
Company Board effects a Change of Recommendation in accordance with _Section
6.4_.

and shall promptly furnish Acquisition Sub with such information (including,
but not limited to, updated lists of holders of the shares of Common Stock
and their addresses, mailing labels, security position listings and non-
objecting beneficial owner lists) and such other assistance as Acquisition Sub
or its agents may reasonably request in communicating with the record and
beneficial holders of shares of Common Stock, in connection with the
preparation and dissemination of the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents and
the solicitation of tenders of shares of Common Stock in the Offer. Parent and
Acquisition Sub and their agents shall hold in confidence the information
contained in any such labels, listings and files, will use such
information only in connection with such transactions and, if this Agreement
shall be terminated, will, upon request, deliver, and will cause their agents
to deliver, to the Company all copies of such information then in their

time at which the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the
Secretary of State or at such later date and time as is agreed between the

ARTICLE III

Section 3.1 _Effect of the Merger on Securities_. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
Company, Acquisition Sub or the holders of any securities of the Company or
Acquisition Sub:

  



  

(a) _Cancellation of Company Securities; Conversion of Subsidiary-
Owned Securities_.

  



  

(i) Each share of Common Stock held by the Company as treasury stock
or held by Parent or Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration or payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in
respect thereof.

  



  

(ii) Each share of Common Stock that is owned by any direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company or any direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (other than Acquisition Sub) or of
Acquisition Sub shall be converted into such number of shares of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation such that the ownership percentage of any such
subsidiary in the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective
Time shall equal the ownership percentage of such subsidiary in the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) _Conversion of Company Securities_. Except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares canceled or
converted pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ hereof and Dissenting Shares), shall
be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, without interest (the
" _Merger Consideration_ "). The holders of certificates or book-entry shares
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Common Stock
(respectively, the " _Certificates_ "and " _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such Common Stock other than the right to
receive, upon surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with  _Section 3.2_ of this Agreement, the Merger Consideration,
or, with respect to Dissenting Shares, the rights set forth in Section 262 of
the DGCL.

  



  

(c) _Conversion of Acquisition Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Acquisition Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(d) _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this
Agreement and other than as contemplated by this Agreement, if at any time
during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
any change in the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall occur as
a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or
any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period
or other similar transaction, the Offer Price and Merger Consideration shall
be equitably adjusted to reflect such change; _provided_  that the Company
may not effect such change except as permitted by this Agreement.

  



  

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  



  

(a) _Designation of Paying Agent; Deposit of Exchange Fund_. Prior
to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a paying agent (the "
_Paying Agent_ "), the identity and the terms of appointment of which shall
be reasonably acceptable to the Company, for the payment of the applicable
Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.1(b)_. At or before the filing
of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State, Parent shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, cash constituting
an amount equal to the Total Common Merger Consideration (all cash deposited
with the Paying Agent, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). At or immediately after the
Effective Time, Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to the Surviving
Corporation and the Surviving Corporation shall disburse in cash the amounts
payable at Closing in respect of the Company Options pursuant to _Section
3.3(a)_ and the Company Share Unit Awards pursuant to _Section 3.3(b)_. In
the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments
contemplated by _Section 3.1(b)_ Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to
be deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount which is
equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. The
Paying Agent shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (i) held for the benefit of
the holders of Common Stock and (ii) applied promptly to making the payments
pursuant to _Section 3.2(c)_ hereof. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for
any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to _Section 3.2(c)_, except
as expressly provided for in this Agreement.

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and in
any event not later than the third Business Day thereafter, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Common Stock (x) a letter of
transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and which shall be in
the form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may
reasonably specify and (y) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration
into which the number of shares of Common Stock previously represented by
such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall have been converted pursuant to
this Agreement.

  



  

(c) Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent,
together with a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, to be mailed, or
delivered by wire transfer, as elected by the surrendering holder, promptly
following the later to occur of (i) the Effective Time or (ii) the Paying
Agent's receipt and acceptance of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss
in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be forthwith
canceled. The Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such
reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an
orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No
interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon the
surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

  



  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares for nine (9) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered
to Parent, upon demand, and any such holders prior to the Merger who have not
theretofore complied with this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent as general creditor thereof for payment of their claims for cash,
without interest, to which such holders may be entitled.

  



  

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person
in respect of any Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest
any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent or, after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ that (i) no such
investment shall relieve Parent or the Paying Agent from making the payments
required by this _Article III_ , and following any losses Parent shall
promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the
holders of Common Stock in the amount of such losses, (ii) no such
investment shall have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be
made pursuant to this Agreement, and (iii) such investments shall be in
short-term obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no
more than thirty days or guaranteed by the United States of America and
backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America or in
commercial paper obligations rated A-l or P-l or better by Moody's Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively. Any interest or
income produced by such investments will become a part of the Exchange Fund.

  



  

Section 3.3 _Treatment of Equity Awards and Company ESPP_.

  



  

(a) _Treatment of Company Options_. As of the Effective Time, each
Company Option (or portion thereof) that is outstanding as of the
Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be canceled by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of any Company
Option, in consideration for the right to receive a cash payment with respect
thereto equal to _the product of_  (x) the number of shares of Common Stock
subject to such Company Option as of the Effective Time and (y) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share
of Common Stock subject to such Company Option as of the Effective Time (the
" _Option Cash Payment_ "). The Surviving Corporation shall cause each Option
Cash Payment to be paid, less any required withholding Taxes, as promptly as
practicable following the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, if the
exercise price per share of Common Stock subject to a Company Option as of the
Effective Time equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration, such Company
Option shall be cancelled for no consideration as of the Effective Time, and
the holder thereof shall have no further rights with respect thereto.

  



  

(b) _Treatment of Company Share Unit Awards_. As of the Effective
Time, each Company Share Unit Award (or portion thereof) that is
outstanding as of the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, (each, a "
_Company Share Unit Award_ "), shall, unless otherwise agreed to by Parent
and selected holders thereof, be canceled by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of any holder of any Company Share Unit Award, in
consideration for the right to receive, following the Effective Time and
subject to the conditions below, a cash payment with respect thereto equal to
_the product of_ (x) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such
Company Share Unit Award as of the Effective Time and (y) the Merger
Consideration (the " _Company Share Unit Award Cash Payment_ "). With respect
to any Company PSU Award, for the purposes of this Section 3.3(b), the total
number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Company Share Unit Award
shall be determined at the target level for any Company PSU Award that is
subject to revenue or total shareholder return-based performance metrics for
performance periods that have not been completed prior to the Effective Time,
and at the level eligible to be paid to the holder based on the
Company's actual revenue or total shareholder return-based performance for
performance periods that have been completed prior to the Effective Time (as
previously determined for performance periods completed prior to the date
hereof and as determined in the ordinary course of business and consistent
with past practice for performance periods that are completed after the date
hereof and prior to the Effective Time). The Surviving Corporation shall
cause each Company Share Unit Award Cash Payment to be paid, less any
required withholding Taxes, as promptly as practicable following the
Effective Time; _provided_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, any payment in respect of a Company Share Unit
Award which immediately prior to such cancellation was subject to Section
409A of the Code shall be made on the applicable settlement date for such
vested Company Share Unit Award if required in order to comply with Section
409A of the Code.

  



    

-10-

--- 

    



  

(c) As of the Effective Time, all Company Options and Company Share
Unit Awards (whether vested or unvested) shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a Company Option and
Company Share Unit Award shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive, in respect of a Company Option with an exercise
price per share of Common Stock that is less than the Merger Consideration,
the Option Cash Payment, and in respect of a Company Share Unit Award, the
Company Share Unit Award Cash Payment.

  



  

(d) _Treatment of Company ESPP_. The Company ESPP will continue to
be operated in accordance with its terms and past practice for the
Offering Period (as defined in the Company ESPP) in effect as of the date of
this Agreement which is scheduled to end on June 30, 2015 (the " _Current
Offering Period_ "). The Company shall (i) suspend the commencement of any
future Offering Period under the Company ESPP (excepting, for the avoidance
of doubt, the Current Offering Period) unless and until this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with _Article VIII_ and (ii) on and after the date
of this Agreement, except as permitted under the terms of the Company ESPP,
no Person shall become a participant in the Company ESPP and no participant in
the Company ESPP shall be eligible to increase the level of such
participant's payroll deductions under the Company ESPP.

  



  

(e) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the board
of directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee administering
any Company Plan or the Director Plan) shall adopt all resolutions and take
all other actions (including, obtaining all consents) as may be necessary or
required in accordance with applicable Law, each Company Plan, the Director
Plan, the Equity Awards or otherwise to terminate each of the Company Plans
and the Director Plan and to effectuate all of the actions contemplated by
this _Section 3.3_, contingent on the Closing.

  



  

Section 3.4 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of
a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to this _Article III_.

  



  

Section 3.5 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding _Section
3.1(b)_, to the extent that holders thereof are entitled to appraisal rights
under Section 262 of the DGCL, shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly
complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting
Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, but the holders of such Dissenting Shares shall have the
rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost his or her right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL,
such holder's shares of Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, and such shares shall not
thereafter be deemed to be Dissenting Shares.

Section 3.6 _Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights_. After the
Effective Time, there shall be no registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for transfer following the Effective Time, they shall be
canceled against delivery of the applicable Merger Consideration, as provided
for in this _Article III_ , for each share of Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificates. All cash paid upon the surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this
_Article III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, subject, however, to Parent and the
Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay any dividends or make any other
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have
been authorized by the Company in compliance with this Agreement and which
remain unpaid at the Effective Time.

  



  

Section 3.7 _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, each of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by or on behalf of Parent,
Acquisition Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such deducted
and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made and shall be paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Authority on such person's behalf.

  



  

Section 3.8 _Subsequent Actions_. The parties agree to take all
necessary action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as
practicable following the Offer Closing without a meeting of the Company's
stockholders, as provided in Section 251(h) of the DGCL.

Section 4.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. Each
of the Company and its subsidiaries is a corporation or legal entity duly
organized or formed, validly existing and in good standing, under the laws of
its respective jurisdiction of organization or formation and has the
requisite corporate, partnership or limited liability company or other
organizational power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties
and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where the
failure to have such power and authority would not be material to the Company
and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Each of the Company and its
subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business or licensed as a foreign
corporation or other entity to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties or
assets or conduct of its business requires such qualification or licensing,

as would not have, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 4.2 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws_. The
Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of the
certificate of incorporation and by-laws, or equivalent organizational
documents, each as amended to date, of the Company, each of the Company's
"significant subsidiaries," as such term is defined in Section 1-02 of
Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act, and all entities listed on Exhibit 21
to the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended December
31, 2014. The Certificate of Incorporation and the By-laws and the equivalent
organizational documents of each of the Company's subsidiaries are in full
force and effect. None of the Company's subsidiaries is in violation of any
provision of its respective certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or
equivalent organizational documents) except as would not have, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company is not in violation of any provision of
the Certificate of Incorporation or the By-laws except as would not, and would
not reasonably be expected to, result in material liability to Parent or the
Company from and after the Closing or prevent, materially delay or materially
impede the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

jurisdiction of organization or formation and has the requisite
corporate power and authority and all necessary governmental approvals to

authority would not be material to Parent and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole and (ii) the failure to have such governmental approvals would not have,
and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the

Acquisition Sub is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do
business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the ownership,
leasing or operation of its properties or assets or conduct of its business
requires such qualification or licensing, except for such failures to be so
qualified or licensed and in good standing that would not have, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 5.2 _Certificate of Incorporation, By-Laws, and Other
Organizational Documents_. Parent has made available to the Company a complete
and correct copy of the certificate of incorporation, by-laws (or equivalent
organizational documents), and other organizational documents, each as

of Parent, the other parties thereto are in violation of any provision of the
Parent Organizational Documents, as applicable, except as would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 5.3 _Authority Relative to Agreement_. Each of Parent and
Acquisition Sub has all necessary power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Acquisition Sub and the
consummation by Parent and Acquisition Sub of the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized
by all necessary corporate action of Parent and Acquisition Sub and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Acquisition Sub or their
respective stockholders are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery
of this Agreement or to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby (other than, with respect to the Merger, (x)
the adoption of this Agreement by Parent in its capacity as the sole
stockholder of Acquisition Sub, which adoption shall occur immediately
following the execution of this Agreement, and (y) the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State). This Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and Acquisition Sub and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, this
Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and

outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding share capital of Acquisition
Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent, a person of which
Parent is a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary, or a direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of such a person. Acquisition Sub does not
have outstanding any option, warrant, right or other agreement pursuant to
which any person other than Parent may acquire any equity interest
of Acquisition Sub. Acquisition Sub was formed solely for the purpose of
engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby, and it has not conducted
any business prior to the date hereof and has no, and prior to the Effective
Time will have no, assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other
than those incident to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

Section 5.7 _Brokers_. Other than Citigroup Capital Markets Inc.

Common Merger Consideration, as applicable, and the consideration in respect
of the Equity Awards, and to pay all related fees and expenses and any other
amounts contemplated by this Agreement to be paid by Parent or
Acquisition Sub at such respective times. Parent's and Acquisition Sub's
obligations hereunder are not subject to a condition regarding Parent's or
Acquisition Sub's obtaining of funds or financing to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent has delivered to the
Company prior to the date hereof a true and correct copy of Parent's
unaudited consolidated balance sheet for the quarter ended March 31, 2015,
and such balance sheet fairly presents in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries as
at the date thereof, in accordance with GAAP. Between March 31, 2015 and the
date hereof, no material adverse change has occurred with respect to the
consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries.

outstanding equity interests in, among other entities, AutoTrader.com, Inc.,

the DGCL) any shares of Common Stock or other securities of the Company or any

of, or any other economic interest (through derivative securities or
otherwise) in, the Company. Neither Parent nor any of its "affiliates" or
"associates"(each as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) is, or has been at
any time with the last three years, an "interested stockholder" as defined in
Section 203 of the DGCL. Neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries has
taken, or authorized or permitted any its Representatives to take, any action
that would cause Parent or any of its "affiliates" or "associates" (each as
defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) thereof to be deemed an "interested
stockholder" as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL or otherwise render
Section 251(h) of the DGCL inapplicable to the Merger.

Company nor any person on behalf of the Company makes any other express or
implied representation or warranty with respect to the Company or any of its

documents and (ii) obtaining and maintaining all consents, approvals,
registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations required to be
obtained from any Governmental Authority that are necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate the Transactions as soon as reasonably possible. "
_Transactions_ " means the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Offer and the Merger.

  



  

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of
Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
provide or cause to be provided as promptly as possible to any Governmental
Authority information and documents requested by any such Governmental
Authority or necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent and Acquisition Sub shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to): (A) take any and all actions necessary to obtain any and all necessary
clearances, approvals, waiver or consents from any Governmental Authority or
necessary to avoid or eliminate any and all impediments under any Antitrust
Law or to prevent the initiation of any Proceeding by any Governmental
Authority under any Antitrust Law or to prevent the entry of any Order, so as
to enable the consummation of the Transactions to occur as soon as
practicable (and in any event no later than the Outside Date), including but
not limited to: (i) the sale, disposition or transfer of, any assets,
businesses, product lines or operations (including proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting the foregoing, by consent decree,
hold separate or otherwise), (ii) licensing or otherwise making available to
any Person of any technology or other intellectual property rights, (iii)
terminating existing relationships, contractual rights or obligations,
ventures or other arrangements, (iv) changing or modifying any course of

respect to Parent or the Company or their respective Affiliates (each, a "
_Divestiture Action_ "), provided, however, that Parent and Acquisition Sub
shall not be required to propose, negotiate, agree or commit to any
Divestiture Action with respect to assets, businesses, product lines or
operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, or any combination thereof, that in the aggregate generated

(B) not take any action (including the acquisition by it or its Affiliates of
any interest in any Person that derives revenues from products, services or
lines of business similar to the Company's products, services or lines of
business) if such action would make it materially more likely that
there would arise any impediments under any Antitrust Law that may be
asserted by any Governmental Authority to the consummation of
the Transactions as soon as practicable. Subject to the foregoing, if any
action, suit or proceeding is instituted (or threatened) challenging the
Transactions (collectively, a " _Proceeding_ "), or if any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, which
would make the Transactions illegal or would otherwise prohibit,
prevent, restrict, impair or delay consummation of the Transactions
(collectively, an " _Antitrust Order_ "), is entered, enforced or attempted
to be entered or enforced by a court or other Governmental Authority, Parent
and Acquisition Sub shall take, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to take, any and all actions and steps (including through litigation and
appeal of litigation) necessary to contest, defend against and resist any
such Proceeding (including by agreeing or proffering to agree to a
Divestiture Action) and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
such Antitrust Order, so as to permit consummation of the Transactions as
soon as practicable and before the Outside Date.

cause their respective Affiliates to, cooperate reasonably with one another
and keep the others generally apprised of material matters relating to or in
connection with the taking of such actions and the doing of such other things
as are contemplated by this _Section 6.2_. Each such party shall, and shall
cause its respective Affiliates to, promptly inform the other parties hereto
of any oral communication with, and provide copies of written
communications with, any Governmental Authority regarding any such filings or
any such transaction, provided, however, that documents provided pursuant to
this _Section 6.2_ may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the
valuation of the Company, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements, and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable privilege concerns.

with, any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions, the
parties shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, to the extent

(a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time or the date, if any,
on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law and notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company will (i) provide to
Parent and its officers, directors, employees, accountants, consultants, legal
counsel, investment bankers, agents and other representatives (collectively,
" _Representatives_ ") reasonable access during normal business hours to the
Company's employees, properties, books, commitments, contracts and records and
other information (including Tax Returns) as Parent may reasonably request
regarding the business, assets, liabilities, employees and other aspects of
the Company and instruct the Company's independent accountants to provide
access to their work papers and such other information as Parent and
Acquisition Sub may reasonably request, (ii) permit Parent and Acquisition Sub
to make such inspections as they reasonably require and (iii) furnish
promptly to Parent and Acquisition Sub a copy of each report, schedule and
other document filed or received by the Company during such period pursuant
to the requirements of the federal or state securities Laws that is
not otherwise made publicly available on the SEC's Electronic Data-Gathering,
Analysis and Retrieval system; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company
shall not be required to provide access to any information or documents which
would, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, (A) constitute a waiver of
the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other privilege held
by the Company, (B) would violate an existing confidentiality obligation to or
agreement with any person; or (C) otherwise violate any applicable Laws;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of clauses _(A)_ and _(B)_ , the
Company shall (1) advise Parent of the nature of any information or documents
withheld by the Company or any of its subsidiaries; (2) use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain any required consents (such as the redaction of
identifying or confidential information, entry into a joint defense agreement
or other agreement or by providing such access, inspections, data or other
information solely to outside counsel to avoid the loss of attorney-client
privilege) as are necessary to provide such access, inspections, data or
other information to Parent or Acquisition Sub in compliance with applicable
Laws; and (3) otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to institute
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements, to the extent practicable in
the circumstances. Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access
contemplated by this _Section 6.3_ shall be conducted in a manner that does
not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company
and its subsidiaries or result in damage or destruction of any property or
assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Any access to the Company's
properties shall be subject to the Company's reasonable security measures and
insurance requirements and shall not include the right to perform invasive
testing.

Affiliates' respective obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement,
subject to _Section 6.4(a)_.

(a) Except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, the Company
agrees that it and its subsidiaries shall, and that it shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives to,

discussions with any person with respect to any Competing Proposal; (iv)
approve or recommend any Competing Proposal; (v) enter into any letter of
intent or similar document or any agreement or commitment providing for any
Competing Proposal; (vi) take any action to make the provisions of any "fair
price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business combination" or
other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation (including any transaction
under, or a third party becoming an "interested stockholder" under Section
203 of the DGCL), or any restrictive provision of any applicable anti-takeover
provision in the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company,
inapplicable to any person other than Parent and its Affiliates or to any
transactions constituting or contemplated by a Competing Proposal; or (vii)
resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing. The Company shall promptly after
the date hereof instruct each person that has executed a confidentiality
agreement within one year prior to the date hereof (other than the
Confidentiality Agreement) relating to a Competing Proposal or potential
Competing Proposal with or for the benefit of the Company promptly to return
to the Company or destroy all information, documents, and materials relating
to the Competing Proposal or to the Company or its businesses, operations or
affairs heretofore furnished by the Company or any of its Representatives to
such person or any of its Representatives in accordance with the terms of any
confidentiality agreement with such person, and shall use reasonable best
efforts to enforce, and not waive without Parent's prior written consent, any
standstill or similar provision in any confidentiality or other agreement with
such person; _provided_ that if the Company Board determines in good faith
that it would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable
Law not to do so, the Company may waive any standstill or similar provisions
in its agreements to the extent necessary to permit a person to make, on a
confidential basis to the Company Board, a Competing Proposal, conditioned
upon such person agreeing to disclosure of such Competing Proposal to Parent
and Acquisition Sub, in each case as contemplated by and subject to compliance
with this _Section 6.4_.

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 6.4(a)_,
if the Company receives a bona fide, Competing Proposal not solicited after
the date hereof that did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.4_ at
any time prior to the Acceptance Time which (i) constitutes a Superior
Proposal or (ii) which the Company Board determines in good faith after
consultation with the Company's outside legal and financial advisors could
reasonably be expected to result, after the taking of any of the actions
referred to in either of clause (x) or (y) below, in a Superior Proposal, the
Company may take the following actions: (x) furnish information to the third
party making such Competing Proposal ( _provided_ , that substantially
concurrently the Company makes available such information to Parent to the
extent such information was not previously made available to Parent) and (y)
engage in discussions or negotiations with the third party with respect to the
Competing Proposal, in each case of clauses (x) and (y), if, and only if,
prior to so furnishing such information, the Company receives from the third
party an executed confidentiality agreement on terms no less favorable in the
aggregate to the Company than the Confidentiality Agreement (an " _Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the Company taking such actions as described
in clauses (x) and (y) above, the Company shall provide written notice to
Parent of such determination of the Company Board pursuant to clauses (i) or
(ii) above. From and after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall
notify Parent promptly (but in any event within 48 hours) of the receipt
of any Competing Proposal, and (A) if it is in writing, deliver to Parent a
copy of such Competing Proposal and any related draft agreements and other
written material setting forth the terms and conditions of such Competing
Proposal or (B) if oral, provide to Parent a reasonably detailed summary of
the material terms and conditions thereof including the identity of the person
making such Competing Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably
informed on a prompt and timely basis of the status and material details of
any such Competing Proposal and with respect to any material change to the
terms of any such Competing Proposal within 48 hours of such material change.

  



  

(c) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 6.4(d)_, neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof may (i) withdraw or withhold, amend,
modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent or Acquisition Sub the
Company Recommendation or make any public announcement inconsistent with the
Company Recommendation, or publicly propose to do any of the foregoing, (ii)
approve, adopt, endorse, or recommend any Competing Proposal or any inquiry
or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Competing Proposal, (iii) following the date any Competing Proposal or any
material modification thereto is first made public, sent or given to the
stockholders of the Company, fail to issue a press release that expressly
reaffirms the Company Recommendation within four (4) Business Days following
Parent's written request to do so (which request may not be made more than
twice with respect to any such Competing Proposal and each material
modification thereto), (iv) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the
Schedule 14D-9 or any amendment thereof, or (v) except as expressly
contemplated by _Section 6.4(g)_, cause or permit the Company to enter into
any contract, letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, or agreement in
principle regarding or providing for any Competing Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) or requiring the Company to
abandon, terminate, delay or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (any action described in clause (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or
(v), whether taken by the Company, the Company Board or any committee thereof,
being referred to as a " _Change of Recommendation_ ").

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, if (i) an event, fact,
circumstance, development, change or occurrence or the consequences of any of
the foregoing (an " _Intervening Event_ ") that materially affects the
business, assets or operations of the Company and that is unknown to the
Company Board as of the date of this Agreement and reasonably should not have
been known as of the date of this Agreement, becomes known to the Company
Board or (ii) the Company receives a Competing Proposal which the Company
Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel
and its financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving
effect to all of the adjustments to the terms of this Agreement which may be
offered by Parent, the Company Board may effect a Change of Recommendation if
the Company Board has concluded in good faith after consultation with the
Company's outside legal advisors that the failure of the Company Board to
make such Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with the directors'
exercise of their fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such action may only be taken (A) if the Company shall
have (x) complied with this _Section 6.4_ and (y) first provided prior
written notice to Parent in advance of its intention to make a Change of
Recommendation and the reasons therefor, including the terms of any Competing
Proposal with respect to which the Change of Recommendation relates and the
identity of the person making such Competing Proposal (it being
understood that the delivery of such notice shall not, in and of itself, be
deemed a Change in Recommendation) and (B) at a time that is after the fourth
(4th) Business Day following the Company's delivery to Parent of such notice,
during which time Parent shall be entitled to deliver to the Company one or
more proposals for amendments to this Agreement and, if requested by Parent,
the Company shall negotiate with the Parent in good faith with respect
thereto, if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with the Company's outside legal advisors, taking into account all amendments
or revisions to this Agreement proposed by Parent, that the failure of the
Company Board to effect such Change of Recommendation still would be
inconsistent with the directors' exercise of their fiduciary duties under
applicable Law. Any material amendment to a Competing Proposal to which such
Change of Recommendation relates, including any revision to price, shall
require the Company to deliver to Parent a new notice and again comply with
the requirements of this _Section 6.4(d)_ with respect to such revised
Competing Proposal.

  



  

(e) No Change of Recommendation shall change the approval of the
Company Board for purposes of (x) Section 251(b) of the DGCL or (y) any state
takeover Law (including the "interested stockholder" as defined in Section 203
of the DGCL) or other state Law.

  



  

(f) Nothing in this _Section 6.4_ shall be deemed to prohibit the
Company or its subsidiaries from complying with Rule 14e-2, Rule 14d-9 or
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act (including
making any "stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication of
the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) thereunder), or to prohibit the Company
from making any disclosure if the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside counsel) that failure to do so would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under
applicable Law, nor shall any such action be deemed to constitute a breach of
the Company's obligations under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing in this _Section 6.4(f)_ shall permit the Company to effect a
Change of Recommendation (including in compliance with Rule 14e-2, Rule 14d-9
or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or other
applicable Law) without complying with _Section 6.4(d)_ and, for the
avoidance of doubt, any such disclosure that does not reaffirm the Company
Recommendation (other than a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act) shall constitute a Change of Recommendation.

(g) If at any time prior to the Acceptance Time the Company Board
has concluded in good faith after consultation with the Company's outside
legal and financial advisors that a Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal, then the Company Board may cause the Company to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1(h)_, pay the Company Termination
Fee substantially concurrently with such termination and enter into a binding
written agreement (a " _Superior Proposal Agreement_ ") with respect to such
Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that such termination shall only
be effective if: (i) the Company (x) shall have complied with this _Section
6.4_ and (y) first provided prior written notice to Parent in advance of its
intention to terminate this Agreement of the terms of the Superior Proposal,
including the final draft of the Superior Proposal Agreement and the identity
of the person making such Competing Proposal; (ii) at a time that is
after the fourth (4th) Business Day following the Company's delivery to
Parent of such notice, during which time Parent shall be entitled to deliver
to the Company one or more proposals for amendments to this Agreement and, if
requested by Parent, the Company shall negotiate with Parent in good faith
with respect thereto, if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Company's outside legal and financial advisors, taking
into account all amendments or revisions to this Agreement proposed by
Parent, that the Competing Proposal remains a Superior Proposal; (iii) the
Company pays the Company Termination Fee to Parent substantially concurrently
with the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement; and (iv) the Company enters into a Superior Proposal Agreement.
Any material amendment to a Competing Proposal, including any revision to
price, shall require the Company to deliver to Parent a new notice and again
comply with the requirements of this  _Section 6.4(g)_ with respect to such
revised Competing Proposal. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company may
simultaneously give notice of its intention both to make a Change of
Recommendation and to terminate this Agreement to enter into a Superior
Proposal Agreement and the notice and negotiation periods set forth in
_Section 6.4(d)_ and this _Section 6.4(g)_ may pass simultaneously.

  



  

(h) As used in this Agreement, " _Competing Proposal_ " shall mean
any bona fide proposal (other than a proposal or offer by Parent or any of
its subsidiaries) for (i) any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, issuance of securities, direct or indirect acquisition of
securities, recapitalization, tender offer, exchange offer or other similar
transaction in which (x) a person or "group"(as defined in the Exchange Act
and the rules promulgated thereunder) of persons directly or indirectly
acquires, or if consummated in accordance with its terms would acquire,
beneficial or record ownership of securities representing more than 10% of
the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of the Company; or
(y) the Company issues securities representing more than 10% of the
outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of the Company; (ii) any
direct or indirect sale, lease, exchange, transfer, acquisition or disposition
of any assets of the Company and of the subsidiaries of the Company that
constitute or account for (x) more than 10% of the consolidated net revenues
of the Company, consolidated net income of the Company or consolidated book
value of the Company; or (y) more than 10% of the fair market value of the
assets of the Company; or (iii) any liquidation or dissolution of the Company.

(i) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean a
Competing Proposal (with all percentages in the definition of Competing
Proposal increased to fifty percent (50%)) on terms that the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside
financial and legal advisors, would (A) offer a higher per share price to the
stockholders of the Company than the Offer Price and (B) be more favorable to
the stockholders of the Company than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, taking into account all factors the Company Board acting in good
faith considers to be appropriate, including (i) any proposal by Parent in
writing to amend or modify the terms hereof, (ii) the identity of the person
making such Competing Proposal, and (iii) the consideration, terms,
conditions, timing, likelihood of consummation, financing terms and legal,
financial, and regulatory aspects of such Competing Proposal.

  



  

Section 6.5 _Directors ' and Officers' Indemnification and
Insurance_.

  



  

(a) Parent and Acquisition Sub agree that all rights to exculpation
and indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including any matters
arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement),
now existing in favor of any Indemnitee as provided in the Certificate of
Incorporation or the By-laws (or comparable organization documents) of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or in any agreement (including those filed
as an exhibit to the Company SEC Documents filed at least two (2)
calendar days prior to the date hereof or listed on _Section 4.16_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter) shall survive the Merger and shall continue in
full force and effect with respect to such Indemnitee. Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and advance expenses to,
Indemnitees with respect to all acts or omissions by them, in their
capacities as such at any time prior to the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law and (ii) not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any
provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws (or
equivalent organizational documents) of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement and any
indemnification agreement of the Company or its subsidiaries or other
applicable contract that has been made available to Parent as in effect
on the date of this Agreement in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of any Indemnitees.

  



  

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 6.5(a)_, during the
period commencing as of the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation and
its subsidiaries will: (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
Indemnitee against and from any costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to
the extent such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arises out
of or pertains to: (A) any action or omission or alleged action or omission in
such Indemnitee's capacity as a director or officer of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries or Affiliates; or (B) the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement
and any transactions contemplated hereby; and (ii) pay in advance of the
final disposition of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation the expenses (including attorneys' fees) of any Indemnitee upon
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnitee to repay such
amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this _Section 6.5(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation not to) settle or compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation for which indemnification may be sought
under this _Section 6.5(b)_ unless such settlement, compromise, consent or
termination includes an unconditional release of all Indemnitees from all
liability arising out of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the
Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of
the Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-
cancellable extension of the directors' and officers' liability coverage of
the Company's existing directors' and officers' insurance policies and the
Company's existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, the
" _D andO Insurance_"), for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least
six years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related
to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's
current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable
than the coverage provided under the Company's existing policies; _provided_ ,
that the premium for such "tail" insurance shall not exceed 250% of the
annual premium currently paid by the Company. If the Company or the Surviving
Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as
of the Effective Time, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall continue to
maintain in effect, for a period of at least six years from and after the
Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with the
Company's current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same
or better credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with
respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the
Company's existing policies as of the date hereof, or (ii) Parent will
provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for a period of not
less than six years after the Effective Time, the Indemnitees who are insured
under the Company's DandO Insurance with comparable DandO Insurance that provides
coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's
current insurance carrier, that is no less favorable than the existing policy
of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO
Insurance in excess of 250% of the annual premium currently paid by the
Company for such insurance;  _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available, with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount; and _provided_ ,
_further_ that Parent may substitute therefor policies of an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's current
insurance carrier, containing terms (including with respect to coverage and
amounts) and conditions (including with respect to deductibles and
exclusions) that are no less favorable to any Indemnitee than the coverage
provided under the Company's existing policies.

  



  

(d) The Indemnitees to whom this _Section 6.5_ applies shall be
third party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.5_. The provisions of this
_Section 6.5_ are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee and his
or her successors, heirs or representatives. Parent shall pay all reasonable
expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by any
Indemnitee in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this
_Section 6.5_.

(e) The rights of each Indemnitee under this _Section 6.5_ shall be
in addition to any rights such person may have under the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of
its subsidiaries, or under any applicable Law or insurance policy or under
any agreement (including any employment agreement) of any Indemnitee with the
Company or any of its subsidiaries.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained in this _Section 6.5_ or
_Section 9.6_ hereof to the contrary, this _Section 6.5_ shall survive the
consummation of the Merger indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and
severally, on all successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
and its subsidiaries, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnitees and their
successors, heirs or representatives. In the event that Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns consolidates
with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers
or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any person, then,
and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall
succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.5_.

  



  

Section 6.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall
promptly (and in any event with two (2) Business Days) notify Parent, and
Parent shall promptly (and in any event with two (2) Business Days) notify
the Company, of (a) any notice or other communication received by such party
from any Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement, the Offer,
the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby, or from any person
alleging that the consent of such person is or may be required in connection
with the Offer, the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby, if the
subject matter of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain
such consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, (b) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings
commenced or, to such party's Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or
involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its subsidiaries which
relate to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby and (c) the discovery by such party of any
fact, circumstance or event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which could
reasonably be expected, individually or taken together with all other existing
facts, events and circumstances known to such party, to cause or result in
any of the conditions of the obligations of such party to consummate the
Merger or the Offer not to be satisfied or the satisfaction of which to be
materially delayed. The delivery of any notice pursuant to this  _Section
6.6_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to
the party receiving such notice or the representations or warranties or
covenants of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
hereunder.

Section 6.7 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall
consult with each other before issuing, and provide each other the
opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public
statements with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or the Offer, and shall
not issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the
prior consent of the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed), except as may be required by Law, court process or any listing
agreement with or rules of the NASDAQ or other stock exchange on which
securities of the Company is listed; _provided_ that Parent and
Acquisition Sub may make public statements regarding any Competing Proposal
that has been made public or in response to public statements of any person
recommending or encouraging stockholders of the Company not to tender their
shares of Common Stock into the Offer, after consulting with the Company and
considering in good faith any comments provided by the Company with respect to
such public statements to the extent permitted by Law and court process. With
respect to any communications to be delivered orally, including by conference
call or webcast, this _Section 6.7 _shall be deemed satisfied if, to the
extent practicable, the disclosing party gives advance notice of such
disclosure to the other party, including copies of any talking points, scripts
or similar documents, and consults with the other party and considers in good
faith any comments provided by such other party with respect thereto; 
_provided_ , _further_ that the prior agreement of the other party shall be
required with respect to such disclosures to the extent that the non-
disclosing party reasonably determines that any disclosure would be materially
adverse to the non-disclosing party and it is reasonably practicable for the
disclosing party to seek such prior consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.7_ shall not apply to any
public statement made or proposed to be made by the Company or Parent in
connection with or following a Change of Recommendation.

  



  

Section 6.8 _Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a) The Surviving Corporation shall provide or cause to be provided
to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continues as an
employee of the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries following the Closing Date (a " _Continuing Employee_ "), (i)
for a period extending until the earlier of the termination of such Continuing
Employee's employment with such entities or the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, a base wage or salary that is no less than that provided to
such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii)
for a period extending until the earlier of the termination of such
Continuing Employee's employment with such entities or the last day of the
fiscal year of Parent in which the Closing Date occurs, (A) incentive
compensation opportunities (excluding equity-based incentive compensation
opportunities) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and (B) all other compensation and employee benefits (excluding salary, base
wage, and incentive compensation opportunities) that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to each
Continuing Employee under the Company Benefit Plans as in effect at the
Effective Time. The provisions of this _Section 6.8_ shall not be construed
or interpreted to restrict in any way the Surviving Corporation's or Parent's
ability to amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan (including to
change the entities who administer such Company Benefit Plans, or the manner
in which such Company Benefit Plans are administered) or any other plan made
available to the Continuing Employees or to terminate any person's employment
at any time and for any reason.

(b) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to: (i)
waive any applicable pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting periods
with respect to participation and coverage requirements in any replacement or
successor welfare benefit plan of Parent or the Surviving Corporation that an
employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is eligible to participate
in immediately following the Effective Time to the extent such exclusions or
waiting periods were inapplicable to, or had been satisfied by,
each Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time under the
relevant Company Benefit Plan in which such employee participated; (ii)
provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and
deductible paid prior to the Effective Time (to the same extent such credit
was given under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective
Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements;
and (iii) to the extent that any Continuing Employee is eligible to
participate in any employee benefit plan of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their subsidiaries following the Effective Time, cause such plan to
recognize the service of such Continuing Employee with the Company and its
subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting, vacation entitlement and severance benefits (but not for
benefit accrual under any defined benefit or for any purpose under any
retiree welfare plan) to the same extent such service was recognized by the
Company and its subsidiaries under any similar Company Benefit Plan in which
such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective
Time; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent it would
result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of service or with
respect to any newly established employee benefit of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their subsidiaries for which service is not taken into
account for employees of Parent or any of its Affiliates.

  



  

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.8(a)_, with
respect to any Continuing Employee whose employment is terminated by Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries on or prior
to the first anniversary of the Effective Time without cause (with "cause"
determined based on the standards customarily applied by Parent with respect
to Parent's policies and practices), Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall provide or cause to be provided to each such Continuing
Employee severance benefits no less than the severance benefits that
similarly situated employees of Parent are entitled to receive upon a
severance eligible termination under the severance policies and practices of
Parent as in effect as of the Effective Time; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
if any such Continuing Employee is entitled to severance benefits under an
individual severance, employment or similar agreement, the terms of such
agreement and not this _Section 6.8(c)_ shall govern.

  



  

(d) If requested by Parent in writing not later than ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
such actions as are necessary, including the adoption of board of directors
or compensation committee resolutions or consents, to terminate the Company's
401(k) plan(s), effective no later than the day immediately prior to the
Effective Time (or if the Company is expected to become an ERISA Affiliate of
Parent at the Acceptance Time, no later than the day immediately prior to the
Acceptance Time), with such termination to be subject to the occurrence of
the Effective Time or Acceptance Time, as applicable. Prior to taking such
action, the Company shall provide Parent with copies of the relevant materials
in connection with such plan termination, which shall be subject to Parent's
review and comment, and prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide
parent with evidence that such plan(s) have been terminated. Parent shall
cause the 401(k) plans of Parent or its Affiliates to accept as soon as
practicable rollover distributions from current and former employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to such individuals' account
balances (including loans), if elected by any such individuals.

(e) The Company shall consult with Parent (and consider in good
faith the advice of Parent) prior to the Company sending any mass
written notices or other mass communication materials (including any postings
to any website) with respect to matters described in this  _Section 6.8_
(and, for avoidance of doubt, not including any compensation or benefits
matters not related to the Merger) to the employees or former employees of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries, but excluding any mass written notices

Section 9.3 _Interpretation: Certain Definitions_. The parties
have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.
Consequently, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an
Article, Section, Annex or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article or
Section of, or an Annex or Exhibit to, this Agreement, unless otherwise
indicated. The table of contents and headings for this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and
"hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of
this Agreement. The words "made available to Parent" and words of similar
import refer to information posted to the electronic data room for Project
Checker hosted by RR Donnelly and maintained by the Company for purposes of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Data Room_ ") or
otherwise delivered to Parent or a Representative of Parent (including by
email or by specific identification of filing or exhibit to a filing

instrument that is referred to herein means such statute as from time to time
amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of statutes) by

owned subsidiaries" of the Company shall include any subsidiary of which the
Company owns, directly or indirectly, all of the equity interests.

  



  

Section 9.4 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the Offer and the Merger is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as

mutually acceptable manner in order that the Offer and the Merger be

any rights or remedies hereunder. The representations and warranties in this
Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for
the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in

Section 9.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without

Section 9.8 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that

accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The
parties acknowledge and agree that the parties shall be entitled to an

remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties
agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that any other party has
an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an

(a) Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company hereby submits

manner provided by Law.

material respects only as of such time), (C) the representations and
warranties of the Company contained in _Section 4.9(ii)_ (No Company Material

and warranties that by their terms address matters only as of another
specified time, which shall be required to be true and correct in all respects
only as of such time), and (D) all of the remaining representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in the Agreement, without giving effect to

(iii) the Company shall have breached or failed to perform or to
comply with, in any material respect, any material agreement or covenant to
be performed or complied with by it under the Agreement on or prior to the
Acceptance Time and such breach or failure shall not have been waived by
Parent or Acquisition Sub or cured by the Company;

  



  

(iv) since the date of the Agreement, a Company Material Adverse
Effect (or any event, development or circumstance that would reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect) shall have occurred and shall be continuing as of the
Expiration Date;

  



  

(v) Acquisition Sub shall have failed to receive a certificate of the
Company, executed by an authorized officer of the Company, dated as of
the Expiration Date, to the effect that none of the conditions set forth in
paragraphs (c)(ii), (c)(iii) or (c)(iv) of this _Annex I_ have occurred; or

  



  

(vi) the Company Board shall have withdrawn or modified (including by

The foregoing conditions, other than the Minimum Condition and the
Termination Condition, are for the sole benefit of Parent and Acquisition Sub
and may be asserted by Parent or Acquisition Sub regardless of the
circumstances giving rise to any such conditions and may be waived by Parent
or Acquisition Sub in writing in whole or in part at any time and from time
to time in their sole discretion, in each case subject to the terms of the
Agreement. Any reference in this _Annex I_ or the Agreement to a condition or
requirement being satisfied shall be deemed to be satisfied if such condition
or requirement is so waived. The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to,
and not a limitation of, the rights of Parent and Acquisition Sub to extend,
terminate, amend and/or modify the Offer pursuant to the terms and conditions
of the Agreement. The failure by Parent or Acquisition Sub at any time to
exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such
right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be
asserted at any time and from time to time.
