_ Section  2.04_ _Conversion of Capital Stock._ Subject to the  provisions
of this Agreement, at the Effective Time:

 

 

(a)   Each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock that does not
qualify  as a Dissenting Share or is not cancelled pursuant to Section
2.04(b)  ( _" Participating Company Common Stock"_) shall, ipso facto and
without  any action on the part of any holder thereof, become and be
converted into  the  right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration
from either the Buyer or  from NewCo or its successor. No interest shall
accrue or be payable  with respect to the Per Share Merger Consideration. At
and after the  Effective Time, each Company Certificate representing share(s)
of Participating  Company Common Stock, until surrendered as provided in
Section 2.06 hereof,  shall represent only the right to receive from either
the Buyer or from NewCo  or  its successor the Per Share Merger
Consideration with respect to each share  of  Participating Company Common
Stock represented thereby.

 

 

(b)   Each share of issued and outstanding Company Common Stock owned of
record  immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Company, the Buyer or
NewCo  or  any of their respective Subsidiaries, including treasury stock,
shall be  canceled and retired, and no cash or other consideration shall be
payable with  respect thereto; _provided, however,_ that shares of Company
Common Stock  owned of record immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Company, the  Buyer or NewCo or any of their respective Subsidiaries (i) in a
fiduciary  or similar capacity ( _" Trust Account Shares"_) or (ii) in
respect of  a debt previously contracted ( _" DPC Shares"_) shall not be
cancelled and  retired as provided above.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c)   Each issued and outstanding share of the common stock of NewCo shall,
ipso  facto  and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
become and be  converted into one (1) issued and outstanding share of the
common stock of  the Surviving Corporation ( _" Surviving Corporation Common
Stock"_), and  all of such shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock shall
be owned by  the  Buyer. The certificates representing share(s) of common
stock of  NewCo issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time of the  Merger shall be deemed to represent an identical number of
shares of Surviving  Corporation Common Stock.

 

 

_ Section 2.05._ _Deposit  of Payment Amount._ At the Effective Time, the

the Payment Amount  to be deposited in an account, segregated from all other
accounts, for the  benefit of the holders of Company Certificates (the _"
Payment Account"_),  for exchange in accordance with this Article II. Any
interest  earned on the Payment Account shall accrue and be paid to the 
Buyer. If a former shareholder of the Company becomes a Participating 
Shareholder after the Effective Time, the Buyer shall deliver, or cause to 
be  delivered, on the date the Surviving Corporation or its successor
receives  actual notice of such former shareholder's status as a
Participating  Shareholder, an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Merger
Consideration  multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such  former shareholder's Company Certificate(s) to the
Paying Agent to be deposited  in the Payment Account. The Buyer or NewCo
shall be responsible for paying  all  fees and expenses of the Paying Agent.

 

 

_ Section 2.06._ _Exchange  of Shares._ (a) Promptly after the receipt of
Shareholder  Approval (but not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the
Effective  Time), the Company shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
cause its  exchange or transfer agent to deliver to the Buyer, in an
electronic format  satisfactory to the Buyer, a list, certified by such
exchange or transfer agent,  of each then holder of Company Common Stock that
does not constitute a  Dissenting Share (each, a _" Participating
Shareholder"_) setting forth  (i) the legal name of each such Participating
Shareholder, (ii) the  number of shares of Company Common Stock held by each
such Participating  Shareholder, (iii) the social security number or other
Tax identification  number of each such Participating Shareholder, (iv) a
list of each Company  Certificate held by each such Participating
Shareholder, setting forth  (A) the certificate number of each such Company
Certificate, (B) the  number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by

Company Certificate,  (v) the most recent address of each such Participating
Shareholder  according to the books and records of the Company or its
exchange or transfer  agent and (vi) any other information with respect to
such Participating  Shareholders reasonably requested by the Buyer or its
Representatives (the  _" Participating Shareholder List"_). From time to time
after  delivery of the Participating Shareholder List through the Closing
Date, the  Company shall supplement or amend the Participating Shareholder
List promptly  after it becomes aware of any fact or the occurrence of any
event (including  any  transfer of shares of Company Common Stock or a
shareholder of the Company  becoming a Participating Shareholder by losing or
withdrawing dissenter's or  appraisal rights under the applicable provisions
of the WBCL) which would render  the Participating Shareholder List
inaccurate or incomplete in any  respect.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  (b) Subject to the Buyer's receipt of the Participating Shareholder List, 
the Buyer shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause the Paying
Agent,  as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no
event  later than three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time), to send
via  regular U.S. mail to each holder of a Company Certificate(s) which
immediately  prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common
Stock (other  than the Buyer, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries with respect  to shares held by such entities other than Trust
Account Shares and DPC  Shares): (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall be
prepared by  the Buyer, shall specify that delivery shall be effected and
risk of loss and  title to any Company Certificates shall pass only upon
actual delivery of the  same to the Paying Agent, and shall be in such form
and contain such other  provisions as the Buyer deems necessary or desirable
for use in effecting the  surrender of the Company Certificates (the _"
Letter of Transmittal"_),  (ii) instructions for completing the Letter of
Transmittal and effecting  the surrender of the Company Certificates pursuant
to the provisions of this  Agreement and (iii) other appropriate materials
required to complete the  exchange of the Company Certificates pursuant to
this  Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer shall provide the 
Company with a reasonable opportunity to review the form Letter of
Transmittal  and instructions thereto.

 

 

  (c) Upon proper surrender of a Company Certificate for exchange and 
cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with the applicable Letter of 
Transmittal and related materials, in each case as duly executed and
properly  completed, the holder of such Company Certificate shall be entitled
to receive  from the Paying Agent in exchange for each share represented
thereby the Per  Share Merger Consideration, and the Company Certificate so
surrendered shall  forthwith be canceled. No interest shall accrue or be paid
on the  consideration payable upon the surrender of any Company Certificate
for the  benefit of the holder of such Company Certificate. If payment of 
consideration pursuant hereto is to be made to a Person other than the
Person  in  whose name the surrendered Company Certificate is registered on
the stock  transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment
that the  Company Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or
otherwise  be in  proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting
such payment shall  have  paid all transfer and other Taxes required by
reason of the payment of such  consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Company  Certificate surrendered or shall have
established to the satisfaction of the  Buyer and the Paying Agent that such
taxes either have been paid or are not  applicable.

 

 

(d)   If any holder of a Company Certificate requests payment by means of a
wire  transfer in his, her or its duly executed and completed Letter of
Transmittal,  the Paying Agent shall make payment of the consideration such
Person is entitled  to hereunder by wire transfer in accordance with such
request and the cost  of  any such wire transfer sent pursuant to such
request shall be charged to the  account of and deducted from the proceeds
paid to such Person  hereunder.

 

 

  (e) The Buyer, NewCo, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent
shall  be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable  pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as the Buyer, NewCo and the
Surviving  Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold
with respect  to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision
of state, local  or foreign Tax Law or Order. To the extent that amounts are
so  withheld by the Buyer, NewCo, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent,  such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as  having been paid to the holders of the shares of Company Common
Stock in respect  to whom such deduction and withholding was made by the
Buyer, NewCo, the  Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  (f) At any time following the expiration of the sixth (6th) month after

shall  be entitled to any funds which have not been disbursed to former
holders of  shares of Company Common Stock (including, without limitation,
all interest  and  other income in respect of the Per Share Merger
Consideration), and thereafter  such holders shall be entitled to look to the
Surviving Corporation or its  successor in interest (subject to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or  similar Laws) only as general creditors
thereof with respect to any  consideration that may be payable upon due
surrender of the Company Certificates  held by them.

 

 

  (g) From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the 
stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock
which  were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective  Time.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of shares of  Company Common
Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares  except as
otherwise provided herein or by applicable Law. If, after  the Effective
Time, any Company Certificate representing such share(s) of  Company Common
Stock is presented for transfer to the Surviving Corporation  or  the Paying
Agent, such Company Certificate shall be canceled and exchanged  as 
provided in this Article II.

 

 

  (h) Neither the Buyer, NewCo nor the Company nor any of their successors 
or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of
Company  Common Stock for any shares or any dividends or distributions with
respect  thereto or any consideration delivered in respect of any such shares
properly  delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property,  escheat or similar Laws.

 

 

  (i) In the event any Company Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or 
destroyed, upon receipt of appropriate evidence as to such loss, theft or 
destruction and to the ownership of such Company Certificate by the Person 
claiming such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and the 
receipt by the Buyer and the Paying Agent of appropriate and customary 
indemnification, the owner of such Company Certificate shall be entitled to 
the  payment of the consideration such Person would be entitled to hereunder
if  such  Person surrendered such Company Certificate to the Paying Agent as
provided  herein.

 

 

_ Section 2.07._ _Employee  Stock Options._ (a) Prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall take or  cause to be taken such action as is necessary: (i)

other equity-related plans  of the Company, including the Merchants and
Manufacturers Bancorporation, Inc.  1996 Incentive Stock Option Plan and the
Merchants and Manufacturers  Bancorporation, Inc. 2006 Stock Incentive Plan
(collectively, the _" Company  Stock Option Plans"_) to be accelerated and
become exercisable in full  effective immediately prior to the Effective
Time; (ii) to effectuate the  termination upon the Effective Time of all
Stock Options outstanding at such  time (without regard to the exercise price
of such Stock Options); and (iii)  to  cause, pursuant to the Company Stock
Option Plans, each outstanding Stock Option  to represent upon the Effective
Time solely the right to receive, in accordance  with this Section 2.07, a
lump sum cash payment in the amount of the Option  Consideration, if any,
with respect to such Stock Option and to no longer  represent the right to
purchase Company Common Stock or any other equity  security of the Company,
the Buyer, NewCo, the Surviving Corporation or any  other Person or any other
consideration.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14  

 

 

 

 

 

 

  (b) Each holder of a Stock Option shall receive from the Buyer or from 
NewCo or its successor, in respect and in consideration of each Stock Option 
so  cancelled, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective
Time,  an  amount equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the
Per  Share Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price per share of
such  Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of
Company  Common Stock covered by such Stock Option (whether or not then
vested or  exercisable), without any interest thereon (the " _Option 
Consideration_ "), which cash payment shall be treated as compensation  and
shall be net of any applicable federal or state withholding tax;  _provided,
however,_ the payment of the Option Consideration shall be  conditioned on an
option-holder executing an acknowledgment that the Option  Consideration
represents the full amount due for all Stock Options held by  such  option-
holder. In the event that the exercise price of any Stock  Option is equal to
or greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration, the  Option Consideration
for such Stock Option shall be zero and such Stock Option  shall be cancelled
and have no further force or effect.

 

 

  (c) As soon as reasonably practicable following the execution of this 
Agreement, the Company shall mail to each Person who is a holder of Stock 
Options a letter describing the treatment of and payment for such Stock
Options  pursuant to this Section 2.07 and providing instructions for use in
obtaining  payment for such Stock Options.

 

 

  (d) The Company hereby represents and warrants to the Buyer that the 
maximum number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to issuance
pursuant  to  the exercise of Stock Options is not and shall not be at or
prior to the  Effective Time more than 100,113 **** shares.

 

 

_ Section 2.08._ _Dissenting  Shares._ The holder of any Dissenting Share
shall have the  rights, subject to the limitations, provided by the

or otherwise affect the Buyer's right to terminate this Agreement  pursuant
to Section 8.01(b)(iv) hereof)

conducted  heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and request
the return  or  destruction of all confidential information regarding the

promptly (but in any case within one (1) Business Day) advise the Buyer of 
the  receipt, directly or indirectly, of any Acquisition Proposal (including
a  summary of the material terms and conditions thereof to the extent the

meetings  that are designated for the discussion of the terms of or

information  provided to its directors in connection with all such meetings,
and shall  provide any other financial reports or other analysis prepared for

discretion (each, a _" Title  Commitment"_);

 

 

(ii)   Legible copies of all documents cited, raised as exceptions or noted
with  respect to each Real Property in the applicable Title Commitment ( _"
Title  Documents"_); and

 

 

(iii)  A  survey of each Real Property prepared in accordance with current
ALTA/ACSM  land  survey standards by Bock and Clark, or another registered
land surveyor agreed  to in writing by the Buyer and the Company and licensed
in the state in which  such Real Property is located (the _" Surveyor"_),

shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts  to cure all objections relating to
each Buyer's Objection Notice.

reasonably promptly  after receipt of any invoice therefor.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

57  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

_ Section 6.03._ _Environmental  Reports._ (a) As soon as reasonably
practicable after the date  hereof, the Buyer may engage, or cause to be
engaged, an environmental  consultant or contractor reasonably satisfactory
to the Company to conduct  a  preliminary environmental assessment ( _"
Phase I"_) of any real  properties (including the improvements thereto) owned
by the Company or its  Subsidiaries (including for the avoidance of doubt
OREO), that the Buyer deems  appropriate or desirable (such determination to
be made by the Buyer in its  sole  discretion) to, among other things,
investigate the possible presence of an  Environmental Condition. The costs
and expenses associated with the  Phase I's performed pursuant to this
Section 6.03 shall be split  equally by the Buyer and the Company, paid by
each party as incurred reasonably  promptly after receipt of any invoice
therefor. With respect to each  such property on which a Phase I is performed
(each, a _" Phase I  Property"_), the Buyer shall a have a period of ten (10)
Business Days  from its receipt of the complete Phase I report (each, a _"
Phase I  Review Period"_) in which to review and examine such Phase I
report  and, if in the reasonable opinion of the environmental consultant or
contractor  that conducted the Phase I, any Environmental Condition is found,
reasonably  suspected or reasonably indicated by such Phase I report, to
deliver to the  Company, at the Buyer's election, notice of such
Environmental Condition (each,  a _" Phase II Notice"_). Upon the Company's
receipt of a  Phase II Notice, the Company shall use Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to  reasonably promptly engage, or cause to be engaged, an
environmental consultant  or contractor reasonably acceptable to the Buyer to
perform a physical  examination and investigation of each Environmental
Condition listed on the  Phase II Notice (each, a _" Phase II"_). The fees
and  expenses of the consultant or contractor with respect to any Phase II
shall  be split equally by the Buyer and the Company, paid by each party as
incurred  reasonably promptly after receipt of any invoice therefor. The 
subject, scope, manner and method of any Phase II will be subject to the 
Buyer's prior review and reasonable approval. At all times the Buyer  shall
have access to all field data, analytical data and analytical results 
obtained or generated in connection with a Phase II. Upon the  Company's
receipt of a final written report with respect to a Phase II, the  Company
shall promptly deliver to the Buyer a copy of such Phase II report  and all
written reports, analytical data, correspondence, notices or other  materials
relating thereto (collectively, each a _" Phase II  Report"_).

 

 

  (b) In the event a Phase II Report identifies an Environmental  Condition
with respect to a Phase I Property, the Company shall use  Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to promptly obtain from the environmental  consultants or
contractors that performed the Phase II on such Phase I  Property a good
faith estimate (reasonably acceptable to the parties) of the  cost and
expense necessary in order to respond to such Environmental Condition  (a _"
Response Estimate"_) based upon the standard that would reasonably  be
required to obtain closure, a no action letter, an offsite letter or a 
determination of no liability with regard to the Environmental Condition
from  a  Governmental Entity with jurisdiction based on the present use of
the  Phase I Property. For purposes of illustration and  clarification, an
Environmental Condition does not arise or exist, and does  not  require a
response, by virtue of the presence of a Hazardous Substance if  applicable
Environmental Law would permit the Hazardous Substance to remain  on,  in,
at, under or from the applicable Phase I Property. For example  and without
limitation, the parties acknowledge and agree that the presence  of  any
Hazardous Substance in, around or under a capped surface such as, by way 
of  example and not limitation, a floor slab, driveway or sidewalk that does
not  pose a significant risk to human health or the environment does not
require  a  response, in each case if applicable Environmental Law would
permit the  Hazardous Substance to remain in such state. The parties
acknowledge  and agree that such Response Estimate with regard to the
Environmental  Conditions shall permit, to the extent allowed by applicable
Environmental  Law  (i) institutional controls (such as web-based GIS
registrations and deed  notices or restrictions) and (ii) Hazardous
Substances to remain on, in,  at, under or from the Phase I Property. The
parties further  acknowledge and agree that neither non-friable asbestos in
good repair nor  mold  constitutes an Environmental Condition requiring a
Response  Estimate. The costs and expenses of the consultant or contractor

shall not be required to call or hold  the Shareholders Meeting until (i)
either the final determination of the  Aggregate Response Estimate Amount or

of Directors  of the Company will not condition its submission of this

provided for  herein.

 

 

  (b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee

in  a manner adverse to the Buyer, the approval, adoption or recommendation
by  such  Board of Directors or such committee of this Agreement or any
transaction  contemplated hereby (including the Merger and the Plan of
Merger), except as  provided in Section 5.04 hereof. If the recommendation of
the  Board of Directors of the Company shall have been withdrawn or modified
as  provided in Section 5.04, the Company may postpone or cancel the 
Shareholders Meeting if, but only if, after consultation with the Company's 
outside legal counsel, the Board of Directors of the Company determines in 
good  faith by a majority vote that it is required to do so in order to act
in a  manner consistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

59  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  (b) The Buyer covenants and agrees that none of the information provided 
by it with respect to the Buyer or its Subsidiaries to be included in the
Proxy  Statement will, at the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement or
any  amendments or supplements thereto, and at the time of the Shareholders
Meeting,  contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material  fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements  therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not  misleading.

 

 

  (c) The Company, the Buyer and NewCo shall cooperate and consult with
each  other in preparation of the Proxy Statement, and the Company will
provide the  Buyer a reasonable opportunity for review and comment on the
Proxy Statement  prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and the Proxy
Statement shall be  mutually satisfactory to the Buyer and the Company.
Without limiting  the generality of the foregoing, each of the Buyer and
NewCo will furnish to  the  Company the information relating to it required
by the Exchange Act and the  rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to
be set forth in the Proxy  Statement. Each of the Company and the Buyer shall
promptly (i)  notify the other of the receipt of any comments from the SEC
with respect to  the  Proxy Statement and of any request by the SEC for
amendments of, or supplements  to, the Proxy Statement, and (ii) provide the
other with copies of all filings  made with the SEC and all correspondence
between the Company and the SEC with  respect to the Proxy Statement. The
Company shall use Commercially  Reasonable Efforts to respond to and resolve
all comments from the SEC with  respect to the Proxy Statement as promptly as
reasonably  practicable.

 

 

  (d) As promptly as reasonably practicable after (i) the Proxy Statement 
has been cleared by the SEC and (ii) either the final determination of the 
Aggregate Response Estimate Amount or the Buyer's agreement in writing that
no  amount of any Response Estimate shall be deducted from the Per Share
Merger  Consideration, the Company shall mail the Proxy Statement to the
holders of  Company Common Stock and, unless the Board of Directors of the
Company withdraws  or modifies the Company Board Recommendation in accordance
with Sections 5.04  and 6.04 hereof, shall use Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to solicit proxies  and votes in favor of the approval and adoption
of this Agreement and the  transactions contemplated hereby (including the
Merger and the Plan of  Merger). If at any time prior to the Effective Time
any event or  circumstance relating to the Company or the Buyer or any of
either the Company  or Buyer\'s Subsidiaries, or their respective officers or
directors, should  be  discovered by the Company or the Buyer, respectively,
which, pursuant to the  Securities Act or Exchange Act, should be set forth
in an amendment or a  supplement to the Proxy Statement, such party shall
promptly inform the  other. Each of the Buyer, NewCo and the Company agree to
correct any  information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement which
shall have  become false or misleading. All documents that each of the
Company  and the Buyer is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection
with the  transactions contemplated hereby will comply as to form in all
material  respects, and will be distributed to the Shareholders in compliance
with all  applicable Law.

consult with each  other before issuing any other press release or otherwise
making any other  public statement with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions  contemplated hereby and will not issue any such press release
or make any such  public statement prior to obtaining the consent of the
other; _provided,  however,_ that such consent shall not be required where
such release or  public statement is required by applicable Law (including
the rules and  regulations of the SEC) or in accordance with any actions
required to be taken  pursuant to this Agreement.

_ Section 6.07._ _Legal  Requirements._ Except as otherwise provided herein,
the Buyer,  NewCo and the Company will take all reasonable actions necessary
or desirable  to  comply promptly with all legal requirements which may be
imposed on them with  respect to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement  (including obtaining all consents from any
third party required to fully effect  the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and furnishing all information  required in connection with
approvals by or filings with any Governmental  Entity, and prompt resolution
of any litigation prompted hereby) and will  promptly and reasonably
cooperate with and furnish information to any party  hereto necessary in
connection with any such filings with or investigations  by  any
Governmental Entity and any other such requirements imposed upon any of 
them  or their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the consummation of

each of the directors  and  officers of the Company and each of the
Company\'s Subsidiaries after the Closing  Date substantially the same
coverage against personal liability for actions  taken after the Closing Date
as is provided to directors and officers of the  Buyer. The Buyer further
agrees to cause the Company, or its  successor in interest, for a period of
six (6) years after the Closing Date  to indemnify the current and past
directors and officers of the Company and  each  of the Company\'s
Subsidiaries for all actions taken by them prior to the Closing  Date in
their respective capacities as directors and officers of the Company  and 
each such Subsidiary to the same extent as the indemnification provided by 
the  Company and each such Subsidiary to such directors and officers
immediately  prior to the Closing Date.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

61  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  (b) The Buyer agrees that for a period of six (6) years after the Closing 
Date, the Buyer shall cause to be maintained in effect the Company's and each
of  the Banks' current policies (as in effect on the Closing Date) of
directors' and  officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company with
respect to actions  and omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing Date,
subject to the  following conditions:

 

 

(i)  The  Company's and the each of the Banks' current directors' and
officers' liability  insurer shall agree to maintain such coverage from and
after the Closing  Date. In the event such insurer terminates or declines to
continue  such coverage after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall use
Commercially  Reasonable Efforts, with the cooperation of the former
directors and officers  of  the Company, to identify and obtain or cause to
be obtained similar coverage  from another insurance carrier of substantially
similar size and reputation  to  that of such former insurer, if such
coverage is reasonably obtainable from  the  marketplace. If after such
Commercially Reasonable Efforts another  such insurance carrier is unable or
unwilling to provide such similar coverage,  the Buyer shall obtain or cause
to be obtained the best coverage available,  in  the reasonable judgment of
the Buyer, for a cost up to but not exceeding the  Maximum Amount.

 

 

(ii)   The Buyer may substitute or cause to be obtained therefor policies of
at least  the same coverage and amount containing terms and conditions which
are  substantially no less advantageous.

 

 

(iii)   In no event shall the Buyer be obligated to expend or cause to be
expended,  in  order to maintain or provide insurance coverage pursuant to
this  Section 6.11(b), any amount, in the aggregate, in excess of  $200,000
**** (the _" Maximum Amount"_).

 

 

(iv)   Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall notify the appropriate
directors' and officers' liability insurers of the Merger and of all pending
or, to the  Knowledge of the Company, Threatened Proceedings asserted or
claimed against  any  officer or director of the Company or any Bank, in
accordance with the terms  and  conditions of the applicable policies.

 

 

(v)   When the amount of the aggregate premiums paid to maintain or procure
such  insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, then, notwithstanding
any other  provision contained herein, the Buyer's obligations under this
Section 6.10(b)  shall cease.

 

 

(vi)   The Company and its directors and officers shall use reasonable and
diligent  efforts to cooperate with the Buyer in obtaining the above-
described insurance  coverages.

 

 

_ Section  6.11._ _Notification of Certain Other  Matters_. (a) Each party
shall use Commercially Reasonable  Efforts to give prompt notice to the other
party of (i) the occurrence or  failure to occur of any event or the
discovery of any information, which  occurrence, failure or discovery would
be likely to cause any representation  or  warranty on its part contained in
this Agreement to be untrue, inaccurate or  incomplete in any material
respect after the date hereof or, in case of any  representation or warranty
given as of a specific date, would be likely to  cause  any such
representation or warranty on its part contained in this Agreement  to  be
untrue, inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect as of such specific 
date; (ii) any failure of such party to comply with or satisfy in any 
material respect any covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied 
by  it hereunder; and (iii) any event or series of events which creates a 
Material Adverse Effect.

any  of  its representations and warranties contained in Article IV hereto
relating  to the period after the date hereof by delivering a supplemental
Disclosure  Statement ( _" Supplemental Disclosure Statement"_) to the Buyer
with  respect to any matter hereafter arising which, to the Company's
Knowledge, would  render any such representation or warranty after the date
of this Agreement  inaccurate or incomplete, in any material respect.

 

 

_ Section  6.12._ _Regulatory Applications_. The Buyer shall file as 
promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement (but

applications, notices, requests for authorization or other documents  with
the appropriate federal, state or foreign bank regulatory authorities, 
including OSFI, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board, the WDFI Division of 
Banking and the IDB, necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated

Merger  (the _" Regulatory Applications"_). The Company shall cooperate  and
assist (and shall cause each Subsidiary of the Company to cooperate and 
assist) with the Buyer in all respects with respect to the preparation and 
filing of all Regulatory Applications. The Buyer shall respond as  promptly
as reasonably practicable to all inquiries received concerning the 
Regulatory Applications and shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
satisfy  all conditions that may be required for the approval or
authorization of the  Regulatory Applications; _provided, however,_ that the
Buyer shall have  no obligation to accept non-standard conditions or
restrictions with respect  to  the approval or authorization of the
Regulatory Applications if it shall  reasonably be determined by the Buyer
that such conditions or restrictions  would  create a Material Adverse
Effect with respect to the Company or the Buyer or  materially **** lessen
the benefits of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement. In the
event of an adverse or  unfavorable determination by any Governmental Entity,
or in the event the Merger  is challenged or opposed by any Proceeding,
whether by the United States  Department of Justice or otherwise, the Buyer
and the Company shall cooperate  in  determining whether or to what extent
to seek appeal or review, administrative  or otherwise, or other appropriate
remedies shall be made consistent with their  obligations in Section 6.09.
The Buyer shall deliver a final copy of  the public portions of all

are filed with the appropriate Governmental  Entity. The Buyer shall advise
the Company periodically of the status  of the Regulatory Applications upon
request.

 

 

_ Section 6.13._ _Control  of the Company 's Business_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement  shall give the Buyer, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct  the  operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
prior to the Effective  Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
exercise,  consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete control  and  supervision over its and its Subsidiaries'
operations.

action  necessary to terminate the Company Stock Option Plans, the Company's
401(k)  Salary Saving Plan (the _" Company 401(k) Plan"_) and any other
Company  Qualified Plan (collectively, the _" Termination Plans"_) effective
as of  immediately prior to the Closing Date. Prior to the Closing Date,
the  Company shall be permitted to make such changes to any Termination Plan
as  it  deems appropriate to carry out the provisions of this  Section

employed by the Buyer or a Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Buyer after the 
Closing (each, a _" Continuing Employee"_) shall receive credit for the  time
he or she was employed dating to their most recent hire date by the Company 
or a Subsidiary of the Company prior to the Closing Date; _provided,
however, _ a Continuing Employee shall not receive credit for the time he
or  she was  employed by the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company prior to
the Closing  Date  for purposes of determining benefit service or benefit
accrual under the defined  benefit retirement plans and retiree health plans
of the Buyer or a Subsidiary  or Affiliate of the Buyer in which such
Continuing Employee is entitled to  participate after the Closing Date. After
the Closing Date, neither  the Buyer nor any Subsidiary nor Affiliate of the
Buyer shall impose and they  shall cause to be waived, except with respect to
short and long term disability  coverage for Continuing Employees who have
been employed by the Company or  a  Subsidiary of the Company for less than
six (6) months prior to the Closing  Date, any eligibility waiting period or
pre-existing condition limitation or  exclusion for any health benefit or
other insurance or insurance-type plan  in  which any Continuing Employee
(or the spouse or eligible dependent of any  Continuing Employee) is entitled
to participate and, to the extent that the  initial period of coverage for
any Continuing Employees under any self-insured  medical health benefit plan
that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" as  defined in Section 3(1) of
ERISA is not a full 12-month period of coverage,  such Continuing Employees
shall be given credit under the applicable  self-insured medical health
benefit plan for any deductibles by such Continuing  Employees under the
Company medical health benefit plan during the balance  of  such 12-month
period of coverage. After the Closing Date, Continuing  Employees shall be
eligible to participate in the employee benefit plans of  the  Buyer subject
to the terms, conditions, and overall administration of such  plans 
applicable to similarly situated employees.

 

 

  (d) Except as provided in the agreements disclosed in Schedule 
4.21(a)(ii) of the Disclosure Statement, notwithstanding anything to the 
contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event shall the Company, the
Buyer,  the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
take any  action or make any payments that would result, either individually
or in the  aggregate, in the payment of a "parachute payment" within the
meaning of Code  Section 280G or that would result, either individually or in
the aggregate,  in payments that would be nondeductible pursuant to Code 
Section 162(m). The Company and the Buyer shall use Commercially  Reasonable
Efforts to resolve matters relating to any of the  foregoing.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

64  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  (e) No provision of this Section 6.14 shall create any third party 
beneficiary rights in any employee or former employee (including any
beneficiary  or dependent thereof) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in respect  of  continued employment (or resumed employment) with the Buyer
or any of its  Affiliates and no provision of this Section 6.14 shall create
such rights  in any such Persons in respect of any benefits that may be
provided, directly  or  indirectly, under any employee program or any plan
or arrangement which may  be  established by the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates. Neither this  Agreement nor any provision hereof shall be
construed as amending any employee  benefit plan or employee program or
arrangement or shall constitute a limitation  on the rights to amend, modify
or terminate after the Effective Time any such  plans, programs or
arrangements of the Buyer or any of its  Affiliates.

 

 

  (f) __ Prior to making any written communications to the  employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation  or benefit

each Person's name listed on Exhibit 6.14(g) attached hereto (each, a "
_Notice Recipient_ "), the Company hereby agrees to give each Notice 
Recipient notice that the term of the employment agreement listed next to
his  or  her name on Exhibit 6.14(g) shall expire pursuant to the terms set
forth in  such  employment agreement. Each such notice shall be given in

expiration of  such  employment agreement's term shall be subject to the
consummation of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company
shall use  its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to provide the Buyer a copy of
each notice  sent pursuant to this Section 6.14(g).

 

 

  (h) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof (but in  any
event within a reasonable time prior to the giving of notice of the 
Shareholders Meeting in accordance with the terms hereof), the Company shall 
take all action necessary to amend the Company 401(k) Plan to provide: (i) 
that  the participants will be entitled to direct the Company 401(k) Plan
fiduciaries  to vote the shares of Company Common Stock allocated to their
accounts at any  meeting or with respect to any action of the Shareholders of
the Company  (including the Shareholders Meeting) and (ii) that the shares of
Company Common  Stock held by the Company 401(k) Plan but unallocated to
participant accounts  and the Company Common Stock allocated to individual
accounts of participants  in  the Company 401(k) Plan for which such
participants do not provide timely voting  instructions with respect thereto
shall be voted by the plan fiduciaries in  the  same proportion (including
at the Shareholders Meeting, "FOR" or "AGAINST"  this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (including without  limitation the Merger
and the Plan of Merger) as those shares for which  participants provided
timely voting instructions.

  (i) For purposes of calculating the parachute payment subject to Code 
section 280G and the amount which may be paid under various employment 
agreements, the Buyer will exclude from the amount subject to Tax and any 
contractual restrictions, the non-competition payments for each affected 
employee equal to the amount of the employee\'s annual compensation
multiplied  by  the number of years (or fraction thereof) that such employee
is restricted  from  entering into competition with the Buyer or its
Affiliates or from soliciting  customers or others as provided in the
employee's employment  agreement. The Buyer will not restrict, reduce or
eliminate an  employee\'s right to payment under an employment related
agreement in order  to  avoid application of Code section 280G, unless a
restriction on payment is  required by the employee\'s employment agreement
and the payment is contingent  on  a change in control as described in Code
section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i).

Aggregate  Response Estimate Amount is greater than $3,500,000, then either
the Buyer  or  the Company may terminate this Agreement; _provided,
however,_ the  Company shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement
under this  Section 6.21(d) if the Buyer agrees in writing to limit the
aggregate  amount of the deductions to the Per Share Merger Consideration to
$2,000,000;  _provided, further,_ the Buyer shall not be entitled to
terminate this  Agreement pursuant to this Section 6.21(d) if the Company
agrees in writing  that  the aggregate amount of the deductions to the Per
Share Merger Consideration  shall not be limited to $2,000,000, but instead
shall be equal the entire amount  of the Aggregate Response Estimate Amount
(or such lesser amount agreed upon  in  writing by the parties) in excess of
$1,500,000.

 

 

  (e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the aggregate amount 
of the portion of the Aggregate Response Estimate Amount to be deducted from 
the  Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 6.21 (the _"
Purchase  Price Reduction Amount"_) shall be reduced by the aggregate amount
of any  Tax deductions which may be taken by the Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation or  any  of the Surviving Corporation\'s Subsidiaries solely in
respect of such Purchase  Price Reduction Amount assuming that the Buyer, the
Surviving Corporation or  the  Surviving Corporation\'s Subsidiaries can
utilize 100% of such Tax deductions  to  offset income that would otherwise
be subject to Tax at the assumed combined  marginal federal and state income
tax rate of thirty-five percent (35%).

herewith or therewith, and  each  and every right allowed it by law or
equity, shall be cumulative and may be  exercised from time to time. The
failure of any party at any time or  times to require performance of any
provision hereof shall in no manner affect  such party's right at a later
time to enforce the same. No waiver by  any party of a condition or of the
breach of any term, agreement, covenant,  representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement, whether by conduct  or  otherwise, in any one
or more instances shall be deemed to be or construed  as a  further or

agreement and shall become effective when one or  more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to  the  other party, it being
understood that all parties need not sign the same  counterpart.

 

 

_ Section 9.03._ _Entire  Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries._ This
Agreement and the  documents and instruments and other agreements among the
parties hereto as  contemplated by or referred to herein (a) constitute the
entire agreement  among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersede  all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, among the  parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and
(b) are not intended  to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies
hereunder; _provided,  however,_ (i) the respective Representatives of the

_ Section 9.04._ _Severability._ In  the event that any provision of this
Agreement or the application thereof  becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal,  void  or unenforceable, the remainder
of this Agreement will continue in full force  and effect and the application
of such provision to other Persons or  circumstances will be interpreted so
as reasonably to effect the intent of  the  parties hereto. The parties
further agree to replace such void or  unenforceable provision of this
Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision  that will achieve, to the
extent possible, the economic, business and other  purposes of such void or
unenforceable provision.

 

 

_ Section 9.05._ _Surviving  Provisions._ All representations, warranties,
covenants and  agreements of the parties in this Agreement shall not survive
after the Closing,  except that any provisions contained in this Agreement
which by their terms  survive or are to be performed after the Closing Date
shall survive for their  respective periods specified, or if no such period
is specified, for a  reasonable time under the circumstances.

 

 

_ Section 9.06._ _Other  Remedies; Specific Performance._ Except as otherwise
provided  herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a
party will be  deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred hereby  or  by Law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by
a party of any one remedy  will not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy. The parties  hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any of the  provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their  specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed  that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent  breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions  hereof in any court of the United
States of America or any state having  jurisdiction, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are  entitled at law or in equity.

 

 

_ Section 9.07._ _Assignment._ No  party may assign either this Agreement or
any of its rights, interests, or  obligations hereunder without the prior
written approval of the other  parties. Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement shall be  binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their  respective successors and permitted assigns.
Notwithstanding the  foregoing, the Buyer may assign any or all of its rights
and obligations under  this Agreement to any of its Affiliates (each a _"
Permitted Assignee"_)  upon not less than five (5) days prior written notice
to the  Company. The Buyer's assignment to a Permitted Assignee as 
contemplated hereby shall not release or relieve the Buyer from any
liability  under this Agreement. Contemporaneously with such assignment,
the  Permitted Assignee shall execute a counterpart of this Agreement and a 
certificate containing the representations and warranties set forth in 
Article III conformed to be applicable to such Permitted  Assignee.

governed by and  construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
