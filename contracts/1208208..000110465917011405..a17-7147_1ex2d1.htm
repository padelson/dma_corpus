"), MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates Ltd., a corporation organized under
the laws of British Columbia (" _Parent_ "), SSL MDA Holdings, Inc., a
Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merlin
Holdco_ ") and Merlin Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Merlin Holdco (" _Merger Sub_ ") (each of which entity is
a " _Party_ ", and collectively such entities are the " _Parties_ ").

 



 

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of the Company, Parent, Merlin
Holdco and Merger Sub have approved and declared advisable this Agreement and
the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the Company
continuing as the surviving corporation in such merger as an indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent (the " _Merger_ "), on the terms and subject to the
conditions provided for in this Agreement; and

 



 

WHEREAS, Parent, Merlin Holdco, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make
certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection
with the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, the Parties agree as
follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I** 
THE MERGER

 



 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to conditions of this
Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company to effectuate the Merger. Upon the
Merger, the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). The
Merger shall have the effects as provided in the applicable provisions of the
DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon the Merger, all
the rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation and all the obligations,
duties, debts and liabilities of the Company and Merger Sub shall be the
obligations, duties, debts and liabilities of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

Section 1.2 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
promptly as practicable on the Closing Date, Merger Sub and the Company will
cause an appropriate Certificate of Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ")
to be executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
(the " _Secretary of State_ ") in such form and executed as provided in the
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective on the date and at the time when the
Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State or,
subject to the DGCL, such later time as is agreed upon by the Parties and
specified in the Certificate of Merger, and such time is hereinafter referred
to as the " _Effective Time_."

 



 

Section 1.3 _Closing_. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and
the transactions contemplated herein abandoned pursuant to _Section 7.1_ and
subject to the

 



      
 

 



 

satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_, the
closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 9:00 a.m.,
Eastern Time, on a date to be specified by the Parties, which shall be no
later than the fifth Business Day after satisfaction or waiver (by the Party
entitled to waive the condition) of all of the conditions set forth in
_Article VI_ hereof (except for those conditions that by their nature cannot
be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
such conditions) (the " _Closing Date_ "), at the offices of Vinson and Elkins
LLP, 1001 Fannin Street, Suite 2500, Houston, Texas 77002, unless another
time, date and/or place is agreed to in writing by the Parties hereto.

 



 

Section 1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, (a)
the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall be
amended and restated to read in its entirety as set forth in _Exhibit A_ and,
as so amended and restated, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation, until thereafter duly amended as provided therein and
by applicable Law, and (b) the bylaws of the Company as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be amended and restated to read in their
entirety as set forth in _Exhibit B_ and, as so amended and restated, shall
be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter duly amended as
provided therein and by applicable Law.

 



 

Section 1.5 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation; Directors of
Parent and Merlin Holdco_.

 



 

(a) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving
Corporation until their successors shall have been duly elected or appointed

accordance with the Surviving Corporations Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws.

 



 

(b) The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their
earlier death, resignation or removal.

 



 

(c) At the Effective Time, the Parent Board shall appoint three (3)
individuals as mutually agreed upon in good faith by the Company and Parent
(each of whom must have been serving as a director of the Company Board as of
the date hereof) and reasonably approved by the Nominating and Governance
Committee of the Parent Board to serve, effective as of the Effective Time, on
the Parent Board (the " _Company Designees_ "). Parent shall take all actions
necessary so that at the Effective Time, the number of directors that will

(collectively, the " _Parent Board Committees_ ") and (ii) each Parent Board
Committee shall include at least one of the Company Designees.

 



 

(e) At the Effective Time, Parent shall cause Merlin Holdco to appoint two (2)
individuals who are Company Designees as mutually agreed upon in good faith by

respective Subsidiaries and except for any Dissenting Shares) shall, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted into the right to receive (i) cash in an amount equal to $17.50 (the
" _Cash Consideration_ ") and (ii) 0.3132 of a validly issued, fully paid and

share, of the Company (" _Company Convertible Preferred Stock_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of
Company Convertible Preferred Stock held directly or indirectly by Parent or
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries and except for any
Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration that the holder thereof would have been entitled to receive had
such holder, immediately prior to the Effective Time, converted such share of
Company Convertible Preferred Stock into Company Common Stock pursuant to and
in accordance with Section 3 of the Certificate of Designations, Preferences
and Rights of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company.

 



 

(c) All of the shares of Company Common Stock and Company Convertible
Preferred Stock converted into the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to
this _Article I_ shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of (i) a certificate (each
a " _Certificate_ ") previously representing any such shares of Company Common
Stock or Company Convertible Preferred Stock or (ii) non-certificated shares
of Company Common Stock or Company Convertible Preferred Stock represented by
book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall thereafter cease to have any rights
with respect to such securities, except the right to receive (A) the
applicable Merger Consideration, (B) any dividends and other distributions in
accordance with _Section 2.1(c)_ hereof, and (C) any cash to be paid in lieu
of any fractional Parent Common Shares in accordance with _Section 2.1(e)_
hereof.

 



 

(d) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of
Parent or the Company shall occur by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split or

 



      
 

 



 

combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon
with a record date during such period, appropriate adjustments shall be made
to the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration. Nothing in this
_Section 1.6(d)_ shall be construed to permit either Party to take any action
that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this
Agreement.

 



 

(e) At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Capital Stock that are owned
directly or indirectly (i) by the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist and no stock of Parent, cash or other
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor and (ii) by Parent or
any of the Parent Subsidiaries shall be converted into and become one fully
paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(f) Prior to the Closing, Merlin Holdco will transfer to Merger Sub an amount
equal to the aggregate Cash Consideration required to be paid pursuant to
_Section 1.6(a)_ and _Section 1.6(b)_ in consideration for the issuance by
Merger Sub to Merlin Holdco of 1,000 shares of the common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub.

 



 

(g) At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Merger Sub that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of preferred
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation having an
aggregate redemption amount and fair market value equal to the aggregate fair
market value of the converted Merger Sub common stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time (such fair market values to be determined by the board of
directors of Merlin Holdco in its discretion).

 



 

(h) At the Effective Time, (i) in consideration for, and in order to cause and
compensate Parent for, the issuance and delivery by Parent of the aggregate
Stock Consideration required to be issued and delivered pursuant to _Section
1.6(a)_ and _Section 1.6(b)_, Merlin Holdco will issue to Parent 100,000
shares of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merlin Holdco (the "
_Merlin Holdco Compensatory Shares_ "), and (ii) in consideration for, and in
order to cause and compensate Merlin Holdco for, the issuance by Merlin Holdco
to Parent of the Merlin Holdco Compensatory Shares, the Surviving Corporation
shall issue to Merlin Holdco 100,000 shares of the common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

Section 1.7 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) _Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each option granted by the Company
to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each a " _Company Option_ ")
pursuant to any stock option plan, program or arrangement of the Company,
including, without limitation, the Companys 2007 Employee Stock Option Plan,
the Earthwatch Incorporated 1999 Equity Incentive Plan, the GeoEye, Inc. 2010
Omnibus Incentive Plan, the 2006 Omnibus Stock and Performance Plan of
Orbimage Holdings Inc., and award agreements granted under either such plan
(collectively, the " _Company Equity Plans_ "), which is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or
unvested, shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive Option
Consideration (subject to applicable Tax withholding or other amounts required
by applicable Law to be withheld). For the avoidance of doubt, if the

 



      
 

 



 

Option Consideration for any Company Option is zero or a negative number, such
Company Option will be cancelled at the Effective Time without any payment
therefor. For purposes of withholding Taxes and other amounts required by
applicable Law to be withheld with respect to payments of the Option
Consideration, applicable withholding on the Total Cash Consideration portion
of such payment shall be taken from such portion of the Option Consideration,
and applicable withholding on the Total Stock Consideration portion of such
payment shall reduce the number of Parent Common Shares otherwise deliverable
in payment of such portion of the Option Consideration (with a Parent Common
Share valued at the Parent Closing Stock Value for purposes of determining the
number of Parent Common Shares to so withhold). Any fraction of a Parent
Common Share payable with respect to a cancelled Company Option pursuant to
this _Section 1.7(a)_ shall be treated consistently with _Section 2.1(e)_.
Parent shall pay (or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay) on the
Closing Date the Option Consideration for those Company Options that are
cancelled pursuant to this _Section 1.7(a)_.

 



 

(b) _Company Performance-Based RSUs and Company Vested Time-Based RSUs_. At
the Effective Time, each Company Performance-Based RSU (whether vested or
unvested) outstanding immediately before the Effective Time, and each Company
Vested Time-Based RSU that is outstanding immediately before the Effective
Time, shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive (subject to
applicable Tax withholding or other amounts required by applicable Law to be
withheld) (i) an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the Cash
Consideration multiplied by (B) the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company RSU, and (ii) a number of Parent Common Shares
equal to the product of (A) the Stock Consideration multiplied by (B) the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU.
For purposes of withholding Taxes and other amounts required by applicable Law
to be withheld with respect to the payments provided for in this _Section
1.7(b)_, applicable withholding on the Cash Consideration portion of such
payment shall be taken from such portion of the payment, and applicable
withholding on the Stock Consideration portion of such payment shall reduce
the number of Parent Common Shares otherwise deliverable in payment of such
cancelled Company RSU with a Parent Common Share valued at the Parent Closing
Stock Value for purposes of determining the number of Parent Common Shares to
so withhold. Any fraction of a Parent Common Share payable with respect to a
cancelled Company RSU pursuant to this _Section 1.7(b)_ shall be treated
consistently with _Section 2.1(e)_. Parent shall pay (or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay) on the Closing Date the payments described in
this _Section 1.7(b)_. In the case of a Company Performance-Based RSU
subject, immediately prior to the Effective Time, to unsatisfied performance
conditions for a performance period that includes the date on which the
Effective Time occurs, for purposes of calculating the payments provided for
by this _Section 1.7(b)_ the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company RSU shall be determined as though such performance conditions
were satisfied at the following level: (i) except as provided in clause (ii),
at the applicable "target" level; and (ii) as to any such performance
condition based on a relative total stockholder return measure, as though the
applicable performance period ended with the trading day immediately preceding
the date on which the Effective Time shall occur and using the Company Closing
Stock Value as the value of the Company Common Stock at the end of such
performance period for purposes of such performance determination.

 



 

(c) _Company Unvested Time-Based RSUs_. At the Effective Time, each Company
Unvested Time-Based RSU that is outstanding immediately before the Effective
Time

 



      
 

 



 

shall automatically and without any required action on the part of any holder
or beneficiary thereof, be assumed by Parent (each, a " _Converted RSU_ ").
Each Converted RSU shall continue to have and be subject to substantially the
same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company RSU immediately
before the Effective Time (including vesting conditions and dividend
equivalent rights), except that: (i) the Converted RSU shall represent the
right to receive (subject to applicable Tax withholding or other amounts
required by applicable Law to be withheld) (A) an amount in cash equal to the
product of (x) the Cash Consideration multiplied by (y) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU (the " _Converted
RSU Cash Consideration_ "), and (B) a number of Parent Common Shares equal to
the product of (x) the Stock Consideration multiplied by (y) the total number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU (" _Converted
RSU Parent Stock Consideration_ "); and (ii) each Converted RSU shall be
deemed fully vested upon the Effective Time as to the Converted RSU Cash
Consideration. Parent shall pay (or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
pay) on the Closing Date the Converted RSU Cash Consideration with respect to
the Converted RSUs.

 



 

(d) Before the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to the holders of the
Company Options and Company RSUs a notice, in a form reasonably acceptable to
Parent, describing the treatment of such awards in accordance with this
_Section 1.7_.

 



 

(e) Before the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt resolutions providing
for the treatment of the Company Options and Company RSUs as provided in this
_Section 1.7_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume the Company Equity
Plans, provided that all references to "Company" in the applicable Company
Equity Plan and the documents governing the Converted RSUs after the Effective
Time will be deemed references to Parent, and the number of Parent Common
Shares available for Converted RSU awards under the Company Equity Plans shall
be determined by adjusting the number of shares of Company Common Stock
available for such awards under the Company Equity Plans immediately before
the Effective Time in accordance with _Sections 1.7(c)_.

 



 

(f) Parent will reserve for issuance the number of Parent Common Shares that
will be deliverable pursuant to this _Section 1.7_.

 



 

Section 1.8 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock or Company
Convertible Preferred Stock as to which the holder thereof shall have properly
complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL as to appraisal rights
(each, a " _Dissenting Share_ "), if any, such holder shall be entitled to
payment of the appraisal value of the Dissenting Shares to the extent
permitted by and in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL.
At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder
of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) if any holder of Dissenting Shares, under the circumstances
permitted by and in accordance with the DGCL, affirmatively withdraws his
demand for appraisal of such Dissenting Shares, (ii) if any holder of
Dissenting Shares fails to establish his entitlement to appraisal rights as
provided in the DGCL or (iii) if any holder of Dissenting Shares takes or
fails to take any action the consequence of which

 



      
 

 



 

is that such holder is not entitled to payment for his shares under the DGCL,
such holder or holders (as the case may be) shall forfeit the right to
appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock or Company Convertible
Preferred Stock, as the case may be, and such shares of Company Common Stock
or Company Convertible Preferred Stock, as the case may be, shall thereupon
cease to constitute Dissenting Shares and if such forfeiture shall occur
following the Effective Time, each such share of Company Common Stock or
Company Convertible Preferred Stock, as the case may be, shall thereafter be
deemed to have been converted into and to have become, as of the Effective
Time, the right to receive, without interest thereon, the applicable Merger
Consideration. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Convertible Preferred Stock, and Parent shall have the right to
participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. The Company shall not settle, make any payments with respect to,
or offer to settle, any claim with respect to Dissenting Shares without the
prior written consent of Parent.

 



 

 **ARTICLE II** 
**EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES**

 



 

Section 2.1 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub, as
applicable, shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited with a bank or trust
company designated by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock and Company Convertible Preferred Stock, for exchange in
accordance with this _Article II_, through the Exchange Agent, sufficient
cash and such aggregate number of Parent Common Shares to make pursuant to
this _Article II_ all deliveries of cash and Parent Common Shares as required
by _Article I_ and _Article II_. Parent agrees to make available to the
Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay any
dividends and other distributions pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ and to make
payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.1(e)_. The
Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger
Consideration contemplated to be paid for shares of Company Common Stock and
Company Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to this Agreement out of the
Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by _Sections 2.1(c)_ and _2.1(e)_
hereof, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Any cash
and Parent Common Shares deposited with the Exchange Agent (including as
payment for fractional shares in accordance with _Section 2.1(e)_) shall
hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ".

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Convertible Preferred Stock as of the
Effective Time (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall
be in customary form) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
or Company Convertible Preferred Stock formerly represented by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Upon surrender of a Certificate or transfer
of Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such
letter of

 



      
 

 



 

transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such other documents as
may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate
or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) one
or more Parent Common Shares (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form
unless a physical certificate is requested) representing, in the aggregate,
the whole number of Parent Common Shares that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to _Section 1.6_ (after taking into account all shares of
Company Common Stock and Company Convertible Preferred Stock held by such
holder as of the Effective Time) and (B) a check in the amount equal to the
aggregate amount of cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
_Section 1.6_ and this _Article II_, including cash payable in lieu of any
fractional Parent Common Shares pursuant to _Section 2.1(e)_ and dividends
and other distributions pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_. No interest shall be
paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares
or on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
shares of Company Common Stock or Company Convertible Preferred Stock which is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock and
Company Convertible Preferred Stock may be paid to a transferee if the
Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Convertible Preferred Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by
all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and the Person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the delivery of the Merger
Consideration in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish
to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is
not payable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.1_, each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
or Company Convertible Preferred Stock represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share, cash in lieu of any fractional Parent Common Shares to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1(e)_ and any dividends or
other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section
2.1(c)_.

 



 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Parent Common Shares_. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to Parent
Common Shares with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to
the Parent Common Shares that such holder would be entitled to receive upon
surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share and no cash payment in lieu
of fractional Parent Common Shares shall be paid to any such holder until such
holder shall surrender such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with
this _Section 2.1_. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, there shall be paid to such holder of
Parent Common Shares issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (i)
promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash due pursuant
to _Section 1.6_ and cash payable in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1(e)_ and the amount
of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time theretofore paid with respect to such Parent Common Shares, and (ii) at
the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such Parent
Common Shares. For purposes of dividends or

 



      
 

 



 

other distributions in respect of Parent Common Shares, all Parent Common
Shares to be issued pursuant to _Section 1.6_ hereof shall be entitled to
dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if such Parent
Common Shares were issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.

 



 

(d) _Further Rights in Company Common Stock and Company Convertible Preferred
Stock_. The Merger Consideration issued upon conversion of a share of Company
Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid
pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ or _Section 2.1(e)_) shall be deemed to have
been delivered in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such share of
Company Common Stock and Company Convertible Preferred Stock.

 



 

(e) _Fractional Shares_. No certificates for fractional Parent Common Shares
or book-entry credit of the same shall be delivered upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates, and such fractional share interests will not entitle
the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights as a holder of any Parent
Common Shares.

 



 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares
of Company Common Stock or Company Convertible Preferred Stock exchanged
pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a
fraction of a Parent Common Share (after taking into account all Certificates
delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest) in an amount equal to the product of (i) the average of the closing
sale prices of Parent Common Shares on the TSX as reported by _The Wall Street
Journal_ for the five trading days immediately preceding the date on which the
Effective Time shall occur, converted from Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars
using the Bank of Canadas daily average Canada/U.S. exchange rate for each
such trading day, and (ii) the fraction of a Parent Common Shares which such
holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 1.6_
hereof. As promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of
cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional interests, the Exchange
Agent shall so notify Parent, and Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause
the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional interests
subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof. The Parties acknowledge
that payment of cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional Parent Common
Shares was not separately bargained for consideration but merely represents a
mechanical rounding off for purposes of simplifying the corporate and
accounting problems that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of
fractional Parent Common Shares.

 



 

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock or Company
Convertible Preferred Stock for twelve months after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to Parent upon demand and, from and after such delivery to
Parent, any holders of Company Common Stock or Company Convertible Preferred
Stock as of the Effective Time who have not theretofore complied with this
_Article II_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Convertible Preferred Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional Parent
Common Shares to which they are entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1(e)_ and any
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Shares to which
they are entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_, in each case, without any

 



      
 

 



 

interest thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Convertible Preferred Stock three years after
the Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time as
such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
governmental entity) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become
the property of Parent free and clear of any Liens, claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(g) _No Liability_. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Convertible
Preferred Stock for any such shares of Parent Common Shares (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered
to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

 



 

(h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent (or, if subsequent to the
termination of the Exchange Fund and subject to _Section 2.1(f))_, Parent
shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
or Company Convertible Preferred Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate, any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares to which the
holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1(e)_ and any dividends
or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
_Section 2.1(c)_, in each case, without any interest thereon.

 



 

(i) _Withholding_. Each of Parent, Merlin Holdco, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Company Common Stock or Company Convertible Preferred Stock such amounts as
Parent, Merlin Holdco, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent is required to deduct and withhold under any provision of state, local,
or foreign Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by Parent, Merlin Holdco, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent pursuant to this _Section 2.1(i)_
or pursuant to _Section 1.7_, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common
Stock, Company Convertible Preferred Stock Company Options or Company RSUs in
respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Merlin
Holdco, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be, provided that such amounts are actually remitted to the
appropriate Governmental Entity.

 



 

Section 2.2 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Convertible Preferred Stock theretofore outstanding on the records of the
Company. From and after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the
Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall be converted into the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock or
Company

 



       
 

 



 

Convertible Preferred Stock formerly represented by such Certificates, any
cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares to which the holders thereof
are entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1(e)_ and any dividends or other
distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section
2.1(c)_, without any interest thereon.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

 



 

Except (y) as set forth in the Company SEC Documents publicly available and
filed with the SEC following January 1, 2015 and at least three Business Days
prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Filed Company SEC Documents_ ")
(excluding any disclosures in such Filed Company SEC Documents in any risk
factor section, any forward-looking disclosure in any section relating to
forward-looking statements or any other statements that are non-specific,
predictive or cautionary in nature other than historical facts included
therein), where the relevance of the information as an exception to (or
disclosure for purposes of) a particular representation is reasonably apparent
on the face of such disclosure or (z) as set forth in the disclosure letter
delivered by the Company to Parent at or before the execution and delivery by
the Company of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ "), the
Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent, Merlin Holdco and Merger Sub

organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is organized (in the case of good standing, to the
extent such jurisdiction recognizes such concept), except, with respect to any
Company Subsidiary, where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good
standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries has all requisite corporate or other
entity power and authority necessary to enable it to own, operate, lease or
otherwise hold its properties and assets and to conduct its businesses as
presently conducted, except where the failure to have such power or authority,

expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business in each
jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the ownership, operation or
leasing of its properties make such qualification necessary, other than in
such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed,

expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has delivered
or made available to Parent, prior to execution of this Agreement, true and
complete copies of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company in effect
as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Company Charter_ ") and the By-laws
of the Company in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Company By-
laws_ ").

Company By-laws or any Contract to which the Company is a party or otherwise
bound. Except pursuant to the Company Equity Plans and awards thereunder,
there are not issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding, and there are not
any outstanding obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue,
deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, (i) any Company
Capital Stock or any capital stock of any Company Subsidiary or any securities
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for shares of capital stock or voting securities of, or other
equity interests in, the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (ii) any warrants,

basis on a Current Report on Form 8-K, being collectively referred to as the "
_Company SEC Documents_ ").

 



 

(b) Each Company SEC Document (i) at the time filed (or if amended or
superseded by a filing or amendment prior to the date of this Agreement, then

may be, the SarbanesOxley Act of 2002 (" _SOX_ ") and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Company SEC
Document and (ii) did not at the time it was filed (or if amended or
superseded by a filing or amendment prior to the date of this Agreement, then
at the time of such filing or amendment) contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of the
consolidated financial statements of

 



      
 

 



 

the Company included in the Company SEC Documents complied at the time it was
filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing or amendment prior to the date
of this Agreement, then at the time of such filing or amendment) as to form in

necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
U.S. GAAP, consistently applied, (ii) that transactions are executed only in
accordance with the authorization of management and (iii) regarding prevention
or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the

(e) The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) used by the Company are reasonably designed
to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to
be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such
information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the
management of the Company, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to enable the chief executive officer and chief
financial officer of the Company to make the certifications required under the
Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

 



 

(f) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party to, or
has any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company and

affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange
Act), where the result, purpose or

 



      
 

 



 

intended effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material

exist any event, change, occurrence, effect, fact, circumstance or condition
which, individually or in the aggregate, has had, or would reasonably be
expected to have or result in, a Company Material Adverse Effect, and (iii)

Parent, would constitute a violation of _Sections 5.1(a), (c)_ , _(d)_ , _(e)_

_(o)_ , _(p)_ , _(r)_ , and _(s)_.

the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries had as of that date any
liabilities or obligations (accrued, contingent or otherwise) that would be
material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Since
the date of the Company Balance Sheet, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has incurred any liabilities or obligations (accrued, contingent

business that individually or in the aggregate have not had, and would not be
reasonably expected to have or result in, a Company Material Adverse Effect,

respect of the terms and conditions of any Indebtedness or other agreement
which individually or in the aggregate has had, or would be reasonably
expected to have or result in, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 3.9 _Proxy Statement_. The Proxy Statement to be filed with the SEC in
connection with the Merger (the " _Proxy Statement_ ") will, when filed,
comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Exchange Act. Neither the Proxy Statement, nor any amendment or supplement
thereto, will, at the date on which the Proxy

 



      
 

 



 

Statement or any such amendment or supplement is first mailed to stockholders
of the Company or at the time such stockholders vote on the adoption of this
Agreement, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or warranty is made by the
Company in this _Section 3.9_ with respect to statements made or incorporated
by reference therein based on information supplied by or on behalf of Parent
or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy

Parent has not filed any confidential material change report which remains
confidential.

 



 

(d) Each Parent Report (i) at the time filed (or if amended or superseded by a
filing or amendment prior to the date of this Agreement, then at the time of
such filing or amendment), complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the applicable Canadian Securities Laws and any rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to such Parent Reports and (ii)

amendment prior to the date of this Agreement, then at the time of such filing
or amendment) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. Each of the consolidated financial statements of Parent
included in the Parent Reports complied at the time it was filed (or if

material respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results

Regulatory Authorities previously communicated in writing to Parent with
respect to any Parent Reports.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Parent has (i) established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as such term is defined in National Instrument 52-109 

Canadian Securities Regulatory Authorities) that are designed to ensure that
material information relating to Parent and its Subsidiaries is made known to
management of Parent by others within those entities and (ii) has disclosed to
its auditors and the audit committee of the Parent Board (A) all material
weaknesses (as such term is defined in National Instrument 52-109 

whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in Parents internal control over financial reporting.

 



 

(f) Parent has designed and maintains a system of internal control over
financial reporting (as such term is defined in National Instrument 52-109 

Canadian Securities Regulatory Authorities) designed to provide reasonable
assurances regarding the reliability of its financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements, including that (i) transactions are
executed in accordance with managements general or specific authorization;
and (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary (A) to permit preparation of
consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS and (B) to maintain
accountability of the assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(g) Neither Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries is a party to, or has
any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Parent and any of
the Parent Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
Person, on the other hand, or any off-balance sheet arrangements), where the
result, purpose or intended effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of
any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Parent or any
of the Parent Subsidiaries in Parents or such Parent Subsidiarys published
financial statements or other Parent Reports.

 



 

(h) Since January 1, 2015, Parent has disclosed to Parents auditors and the
audit committee of the Parent Board (A) any material weaknesses (as such term
is defined in National Instrument 52-109  _Certification of Disclosure in
Issuers  Annual and Interim Filings_ of the Canadian Securities Regulatory
Authorities) in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting of Parent, and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees of Parent who have a significant role in the
internal controls over financial reporting of Parent.

 



 

(i) None of the Parent Subsidiaries is, or has at any time since January 1,
2015 been, subject to the reporting requirements of the Canadian Securities

operations in all material

 



      
 

 



 

respects in the ordinary course consistent with past practice, (ii) there has
not occurred or continued to exist any event, change, occurrence, effect,
fact, circumstance or condition which, individually or in the aggregate, has
had, or would reasonably be expected to have or result in, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect, and (iii) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken
any action that if taken after the date of this Agreement without the prior
written consent of the Company, would constitute a violation of _Section 5.2
(a)_, _(b)_ , _(c)_ , _(d)_ , _(e)_ , _(f)_ , _(g)_ and _(h)_.

 



 

Section 4.8 _Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except as set forth or
reserved against in the balance sheet dated as of September 30, 2016 included

neither Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries had as of that date any
liabilities or obligations (accrued, contingent or otherwise) that would be
material to Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Since the
date of the Parent Balance Sheet, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
has incurred any liabilities or obligations (accrued, contingent or
otherwise), except for (i) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of
business that individually or in the aggregate have not had, and would not be
reasonably expected to have or result in, a Parent Material Adverse Effect,
(ii) liabilities in respect of Litigation (which are the subject of _Section

individually or in the aggregate has had, or would be reasonably expected to
have or result in, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the
Securities Act. The management information circular of Parent (" _Parent
Circular_ ") to be delivered to, or put at the disposal of, shareholders of
Parent in connection with obtaining the Parent Shareholder Approval at the
Parent Shareholders Meeting will, when provided to shareholders of Parent,
comply as to form and substance in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of Canadian Securities Laws. None of the Parent Circular or any
amendment or supplement thereto, will, at the date on which the Parent
Circular or any amendment or supplement thereto is first mailed to
shareholders of Parent or at the time such shareholders vote on the matters
constituting the Parent Shareholder Approval, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. Neither the Form F-4 nor any amendment or supplement
thereto, will, at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or warranty
is made by Parent in this _Section 4.9_ with respect to statements made or
incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by or on
behalf of the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Parent Circular or the Form F-4.

with IFRS in the Parent Financial Statements.

or in the aggregate has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, (ii) there is no Litigation pending or, to the

Permits_ "), except for Parent Permits under Environmental Laws (which are the
subject of _Section 4.16_) and except where the failure to hold such Parent
Permits individually or in the aggregate has not had, and would not reasonably
be expected to have, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries has received notice that any material Parent Permit will
be terminated or modified or cannot be renewed in the ordinary course of
business, and except where such termination, modification or nonrenewal would
not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, Parent

modification or nonrenewal.

notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the
part of Parent under any term or condition of the Commitment Letter. As of the
date of this Agreement (a) Parent is not aware of any fact or occurrence that
makes any of the assumptions, or the representations or warranties of Parent,
in the Commitment Letter inaccurate in any material respect, (b) assuming the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.3 _have been satisfied,
Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing
will fail to be satisfied on the Closing Date and (c) Parent has no reason to
believe that any portion of the Financing to be made available on the Closing
Date pursuant to the Commitment Letter will not be made available to Parent on
the Closing Date. Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other
fees required by the Commitment Letter to be paid by it on or prior to the
date of this Agreement. Parent expressly acknowledges that its ability to
obtain financing is not a condition to its obligations under this Agreement.

the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; or (ii) in the absence
of a Company Acquisition Proposal, and solely in

 



      
 

 



 

response to a Company Intervening Event, make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change if the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and independent financial
advisors, that the failure of the Company Board to make such Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to such Company Intervening Event would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law. The

good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and independent
financial advisors and taking into account any proposed binding changes to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such
Company Acquisition Proposal, that such Company Acquisition Proposal remains a
Company Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law. The
Parties agree that any amendment to the financial terms or other material
terms of a Company Superior Proposal following the delivery of a Company
Superior Proposal Notice in respect of such Company Superior Proposal shall
require delivery of another Company Superior Proposal Notice and another
Company Superior Proposal Notice Period in respect of such amended Company
Superior Proposal, except that if the only change to the Company Superior
Proposal is a change in price, then the Company Superior Proposal Notice
Period shall be the greater of the remaining time of the Company Superior
Proposal Notice Period in effect prior to the delivery of such new Company
Superior Proposal Notice and the period starting on the date Parent receives
such new Company Superior Proposal Notice and ending at 11:59 p.m., Eastern
Time on the second Business Day following such receipt. The Company Board

Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent, to the extent Parent
wishes to negotiate, during the period starting on the date Parent receives
the Company Intervening Event Notice and ending at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time on
the fourth Business Day following such receipt (such time, a " _Company
Intervening Event Notice Period_ "), with respect to any revisions to the
terms

 



      
 

 



 

of this Agreement proposed by Parent; and (C) following the end of such
Company Intervening Event Notice Period, the Company Board shall have
considered in good faith any changes to this Agreement proposed in writing by
Parent, and shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and independent financial advisors, that notwithstanding
such proposed changes, failure to take such actions in response to a Company
Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

 



 

(d) The Company shall advise Parent in writing within 24 hours of the receipt
of (i) any Company Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) any request for material
non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries made

(including the CFIUS Approval and Regulatory Approvals). The Parties may
designate, as they deem advisable and necessary, any sensitive information
materials required to be provided to the other under this _Section 5.6(a)_ as
"outside counsel only." Such materials and the information contained therein
shall be given only to outside counsel of the

 



      
 

 



 

recipient and shall not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers or directors of the recipient without the advance written consent of
the Party providing such materials or its counsel. Notwithstanding the prior
two sentences, Parent is not required to provide Company or its
representatives with personal identifying information required to be submitted
to CFIUS pursuant to and are not required to share any information required to
be submitted to CFIUS under 31 C.F.R. § 800.402(c)(6)(vi)(B).

Parent shall: (i) as soon as practicable and in any event within 15 Business
Days after the date of this Agreement, file Notification and Report Forms

and shall use reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to
all inquiries received from the FTC or the Antitrust Division for additional
information or documentation; (ii) as soon as practicable make any filing,
notice or application under any other applicable Competition Laws and shall
use reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practical to all

requested by a Governmental Entity from a party in respect of the Regulatory
Approvals, and supply as promptly as reasonably practicable as required in
applicable regulations any additional information and documentary material

privilege) that may be requested by CFIUS, DSS, NOAA, DDTC or other
Governmental Entity, as applicable, in connection with obtaining CFIUS
Approval and the Regulatory Approvals; (iv) consistent with Section 721, file
a draft joint voluntary notice with CFIUS with respect to the Merger (and in
no event later than 20 Business Days from the date hereof), and as promptly as
practicable thereafter, file a formal joint voluntary notice with CFIUS; and
(v) use its reasonable best efforts consistent with this _Section 5.6_ to
cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under
the HSR Act (including any extensions thereof) and to obtain CFIUS Approval
and the Regulatory Approvals as promptly as reasonably practicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if CFIUS notifies Parent and the Company that
CFIUS intends to send a report to the President of the United States
recommending that the President act to suspend or to prohibit the Merger,
either Parent or the Company may request a withdrawal of the notice filed with
CFIUS in connection with the CFIUS Approval in which case the "CFIUS Approval"
shall be deemed to be withheld.

 



 

(c) Each of the Parties shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to
prevent the entry of, and to cause to be discharged or vacated, any order or
injunction of a Governmental Entity precluding, restraining, enjoining or
prohibiting consummation of the Merger.

 



 

(d) In addition to, and without limiting the generality of, the obligations
set forth in this _Section 5.6_, each of the Company and Parent agree with
respect to any DSS foreign ownership, control and influence (" _FOCI_ ")
review (i) to file as promptly as practicable, all certificates pertaining to
foreign interests and similar notifications or documents (including any FOCI
mitigation plan) required or advisable in order to ensure after the Effective
Time that Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries maintain their
respective facility security clearances and personnel security clearances
issued by DSS and to remain in compliance with

 



   

     
 

 



 

and perform under the Contracts of Parent, the Company and their respective
Subsidiaries and with applicable U.S. national industrial security laws and
regulations; and (ii) to supply, as promptly as practicable, any additional
documents and information that may be required or requested in connection with
any DSS FOCI review. Subject to the limitations set forth in _Section
5.6(g)_, the Parties shall take, and cause their affiliates to take, any and
all actions necessary, and agree to all such requirements or conditions as may
be requested or required by DSS in connection with, or as a condition of, the
receipt of DSS Approval of any FOCI mitigation plan and make such changes to
the FOCI mitigation plan as are requested or required by DSS in order to
obtain DSS Approval.

 



 

(e) In addition to, and without limiting the generality of, the obligations
set forth in this _Section 5.6_, the Company and its Subsidiaries, in
coordination with the other Parties, will use reasonable best efforts to
timely submit to DDTC the 60-day notice pursuant to Section 122.4(a)-(b) of
the International Traffic in Arms Regulations.

 



 

(f) In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper
officers and/or directors of the Surviving Corporation shall take or cause to
be taken all such necessary action.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.6_, neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries (including Merlin Holdco and Merger Sub)
shall be required to, as a condition to obtaining any required approval
(including, for greater certainty, the CFIUS Approval and the Regulatory
Approvals) or resolving any objection of any Governmental Entity, offer or
accept, or agree, commit to agree or consent to, any undertaking, term,
condition, liability, obligation, commitment, sanction or other measure that
constitutes an Extraordinary Condition. In addition, the Company shall not,
and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, in connection with obtaining
any required approval of any Government Entity in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, offer to agree, or agree,
to any undertaking, term, condition, liability, obligation, commitment,
sanction or other measure, without Parents prior written consent. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Extraordinary Condition_ " means any
undertaking, term, condition, liability, obligation, commitment, sanction or
other measure (i) that would or would reasonably be expected to result in a
material change to the timing of Parents plan to reincorporate in the U.S. as
set forth in _Section 5.16_ of this Agreement, (ii) that would have a
material negative financial impact on Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries (on a
consolidated basis) or the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (on a
consolidated basis) or (iii) that would require Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) to enter into a
proxy agreement or voting trust agreement with respect to the services
provided by Condor under the NGA Contract.

 



 

(h) Each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
opinion described in _Section 6.2(e)_ and _Section 6.3(e)_, as applicable
and shall deliver to OMelveny and Myers LLP, KPMG LLP, Ernst and Young LLP,
Vinson and Elkins LLP or such other nationally recognized tax advisor or legal
counsel, as applicable, such representations, warranties and covenants as
described in _Section 6.2(e)_ and _Section 6.3(e)_, as applicable, as such
counsel may reasonably request and that can be made by such Party in good
faith.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.7 _Disclosure Documents; Stockholders  Meetings_.

 



 

(a) The Company and Parent shall cooperate with one another (i) in connection
with the preparation of the Proxy Statement, the Parent Circular and the Form
F-4, (ii) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing
with, any Governmental Entity is required, or any consents, approvals or
waivers are required to be obtained from Parties to any material contracts, in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (iii) in seeking any such actions, consents, approvals or
waivers or making any such filings, furnishing information required in
connection therewith or with the Proxy Statement, the Parent Circular, the
Form F-4 and seeking timely to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or
waivers. The Proxy Statement will be included as part of the Form F-4. Each of
Parent and the Company shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
file with the SEC the Form F-4 as soon as practicable following the date
hereof. Each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC and the Form F-4 declared
effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable and to keep the Form F-4
effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall, as
promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other Party copies
of any written comments and advise the other Party of any oral comments with
respect to the Proxy Statement, the Parent Circular and the Form F-4 received
by any Governmental Entity. The Parties shall cooperate and provide the other
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Parent Circular or the Form F-4 prior
to filing such documents with any Governmental Entity, and will provide each
other with a copy of all such filings made with any Governmental Entity.

 



 

(b) The information supplied by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub or any of
their respective affiliates for inclusion in the Form F-4 shall not, at the
time the Form F-4 is declared effective, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, or
necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading. The
information supplied by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub or any of their
respective affiliates for inclusion in the Proxy Statement shall not, at the
date the Proxy Statement (or any supplement thereto) is first mailed to the
stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. The information supplied by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub

first mailed to the shareholders of Parent or at the time of the Parent
Shareholder Meeting contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading. If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any
event or circumstance relating to the Company, Parent and Merger Sub or any of
their respective affiliates, or its or their respective officers or directors,
should be discovered by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub that should be set
forth in an amendment to the Form F-4 or a supplement to the Proxy Statement
or Parent Circular, the Company, Parent or Merger Sub shall promptly inform
the other Parties hereto thereof in writing. All documents that the Company or
Parent is responsible for filing with the

 



      
 

 



 

SEC or the Canadian Securities Regulatory Authorities in connection with the
transactions contemplated herein will comply as to form in all material
respects with applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder and the Canadian Securities Laws and the rules and regulations
thereunder.

 



 

(c) The Company, acting through the Company Board, shall, in accordance with
its certificate of incorporation and bylaws and with applicable Law, promptly
and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold, as soon as practicable
following the date upon which the Form F-4 becomes effective for the purposes
of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement in no event later than 45 days
after such date, the Company Stockholder Meeting for the purpose of
considering and taking action upon this Agreement, and shall, except as
otherwise provided in _Section 5.3(c)_, (i) recommend adoption of this
Agreement by the stockholders of the Company (the " _Company Board
Recommendation_ ") and include in the Proxy Statement such recommendation and
(ii) use its reasonable best efforts to solicit and obtain such adoption;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (A) the Company may change the date of, postpone
or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting (but not to a date later than the
Business Day prior to the End Date) to the extent that it has determined in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and Parent (and its
outside counsel), that such change, postponement or adjournment is necessary
to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is
provided to the Companys stockholders within a reasonable amount of time in
advance of the Company Stockholder Meeting; and (B) the Company may (and if
Parent so requests, the Company shall (it being understood and agreed that the
Company is not obligated to change the date of, postpone or adjourn if so
requested by Parent more than two times)), change the date of, postpone or
adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting (but not to a date later than the
Business Day prior to the End Date and provided that the Company shall not be
required to set a new record date) if as of the time for which the Company
Stockholder Meeting is scheduled (1) there are insufficient shares of Company
Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholder Meeting or (2) at
such time the Company has not received proxies sufficient to allow the receipt
of the Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholder Meeting. The
Company shall keep Parent updated with respect to proxy solicitation results
as reasonably requested by Parent. Notwithstanding any withdrawal, amendment
or modification by the Company Board or any committee thereof of its
recommendation of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 5.3(c)_ or the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company of any Company Acquisition Proposal, or any other fact or
circumstance, this Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of the
Company at the Company Stockholder Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval.

 



 

(d) Parent shall prepare and, concurrently with the mailing of the Proxy
Statement to the stockholders of the Company, Parent shall (i) file with the
Canadian Securities Regulatory Authorities the Parent Circular for the purpose
of seeking the approval of its shareholders of the issuance of Parent Common
Shares in connection with this Agreement and (ii) mail the Parent Circular to
the shareholders of Parent. Parent will cause the Parent Circular to comply as
to form in all material respects with applicable Law (including Canadian
Securities Laws). Subject to the last sentence of this _Section 5.7(d)_,
Parent will take, in accordance with applicable Law and the Parent Notice of
Articles and the Parent Articles, all action necessary to

 



      
 

 



 

convene a special meeting of its shareholders (the " _Parent Shareholders 
Meeting_") to consider and vote upon the approval of the issuance of Parent
Common Shares in connection with this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
(A) Parent may change the date of, postpone or adjourn the Parent Shareholder
Meeting (but not to a date later than the Business Day prior to the End Date)
to the extent that it has reasonably determined, after consultation with
outside legal counsel and the Company (and its outside counsel), that such
change, postponement or adjournment is necessary to ensure that any required
supplement or amendment to the Parent Circular is provided to Parents
shareholders within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Parent
Shareholder Meeting; and (B) Parent may (and if the Company so requests,
Parent shall (it being understood and agreed that Parent is not obligated to
change the date if so requested by the Company more than two times)) change
the date of, postpone or adjourn the Parent Shareholder Meeting (but not to a
date later than the Business Day prior to the End Date and provided that
Parent shall not be required to set a new record date) if as of the time for
which the Parent Shareholder Meeting is scheduled (1) there are insufficient
Parent Common Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute
a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Parent Shareholder Meeting
or (2) at such time Parent has not received proxies sufficient to allow the
receipt of the Parent Shareholder Approval at the Parent Shareholder Meeting.
Parent shall keep the Company updated with respect to proxy solicitation
results as reasonably requested by the Company. Parent shall promptly take any
action required to be taken under foreign or state securities or blue sky laws
in connection with the issuance of Parent Common Shares in connection with the
Merger. Notwithstanding any withdrawal, amendment or modification by the
Parent Board or any committee thereof of its recommendation of the Parent
Shareholder Approval in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, or any
other fact or circumstance, the Parent Shareholders Meeting shall be held for
the purpose of obtaining the Parent Shareholder Approval. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent shall have no obligation to convene or hold the Parent
Shareholder Meeting to consider and vote upon the approval of the issuance of
Parent Common Shares in connection with this Agreement and Parent shall be
permitted to adjourn, postpone or cancel the Parent Shareholders Meeting if
called, until all of the conditions set forth in _Sections 6.1(c)_ and _(d)_
have been satisfied (and the condition set forth in _Section 6.1(b)_ would
have been satisfied if the Parent Shareholder Meeting had occurred on the date
on which the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1(c)_ and _(d)_ had first
been satisfied).

 



 

Section 5.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of the Company, on one
hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall give prompt notice
to the other of (i) any representation or warranty made by it contained in
this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (ii)
the failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall
affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Parties
or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties under this Agreement. In
addition, the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any fact, event or
circumstance known to the Company that would reasonably be expected,
individually or taken together with all other facts, events and circumstances
known to the Company, to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. Parent
shall give prompt notice to the Company of any fact, event or circumstance
known to Parent that would reasonably be expected, individually or taken
together with all other facts, events and circumstances known to Parent, to
result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.9 _Directors  and Officers Insurance and Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent
provided in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as in
effect on the date of this Agreement and permitted by applicable Law, each
present and former officer, director, manager, employee and agent of the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries in such capacities (" _Indemnified
Parties_ ") against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines
and reasonable fees, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit,
proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party upon receipt of an
undertaking from such Indemnified Party to repay such advanced expenses if it
is determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party was not entitled to indemnification
hereunder) arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party
is or was an officer, director, manager, employee or agent of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or, while a director, manager or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, is or was serving at the request of the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries as an officer, director, manager, employee
or agent of another Person).

 



 

(b) From the Effective Time through the six-year anniversary of the date on
which the Effective Time occurs, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation shall contain, and each of Parent and Merlin
Holdco shall cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation to so contain, provisions no less favorable with respect
to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and
former directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries than are set
forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as in
effect on the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Subject to the next sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall either (i)
maintain, and each of Parent and Merlin Holdco shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for six
(6) years from the Effective Time the current directors and officers
liability insurance policies maintained by the Company (the " _Current D andO
Insurance_") with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) or
(ii) purchase a six (6) year extended reporting period endorsement with
respect to the Current DandO Insurance and maintain such endorsement in full
force and effect for its full term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event
will Parent be required to expend, in the aggregate, an amount in excess of
300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries
for the Current DandO Insurance (the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If the Companys or
the Surviving Corporations existing insurance expires, is terminated or
canceled during such six-year period or exceeds the Maximum Premium, the
Surviving Corporation shall obtain, and each of Parent and Merlin Holdco shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain, as much directors and officers
liability insurance as can be obtained for the remainder of such period for an
annualized premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium, on terms and
conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties than the Current
DandO Insurance.

 



 

(d) In the event Parent, Merlin Holdco or the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and

 



      
 

 



 

shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, Merlin
Holdco or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall expressly
assume and succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.9_.

 



 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 5.9_ are intended to be in addition to
the rights otherwise available to any Indemnified Party by Law, charter,
statute, bylaw or agreement, and shall operate for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their
representatives.

 



 

(f) In the event that, after the Effective Time, any excise tax is payable by
any Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 4985 of the Code, as such section
may be amended or modified (or, for the avoidance of doubt, any successor
section), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to
each such individual, by no later than the time such excise tax is required to
be paid by such individual or withheld by Parent or its Subsidiary, an amount
equal to the sum of the excise tax payable by such individual, plus the amount
necessary to put the individual in the same after-tax position (taking into
account any applicable Taxes, including taxes payable upon such payment) that
such individual would have been in if such individual had not incurred such
excise tax.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Publicity_. No Party nor any of their respective affiliates
shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other
announcement with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior consultation of
the other Party and shall not issue any such press release or announcement
without the prior consent of the other party (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by
Law or by any listing agreement with, or regulation of, any U.S. or foreign
securities exchange or regulatory authority if all reasonable best efforts
have been made to consult with the other Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no such consultation or consent shall be required with respect to the
publication of any press release or announcement with respect to a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change made in accordance with _Section 5.3(c)_ or a
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change made in accordance with _Section
5.4(c)_. The Company, Parent, Merlin Holdco and Merger Sub agree that the
press release announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement will be
the joint release of the Company and Parent in the form of _Exhibit C_
hereto.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain and effectuate the
Financing on a timely basis on the terms and conditions described in the
Commitment Letter, including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain
in effect the Commitment Letter and negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect to the applicable Commitment Letter on terms and
conditions contained in the Commitment Letter, (ii) satisfy (or, at the option
of Parent, seek waiver of) all conditions to funding applicable to Parent
contained in the applicable Commitment Letter (or any definitive agreements
related thereto) within its or any of its affiliates control, (iii) upon
satisfaction of such conditions, consummate the applicable Financing, and draw
the full amount of the Financing required on the Closing Date, at or prior to

 



      
 

 



 

the Closing Date and (iv) pay any and all commitment or other fees in a timely
manner that become payable by Parent under the Commitment Letter following the
date of this Agreement. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably
current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange
the Financing. Parent shall give the Company reasonably prompt notice upon
having Knowledge of any breach by any party of the Commitment Letter or any
termination of the Commitment Letter.

 



 

(b) In the event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
and conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter, Parent shall promptly
notify Company and shall use reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain
alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement upon the terms set
forth herein and therein and otherwise on terms not less favorable to Parent
than the terms and conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter as promptly
as practicable following the occurrence of such event. Parent shall deliver to
Company true and complete copies of all agreements (including any fee letter
(subject to customary redactions)) pursuant to which any such alternative
source shall have committed to provide Parent with all or any portion of the
Financing. In the event any alternative financing source is required to be
obtained, (i) any reference in this Agreement to the "Financing" shall include
the financing contemplated by the alternate source, (ii) any reference in this
Agreement to the "Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include any commitment
letter of the alternative financing source, (iii) any reference in this
Agreement to "fee letter" shall be deemed to include any fee letter relating
to the alternative financing source and (iv) any reference in this Agreement
to the "Debt Providers" shall refer to the alternative financing sources.
Parent shall not agree to or permit any amendment, supplement or other
modification of, or waive any of its rights under, the Commitment Letter or
the definitive agreements relating to the Financing that would (A) add new
conditions precedent or expand any of the conditions precedent set forth
therein as in effect on the date of this Agreement (unless such new or
expanded conditions precedent would not reasonably be expected to materially
impair, materially delay or prevent the availability of all or a portion of
the Financing), (B) reasonably be expected to materially impair, materially
delay or prevent the availability of all or a portion of the Financing, (C)
reduce the aggregate cash amount of the funding commitments under the
Commitment Letter in effect on the date of this Agreement to be funded on the
Closing Date (except (x) in connection with a Senior Notes Election (as
defined in the Commitment Letter) by the aggregate principal amount of the
Senior Notes (as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter) the proceeds of which
are available on the Closing Date to finance the Transaction or (y) as set
forth in any "flex provisions" in the Commitment Letter and, to the extent
resulting from an increase in the amount of fees to be paid or original issue
discount, if any revolving facility or increased term loan is available to
satisfy such amounts or original issue discount), or (D) otherwise adversely
affect in any material respect the ability of Parent to enforce its rights
against the other parties to the Commitment Letter or would reasonably be
expected to materially delay the Closing (collectively, the " _Restricted
Commitment Letter Amendments_ ") ( _provided_ , that subject to the
limitations set forth in this _Section 5.11(b)_, Parent may amend the
Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities that have not executed the Commitment Letter as of
the date of this Agreement, including by novation, joinder or other agreement
for valid transfer of commitments from a Debt Provider party to the Commitment
Letter as of the date of this Agreement to such new Debt Provider under the
Commitment Letter (which novation, joinder or other agreement for valid
transfer shall become effective under the terms of

 



      
 

 



 

the Commitment Letter as agreed between the Parent and the Debt Providers,
without further action, consent or waiver by any other party to this
Agreement) (but not to make any other changes except as permitted by this
_Section 5.11(b)_, but only if the addition of such additional parties,
individually or in the aggregate, would not result in the occurrence of a
Restricted Commitment Letter Amendment). Parent shall promptly deliver to
Company true, complete and correct copies of any amendment, modification or
replacement, in whole or in part, of the Commitment Letter. Parent shall keep
Company reasonably apprised of material adverse developments relating to the
Financing, including any material dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties to the Commitment Letter with respect to the obligation to fund the
Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded at Closing (but
excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any ordinary course negotiations with
respect to the terms of the Financing and/or the definitive documentation
related thereto).

 



 

Section 5.12 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Parent Common Shares to be issued in connection with the
Merger to be conditionally approved for listing on the TSX, subject only to
the provision of such required documentation as is customary in the
circumstances. To the extent requested by Parent, prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all
things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable
Laws and rules and policies of the NYSE to enable the delisting by the
Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock from the NYSE and
the deregistration of the shares of Company Common Stock under the Exchange
Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event no
more than ten days after the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 5.13 _Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) From the Closing Date until the earlier to occur of (i) the first (1st)
anniversary of the Closing Date or (ii) the termination of a Continuing
Company Employees employment with Parent and its Subsidiaries (including but
not limited to Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries), Parent shall, and
shall cause its affiliates (including but not limited to Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries) to, provide each individual employed by the Company or
one of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Continuing
Company Employees_ ") a base salary or base wage rate, as applicable, that is
not less than the Continuing Company Employees base salary or base wage rate,
as applicable, as in effect immediately prior to the Closing and compensation
and employee benefits (excluding equity-based compensation) that, in the
aggregate, are substantially comparable to such compensation and benefits
provided to such Continuing Company Employees by the Company or its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing (but excluding any transaction-
based retention or other extraordinary, special, or one-time, non-recurring
compensation or benefits); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this
_Section 5.13_ shall be interpreted to require Parent to provide for the
participation of any Continuing Company Employees in any benefit plan of
Parent or its affiliates.

 



 

(b) As of the Closing Date, Parent shall provide, or cause its affiliates to
provide, to each Continuing Company Employee under each employee benefit plan,

duplication of benefits to any Continuing Company Employee.

 



 

(c) For purposes of each Post-Closing Plan providing medical, dental,
prescription drug and/or vision benefits, or other welfare benefits to any
Continuing Company Employee, Parent shall, or shall cause its affiliates to,
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions, actively-at-work requirements, evidence of insurability

reasonable efforts to cause any Post-Closing Plan to provide each Continuing
Company Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid by such

Date occurs for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible, coinsurance,

been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable Post-
Closing Plan.

plan providing benefits to any Continuing Company Employee or as altering the
at-will nature of any Continuing Company Employees employment.

at law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, involving
the Debt Providers arising out of, or relating to, the transactions
contemplated hereby, the Commitment Letter, the Financing or the performance

jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New
York, or if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the
federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York (and the appellate courts thereof) and each party hereto submits for
itself and its property with respect to any such action or proceeding to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such court and (ii) not to permit or bring any of
its Affiliates to bring or support anyone else in bringing any such action or
proceeding in any other court.

 ** _EXHIBIT A_**

 



 

 **AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION 
OF 
DIGITALGLOBE, INC.**

 



 

 ** _FIRST_** : The name of the Corporation is DigitalGlobe, Inc.

 



 

 ** _SECOND_** : The address of the registered office of the Corporation in
the State of Delaware is 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, Delaware, New Castle
County 19801. The name of its registered agent at that address is The
Corporation Trust Company.

 



 

 ** _THIRD_** : The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act
or activity for which a corporation may be organized under the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " **GCL** "). The Corporation
shall have any power necessary or convenient to the conduct, promotion or
attainment of such acts and activities.

 



 

 ** _FOURTH_** : The total number of shares of all classes of stock which the
Corporation shall have authority to issue is 1,010,000 shares, consisting of
(i) 1,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (" **Common
Stock** ") and (ii) 10,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per
share (" **Preferred Stock** "). The following is a statement of the
designations and the powers, privileges and rights, and the qualifications,
limitations or restrictions thereof in respect of each class of capital stock
of the Corporation.

 



 

1. **COMMON STOCK**

 



 

1.1. **_General_**. The voting, dividend and liquidation rights of the holders
of Common Stock are subject to and qualified by the rights, powers and
preferences of the holders of Preferred Stock set forth herein.

 



 

1.2. **_Voting_**. The holders of Common Stock are entitled to one vote for
each share of Common Stock held at all meetings of stockholders (and written
actions in lieu of meetings). There shall be no cumulative voting.

 



 

2. **PREFERRED STOCK**

 



 

2.1. **_Dividends_**. The Corporation shall not declare, pay or set aside any
dividends on Common Stock unless (in addition to the obtaining of any consents
required elsewhere in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
or in the By-Laws, if any) the holders of Preferred Stock then outstanding
shall first receive, or simultaneously receive, a dividend on each outstanding
share of Preferred Stock in an amount at least equal to that dividend per
share of Preferred Stock as would equal the product of (i) a fraction
calculated by dividing the amount of the dividend payable on each share of
Common Stock by the original issuance price of such Common Stock (subject to
appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split,
combination or other similar recapitalization with respect to such Common
Stock) and (ii) an amount equal to the Preferred Original Issue Price (as
defined below). The " **Preferred Original Issue Price** " per share of
Preferred Stock shall mean the fair market value, as determined by the Board
of Directors in their sole discretion, of one share of

      
 

 



 

common stock that was converted into one share of Preferred Stock immediately
prior to the date of the initial issuance of Preferred Stock, subject to
appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split,
combination or other similar recapitalization with respect to Preferred Stock.
No dividends shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment, or other
distribution declared or made or set apart, upon the Common Stock if the
Corporation would not be able to redeem all of the Preferred Stock at the
Redemption Price.

 



 

2.2. **_Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up_**.

 



 

2.2.1. _Preferential Payments to Holders of Preferred Stock_. In the event of
any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, the holders of shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding shall
be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Corporation available for
distribution to its stockholders before any payment shall be made to the
holders of Common Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per
share equal to the Preferred Original Issue Price, plus any dividends declared
but unpaid thereon (the " **Preferred Liquidation Amoun** t"). If upon any
such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation the assets of
the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders shall be
insufficient to pay the holders of shares of Preferred Stock the full amount
to which they shall be entitled under this _Subsection 2.2.1_, the holders of
shares of Preferred Stock shall share ratably in any distribution of the
assets available for distribution in proportion to the respective amounts
which would otherwise be payable in respect of the shares held by them upon
such distribution if all amounts payable on or with respect to such shares
were paid in full. For the avoidance of doubt, neither the consolidation,
merger or other business combination of the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries with or into any other entity(ies), nor the sale, lease, exchange
or conveyance of all or any part of the property, assets or business of the
Corporation or any of its subsidiaries to any individual(s) or entity(ies)
shall be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation for purposes of this _Subsection 2.2.1._

 



 

2.2.2. _Payments to Holders of Common Stock_. In the event of any voluntary or
involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, after
the payment of all preferential amounts required to be paid to the holders of
shares of Preferred Stock, the remaining assets of the Corporation available
for distribution to its stockholders shall be distributed among the holders of
shares of Common Stock, pro rata based on the number of shares held by each
such holder.

 



 

2.3. **_Voting_**. Except as provided by law or by the other provisions of
this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, holders of Preferred
Stock shall not be entitled to vote, in respect of their holdings of Preferred
Stock, on any matters upon which the stockholders of the Corporation are
entitled to vote, including without limitation the election of directors.

 



 

2.4. **_Redemption_**.

 



 

2.4.1. _Stockholder Initiated Redemption_. Unless prohibited by Delaware law
governing distributions to stockholders, each share of Preferred Stock that is
the subject of a Redemption Request (as defined below) shall be redeemed by
the Corporation at a price equal to the greater of (a) the Preferred Original
Issue Price per share, plus all declared but unpaid

      
 

 



 

dividends thereon and (b) the fair market value (determined in the manner set
forth below) of a single share of Preferred Stock as of the date of the
Corporations receipt of the Redemption Request (the " **Redemption Price**
"), promptly after receipt by the Corporation from one or more holders of then
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, of written notice requesting redemption
of all or some of the Preferred Stock held by such holder(s) (the "
**Redemption Request** "). For purposes of this _Subsection 2.4.1_ , the fair
market value of a single share of Preferred Stock shall be the value of a
single share of Preferred Stock as determined by the Board of Directors, and,
in the event that the Board of Directors is unable to reach agreement, by a
third-party appraiser designated by the Board of Directors. On the applicable
redemption date determined by the Board of Directors (a " **Put Redemption
Date** "), the Corporation shall redeem the total number of shares of
Preferred Stock in respect of which a Redemption Request has been received. If
on any Put Redemption Date Delaware law governing distributions to
stockholders prevents the Corporation from redeeming all shares of Preferred
Stock to be redeemed, the Corporation shall ratably redeem the maximum number
of shares that it may redeem consistent with such law, and shall redeem the
remaining shares as soon as it may lawfully do so under such law.

 



 

2.4.2. _Corporation Initiated Redemption_. To the extent the Corporation may
lawfully do so, the Corporation, subject to the approval of the Board of
Directors, may, at its option, redeem, in whole or in part, the Preferred
Shares at any time, but only out of funds legally available therefor, by
paying therefor the Redemption Price. If less than all outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the Corporation shall redeem shares pro
rata among the holders thereof in accordance with the respective numbers of
shares of Preferred Stock held by each of them. The date on which the
applicable shares are to be redeemed is referred to as the " **Call Redemption
Date** ".

 



 

2.4.3. _Redemption Notice_. The Corporation shall send written notice of each
redemption (the " **Redemption Notice** ") to each holder of record of
Preferred Stock on or prior to each Put Redemption Date and/or Call Redemption
Date, as applicable. Each Redemption Notice shall state:

 



 

(a) the number of shares of Preferred Stock held by the holder that the
Corporation shall redeem on the Put Redemption Date or Call Redemption Date,
as applicable, specified in the Redemption Notice;

 



 

(b) the Put Redemption Date or Call Redemption Date, as applicable, and the
Redemption Price; and

 



 

(c) for holders of shares in certificated form, that the holder is to
surrender to the Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated, his,
her or its certificate or certificates representing the shares of Preferred
Stock to be redeemed.

 



 

2.4.4. _Surrender of Certificates; Payment_. On or before the applicable Put
Redemption Date or Call Redemption Date, each holder of shares of Preferred
Stock to be redeemed on such Put Redemption Date or Call Redemption Date
shall, if a holder of shares in certificated form, surrender the certificate
or certificates representing such shares (or, if such registered holder
alleges that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost
certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation
to indemnify the Corporation

      
 

 



 

against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the
alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate) to the Corporation, in
the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and thereupon
the Redemption Price for such shares shall be payable to the order of the
person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner
thereof. In the event less than all of the shares of Preferred Stock
represented by a certificate are redeemed, a new certificate, instrument, or
book entry representing the unredeemed shares of Preferred Stock shall
promptly be issued to such holder.

 



 

2.4.5. _Rights Subsequent to Redemption_. If the Redemption Notice shall have
been duly given, and if on the applicable Put Redemption Date or Call
Redemption Date the Redemption Price payable upon redemption of the shares of
Preferred Stock to be redeemed on such date is paid or tendered for payment or
deposited with an independent payment agent so as to be available therefor in
a timely manner, then notwithstanding that any certificates evidencing any of
the shares of Preferred Stock so called for redemption shall not have been
surrendered, all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith after the
applicable Put Redemption Date or Call Redemption Date terminate, except only
the right of the holders to receive the Redemption Price without interest upon
surrender of any such certificate or certificates therefor.

 



 

2.4.6. _Redeemed or Otherwise Acquired Shares_. Any shares of Preferred Stock
that are redeemed or otherwise acquired by the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries shall be automatically and immediately cancelled and retired and
shall not be reissued, sold or transferred. Neither the Corporation nor any of
its subsidiaries may exercise any voting or other rights granted to the
holders of Preferred Stock following redemption.

 



 

2.5. **_Waiver_**. Any of the rights, powers, preferences and other terms of
Preferred Stock set forth herein may be waived on behalf of all holders of
Preferred Stock by the affirmative written consent or vote of the holders of
at least 75% of the shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding.

 



 

 ** _FIFTH_** : Unless and except to the extent that the By-Laws of the
Corporation shall so require, the election of directors of the corporation
need not be by written ballot. The number of directors of the Corporation
shall be as specified in, or determined in the manner provided in, the By-Laws
of the Corporation. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be
managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors of the
Corporation.

 



 

 ** _SIXTH_** : No director shall be personally liable to the Corporation or
any of its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a
director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation
thereof is not permitted under the GCL as the same exists or may hereafter be
amended. If the GCL is amended hereafter to authorize the further elimination
or limitation of the liability of directors, then the liability of a director
of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent
authorized by the GCL, as so amended. Any repeal or modification of this
Article SIXTH shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director
of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification with
respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to such repeal or modification.

      
 

 



 

 ** _SEVENTH_** : The Corporation shall indemnify its directors and officers
to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by law, as now or hereafter in
effect, and such right to indemnification shall continue as to a person who
has ceased to be a director or officer of the Corporation and shall inure to
the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and personal and legal
representatives; provided, however, that, except for proceedings to enforce
rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify
any director or officer (or his or her heirs, executors or personal or legal
representatives) in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated
by such person unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or
consented to by the Board of Directors. The right to indemnification conferred
by this Article SEVENTH shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation
the expenses incurred in defending or otherwise participating in any
proceeding in advance of its final disposition upon receipt by the Corporation
of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer receiving
advancement to repay the amount advanced if it shall ultimately be determined
that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation under
this Article SEVENTH.

 



 

The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board
of Directors, provide rights to indemnification and to the advancement of
expenses to employees and agents of the Corporation similar to those conferred
in this Article SEVENTH to directors and officers of the Corporation.

 



 

The rights to indemnification and to the advance of expenses conferred in this
Article SEVENTH shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may
have or hereafter acquire under this Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, the By-Laws of the Corporation, any statute, agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

 



 

Any repeal or modification of this Article SEVENTH shall not adversely affect
any rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses of a director
or officer of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or
modification with respect to any acts or omissions occurring prior to such
repeal or modification.

 



 

 ** _EIGHTH_** : In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred
by the laws of the State of Delaware, the Board of Directors of the
Corporation is expressly authorized to adopt, make, alter and repeal the By-
Laws of the Corporation; provided, however, that while the Security Control
Agreement (as amended from time to time (the " **Security Agreement** "),
dated January 26, 2017, by and among MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates Ltd.
(" **MDA** "), SSL MDA Holdings, Inc., and the Department of Defense is in
effect, the By-Laws of the Corporation may only be altered, amended or
repealed, and new bylaws made, by the stockholders.

 



 

 ** _NINTH_** : The Corporation reserves the right at any time, and from time
to time, to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and other provisions
authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force may be
added or inserted, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by law; and all
rights, preferences and privileges of any nature conferred upon stockholders,
directors or any other persons by and pursuant to this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation in its present form or as hereafter amended are
granted subject to the rights reserved in this Article NINTH.

      
 

 



 

 ** _TENTH_** : **_Investor Protections_**. Notwithstanding any of the
provisions of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation,

 



 

(a) the following actions are reserved to MDA, and may not be undertaken by
the Board of Directors unless the Corporation or Board of Directors shall have
received, with respect to each such action, the prior written approval of MDA;
and to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Corporation will not, and will
not permit any " **Controlled Entity** " (as defined in the Security
Agreement) to:

 



 

(i) merge, consolidate, reorganize, or dissolve; liquidate, sell or pledge all
or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation or of any Controlled
Entity; acquire a company, business, or other legal entity; enter into any
financing arrangement or indebtedness in excess of $5,000,000 other than in
the " **Normal Course of Business** " as that term is defined by MDA; or
voluntarily file for bankruptcy or liquidate or sell any business of the
Corporation or any Controlled Entity or any assets having a value in excess of
$5,000,000, other than in the Normal Course of Business;

 



 

(ii) change any of the existing legal rights or preferences of, the shares of
any capital stock, as provided in the Corporations charter documents, or any
shares or interests as provided in the charter documents of any Controlled
Entity;

 



 

(iii) amend the Corporations or any Controlled Entitys charter documents
with respect to the matters described in Article TENTH subsection(a)(i)
through (a)(iii) and subsection (b)(i);

 



 

(iv) approve or disapprove the Corporations or any Controlled Entitys
execution of unclassified contracts valued in excess of $25,000,000 other than
in the Normal Course of Business;

 



 

(v) approve or disapprove capital expenditures by the Corporation or any
Controlled Entity in excess of $5,000,000 other than in the Normal Course of
Business; or

 



 

(vi) amend the Corporations By-laws; and

 



 

(b) MDA shall have the legally enforceable right to:

 



 

(i) purchase additional shares in the capital stock of the Corporation or
shares or interests in any Controlled Entity, as the case may be, to prevent
the dilution of an investors pro rata interest in the Corporation or any
Controlled Entity in the event that the Corporation or the Controlled Entity
issues new shares or interests;

 



 

(ii) cause the Corporation to (and cause the Corporation to cause each
Controlled Entity to) adopt:

 



 

(A) the risk-management policies of MDA, the ultimate parent of the
Corporation, with respect to regulatory and legal compliance, contract
overruns (for unclassified contracts only), and related matters;

      
 

 



 

(B) financial reporting standards and policies of MDA, as the ultimate parent
of the Corporation; and

 



 

(C) the corporate strategies (not involving classified information or
contracts) of MDA, as the ultimate parent of the Corporation, involving
capital and financial structuring; and

 



 

(iii) hold meetings among personnel of MDA, as the ultimate parent of the
Corporation, and the Corporation or any Controlled Entity personnel with
respect to administrative, financial, and operational matters, including any
matters with respect to approved budgets, including remediation actions,
related to commercial and non-U.S. classified and export-controlled activities
and contracts.

      
 

 



 

 ** _EXHIBIT B_**

 



 

 **AMENDED AND RESTATED BY-LAWS 
OF 
DIGITALGLOBE, INC.**

 



 

 **ARTICLE I** ** 
Meetings of Stockholders**

 



 

Section 1.1 **_Annual Meetings_**. If required by applicable law, an annual
meeting of stockholders shall be held for the election of directors and such
other lawful purposes at such date, time and place, if any, either within or
without the State of Delaware, as may be designated by resolution of the board
of directors of the corporation (the " ** _Board of Directors_** ") from time
to time. Any other proper business may be transacted at the annual meeting.
The corporation may postpone, reschedule or cancel any annual meeting of
stockholders previously scheduled by the Board of Directors.

 



 

Section 1.2 **_Special Meetings_**. Special meetings of stockholders for any
purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the Board of Directors, but
such special meetings may not be called by any other person or persons.
Business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall be limited to
the purposes stated in the notice. The corporation may postpone, reschedule or
cancel any special meeting of stockholders previously scheduled by the Board
of Directors.

 



 

Section 1.3 **_Notice of Meetings_**. Whenever stockholders are required or
permitted to take any action at a meeting, a notice of the meeting shall be
given that shall state the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting, the
means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy
holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, the
record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting
(if such date is different from the record date for stockholders entitled to
notice of the meeting) and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or
purposes for which the meeting is called. Unless otherwise provided by law,
the certificate of incorporation of the corporation (as amended or restated
from time to time, the " ** _Certificate of Incorporation_** ") or these
bylaws, the notice of any meeting shall be given not less than ten (10) nor
more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder
entitled to vote at the meeting as of the record date for determining the
stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting. Except as otherwise provided
herein or permitted by applicable law, notice to stockholders shall be in
writing and delivered personally or mailed to the stockholders at their
address appearing on the books of the corporation. Without limiting the manner
by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, notice of
meetings may be given to stockholders by means of electronic transmission in
accordance with applicable law.

 



 

Section 1.4 **_Adjournments_**. Any meeting of stockholders, annual or
special, may adjourn from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other
place, and notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time,
place, if any, and the means of remote communication, if any, thereof are
announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned
meeting the corporation may transact any business which might have been

      
 

 



 

transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty
(30) days, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each
stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after the
adjournment a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to
vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board of Directors shall fix as
the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of such
adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination
of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and shall give
notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record as of the record
date so fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting.

 



 

Section 1.5 **_Quorum_**. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate
of Incorporation or these bylaws, at each meeting of stockholders the presence
in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority in voting power of the
outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote at the meeting shall be necessary
and sufficient to constitute a quorum. In the absence of a quorum, the
stockholders so present may, by a majority in voting power thereof, adjourn
the meeting from time to time in the manner provided in _Section 1.4_ of
these bylaws until a quorum shall attend. Shares of its own stock belonging to
the corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares
entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is
held, directly or indirectly, by the corporation, shall neither be entitled to
vote nor be counted for quorum purposes; provided, however, that the foregoing
shall not limit the right of the corporation or any subsidiary of the
corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock, held by
it in a fiduciary capacity. A quorum, once established, shall not be broken by
the subsequent withdrawal of enough votes to leave less than a quorum.

 



 

Section 1.6 **_Organization_**. Meetings of stockholders shall be presided
over by the Chairperson of the Board, if any, or in his or her absence by the
Vice Chairperson of the Board, if any, or in his or her absence by the
President, or in his or her absence by a Vice President, or in the absence of
the foregoing persons by a chairperson designated by the Board of Directors,
or in the absence of such designation by a chairperson chosen at the meeting.
The Secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in his or her absence
the chairperson of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of
the meeting.

 



 

Section 1.7 **_Voting; Proxies_**. Except as otherwise provided by or pursuant
to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, each stockholder
entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to one (1)
vote for each share of stock held by such stockholder which has voting power
upon the matter in question. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of
stockholders or to express consent to corporate action in writing without a
meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by
proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three (3) years
from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. Proxies for use
at any meeting of stockholders shall be filed with the Secretary, or such
other officer as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine by
resolution, before or at the time of the meeting. A proxy shall be irrevocable
if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled
with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A
stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the
meeting and voting in person or by delivering to the Secretary of the
corporation, or such other person as may also be authorized by the Board of
Directors for such purpose, a revocation of the proxy or a new proxy bearing a
later date. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot.
At all meetings of stockholders for the election of directors at which a
quorum

      
 

 



 

is present a plurality of the votes cast shall be sufficient to elect. All
other elections and questions presented to the stockholders at a meeting at
which a quorum is present shall, unless a different or minimum vote is
required by the Certificate of Incorporation, these bylaws, or any law or
regulation applicable to the corporation or its securities, in which case such
different or minimum vote shall be the applicable vote on the matter, be
decided by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power
of the shares of stock of the corporation which are present in person or by
proxy and entitled to vote thereon.

 



 

Section 1.8 **_Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record_**.

 



 

(a) In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board of
Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Directors, and which record date shall, unless otherwise required by law, not
be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such
meeting. If the Board of Directors so fixes a date, such date shall also be
the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such
meeting unless the Board of Directors determines, at the time it fixes such
record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be
the date for making such determination. If no record date is fixed by the
Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of
business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if
notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day
on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to
any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors
may fix a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote
at the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date
for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an
earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote
in accordance herewith at the adjourned meeting.

 



 

(b) In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any
rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change,
conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action,
the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not
precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted,
and which record date shall not be more than sixty (60) days prior to such
action. If no such record date is fixed, the record date for determining
stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day
on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.

 



 

(c) Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation, in order
that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to express
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of
Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Directors, and which record date shall not be more than ten (10) days after
the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the
Board of Directors. If no record date for determining stockholders entitled to
express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting is fixed by
the Board of Directors, (i) when no prior action of the

       
 

 



 

Board of Directors is required by law, the record date for such purpose shall
be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action
taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation in accordance
with applicable law, and (ii) if prior action by the Board of Directors is
required by law, the record date for such purpose shall be at the close of
business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution
taking such prior action.

 



 

Section 1.9 **_List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote_**. The officer who has
charge of the stock ledger shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days
before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders
entitled to vote at the meeting (provided, however, if the record date for
determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than ten (10) days
before the date of the meeting, the list shall reflect the stockholders
entitled to vote as of the tenth (10th) day before the meeting date), arranged
in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the
number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall
be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the
meeting for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting (a) on a
reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information
required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of meeting or
(b) during ordinary business hours at the principal place of business of the
corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then a list of
stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting shall be produced and kept at the
time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be
examined by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held
solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to
the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a
reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to
access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. Except as
otherwise provided by law, the stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to
who are the stockholders entitled to examine the list of stockholders required
by this _Section 1.9_ or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of
stockholders.

 



 

Section 1.10 **_Action By Written Consent of Stockholders_**. Unless otherwise
restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation, any action required or
permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders may
be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a
consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be
signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum
number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a
meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted
and shall be delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office
in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or
agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which minutes of
proceedings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the corporations
registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without
a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall, to the extent required
by law, be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing and
who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to
notice of the meeting if the record date for notice of such meeting had been
the date that written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to
take the action were delivered to the corporation.

 



 

Section 1.11 **_Inspectors of Election_**. The corporation may, and shall if
required by law, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or
more inspectors of election, who may be employees of the corporation, to act
at the meeting or any adjournment thereof and to

      
 

 



 

make a written report thereof. The corporation may designate one or more
persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. In
the event that no inspector so appointed or designated is able to act at a
meeting of stockholders, the person presiding at the meeting shall appoint one
or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon
the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath to execute
faithfully the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to
the best of his or her ability. The inspector or inspectors so appointed or
designated shall (a) ascertain the number of shares of capital stock of the
corporation outstanding and the voting power of each such share, (b) determine
the shares of capital stock of the corporation represented at the meeting and
the validity of proxies and ballots, (c) count all votes and ballots, (d)
determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of
any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors, and (e) certify
their determination of the number of shares of capital stock of the
corporation represented at the meeting and such inspectors count of all votes
and ballots. Such certification and report shall specify such other
information as may be required by law. In determining the validity and
counting of proxies and ballots cast at any meeting of stockholders of the
corporation, the inspectors may consider such information as is permitted by
applicable law. No person who is a candidate for an office at an election may
serve as an inspector at such election.

 



 

Section 1.12 **_Conduct of Meetings_**. The date and time of the opening and
the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote
at a meeting shall be announced at the meeting by the person presiding over
the meeting. The Board of Directors may adopt by resolution such rules and
regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall deem
appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations
as adopted by the Board of Directors, the person presiding over any meeting of
stockholders shall have the right and authority to convene and (for any or no
reason) to recess and/or adjourn the meeting, to prescribe such rules,
regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such
presiding person, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such
rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or
prescribed by the presiding person of the meeting, may include, without
limitation, the following: (a) the establishment of an agenda or order of
business for the meeting; (b) rules and procedures for maintaining order at
the meeting and the safety of those present; (c) limitations on attendance at
or participation in the meeting to stockholders entitled to vote at the
meeting, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons
as the presiding person of the meeting shall determine; (d) restrictions on
entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and
(e) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants.
The presiding person at any meeting of stockholders, in addition to making any
other determinations that may be appropriate to the conduct of the meeting,
shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a
matter or business was not properly brought before the meeting and if such
presiding person should so determine, such presiding person shall so declare
to the meeting and any such matter or business not properly brought before the
meeting shall not be transacted or considered. Unless and to the extent
determined by the Board of Directors or the person presiding over the meeting,
meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with
the rules of parliamentary procedure.

 **ARTICLE V** ** 
Stock**

 



 

Section 5.1 **_Certificates_**. The shares of the corporation shall be

corporation for any purpose until it shall have been entered in the stock
records of the corporation by an entry showing from and to whom

      
 

 



 

transferred. The Board of Directors may appoint, or authorize any officer or
officers to appoint, one or more transfer agents and one or more registrars.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VI** ** 
Indemnification**

 



 

Section 6.1 **_Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings other than
Those by or in the Right of the Corporation_**. Subject to _Section 6.3_, the
corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened
to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other
than an action by or in the right of the corporation), by reason of the fact
that such person is or was a director or officer of the corporation, or is or
was a director or officer of the corporation serving at the request of the
corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses
(including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such
action, suit or proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner
such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests
of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding,
had no reasonable cause to believe such persons conduct was unlawful. The
termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement,
conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of
itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in
a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the
best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such persons conduct was
unlawful.

 



 

Section 6.2 **_Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings by or in
the Right of the Corporation_**. Subject to _Section 6.3_, the corporation
shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a
party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the
right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the
fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the corporation, or
is or was a director or officer of the corporation serving at the request of
the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against
expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such
person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if
such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation;
except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or
matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the
corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall
determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in
view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and
reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery
or such other court shall deem proper.

 



 

Section 6.3 **_Authorization of Indemnification_**. Any indemnification under
this _Article VI_ (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the
corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that
indemnification of the present or former director or officer is proper in the
circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of

      
 

 



 

conduct set forth in _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.2_, as the case may be.
Such determination shall be made, with respect to a person who is a director
or officer at the time of such determination, (a) by a majority vote of the
directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though
less than a quorum, or (b) by a committee of such directors designated by a
majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (c) if
there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent
legal counsel in a written opinion or (d) by the stockholders. Such
determination shall be made, with respect to former directors and officers, by
any person or persons having the authority to act on the matter on behalf of
the corporation. To the extent, however, that a present or former director or
officer of the corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in
defense of any action, suit or proceeding described above, or in defense of
any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against
expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such
person in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the
specific case.

 



 

Section 6.4 **_Good Faith Defined_**. For purposes of any determination under
_Section 6.3_, a person shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a
manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the corporation, or, with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe such persons conduct
was unlawful, if such persons action is based on the records or books of
account of the corporation or another enterprise, or on information supplied
to such person by the officers of the corporation or another enterprise in the
course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the corporation
or another enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to
the corporation or another enterprise by an independent certified public
accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care by
the corporation or another enterprise. The provisions of this _Section 6.4_
shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the circumstances
in which a person may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct
set forth in _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.2_, as the case may be.

 



 

Section 6.5 **_Indemnification by a Court_**. Notwithstanding any contrary
determination in the specific case under _Section 6.3_, and notwithstanding
the absence of any determination thereunder, any director or officer may apply
to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or any other court of
competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware for indemnification to the
extent otherwise permissible under _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.2_. The basis
of such indemnification by a court shall be a determination by such court that
indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances
because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in
_Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.2_, as the case may be. Neither a contrary
determination in the specific case under _Section 6.3_ nor the absence of any
determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a
presumption that the director or officer seeking indemnification has not met
any applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any application for
indemnification pursuant to this _Section 6.5_ shall be given to the
corporation promptly upon the filing of such application. If successful, in
whole or in part, the director or officer seeking indemnification shall also
be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such application.

 



 

Section 6.6 **_Expenses Payable in Advance_**. Expenses (including attorneys
fees) incurred by a director or officer in defending any civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by
the corporation in advance of the final disposition of

      
 

 



 

such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf
of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be
determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the
corporation as authorized in this _Article VI_. Such expenses (including
attorneys fees) incurred by former directors and officers or other employees
and agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the
corporation deems appropriate.

 



 

Section 6.7 **_Nonexclusivity of Indemnification and Advancement of
Expenses_**. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or
granted pursuant to, this _Article VI_ shall not be deemed exclusive of any
other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses
may be entitled under the Certificate of Incorporation, these bylaws,
agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both
as to action in such persons official capacity and as to action in another
capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of the corporation
that indemnification of the persons specified in _Section 6.1_ and _Section
6.2_ shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law. The provisions of
this _Article VI_ shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any
person who is not specified in _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.2_ but whom the
corporation has the power or obligation to indemnify under the provisions of
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or otherwise.

 



 

Section 6.8 **_Insurance_**. The corporation may purchase and maintain
insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer of the
corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the corporation serving at
the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person
in any such capacity, or arising out of such persons status as such, whether
or not the corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify
such person against such liability under the provisions of this _Article VI_.

references to "the corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting
corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a
constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate
existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its
directors or officers, so that any person who is or was a director or officer
of such constituent corporation, or is or was a director or officer of such
constituent corporation serving at the request of such constituent corporation
as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position
under the provisions of this _Article VI_ with respect to the resulting or
surviving corporation as such person would have with respect to such
constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued. The term
"another enterprise" as used in this _Article VI_ shall mean any other
corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or
other enterprise of which such person is or was serving at the request of the
corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent. For purposes of this
_Article VI_, references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed
on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and references to
"serving at the request of the corporation" shall include any service as a
director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation which imposes duties
on, or involves services by, such director or officer with respect to an
employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who

the interest of the participants and

       
 

 



 

beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a
manner "not opposed to the best interests of the corporation" as referred to
in this _Article VI_.

 



 

Section 6.10 **_Survival of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_**.
The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted
pursuant to, this _Article VI_ shall, unless otherwise provided when

the corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify any director or officer
(or his or her heirs, executors or personal or legal representatives) or
advance expenses in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated
by such person unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or
consented to by the Board of Directors of the corporation.

 



 

Section 6.12 **_Indemnification of Employees and Agents_**. The corporation

 **FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:**

 



 

 **MDA to Acquire DigitalGlobe, Creating Industry Leader in End-to-End Space
Systems, Earth Imagery and Geospatial Solutions**

 



 

 _Combination to Offer Enhanced, Value-Added Services to Commercial and
Government Customers Worldwide_

 



 

 _Creates Leading Provider of Satellites, Earth Imagery, Geospatial Data
Solutions and Analytics_

 



 

 _Expands Market Access, Increases Scale, and Diversifies Revenue and
Customer Base_

 



 

 _Transaction Expected to be Accretive to Operating Earnings per Share in
2018, Anticipated to Deliver C$75-150M in Run-Rate Synergies by 2019_

 



 

 _Provides DigitalGlobe Shareowners with Immediate Cash Value and Opportunity
to Participate in Upside Potential of Combined Company_

 



 

 **SAN FRANCISCO and WESTMINSTER, Colo.**  February 24, 2017  MacDonald,
Dettwiler and Associates Ltd. ("MDA") (TSX: MDA), a global communications and
information company providing technology solutions to commercial and
government organizations worldwide, and DigitalGlobe, Inc. ("DigitalGlobe")
(NYSE: DGI), the global leader in Earth imagery and information about our
changing planet, today announced they have entered into a definitive merger
agreement, pursuant to which MDA will acquire DigitalGlobe for US$35.00 per
share in a combination of cash and stock. The transaction values DigitalGlobe
at an equity value of approximately C$3.1 billion (US$2.4 billion), and an
enterprise value of C$4.7 billion (US$3.6 billion), including assumption of
DigitalGlobes C$1.6 billion (US$1.2 billion) in net debt. The transaction has
been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies, and is
expected to close in the second half of 2017.

 



 

Under the terms of the agreement, each DigitalGlobe common share will be
exchanged for US$17.50 in cash and 0.3132 MDA common shares, representing a
per share value of US$17.50

      
 

 



 

based on MDAs unaffected closing share price of C$73.40 on the Toronto Stock
Exchange (TSX) on February 16, 2017, the day prior to market speculation about
a potential combination, and a C$/US$ exchange ratio of 0.7612. The total cash
and stock per share value consideration represents an 18% premium based on
DigitalGlobes unaffected closing stock price on the New York Stock Exchange
(NYSE) on February 16, 2017.

 



 

The combination will bring together complementary space-related capabilities,
creating a stronger company uniquely positioned to capture growth in the U.S.,
Canadian and global Earth observation and geospatial services markets given
its ability to provide complete, end-to-end space systems, earth imagery and
geospatial solutions. Together, the combination will leverage a full suite of
space-related capabilities, including communications and Earth observation
satellites and robotics, ground stations, integrated electro-optical and radar
imagery, and advanced data analytics. Additionally, the combined company will
lead in cloud-based information services that allow commercial and government
customers worldwide to better understand activity across the changing planet.

 



 

As part of the transaction, MDA will apply to list its shares on the NYSE in
addition to the TSX. Upon completion of the transaction, the combined Company
will continue to execute its U.S. Access Plan strategy. This will include
further reorganization of all or part of the combined Companys corporate and
operating structure to ensure that the ultimate parent of DigitalGlobe is
incorporated in the U.S. by the end of 2019, subject to customary approvals.
MDA undertook a corporate reorganization in 2016 that included the formation
of SSL MDA Holdings, Inc. ("SSL MDA Holdings"), the U.S. Operating Company of
MDA, under the guidance and approval of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD).
SSL MDA Holdings currently operates under a Security Control Agreement (SCA)
with DoD, allowing it to pursue and execute U.S. Government programs that
require security clearances.

 



 

"Todays announcement creates a new company that will lead the industry,
offering space systems and imaging solutions from inception to execution, able
to make design decisions with our customers needs in mind," said Howard L.
Lance, president and chief executive officer of MDA. "This combination has the
scale, resources and technology to serve the large and increasingly complex
needs of government and commercial customers globally. By combining MDA and
DigitalGlobe, we are significantly expanding our total addressable market by
broadening both companies capabilities and facilitating future growth."

 



 

Lance continued, "MDA remains fully committed to its enduring and valued
partnership with the Canadian Government and our Canadian employees. This
combination offers the opportunity to deliver future economic and job growth
in both Canada and the United States, as we focus on driving sustainable
revenue expansion from our investments and create value for all our
stakeholders."

 



 

Lance further stated, "The transaction is a major step forward in our
previously announced U.S. Access Plan. We are committed to serving the U.S.
Government as a mission-critical partner

      
 

 



 

with an expanded portfolio of end-to-end solutions. DigitalGlobe will operate
as a stand-alone division under SSL MDA Holdings, in the same way as SSL and
MDAs Canadian businesses."

 



 

Jeffrey R. Tarr, president and chief executive officer of DigitalGlobe, said,
"Following a thorough review of strategic alternatives, we believe that
joining forces with MDA will enable us to deliver more value to our customers,
expand opportunities for our team members and maximize value for shareowners.
This compelling transaction will deliver immediate cash value to shareowners
with further upside through ownership in the combined entity, position
DigitalGlobe to reach its next phase of growth and provide greater
opportunities for our team members by being part of a larger, more diversified
company."

 



 

Tarr continued, "Upon completing the transaction, DigitalGlobe will accelerate
our vision of being the leading source of information about our changing
planet. We look forward to working with the MDA team to ensure a seamless
transition and to realize the potential of this exciting combination."

 



 

 **COMPLEMENTARY CAPABILITIES AND UNMATCHED SERVICES**

 



 

MDA is one of Canadas leading technology companies, and has provided
government and commercial customers with innovative space systems and
solutions for decades. Since its founding more than 60 years ago in Palo Alto,
Calif., MDAs subsidiary company SSL (Space Systems Loral) has been the
recognized global leader in communications satellite design and manufacturing.
SSLs global customers operate more than 85 communications satellites in
geostationary orbit. SSL also produces small satellites for Earth observation
and communications applications. In addition, SSL executes programs for NASA
and other U.S. Government agencies, and was recently awarded two U.S.
Government spacecraft program contracts for NASA, including Restore-L and
Psyche. MDA Information Systems, based in Gaithersburg, Md. and Ypsilanti,
Mich., is a leading provider of geospatial processing solutions and mission
systems to U.S. Government and commercial customers. MDA in Canada is the
leading supplier of radar satellites, geospatial services, integrated systems
and robotics to the Canadian Department of National Defence (DND), the
Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and commercial customers through its operations in
Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, and Halifax.

 



 

DigitalGlobe brings to the combined company the industrys most sophisticated
satellite imaging constellation, a 17-year time-lapse image library, a world-
class ground infrastructure, and a growing ecosystem of geospatial content
producers and consumers leveraging artificial intelligence and machine
learning to address complex global problems at scale. DigitalGlobe recently
acquired The Radiant Group, which dramatically expands its capabilities in
advanced geospatial expertise and analytics. DigitalGlobe is a trusted mission
partner to the U.S. Government and friendly foreign governments, serving
customers in 90 countries around the globe and a diverse set of industry-
leading commercial customers that rely on the highest quality imagery and
advanced geospatial expertise to make decisions with confidence. The

      
 

 



 

company is engaged in extending its industry lead through its investment in
its next generation constellation, WorldView-Legion, and its partnership with
KACST and TAQNIA Space to build a fleet of small satellites, SCOUT, which will
allow the company to image the most rapidly changing places on Earth up to 40
times per day.

 



 

 **STRATEGIC AND FINANCIAL BENEFITS OF THE COMBINATION**

 



 

The combination of MDA and DigitalGlobes technology offer attractive vertical
integration benefits, including lower costs, increased speed-to-market and
enhanced analytics capabilities. Combining MDAs leadership in satellite
design and manufacturing, radar capabilities, ground systems and systems
engineering with DigitalGlobes world-leading constellation, archive, platform
and advanced geospatial expertise and analytics will drive value and open
channels for growth in adjacent markets. MDAs industry-leading technology in
large and small satellites and ground stations will enhance DigitalGlobes
future constellations, positioning the combined company to extend its lead in
the collection, dissemination and analysis of commercial Earth imagery
collected with unrivaled resolution, accuracy, revisit and refresh of the most
rapidly changing places on the planet.

 



 

The transaction is expected to be accretive to MDAs Operating EPS in 2018 and
the combined company will deliver meaningful revenue and cost synergies of
C$75-150 million on a run-rate basis by 2019. Revenue synergies include
accelerating SSLs penetration into U.S. Government markets, international
market expansion, cross-selling opportunities and the ability to target larger
geospatial services contract awards. Cost synergies include elimination of
duplicative public company costs, procurement cost savings, efficiencies
gained by leveraging SSLs manufacturing capabilities for future Earth
observation satellite constellations, and the operational benefits of
increased scale.

 



 

 **LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE**

 



 

Mr. Lance, president and chief executive officer of MDA and president and
chief executive officer of SSL MDA Holdings, will lead the combined company.
Mr. Lances extensive experience in the global aerospace, defense and security
markets will help guide and inform the transition and will position the
combined company to capture growing demand for end-to-end space systems
solutions.
