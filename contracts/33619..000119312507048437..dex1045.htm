3.5.1 Not later than 90 calendar days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser
shall, at the sole cost of the Purchaser (which, for greater certainty and
without limitation, shall not be accrued as a Current Liability on the
Closing Date Balance Sheet), acting in good faith and using all reasonable
efforts, cause (i) a consolidated unaudited balance sheet of the Corporation
as at the close of business on the day preceding the Closing Date to be
prepared and delivered to the Vendors Representative, which balance sheet
shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
as defined in section 1.6, (the "Closing Date Balance Sheet") and (ii) a
Closing Date adjusted working capital statement based on the Closing Date
Balance Sheet in the form of the Target Working Capital Statement, which
statement was prepared on a basis consistent with the indicative calculation
described in Schedule 3.5.1 (such Closing Date adjusted working capital
statement as finally determined referred to as the "Closing Date Statement")
(provided that for greater certainty and without limitation, the Target
Working Capital Statement is based upon the Target Balance Sheet except that
the value of cash and cash equivalents is equal to $0, in determining the
Closing Date Statement the full value of all

to a request for confidential treatment filed separately with the Commission. \- 29 -



 

 cash and cash equivalents as at the close of business on the day preceding
the Closing Date will be included as a Current Asset, and provided further
that the value of any tax deductions generated by the payment of Corporation
Costs or Indebtedness at the Closing will not serve to reduce the
Corporation\'s Tax liability on the Closing Date Statement. The Purchaser
acknowledges that PriceWaterhouseCoopers, the current auditor of the
Corporation, may act as the Vendors accountants pursuant to these provisions,
including in respect of the review and evaluation of the Closing Date Balance
Sheet and the Closing Date Statement, and the settlement of any Closing Date
Statement Dispute.

delivered by the Purchaser to the Vendors Representative through the date
such statement is finally determined, the Purchaser shall (subject to
receiving the usual and customary release letters) provide the Vendors
Representative and the Vendors Representatives accountants reasonable access
to its (and, if applicable, its accountants) work papers in connection with
the preparation or review of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing
Date Statement. Access to the Purchasers (and, if applicable its
accountants) working papers will be on the basis that liability of the
Purchaser and its advisors, including its auditors, is denied and so
acknowledged by the Vendors Representative.

3.5.3 If the Vendors Representative notifies the Purchaser that
the Vendors Representative agrees with the Closing Date Statement within 30
days after receipt thereof or fails to deliver notice to the Purchaser of its
disagreement therewith within such 30 day period, the Closing Date Statement,
and the Closing Date Balance Sheet as it pertains to the accuracy of any
amount reflected in the Closing Date Statement, be conclusive and binding on
the Vendors and the Purchaser and the parties shall be deemed to have agreed
thereto, in the first case, on the date the Purchaser receives the notice
and, in the second case, on such 30th day. If the Vendors Representative,
acting in good faith, believes the Closing Date Statement, or the Closing Date
Balance Sheet as it pertains to the accuracy of any amount reflected in the
Closing Date Statement, has not been prepared in accordance with the
provisions of section 3.5.1, then the Vendors Representative shall notify the
Purchaser of its disagreement with the Closing Date Statement, or the Closing
Date

 Balance Sheet as it pertains to the accuracy of any amount reflected in the
Closing Date Statement, within such 30 day period together with
reasonable particulars of the basis of such dispute, including the Vendors
Representatives position of the amounts in dispute (and the resulting
Purchasers position of Closing Date Working Capital). In such event, the
Vendors Representative and the Purchaser shall attempt, in good faith, to
resolve their differences with respect thereto within 15 days after the
Vendors Representatives notice of disagreement.

3.5.4 Any disagreement over the Closing Date Statement, or the Closing Date
Balance Sheet as it pertains to the accuracy of any amount reflected in the
Closing Date Statement, (a "Closing Date Statement Dispute") on the basis
referred to in section 3.5.3 not resolved by the Vendors Representative and
the Purchaser within such 15 day period shall be submitted to an independent
nationally recognized accounting firm (the "Arbitrator"), other than the
Purchasers accountants or PriceWaterhouseCoopers (or such other accounting
firm selected by the Vendors Representative pursuant to section 3.5.1), to
determine such dispute with respect to the Closing Date Statement, or the
Closing Date Balance Sheet as it pertains to the accuracy of any amount
reflected in the Closing Date Statement, and such determination shall be
final and binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or
review. If the Vendors Representative and the Purchaser are unable to agree
upon an accounting firm to serve as the arbitrator, a representative of
an accounting firm selected by the Vendors Representative and a
representative of the Purchasers accountants selected by the Purchaser shall
select an independent nationally recognized accounting firm (other than
themselves and PriceWaterhouseCoopers) to be such Arbitrator. The Arbitrator
shall allow the Vendors Representative, on behalf of the Vendors, and the
Purchaser to present their respective positions regarding the dispute
(provided that, for greater certainty, such presentations are limited to
matters relating to the Closing Date Statement, or the Closing Date Balance
Sheet as it pertains to the accuracy of any amounts reflected in the Closing
Date Statement), and each of the Vendors Representative and the Purchaser
shall have the right to present additional documents, materials and other
information, and make an oral presentation to the Arbitrator, regarding such
dispute and the Arbitrator shall consider such additional documents,
materials and

to a request for confidential treatment filed separately with the Commission. \- 31 -



 

 other information and such oral presentation. Any such other documents,
materials or other information shall be copied to each of the
Vendors Representative and the Purchaser and each of the Vendors
Representative and the Purchaser shall be entitled to attend any such oral
presentation. The Arbitrator shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
complete its work within 30 calendar days of its engagement. The fees and
disbursements of the Arbitrator shall be paid by the party whose determination
of Closing Date Working Capital is furthest from the Arbitrators
determination.

Closing Date Statement (or are deemed to have agreed to the Closing Date
Statement) or on the 2nd Business Day following the date on which a
determination of a Closing Date Statement Dispute is made pursuant to section
3.5 (the "Settlement Date"), the amounts set out in section 3.5.1 shall be
determined and the payments contemplated by section 3.2.6 shall be made based
on the Share Purchase Price as finally determined, subject to withholding. To

 the consents and approvals referred to in Schedule 6.9. If, notwithstanding
such efforts, the Corporation is unable to obtain any of such consents
and approvals, the Corporation shall not be liable to the Purchaser for any
breach of covenant. For the purposes hereof, the Corporation shall not be
required to pay any monies or give any other consideration in order to obtain
any consent or approval, other than payments in respect of reasonable legal
fees incurred by third parties in connection with a request for a consent or
approval and the expenses of the Corporation (including the fees and
disbursements of the Corporations Counsel) in obtaining such consents and
approvals. If upon completion of the transactions contemplated hereby any of

the Vendors Representative shall continue after the Closing to use
reasonable efforts for a period of up to 30 days as requested by the Purchaser
from time to time in order to attempt to obtain any such consent or approval.

The Purchaser shall, at the request of the Vendors Representative, promptly
furnish the Vendors Representative with copies of such documents and

the Vendors Representative may reasonably request in connection with the
obtaining of any consents contemplated by this Agreement.

expense, for _bona fide_ business purposes and during usual business hours,
upon reasonable prior notice to the Purchaser, all relevant books and records
relating to any Tax filing, Tax audit or litigation associated with the period
up to the Closing Date. The Purchaser shall retain and preserve all books and
records relating to any pre-Closing Tax filing, Tax audit or litigation for
such 7 year period.



   6.11 | Cooperation

6.11.2 Without limiting the generality of section 6.11.1, the Purchaser
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in good faith with

reorganization by the Vendors and the Corporation, including with respect to
its shareholdings in the Corporation, provided that such reorganization will
not adversely affect the Corporation, the Business or the Purchaser.



   6.12 | Insurance and Indemnification 
---|--- 

The Purchaser agrees that for the period from the Closing Date until six
years after the Closing Date, Purchaser will cause the Corporation or any
successor to the Corporation to maintain the Corporations current directors
and officers insurance policy or an equivalent policy subject in either case
to terms and conditions no less advantageous to the directors and officers of
the Corporation or any of the Subsidiaries than those contained in the policy
in effect on the date hereof, for all present and former directors of the
Corporation, any of the Subsidiaries or any predecessor covering claims made
prior to or within six years after the Closing Date, and the Purchaser shall
provide the Vendors Representative, acting reasonably, with evidence as to
the satisfaction by the Purchaser of these covenants. Purchaser also agrees
after the expiration of such six year period to use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause such directors and officers to be covered by
the Corporations then existing directors and officers insurance policy, if
any. Purchaser agrees that all rights to indemnification or exculpation now
existing in favour of present or former directors or officers of the
Corporation or any of the Subsidiaries as provided in its articles of
incorporation or by-laws, as amended, or indemnification agreements, in effect
on the date hereof shall survive the Closing and shall continue in full force
and effect for a period of not less than six years from the Closing Time.

    6.14 | Charges 
---|--- 

The Corporation shall obtain releases of all Charges relating to
Indebtedness, other than Permitted Charges.



   6.15 | Tax Matters 
---|--- 

6.15.1 Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared, on a basis
consistent with prior returns (to the extent permitted by applicable Laws),
and timely file or caused to be timely filed all Tax Returns of
the Corporation and each CMC Subsidiary for all periods ending on or prior to
the Closing Date which are to be filed after the Closing Date. Thirty days
prior to filing such Tax Returns, the Purchaser shall inform the Vendors
Representative in writing (the "Tax Notice") of such filing and shall provide
the Vendors Representative with a copy of the Tax Return and any relevant
working papers.

6.15.1.1 If the Vendors Representative notifies the Purchaser that the
Vendors Representative agrees with the filing of such Tax Return or fails to
deliver notice to the Purchaser of its disagreement therewith within 20 days
of receipt of the Tax Notice, the Vendors Representative and the Purchaser
shall issue a joint direction to the Escrow Agent within thirty (30) days
after the date on which such Taxes are paid to release from the Escrow Amount
the amount of any Taxes of the Corporation and each CMC Subsidiary reflected
on such Tax Returns to the extent such Taxes are in excess of the reserve for
Taxes in the Closing Date Balance Sheet.

6.15.1.2 If the Vendors Representative, acting in good faith, believes
that such Tax Returns are inaccurate, the Vendors Representative shall
notify in writing the Purchaser of its disagreement, within 20 days after
receipt thereof, together with reasonable particulars of the basis of such
disputes. The Vendors Representative and the Purchaser shall attempt, in
good faith, to resolve their differences with respect thereto within fifteen
(15) days after the Vendors Representatives notice of disagreement. To the
extent that the Vendors\' Representative and the Purchaser are unable to
agree, the dispute may be referred



 

[ * ] designates portions of this document that have been omitted pursuant
to a request for confidential treatment filed separately with the Commission. \- 91 -



 

 by either party for determination by arbitration in a similar manner as
contemplated by section 3.5.4. Once the dispute is settled amongst the
Vendors\' Representative and the Purchaser or determined by the Arbitrator,
the Purchaser and the Vendors Representative shall, if applicable, issue a
joint-direction, consistent with the settlement or determination, as the case
may be, to release from the Escrow Amount, the amount so determined.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser may cause such Tax Returns to be
filed; however, such filing would be without prejudice to Vendors right to
dispute the Taxes payable.

6.15.2 Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared, on a basis consistent
with prior returns to the extent consistent with applicable Law, and file or
cause to be filed all Tax Returns of the Corporation and each CMC Subsidiary
for tax periods that begin before the Time of Closing on the Closing Date and
end after the Time of Closing on the Closing Date. Purchaser shall permit the
Vendors\' Representative to review and comment upon such Tax Returns prior to
filing. The procedures set out in section 6.15.1 with respect to the review
and dispute, if any, of such Tax Returns and amount of Tax which relates to
the portion of such taxable period ending on the Closing Date, shall apply
_mutatis mutandis_.

6.15.3 Any Tax sharing or similar agreements with respect to or involving
the Corporation or any CMC Subsidiary shall be terminated as of the Closing
Date and, after the Closing Date, neither the Corporation nor any CMC
Subsidiary shall be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

6.15.4 Purchaser, the Corporation and each CMC Subsidiary, the Vendors and
Vendors Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other party, in connection of the filing of Tax Returns
pursuant to this section 6.15 and any audit, litigation or other proceeding
with respect to Taxes of the Corporation or any CMC Subsidiary. Purchaser and
the Vendors Representative further agree, upon request, to use reasonable
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any governmental body



 

[ * ] designates portions of this document that have been omitted pursuant
to a request for confidential treatment filed separately with the Commission. \- 92 -



 

 or any other person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any
Tax that could be imposed.

6.15.5 For purposes of this Agreement, Taxes shall be computed based on the
closing of the books method as at the Time of Closing on the Closing Date
provided, however, in the case of any Tax imposed on the ownership or holding
of real or personal property, such Taxes shall be prorated based on the
percentage of the actual period to which such Taxes relate that precedes
the Closing Date. The Purchaser shall cause the Corporation and CMC
Electronics to make the election provided in subsection 256(9) of the ITA and
any corresponding provincial taxing legislation.



   6.16 | Non-Solicit of Employees 
---|--- 

The ONCAP Parties shall not for a period commencing on the date hereof and
ending on the second anniversary of the Closing Date, without the prior
written approval of the Purchaser:



     | (a) | solicit for employment, either directly or through agents,
any Key Employee; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | direct any of their operating companies to solicit for
employment, either directly or through agents, any Key Employee; 
---|---|--- 
provided that (A) the ONCAP Parties shall not be precluded from soliciting or
hiring any employee of the Corporation or the CMC Subsidiaries who: (i)
responds to any public announcement or general solicitation (including a non-
directed solicitation by an employment consultant) or (ii) has ceased to be
employed by the Corporation or the CMC Subsidiaries, as the case may be, prior
to the commencement of discussions between such employee and the ONCAP
Parties; and (B) the foregoing non-solicitation provision shall not apply to
any of the operating companies of any of the ONCAP Parties, unless such
operating company was directed by any of the ONCAP Parties to solicit a Key
Employee.

---|---|---

Purchaser or by the Corporation or any CMC Subsidiary as a result of any
breach of representation or warranty



 

[ * ] designates portions of this document that have been omitted pursuant
to a request for confidential treatment filed separately with the Commission. \- 94 -



 

 by that Vendor of section 4.2, provided that Damages from any such Claim are
paid first out of such Vendors Pro Rata share of the Escrow Amount. 



   7.2 | Indemnification by the Purchaser 
---|--- 

The Purchaser shall indemnify and save the Vendors harmless from and against
any Damages suffered by one or more of the Vendors:



     | (a) | as a result of any breach of representation or warranty by
the Purchaser of sections 4.4.1 or 4.4.2; or 
---|---|--- 


     | (b) | associated with any breach of a covenant or agreement of the
Purchaser set forth in this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 


   7.3 | Notice of Claim 
---|--- 

If the Purchaser or the Vendors wish to make a claim for indemnification (a
"Claim") pursuant to this Article 7 (such party or parties herein called the
"Indemnified Party") against one or more Vendors, on the one hand, or the
Purchaser, on the other hand (the party or parties against whom the Claim is
made herein called the "Indemnifying Party"), the Indemnified Party shall
promptly give notice in writing (the "Claim Notice") to the Indemnifying Party
of the Claim. Such notice shall specify whether the Claim originates with the
Indemnified Party (an "Original Claim") or with a Person (a "Third Party
Claimant") other than the Indemnified Party (a "Third Party Claim"), and shall
also specify with reasonable particularity (to the extent that the
information is available):

7.3.1 the factual basis for the Claim (including, in the case of a Third
Party Claim, attaching copies of all relevant pleadings, demands and other
papers served on the Indemnified Party); and

7.3.2 the amount of the Claim, or, if an amount is not then determinable,
an approximate and reasonable estimate of the potential amount of the Claim.

In respect of a Claim by the Purchaser or a Third Party Claimant pursuant to
section 7.1.1, the Vendors Representative shall administer the Claim on
behalf of the Vendors named in the Claim,



 

[ * ] designates portions of this document that have been omitted pursuant
to a request for confidential treatment filed separately with the Commission. \- 95 -



 

 in which circumstances, while liability remains with the Vendors named in
the Claim, the Vendors Representative will be the party entitled to
receive and issue notices and make decisions in respect of any matter related
to the Claim on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties. In respect of a Claim by
the Purchaser pursuant to section 7.1.2, each Vendor named in a Claim shall
administer the Claim itself.



   7.4 | Procedure for Indemnification 
---|--- 

7.4.1 _Original Claims_. Following receipt of notice of an Original Claim
from an Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days to make
such investigation of the Original Claim as the Indemnifying Party considers
necessary or desirable. For the purpose of such investigation, the Indemnified
Party shall make reasonably available to the Indemnifying Party during normal
business hours the information relied upon by the Indemnified Party to
substantiate the Original Claim and the personnel of the Indemnified Party
with knowledge regarding the subject matter of the Original Claim. If the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party agree at or prior to the
expiration of such 30 day period (or any mutually agreed upon extension
thereof) to the validity and amount of the Original Claim, the Indemnifying
Party shall issue a joint direction to the Escrow Agent to release from the
Escrow Amount to the Indemnified Party the full agreed upon amount of the
Original Claim. If the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party do not
agree within such period (or any mutually agreed upon extension thereof), the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party agree that the Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to bring an action in a court of law regarding the Original
Claim.

7.4.2 _Third Party Claims_.

 

7.4.2.1 With respect to any Third Party Claim (other than Tax Claims), the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its own expense, to participate
in or assume control of the negotiation, settlement or defense of the Third
Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume such control within 10
days of receipt of the Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to employ counsel of its choice, reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Party, to defend any such Third Party Claim, provided that the
Indemnified Party shall in any

to a request for confidential treatment filed separately with the Commission. \- 96 -



 

 event have the right to participate, at its own expense, in the defense of
any Third Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party is defending. The
Indemnifying Party, if it shall have assumed the defense of any Third Party
Claim in accordance with the terms thereof, shall have the right, upon thirty
days prior notice to the Indemnified Party, to consent to the entry of
judgment with respect to, or otherwise settle such Third Party Claim;
provided that such judgment or settlement does not impose any obligation on
the Indemnified Party (other than the payment of money that constitutes
Damages which will be paid in full by the Indemnifying Party) or restrict the
action of the Indemnified Party.

7.4.2.2 If the Indemnifying Party does not elect to assume control as
contemplated in section 7.4.2.1 or having elected to assume control as
contemplated in section 7.4.2.1 thereafter fails to defend any such Third
Party Claim within a reasonable time, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled
to assume such control. Subject to the provisions of section 7.5.4.1, the
Indemnifying Party shall be bound by any and all judgments of a court
following a contested proceeding or other settlement that is obtained against
the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim.

7.4.2.3 Whether or not the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend
or prosecute any Claim involving a third party, all the parties accused shall
cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof and shall furnish such
records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may reasonably be requested in
connection therewith, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party.

7.4.2.4 With respect to Third Party Claims asserted by Government Entities
related to Taxes, Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts to notify Vendors
Representative following receipt of any notice of audit or other proceeding
related to any Tax Return filed by the Corporation or any of the CMC
Subsidiaries that cover periods on or before the Closing. Purchaser shall have
the right to represent the Corporation or appropriate CMC Subsidiary regarding
any audit or other  



 

[ * ] designates portions of this document that have been omitted pursuant
to a request for confidential treatment filed separately with the Commission. \- 97 -



 

 proceeding relating to Taxes. Vendors Representative shall have the right,
at its expense, to participate in, but not control the portion of any
such audit or proceeding which relates to Taxes for periods or portions
thereof which end on or prior to the Time of Closing on the Closing Date and
for which the Vendors may be responsible pursuant to this Agreement. Purchaser
shall use reasonable efforts to provide notice to Vendors Representative
with respect to such audit or proceeding and any negotiations related thereto.



   7.5 | Additional Rules and Procedures 
---|--- 

The obligation of the parties to indemnify each other pursuant to this
Article shall also be subject to the following:

7.5.1 No claim for breach of representation and warranty, covenant or
agreement under 7.1.1(a), 7.1.1(b), 7.1.1(d), 7.1.2 or 7.2 shall be valid
unless the party against whom such claim is made has been given notice thereof
before the date on which the applicable representation and warranty, covenant
or agreement shall have terminated pursuant to section 4.5, provided that any
indemnification obligation shall not terminate with respect to any Losses as
to which the Indemnified Party shall have given notice (stating in reasonable
detail the basis of the claim for indemnification) to the Indemnified Party
before termination of the applicable survival period.

7.5.2 Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
other than in respect of the Vendors obligation to indemnify the Purchaser in
respect of (i) a breach of the representations and warranties set forth in
sections 4.1.11 {Tax Matters} and the Ownership of Share Representations; (ii)
pursuant to the Retention Bonus Indemnity, the Moore Claim Indemnity and the
Tax Indemnity; and (iii) Claims based on fraud, a Vendors obligation to
indemnify the Purchaser hereunder shall only apply upon, and to the extent
that, the aggregate of the Claims in respect of which the Vendors are required
to indemnify exceed $1,000,000 (the "Basket Amount"), for greater certainty
the Vendors indemnification obligations under this Agreement shall apply only
to Claims which exceed the Basket Amount.



 

[ * ] designates portions of this document that have been omitted pursuant
to a request for confidential treatment filed separately with the Commission. \- 98 -



 

7.5.3 Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
if the indemnification obligation of the Vendors exceeds $1,000,000 the
Purchaser shall not be entitled to seek indemnification pursuant to Article 7
in connection with any individual Claims or series of related Claims where the
aggregate amount of the Damages to the Purchaser with respect to the
individual Claim or series of related Claims is less than $25,000.

7.5.4 Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary:

7.5.4.1 Subject to sections 7.5.4.2, 7.5.4.3 and 7.5.4.4, in no event shall
the aggregate amount of indemnification obligations of the Vendors, at a
particular point in time, exceed the funds in the Escrow Amount at such time
(the "Indemnification Cap") and claims shall only be satisfied from the Escrow
Amount and in no event shall the aggregate amount of indemnification
obligations of a particular Vendor for Claims in respect of such Vendor
exceed that Vendors Pro Rata Share of the Indemnification Cap.

7.5.4.2 Subject to section 7.5.4.4, the aggregate amount of
indemnification obligation of the Vendors may exceed the Indemnification Cap
(up to a maximum amount of the Share Purchase Price) only in respect of Claims
(i) based on fraud, (ii) in respect of a breach of the representations and
warranties set forth in sections 4.1.11 {TAX MATTERS} and the Ownership of
Shares Representations or (iii) in respect of the Retention Bonus Indemnity
and the Tax Indemnity, provided that any Damages from any such Claim are
first paid out of the Escrow Amount.

7.5.4.3 Subject to section 7.5.4.4, in respect of Claims for breaches of
the representations and warranties set out in section 4.1.10 {ENVIRONMENTAL}
only ("Environmental Claim"), to the extent that one or more Claims is made by
the Purchaser on a date that is on or after the [*] Release Date and before
the expiry of the relevant survival period, the aggregate amount of the
indemnification obligation of the Vendors for Environmental Claims shall not
 



 

[ * ] designates portions of this document that have been omitted pursuant
to a request for confidential treatment filed separately with the Commission. \- 99 -



 

 exceed the Available Escrow Amount as determined on the [*] Release Date
(the "Limit Amount") after delivery of the [*] Claim Amount;
provided however, that (i) in no event shall the indemnification obligations
of a particular Vendor in respect of Environmental Claims under section 4.1.10
exceed such Vendors Pro Rata Share of the Limit Amount and (ii) Damages
in respect of any Environmental Claim are initially paid using funds in the
Escrow Amount.

7.5.4.4 In no event shall a particular Vendors aggregate indemnification
obligation under this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (in
respect of all Claims hereunder where such Claims may exceed the
Indemnification Cap) exceed such Vendors Pro Rata Share of the Share
Purchase Price.

7.5.5 In the event that any Third Party Claim is of a nature such that
the Indemnified Party is required by applicable law to make a payment to any
Person (a "Third Party") with respect to such Third Party Claim before the
completion of settlement negotiations or related legal proceedings, the
Indemnified Party may make such payment and the Indemnifying Party shall, if
otherwise required under the provisions of section 7.5, forthwith after demand
by the Indemnified Party, reimburse the Indemnified Party for any such payment
or if the Vendors are the Indemnifying Party, the Vendors Representative and
the Purchaser shall issue a joint direction to the Escrow Agent to pay such
amount from the Escrow Amount. If the amount of any liability under the Third
Party Claim in respect of which such a payment was made, as finally
determined, is less than the amount which was paid by the Indemnifying Party
to the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall pay such difference to
the Indemnifying Party or as the Indemnifying Party directs. 

7.5.6 The Indemnified Party shall not permit any right of appeal in respect
of any Third Party Claim to terminate without giving the Indemnifying Party
notice thereof and an opportunity to contest such Third Party Claim.

7.5.7 The Purchaser and the Vendors Representative shall reasonably
cooperate with each other with respect to Third Party Claims, shall keep each
other advised with respect



 

[ * ] designates portions of this document that have been omitted pursuant
to a request for confidential treatment filed separately with the Commission. \- 100 -



 

 thereto (including supplying copies of all relevant documentation promptly
as it becomes available) and shall each designate a senior officer who will
keep himself informed about and be prepared to discuss the Third Party Claim
with his counterparts and with counsel at all reasonable times.

7.5.8 In no event shall the Vendors or the Purchaser be liable for punitive
or consequential damages. The Indemnified Party shall take reasonable steps to
mitigate Damages directly or indirectly incurred or sustained by it upon and
after becoming aware of any event which could reasonably be expected to give
rise to Damages.

7.5.9 For greater certainty and without limitation, the Purchaser
acknowledges that Share Purchase Price takes into account all liabilities in
respect of the defined-benefit plans and any other post-retirement
or retirement compensation plans of the Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries and as a result the Vendors shall not in any event be liable for
any Claim in respect of such matters or any adjustment under section 3.5.1
hereunder.

7.5.10 Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement (including,
but not limited to, the appointment of the Vendors Representative at section
6.1 as representative of all the Vendors), the Purchaser and each of the
Vendors acknowledge and agree that the obligations of each of the Vendors
pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement (whether under this Article
7 or otherwise) are several, and are not joint and several. For greater
certainty and without limitation, subject to the limitations on
indemnification obligations set forth in section 7.5 (and in particular the
limitations in section 7.5.4.1), the total liability of a particular Vendor
with respect to a particular Claim under section 7.1.1 shall not exceed such
Vendors Pro Rata Share of the amount of such Claim.

7.5.11 Payments out of the Escrow Amount or, where applicable, by the
Vendors under this Article 7, shall be limited to the amount of any Damage
that remains after deducting therefrom any reserve or indemnity, contribution,
insurance payment, benefit or other similar payment actually recovered by the
Purchaser, the Companies or any Affiliates of Purchaser from any third party
(including, for greater certainty and without limitation, a Governmental
Entity) with respect thereto.



 

[ * ] designates portions of this document that have been omitted pursuant
to a request for confidential treatment filed separately with the Commission. \- 101 -



 

7.5.12 Notwithstanding any other provision, the Vendors shall have no
obligation with respect to any Claim made in connection with a breach of the
representations and warranties set forth in section 4.1.10 {ENVIRONMENTAL} to
the extent the Purchasers claim arises solely out of the voluntary subsurface
investigation of the Purchaser. For the purposes of the foregoing, the term
voluntary subsurface investigation of the Purchaser shall not include (i) the
removal of subsurface structures or equipment (including, without limitation,
tanks or treatment units), (ii) activities associated with the sale, leasing
or financing of the property reasonably required by the lender, purchaser,
lessor or lessee or (iii) any other reasonable activity for which the
Purchaser has a legitimate business purpose other than characterization of
the premises.



   7.6 | Indemnification Claims 
---|--- 

Other than as set out in sections 3.6 and 3.7, the parties agree that Article
7 sets out the sole and exclusive manner by which the Purchaser or the
Corporation may seek a remedy from the Vendors, or by which the Vendors may
seek a remedy from the Purchaser, for any matter in respect of or in
connection with the purchase of the Purchased Shares (including any matter for
which the Purchaser or the Vendors may make a Claim under sections 7.1 and
7.2, respectively, including, for greater certainty, any matter that could be
made a Claim under either of those sections but for sections 7.5.2, 7.5.3 or
7.5.4.



   7.7 | Waiver 
---|--- 

The Vendors, for the benefit of the Corporation and any CMC Subsidiary,
irrevocably waive any claims against the current or former directors or
officers of the Corporation or any CMC Subsidiary.

 accountants, legal advisers or representatives as a result of the Vendors or
the Corporation making the same available in connection with the

required by any stock exchange on which any of the securities of such party or
any of its Affiliates are listed or by any securities commission or other
similar regulatory authority having jurisdiction over such party or any of its
Affiliates, and if such disclosure is required the party making such
disclosure shall use reasonable efforts to give prior oral or written notice
to the other, and if such prior notice is not possible, to give such notice
immediately following the making of such disclosure.



   10.3 | No Shop 
---|--- 

The Vendors and the Corporation hereby agree that they will not, directly or
indirectly, from the date hereof until the earlier of the termination of this

fee associated with the HSR Act and other anti-trust and regulatory filings
in its entirety.

Except as provided in this section, no party may assign its right or benefits
under this Agreement. The Purchaser may, at any time prior to the Time of

this Agreement to any Affiliate of the Purchaser who delivers an instrument

its payment obligations under this Agreement. In the event of an assignment
contemplated above, any reference in this Agreement to "Purchaser" shall
be deemed to include the assignee.
