10    (b) Assumed Liabilities. For all purposes of and under
this Agreement, the term "Assumed Liabilities" shall mean each of the
following Liabilities and no other Liabilities:   (i) all of the Seller\'s
obligations, liabilities and commitments under the Business Contracts
included in the Purchased Assets attributable to the period subsequent to the
Closing;   (ii) all of the current liabilities of the Seller (other

respective terms all of the Excluded Liabilities.   2.3 Consideration for
Purchased Assets.   (a) Consideration. Subject to Section 2.3(b) hereof, the

Subscription Liabilities (as defined in the Subscription Fulfillment
Agreement) of the Magazines as of the Closing Date (the "Subscription
Liability Payment"), and (iii) the assumption by the Purchaser of the Assumed
Liabilities pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof.   (b) Working Capital
Adjustment.   (i) For all purposes of and under this Agreement, the
term "Working Capital" shall mean (A) the aggregate value of the current
assets of the Business included within the Purchased Assets, minus (B) the
aggregate value of the current liabilities of the Business included within
the Assumed Liabilities (not including the Deferred Subscription
Liabilities), each calculated as of the Closing Date in accordance with GAAP
applied in a manner consistent with the preparation of the   
11   Financial Statements and otherwise in a manner consistent with the
calculation of Working Capital as of December 31, 2000 as set forth in
Schedule 2.3(b) hereto (the "December 31, 2000 Working Capital"). Such
aggregate value shall be adjusted, if necessary, to reflect an appropriate
proration of real and personal property Taxes imposed upon any of the
Purchased Assets.   (ii) Not more than five (5) Business Days, but in no
event less than two (2) Business Days, before the Closing, the Seller shall
in good faith prepare and deliver to the Purchaser an estimated unaudited
combined balance sheet of the Business (the "Estimated Closing Balance
Sheet"), dated as of the day immediately preceding the Closing, setting forth
the Seller\'s estimate of the Working Capital. The Seller will make available
to the Purchaser all records and work papers used in preparing the Seller\'s
estimate of the Working Capital and the Purchaser shall notify the Seller of
any good faith disagreement with such calculation. If the Purchaser and the
Seller cannot agree as to an estimate of the Working Capital prior to the
Closing, the estimate of the Working Capital will be deemed to be equal to
the average of the Seller\'s and the Purchaser\'s good faith determinations
thereof. The Working Capital as finally estimated pursuant to this Section
2.3(b)(ii) is referred to herein as the "Estimated Working Capital." The
Purchase Price payable at Closing will be increased on a dollar for dollar
basis by the amount by which the Estimated Working Capital exceeds the
December 31, 2000 Working Capital, or decreased on a dollar for dollar basis
by the amount by which the December 31, 2000 Working Capital exceeds the
Estimated Working Capital.   (iii) As promptly as practicable, but in any
event within sixty (60) calendar days following the Closing, the Seller shall
cause to be prepared and delivered to the Purchaser an unaudited combined
balance sheet of the Business as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Balance
Sheet") and statement relating to the Business (the "Statement of Working
Capital") setting forth the Working Capital as of the Closing (the "Closing
Working Capital"). The Purchaser shall afford the Seller and its agents and
representatives reasonable access to all books, records and work papers in
order to prepare the Closing Balance Sheet and the Statement of Working
Capital.   (iv) If the Purchaser disagrees in good faith with the Statement
of Working Capital, then the Purchaser shall notify the Seller in writing
(the "Notice of Disagreement") of such disagreement within thirty
(30) calendar days following delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Statement of Working Capital. The Notice of Disagreement shall set forth in
reasonable detail the basis for the disagreement described therein.
Thereafter, the Seller and the Purchaser shall attempt in good faith to
resolve and finally determine the amount of the Closing Working Capital. If
the Seller and the Purchaser are unable to resolve the disagreement within
thirty (30) calendar days following delivery of the Notice of Disagreement,
then the Seller and the Purchaser shall select a mutually acceptable,
nationally recognized independent accounting firm that does not then have a
relationship with the Seller or the Purchaser, or any of their respective
Affiliates (the "Independent Accountant"), to resolve the disagreement and
make a determination with respect thereto as promptly as practicable;
provided that if the Seller and the Purchaser cannot agree, the Independent
Accountant shall be selected by an accounting firm designated by
the Purchaser and an accounting firm designated by the    12   Seller.
Such determination will be made, and written notice thereof given to
the Seller and the Purchaser, within thirty (30) calendar days after such
selection. The determination by the Independent Accountant shall be final,
binding and conclusive upon the Seller and the Purchaser. The scope of the
Independent Accountant\'s engagement (which will not be an audit) shall be
limited to the resolution of the disputed items described in the Notice of
Disagreement, and the recalculation, if any, of the Closing Working Capital
in light of such resolution. If an Independent Accountant is engaged pursuant
to this Section 2.3(b)(iv), the fees and expenses of the Independent
Accountant shall be borne equally by the Seller and the Purchaser. Within ten
(10) calendar days after (x) the expiration of the thirty (30) day period
after delivery of the Statement of Working Capital if no Notice of
Disagreement shall have been delivered, (y) the resolution by the Seller and
the Purchaser of the items in any Notice of Disagreement or (z) the delivery
of a notice of determination by the Independent Accountant as described
above, as the case may be, any payment required by Section 2.3(b)(v) hereof
shall be made based on such determination.   (v) After the Closing Working
Capital is finally determined pursuant to Sections 2.3(b)(iii) and (iv):  
(A) in the event that Estimated Working Capital is greater than  the Closing
Working Capital, the Seller shall pay to the  Purchaser an amount in cash
equal to Estimated Working Capital  minus the Closing Working Capital by wire
transfer of  immediately available funds to an account designated by the 
Purchaser; and   (B) in the event that the Closing Working Capital is
greater than  the Estimated Working Capital, the Purchaser shall pay to the 
Seller, an amount equal to the Closing Working Capital, minus  the Estimated
Working Capital by wire transfer of immediately  available funds to an
account designated by the Seller.  Any amount payable by the Purchaser or
the Seller pursuant to this Section 2.3(b)(v) shall include simple interest
thereon at the rate of 8% per annum, calculated on the basis of a 365-day
year, from the Closing Date to the date of payment.   (c) Allocation of
Purchase Price. The consideration for the Purchased Assets provided herein
shall be allocated among the various categories of Purchased Assets in
accordance with their respective fair market values. Within one hundred
twenty (120) days following the Closing, the Purchaser shall provide to the
Seller an allocation among the Purchased Assets in accordance with Section
1060 of the Internal Revenue Code. Such allocation shall be deemed final
unless the Seller has notified the Purchaser of any disagreement with
the allocation within thirty (30) calendar days after submission by the
Purchaser. In the event of such disagreement, the parties hereto shall use
their reasonable efforts to reach agreement on a reasonable allocation of
consideration to such categories of Purchased Assets. If the allocation is
deemed final or the Purchaser and the Seller reach such agreement, the
Purchaser and the Seller (i) shall execute and file all Tax Returns in a
manner consistent with the allocation determined pursuant to this
Section    13   2.3(c) and (ii) shall not take any position before any
Governmental Authority or in any judicial proceeding that is inconsistent
with such allocation. Such agreement shall not be a condition to Closing or a
requirement hereunder. The Seller and the Purchaser shall each timely file a
Form 8594 with the IRS in accordance with the requirements of Section 1060 of
the Internal Revenue Code. In the event that the parties do not agree to a
purchase price allocation then each party hereto shall file its own Form
8594.   2.4 Further Assurances. At and after the Closing, and without
further consideration therefor, (i) the Seller shall execute, or arrange the
execution of, and deliver to the Purchaser such further instruments and
certificates of conveyance and transfer as the Purchaser may reasonably
request in order to more effectively convey and transfer the Purchased Assets
from the Seller to the Purchaser and to put the Purchaser in operational
control of the Business, or for aiding, assisting, collecting and reducing to
possession any of the Purchased Assets and exercising rights with respect
thereto and (ii) the Purchaser shall execute, or shall arrange the execution
of, and deliver to the Seller such further instruments and certificates of
assumption, novation and release as the Seller may reasonably request in
order to effectively make the Purchaser responsible for all Assumed
Liabilities and release the Seller therefrom to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law.   2.5 Assignment of Business Contracts and Business
Licenses. To the extent that transfer or assignment hereunder by the Seller
to the Purchaser of any Business Contract or Business License is not
permitted or is not permitted without the consent or approval of another
Person, this Agreement shall not be deemed to constitute an undertaking to
assign the same if such consent or approval is not given or if such an
undertaking otherwise would constitute a breach thereof or cause a loss of
benefits thereunder. The Seller (and the Purchaser where required) shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any and all such third party
consents or approvals under all Material Business Contracts and Material
Business Licenses; provided, however, that neither the Seller nor the
Purchaser shall be required to pay or incur any cost or expense to obtain any
third party consent or approval that it is not otherwise required to pay or
incur in accordance with the terms of the applicable Material Business
Contract or Material Business License, except for usual legal fees and
expenses. If any such third party consent or approval for the assignment or
transfer of a Material Business Contract is not obtained before the Closing,
the Seller shall cooperate with the Purchaser in any reasonable arrangement
designed to provide for the Purchaser after the Closing the benefits intended
to be assigned to the Purchaser under the applicable Business Contract,
including enforcement at the cost and for the account of the Purchaser of any
and all rights of the Seller against the other party thereto arising out of
the breach or cancellation thereof by such other party or otherwise; provided
that the Purchaser shall (i) undertake to pay or satisfy the corresponding
Liabilities for the enjoyment of such benefit to the extent that the
Purchaser would have been responsible therefor hereunder if such
consent, waiver or approval had been obtained and (ii) indemnify and hold
harmless the Seller and its Affiliates for any costs, expenses or Liabilities
(including legal fees and expenses) incurred by them in connection with the
enforcement of any such Business Contract.    14    ARTICLE III.  THE

available exemption from such Taxes.   6.9 Employees and Employee Benefit
Matters.   (a) The Purchaser shall offer employment as of the Closing Date
to all Business Employees except as set forth on Schedule 6.9. As of the
Closing Date, the Purchaser shall employ each such Business Employee who
accepts the Purchaser\'s offer of employment ("Transferred Employees") at a
compensation level (including salary, bonuses and commissions) that is
generally comparable in the aggregate, and on terms and conditions (and with
employee benefits (including benefits of the type described in Section 3(1)
of ERISA)) that are generally comparable in the aggregate, as those   
29   provided by the Seller (or any Affiliate thereof) until at least the
first anniversary of the Closing Date. The Purchaser shall provide each
Transferred Employee credit for years of service with the Seller (or its
Affiliates) prior to the Closing for the purpose of eligibility, vesting and
coverage (but not for purposes of benefit accrual under defined benefit
plans) under the Purchaser\'s health (including post-retirement welfare
benefit coverage), vacation, severance, sick leave and other employee benefit
plans and policies. In the event that as a result of the Purchaser\'s
termination of the employment of Transferred Employees after the Closing
Date, or for any other reason, the requirements under the Worker Adjustment
and Retraining Notification Act, as amended ("WARN"), are triggered, the
Purchaser shall be responsible for all financial obligations arising as a
result thereof. In addition, the Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that any
decisions respecting the termination of the employment of Transferred
Employees after the Closing Date shall be solely the responsibility of the
Purchaser and the Purchaser shall not consult with or rely upon the Seller,
its Affiliates or their respective agents in making any
such determination.   (b) Without limiting the scope of Section 6.9(a), the
Purchaser shall cause each Transferred Employee (and his or her eligible
dependents) to be covered immediately following the Closing, until the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, by group health plans that provide health
benefits (within the meaning of Section 5000(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue
Code) on terms and conditions that are substantially similar to those
provided under the group health plans in which the Transferred Employee
participated immediately prior to the Closing, provided that such group
health plans (i) do not limit or exclude coverage on the basis of any pre-
existing condition of such Transferred Employee or his or her dependents and
(ii) provide such Transferred Employee full credit for the year during which
the Closing occurs for any deductible already incurred by the Transferred
Employee and his or her dependents under such group health plans and with any
other out-of-pocket expenses that count against any maximum out-of-pocket
expense provision of such group health plans.   (c) If any Transferred
Employee is eligible to take any accrued but unused vacation time pursuant to
the vacation policy applicable to such Transferred Employee immediately prior
to Closing and such Liability is reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet, the
Purchaser shall allow such Transferred Employee to use such accrued vacation,
or to receive payment thereafter upon termination of employment to the extent
such payment would have been made under the Seller\'s vacation policy.  
(d) From the Closing Date until the first anniversary of the Closing Date, if
the Purchaser (or an Affiliate thereof) terminates the employment of
a Transferred Employee with the Purchaser (or an Affiliate thereof) for any
reason that would have given rise to the payment of a severance payment under
The New York Times Company Severance Pay Plan, as set forth on Schedule
4.10(a), the Purchaser shall provide a severance package to such Transferred
Employee containing severance benefits at least equal to those that would
have been paid under The New York Times Company Severance Pay Plan. For
purposes of the preceding sentence, such Transferred Employee will receive
credit for service performed for the Seller (or its Affiliates) prior to
the    30   Closing Date, and service performed for the Purchaser after
the Closing Date, in connection with the determination of such severance
benefit.   (e) The Seller agrees to cooperate with the Purchaser in filing
any applications and forms related to employment Taxes, including annual Form
W-2s and applications for transfer of unemployment experience history.  
6.10 Retention of and Access to Records. From and after the Closing, for
a period of six (6) years the Purchaser shall preserve all Books and
Records transferred by the Seller to the Purchaser pursuant to this
Agreement. Upon the expiration of such six (6) year period, the Purchaser
shall provide the Seller a reasonable opportunity to obtain copies, at the
Seller\'s expense, of any of such Books and Records. As soon as practicable
following the Closing, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller such
financial information relating to the Business in sufficient detail to enable
the Seller to prepare its financial statements, the Statement of Working
Capital and all Tax Returns of the Seller relating to periods ending on or
prior to the Closing Date. In addition to the foregoing, from and after the
Closing, the Purchaser shall afford to the Seller, and its counsel,
accountants and other authorized agents and representatives, during normal
business hours, reasonable access to the employees, Books and Records
and other data relating to the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities,
the Transferred Employees and the Excluded Liabilities in its possession
with respect to periods prior to the Closing, and the right to make copies
and extracts therefrom, to the extent that such access may be reasonably
required by the requesting party (a) to facilitate the investigation,
litigation and final disposition of any claims which may have been or may be
made against any such party or Person, or its Affiliates, (b) for the
preparation of Tax Returns and audits, and (c) for any other reasonable
business purpose.   6.11 Notification of Certain Matters. In the event that
the Seller notifies the Purchaser or the Purchaser otherwise has Knowledge
(in which case it agrees to promptly notify the Seller) on or prior to the
Closing Date of any breach of any representation or warranty of the Seller
that but for this Section 6.11 would entitle the Purchaser to not consummate
the Closing (whether due to facts or events occurring subsequent to the
execution of this Agreement or facts or events that existed on the date
hereof), unless the Seller determines to cure such breach and such breach is
cured by the Seller on or prior to the Closing Date, (x) to the extent the
aggregate cost of remedying such breach is less than or equal to $25,000,000,
the Purchaser shall consummate the Closing with a reduction of the Cash
Payment by such cost; or (y) if the cost of remedying such breach exceeds
$25,000,000, the Purchaser may terminate this Agreement in accordance with
Section 9.1 hereof; or (z) if such breach is not reasonably subject to
meaningful quantification but constitutes a Material Adverse Effect, the
Purchaser may terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.1(d).
In any case, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
whether the Purchaser terminates this Agreement or proceeds to consummate the
Closing, the Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived any and all rights,
remedies or other recourse against the Seller to which the Purchaser might
otherwise be entitled in respect of such breach.    31    6.12
Fulfillment of Current Subscriptions. The Purchaser agrees, as
a representative of the Seller, to discharge all of the Seller\'s obligations
and liabilities for the fulfillment of current subscriptions to the
Magazines, to the extent such obligations and liabilities remain unperformed
or unfulfilled on, or by their terms continue in effect after the Closing
Date, substantially consistent with the Seller\'s past practices, and in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Subscription
Fulfillment Agreement.   ARTICLE VII.  CLOSING CONDITIONS   7.1

individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect.   (b) The Seller shall have performed and complied

Purchaser. (a) After the Closing, the Purchaser agrees to indemnify the
Seller, its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees
and representatives (each, a "Seller Indemnified Party") against and hold
them harmless from and reimburse them for all losses, damages, liabilities
and expenses, including reasonable attorneys\' fees (collectively, "Damages")
which such Seller Indemnified Party may at any time sustain or incur as a
result of or arising out of:    33    (i) the breach of any
representation or warranty of the Purchaser herein or the breach of any
covenant of the Purchaser herein which is to be performed on or before the
Closing Date;   (ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement of the
Purchaser contained herein which is to be performed after the Closing Date;
and   (iii) the Assumed Liabilities.   8.3 Indemnification by the Seller.
(a) After the Closing, the Seller agrees to indemnify the Purchaser, its
Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees and
representatives (each, a "Purchaser Indemnified Party") against and hold them
harmless from and reimburse them for all Damages which such Purchaser
Indemnified Party may at any time sustain or incur as a result of or arising
out of:   (i) the breach of any representation or warranty of the
Seller herein or breach of any covenant of the Seller herein which is to be
performed on or before the Closing Date;   (ii) the breach of any covenant
or agreement of the Seller contained herein which is to be performed after

Date, but subject to Section 8.8).   8.4 Notification of Claims.   (a) A
party entitled to be indemnified pursuant to Section 8.2 or 8.3 (the
"Indemnified Party") shall promptly notify the party or parties liable for
such indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing of any claim
or demand which the Indemnified Party has determined has given or could give
rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement (a "Notice of
Claim"); provided, however, that a delay or failure to provide such notice
shall not relieve any Indemnifying Party of its obligations except to the
extent that it has been prejudiced by such delay or failure. Any Notice of
Claim (i) shall state (with reasonable specificity) the basis on which
indemnification is being asserted, (ii) shall set forth the amount of Damages
for which indemnification is being asserted, and (iii) in the case of third
party claims, shall be accompanied by copies of all relevant pleadings,
demands and other papers served on the Indemnified Party.   (b) If the
Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party of any claim or demand
pursuant to Section 8.2 or 8.3 asserted by a third party, the Indemnifying
Party shall have the right (i) to employ counsel of its choice to defend any
such claim or demand asserted against the Indemnified Party, (ii) to control
and conduct any proceedings or negotiations in connection therewith and
necessary or appropriate to defend the Indemnified Party and (iii) to
take all other steps or proceedings to settle or    34   defend any
such claims, provided that in the case of any settlement that provides for
any relief other than the payment of monetary damages as to which the
Indemnified Party will be indemnified in full, such settlement may only
be made with the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Indemnifying Party
shall notify the Indemnified Party in writing, as promptly as possible after
receipt of the Notice of Claim (but in any case within 30 days of receipt by
the Indemnifying Party of a Notice of Claim or such earlier time necessary to
reasonably allow a timely response to the claim (the "Indemnity Notice
Period")) of its election to defend any such third party claim or demand. In
the event that the Indemnifying Party does assume the defense as provided
above, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in such
defense (including without limitation, with counsel of its choice), at its
own expense, and the Indemnifying Party shall reasonably cooperate with the
Indemnified Party in connection with such participation. If the Indemnifying
Party does not deliver to the Indemnified Party written notice within the
Indemnity Notice Period that the Indemnifying Party will assume the defense
of any such claim or litigation resulting therefrom, the Indemnified Party
may defend against any such claim or litigation in such manner as it may deem
appropriate, at the cost of the Indemnified Party, provided that the
Indemnified Party shall not settle any such claim or litigation without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. In the event that the Indemnifying Party
does not assume the defense as provided above, the Indemnifying Party shall
have the right to participate in such defense (including without limitation,
with counsel of its choice), at its own expense, and the Indemnified Party
shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in connection with
such participation, and in all cases the Indemnified Party shall keep the
Indemnifying Party reasonably informed as to all matters concerning such
third party claim and shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in writing
of any and all significant developments relating thereto.   (c) In the event
that a Notice of Claim hereunder does not involve a third party claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall, within 30 days after the date of receipt of a
Notice of Claim, respond in writing to the Indemnified Party (the "Indemnity
Response") and set forth with reasonable specificity those items, if any, in
the Notice of Claim to which the Indemnifying Party does not agree as well as
the basis upon which such disagreement is founded. Within 30 days following
the receipt of the Indemnity Response by the Indemnified
Party, representatives of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
shall meet to attempt to resolve through good faith negotiations the
applicable disputed matters. The parties shall negotiate in good faith for up
to 30 days in an attempt to reach a settlement of any disputed matter. In the
event that such good faith negotiations are unsuccessful or in the event of
any other dispute under this Article VIII, the parties may proceed in court
to adjudicate the dispute pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement.  
8.5 Limitations.   (a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no
Indemnifying Party shall have any obligation to indemnify any Indemnified
Parties pursuant to Sections 8.2(a)(i) or 8.3(a)(i), and no Indemnified Party
shall make a claim pursuant to Sections    35   8.2(a)(i) or 8.3(a)(i),
unless the aggregate amount of Damages sustained or incurred with respect to
all claims pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i) or Section 8.3(a)(i), as the case
may be, exceeds $4,000,000 (the "Deductible") and then only to the extent of
such excess up to (but not in excess of) a maximum aggregate indemnity for
such Damages payable by the Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i) or the
Seller pursuant to Section 8.3(a)(i), as the case may be, of an amount equal
to $50,000,000 (the "Cap").   (b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, payments by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 8.2 or 8.3
shall be limited to the amount of Damages, if any, that remains after
deducting therefrom (i) any insurance proceeds and any indemnity,
contribution or other similar payment actually recovered by the Indemnified
Parties from any third party with respect thereto, (ii) any provision or
reserve provided for the item in question in the Statement of Working Capital
and (iii) any adjustments to the Purchase Price paid pursuant to Section
2.3(b) in respect of the item in question, provided that any amount deducted
pursuant to any one of the foregoing subsections (i) through (iii) shall not
be also deducted pursuant to any of the other subsections of this Section
8.5(b).   (c) The Seller shall have no liability under any provision of
this Agreement for any Damages to the extent, but only to the extent, that
such Damages relate to actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates after the Closing Date to the extent the Purchaser
had Knowledge that its actions taken or omitted to be taken could reasonably
be expected to give rise to Damages, and in no event shall the Seller be
liable for punitive or consequential damages.   (d) Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, the Purchaser acknowledges that the
obligation of the Seller to provide indemnification for Damages arising out
of Section 8.3 extends only to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, and that
the Seller shall not be obligated to provide such indemnification to any
other Persons.   8.6 Treatment of Indemnity Benefits. All payments made by
the Seller or the Purchaser, as the case may be, to or for the benefit of the
other pursuant to any indemnification obligations under this Agreement shall
be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes and such
agreed treatment shall govern for purposes of this Agreement.   8.7
Exclusive Remedy. The parties hereto hereby acknowledge and agree that the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties and the Seller
Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, from and after the Closing
with respect to Damages and any and all claims for any breach or liability

to the subject matter of this Agreement and the Operative Agreements and
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be solely in
accordance with, and limited by, the indemnification provisions set forth in
this Article VIII. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Purchaser and the
Seller hereby waive on their own behalf and on behalf of each other
applicable Indemnified Party, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action it or they
may have against the Seller or the Purchaser, as the case may   
36   be, arising under or based upon any Federal, state or local Law, rule
or regulation (including without limitation, (i) any such rights, claims or
causes of action arising under or based upon common law or otherwise and (ii)
any and all claims for Damages or contribution arising under any
Environmental Law or securities Laws).   8.8 Remediation Projects. Each
remediation project under Environmental Laws for which the Purchaser shall
seek indemnification under Section 8.3(a)(iii) (each, a "Remediation
Project") shall be planned, conducted, and supervised by environmental
consultants of recognized standing selected by the Purchaser and reasonably
acceptable to the Seller (the "Consultants"). The Purchaser agrees to consult
with the Seller in connection with all Remediation Projects and that any
Remediation Project shall be limited to measures that are reasonably
determined by the Consultants to be applicable to property used
for commercial and/or industrial purposes.   ARTICLE IX.  TERMINATION
