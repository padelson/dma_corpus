(c) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Chief
Financial Officer of the Company shall deliver to the Buyer a good faith
estimate of (i) Closing Working Capital prepared in accordance with the
Working Capital Rules and the resulting Working Capital Overage or Working
Capital Underage (the " _Working Capital Estimate_ "), (ii) the amount of

the Closing Date) an aggregate amount sufficient to pay the Estimated Company
Expenses.

2.3 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(a) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall deliver to
the Seller a statement (the " _Statement_ ") of the Closing Working Capital
and the Assumed Indebtedness, in each case prepared in accordance with the
Working Capital Rules and the Assumed Indebtedness Rules, as applicable. The
Buyer shall not amend, supplement or modify the Statement following its
delivery to the Seller. The Buyer and the Seller acknowledge that no
adjustments shall be made to the Base Amount.

(b) The Statement shall become final and binding upon the parties on the
thirtieth (30th) day following the date on which the Statement was delivered
to the Seller, unless the Seller delivers written notice of its disagreement
with the Statement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to the Buyer prior to such
date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall (i) specify in reasonable detail the
nature of any disagreement so asserted and (ii) only include good faith
disagreements based on Closing Working Capital and/or Assumed Indebtedness not
being calculated in accordance with the Working Capital Rules or the Assumed
Indebtedness Rules, as applicable. If a Notice of Disagreement is received by
the Buyer in a timely manner, then the Statement (as revised

 



11  in accordance with this sentence) shall become final and binding upon the
Seller and the Buyer on the earlier of (A) the date the Seller and the Buyer
resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to the matters
specified in the Notice of Disagreement and (B) the date any disputed matters
are finally resolved in writing by the Accounting Firm. During the fourteen
(14)-day period following the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, the
Seller and the Buyer shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any
differences that they may have with respect to the matters specified in the
Notice of Disagreement. If at the end of such fourteen (14)-day period
the Seller and the Buyer have not resolved in writing the matters specified
in the Notice of Disagreement, the Seller and the Buyer shall submit to an
independent accounting firm (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") for arbitration, in
accordance with the standards set forth in this _Section 2.3_, only matters
that remain in dispute. The Accounting Firm shall be such nationally
recognized independent public accounting firm as shall be agreed upon by the
Seller and the Buyer in writing. The Seller and the Buyer shall use
reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to render a written decision
resolving the matters submitted to the Accounting Firm within thirty (30) days
of the receipt of such submission. The scope of the disputes to be resolved
by the Accounting Firm shall be limited to fixing mathematical errors and
determining whether the items in dispute were determined in accordance with
the Working Capital Rules or the Assumed Indebtedness Rules, as applicable,
and the Accounting Firm is not to make any other determination, including any
determination as to whether the Base Amount, Working Capital Estimate, the
final physical inventory count referenced in _Exhibit B_ (if applicable) or
the Estimated Assumed Indebtedness Amount are correct. The Accounting Firms
decision shall be based solely on written submissions by the Seller and the
Buyer and their respective representatives and not by independent review and
shall be final and binding on all of the parties hereto. The Accounting Firm
may not assign a value greater than the greatest value for such item claimed
by either party or smaller than the smallest value for such item claimed by
either party. Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the
Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the party against which
such determination is to be enforced. The fees and expenses of the Accounting
Firm incurred pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ shall be borne equally as
between the Seller, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand.

(c) For the purposes of this Agreement, " _Final Working Capital_ " means the
Closing Working Capital and " _Final Assumed Indebtedness_ " means the Assumed
Indebtedness, in each case as finally agreed or determined in accordance
with  _Section 2.3(b)_. The Estimated Purchase Price shall be increased (any
such increase, the " _Seller Adjustment Amount_ ") by the _sum_ of (i) the
amount, if any, that the Final Working Capital exceeds the Working Capital
Estimate and (ii) the amount, if any, that the Estimated Assumed Indebtedness
Amount exceeds the Final Assumed Indebtedness. The Estimated Purchase Price
shall be decreased (any such decrease, the " _Buyer Adjustment Amount_ ") by
the _sum_ of (i) the amount, if any, that the Working Capital Estimate exceeds
the Final Working Capital and (ii) the amount, if any, that the Final Assumed
Indebtedness exceeds the Estimated Assumed Indebtedness Amount. If the Seller
Adjustment Amount exceeds the Buyer Adjustment Amount by more than $300,000,
the Buyer shall, within five (5) Business Days after the Final Working Capital
and the Final Assumed Indebtedness are determined, make payment by wire
transfer of

 



12  immediately available funds to the Seller in the amount by which the Seller
Adjustment Amount exceeds the Buyer Adjustment Amount. If the Buyer Adjustment
Amount exceeds the Seller Adjustment Amount by more than $300,000, the Seller
shall, within five (5) Business Days after the Final Working Capital and the
Final Assumed Indebtedness are determined, make payment by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the Buyer in the amount by which the Buyer
Adjustment Amount exceeds the Seller Adjustment Amount. Upon payment of the
amounts provided in this _Section 2.3(c)_, none of the parties hereto may
make or assert any claim under this _Section 2.3_. 

(d) No actions taken by the Buyer, on its own behalf or on behalf of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries, on or following the Closing Date shall
be given effect for purposes of determining the Closing Working Capital or
Assumed Indebtedness. During the period of time from and after the delivery of
the Statement by the Buyer through the final determination of Closing Working
Capital and Assumed Indebtedness in accordance with this _Section 2.3_, the
Buyer shall afford, and shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
to afford, to the Seller and any accountants, counsel or financial
advisers retained by the Seller in connection with the review of Closing
Working Capital and Assumed Indebtedness in accordance with this _Section
2.3_, direct access during normal business hours upon reasonable advance
notice to all the properties, books, contracts, personnel, representatives
(including the Companys accountants) and records of the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries and such representatives (including the work papers of the
Companys accountants) relevant to the review of the Statement and the

accordance with this _Section 2.3_.

environmental reports, sampling data or site assessments with respect to any

5.16 _Insurance_.  _Schedule 5.16_ contains a complete and accurate list of
all material insurance policies (the " _Insurance Policies_ ") with respect to

the Buyer).

 

5.17 _Real Property_. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries do not own any
real property. _Schedule 5.17_ contains a complete and accurate list of all
real property previously owned by the Company or any Company Subsidiary since
January 17, 2007. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable,
have valid leasehold interests in the real property specified on _Schedule
5.17_ under the heading "Leased Properties" (the " _Real Property_ ").
_Schedule 5.17_ contains a complete and accurate list as of the date hereof
of all Real Property leased by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as
lessee, including all subleases and other arrangements relating

 



27  to the use or occupancy of the Real Property by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Leases_ "). _Schedule 5.17_ contains a
complete and accurate list as of the date hereof of all Leases (and copies
thereof have been delivered to the Buyer), as the same may have been amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time. With respect to each
Lease, neither the Company, any Company Subsidiary nor, to the knowledge of
the Company, any other party to any such Lease is in material breach thereof
or default thereunder and there does not exist under any thereof any event
which, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time, would constitute such
a material breach or default by the Company, any Company Subsidiary or, to the
knowledge of the Company, any other party. All of the Leases are, to the
knowledge of the Company, in full force and effect. Except as disclosed on 
_Schedule 5.17_ , neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a
sublessor or grantor under any sublease or other instrument granting to any
other Person any right to the possession, lease, occupancy or enjoyment of any
of the Real Property. To the knowledge of the Company, no material
improvements constituting a part of the Real Property encroach on real
property owned or leased by a Person other than the Company or any Company
Subsidiary. There are no claims, actions or legal proceedings pending nor, to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened against or affecting the Real
Property or any portion thereof or interest therein in the nature or in lieu

from the date of the Interim Balance Sheet to the date of this Agreement, the
Company and each Company Subsidiary have conducted their respective
businesses in the ordinary course of business and they have not undertaken, or
agreed in writing to undertake, any action of the type described in _Section
7.1(c)_, _(e)_ , _(f)_ , _(g)_ , _(h)_ ,  _(i)_ , _(j)_ , _(k)_ , _(l)_ ,

5.21 _Title to Assets_. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have good
and valid title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all material property and
assets reflected on the Interim Balance Sheet or acquired after the date of
the Interim Balance Sheet, other than properties and assets sold or otherwise
disposed of in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
since the date of the Interim Balance Sheet. All such properties and assets
are free and clear of Encumbrances except for Permitted Encumbrances.

5.22 _Condition and Sufficiency of Assets_. The buildings, plants, structures,
furniture, fixtures, machinery, equipment, vehicles and other items of
tangible personal property of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, are in reasonably good operating condition subject to ordinary
wear and tear. The buildings, plants, structures, furniture, fixtures,
machinery, equipment, vehicles and other items of tangible personal property
currently owned or leased by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
together with all other properties and assets of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are sufficient to enable the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries to operate their businesses in substantially the same
manner as conducted as of the date hereof, taken as a whole.

 

5.23 _Inventory_. All inventory reflected on the Interim Balance Sheet and the
inventory acquired after the date thereof consists of a quality and quantity
usable and salable in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, except for obsolete, damaged, defective or slow-moving items that

Balance Sheet and the accounts receivable arising after the date thereof have
arisen from bona fide transactions entered into by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries involving the sale of goods or the rendering of services in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. To the knowledge of
the Company, the debtors to which such accounts receivable relate are not in
or subject to a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding.

 

5.25 _Labor Relations_. Neither the Company nor the Company Subsidiaries are a
party to, or bound by, any collective bargaining or other contract with a

 



29  labor organization representing any of its respective employees, and there
are no labor organizations representing, or, to the knowledge of the Company,
attempting to represent any employee of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries. As of the date hereof, there are no actual or, to the knowledge
of the Company, threatened strikes, slowdowns, work stoppages, lockouts,
concerted refusals to work overtime or other similar labor activity or
dispute affecting the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or any of their
respective employees.

5.26 _Product Liability_. Neither the Company nor the Company Subsidiaries
has received any written notice with respect to any product liability claim
against the Company or the Company Subsidiaries asserting that an alleged
defect in any product of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries (including,
without limitation, any past, prior or discontinued products) caused any
material injury to any individual or property.

5.27 _Internal Controls_. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting sufficient in
all material respects to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of such entitys financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP and to provide reasonable
assurance in all material respects that: (a) records are maintained
in reasonable detail that accurately and fairly reflect in all material
respects the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries; (b) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that
material transactions are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and/or the board of directors (or equivalent entity) of the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable; and (c) unauthorized acquisition,
use or disposition of the Companys or any Company Subsidiarys assets that
could have a material effect on such entitys financial statements are timely
detected and/or prevented. To the knowledge of the Company, there are no
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of
such system of internal control over financial reporting that are reasonably
likely to adversely affect in any material respect the ability of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries to record, process, summarize and report
financial information. To the knowledge of the Company, since July 1, 2009,
there have been no instances of fraud, whether or not material, that involve
the Companys or any of the Company Subsidiarys management or other employees
who have a significant role in such entitys system of internal control over
financial reporting.

for or on behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and no
broker, finder, agent or similar intermediary is entitled to any brokers,

other party hereto in connection with the foregoing.

 

(d) Subject to the Buyers compliance with _Section 7.3(e)_, and
notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this  _Section 7.3_ shall require,
or be construed to require, the Buyer or any of its Affiliates to agree to (i)
sell, hold, divest, discontinue or limit, before or after the Closing Date,
any assets, businesses or interests of the Buyer, the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates; (ii) any conditions relating

Law, or (B) by any domestic or foreign court or similar tribunal, in any suit
brought by any Person or Governmental Authority challenging the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, in order to
avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order or other order that has the effect of preventing the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If the Buyer
or any of its Affiliates takes any of the actions set forth in clause (i)

_Sections 8.4_ or _9.4_ , if in any suit brought by any Person or
Governmental Authority challenging the transactions contemplated by this

Governmental Authority makes an order or decree permitting the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, but requiring that any of the businesses,
product lines or assets of any of the Buyer or its Affiliates or of the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates be divested
or held separate by the Buyer, or that would otherwise limit the Buyers

39  employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, taken as a whole, than

set forth in any agreement (other than this Agreement) with any employee of

preclude the Buyer, the Company or any Company Subsidiary from terminating the

service rendered by employees of the Company and each Company Subsidiary

such service was taken into account under corresponding plans of the Company

(including the Company and each Company Subsidiary) for any condition for
which such employee would have been entitled to coverage under the

"), the Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company and each Company Subsidiary
to, make all bonus payments required to be made under the 2011 Bonus Plan in
accordance with the terms of the 2011 Bonus Plan to the extent such
obligations are reflected as a Current Liability shown on the face of the
finally determined Statement.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing contained in this

agreement (each, a " _Restrictive Covenant Agreement_ "), as further set
forth on _Schedule 7.12_ hereto. With respect to each Restrictive Covenant
Agreement to which any Company Subsidiary is a party, during the period from
the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the Closing Date and
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article 10_ , the
Company shall not, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, amend,

7.13 _Tax Matters_. Promptly following the execution and delivery of this

time as this Agreement is terminated in accordance with  _Article 10_ , the
Company shall not file such Tax Returns. The Company shall file such Tax
Returns at the time the Statement of Closing Working Capital becomes final.
Such Tax Returns shall be prepared consistently with point 6 of  _Exhibit B_
and shall show a final tax liability equal to the amounts included in the
Final Working Capital with respect thereto. In the event that the estimated
state income Tax payments of the Company (made prior to the Closing Date) for
the period ended June 30, 2011, result in an income Tax refund from the State
of North Carolina or the State of California to the Company or the Buyer after
the Closing Date, the Company shall pay to the Seller an amount equal to such
refund received in amount not to exceed $2,000 with respect to North Carolina
and $26,800 with respect to California, less any reasonable expenses of the
Company or the Buyer to obtain such refund (not to include any costs
associated with the preparation and filing of the applicable state income Tax
Returns), within ten (10) Business Days after the receipt of such refund or
the time at which such refund is used to reduce the Taxes (including estimated
Taxes) otherwise payable by the Company. The Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain such North Carolina and California income Tax
Refunds. Neither the North Carolina nor the California Tax refund shall be
included in the Statement of Closing Working Capital or the Final Working
Capital.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except in the
event of fraud, or with respect to breaches or inaccuracies of any of the
Seller Specified Representations and the Company Specified Representations,
Buyer shall have recourse for indemnification under this _Article 11_ solely
to, and to the extent of, the then available Indemnity Escrow Amount in
accordance with _Section 11.10_; _provided_ , that, from and after the date
that is immediately following the

 



48  first anniversary of the Closing Date until December 27, 2012 or, in the
case of an indemnification claim under _Section 11.2(a)(vii)_, until the
applicable Cut-Off Date if later than December 27, 2012, the Buyer shall have
recourse for indemnification under _Sections 11.2(a)(vi)_ and _(vii)_ solely
to, and to the extent of, the then available Cap; _provided, further,_ that in
no event shall the amount of Losses paid by the Seller under _Section
11.2(a)_ exceed the Final Purchase Price less any amounts paid by Seller to
the Buyer Indemnitees under Article 11 of this Agreement (including payments
made from the Indemnity Escrow Amount).

(f) No party hereto shall be obligated to indemnify any other Person with
respect to (i) any Losses with respect to any matter if such matter was
included in the calculation of the adjustment to the Estimated Purchase Price
pursuant to _Section 2.3_ (to the extent so included), (ii) for any Losses
for which a Claims Notice was not duly delivered prior to the applicable Cut-
Off Date.

(g) For purposes of this _Article 11_ , any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty (other than the representations and warranties in
_Section 5.7_ (Financial Statements), _Section 5.19(ii)_ (Absence of Certain
Changes or Events) and _Section 5.27 _(Internal Controls)) shall be
determined without regard to any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or other
similar qualification contained in or otherwise applicable to such
representation or warranty; _provided_ , _however_ , any such qualification
shall not be disregarded solely to the extent that it modifies the
identification of applicable lists of agreements, contracts, instruments or
permits.

11.4 _Indemnification Claim Process_.

(a) All claims for indemnification by either a Seller Indemnitee or Buyer
Indemnitee under this _Article 11_ shall be asserted and resolved in
accordance with _Sections 11.4_, _11.5_ and _11.10_.

 

(b) If a Buyer Indemnitee intends to seek indemnification for a Third Party
Claim pursuant to this _Article 11_ , the Buyer Indemnitee shall promptly,
but in no event more than thirty (30) calendar days following such Buyer
Indemnitees knowledge of such claim, notify the Seller in writing of such
claim, describing such claim in reasonable detail and the amount or estimated
amount of such Losses (the " _Claims Notice_ "). The failure to give such
prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the Seller of its
indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the
Seller forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure.

(c) If a Seller Indemnitee intends to seek indemnification for a Third Party
Claim pursuant to this _Article 11_ , the Seller Indemnitee shall promptly,
but in no event more than thirty (30) calendar days following the Sellers
knowledge of such claim, deliver a Claims Notice to the Buyer. The failure
to give such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the Buyer of
its indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the Buyer
forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure.

 



49 (d) The Indemnitor shall have thirty (30) days from the date on which the
Indemnitor received the Claims Notice to notify the Indemnitee that the
Indemnitor desires to assume the defense or prosecution of the Third Party
Claim and any litigation resulting therefrom with counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnitee;  _provided_ , that the Indemnitor shall not be
entitled to assume such defense if (i) such Third Party relates to or arises
in connection with any criminal allegation, (ii) such Third Party Claim seeks
an injunction or equitable relief against an Indemnitee, (iii) an adverse
determination with respect to such Third Party Claim would be materially
detrimental to or materially injure the Indemnitees reputation or future
business prospects, or (iv) the Indemnitee reasonably believes that the
Losses relating to such Third Party Claim could exceed the maximum amount that
such Indemnitee could then be entitled to recover under this _Article 11_. If
the Indemnitor assumes the defense of such claim in accordance herewith: (i)
the Indemnitee may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and
participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim, but the Indemnitor shall
control the investigation, defense and settlement thereof; (ii) the
Indemnitee shall not file any papers or consent to the entry of any judgment
or enter into any settlement with respect to such Third Party Claim without
the prior written consent of the Indemnitor; and (iii) the Indemnitor
shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
with respect to such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of
the Indemnitee (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) unless the judgment
or settlement provides solely for the payment of money, the Indemnitor makes
such payment in full and the Indemnitee receives an unconditional release. The
parties shall act in good faith in responding to, defending against, settling
or otherwise dealing with Third Party Claims, and cooperate in any such
defense and give each other reasonable access to all information relevant
thereto. Whether or not the Indemnitor has assumed the defense of such Third
Party Claim, the Indemnitor will not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee
hereunder with respect to any settlement entered into or any judgment
consented to without the Indemnitors prior written consent (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld).

 

(e) If the Indemnitor does not assume the defense of such Third Party Claim
within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Claims Notice, the Indemnitee will
be entitled to assume such defense, at its sole cost and expense (or, if the
Indemnitee incurs a Loss with respect to the matter in question for which the
Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Article 11_ , at the
expense of the Indemnitor), upon delivery of notice to such effect to the
Indemnitor; _provided_ , _however_ , that: the Indemnitor (i) shall have the
right to participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim at its sole
cost and expense and (ii) shall not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee
hereunder for any settlement entered into or any judgment consented to without
the Indemnitors prior written consent.

 

(f) The Buyer Indemnitee shall, and shall cause the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to, provide reasonable cooperation with the Seller in all
aspects of any investigation, defense, pretrial activities, trial, compromise,
settlement or discharge of any claim in respect of which a Buyer Indemnitee is
seeking indemnification pursuant to this _Article 11_ that the Seller has
elected to control, including, but not limited

 



50  to, by providing the Seller with reasonable access to books, records,
employees and officers (including as witnesses) of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries.

 

11.5 _Indemnification Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims_. The Indemnitee
will deliver a Claims Notice to the Indemnitor promptly upon its discovery of
any matter for which the Indemnitor may be liable to the Indemnitee hereunder
that does not involve a Third Party Claim, which Claims Notice shall also (a)
state that the Indemnitee has paid or properly accrued Losses or anticipates
that it will incur liability for Losses for which such Indemnitee is entitled
to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, and (b) the date such item was
paid or accrued. The Indemnitee shall reasonably cooperate and assist
the Indemnitor in determining the validity of any claim for indemnity by the
Indemnitee and in otherwise resolving such matters. Such assistance and
cooperation shall include providing reasonable access to and copies of
information, records and documents relating to such matters, furnishing
employees to assist in the investigation, defense and resolution of such
matters and providing legal and business assistance with respect to such
matters.

 

11.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
except in the case of fraud or in connection with a dispute under _Section
2.3_ (which shall be governed exclusively by _Section 2.3_), the
indemnification provisions of _Article 11_ shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of parties following the Closing for any and all breaches or alleged
breaches of any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
parties, or any other provision of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. For the avoidance of doubt, (a) the Buyer
hereby acknowledges and agrees that all Losses of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, other than those for which a Buyer Indemnitee is entitled to
recover in accordance with this _Article 11_ , shall be the sole
responsibility of the Buyer, and after the Closing, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries and (b) the Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees that
the Seller shall have no right of contribution or other claim against the
Company with respect to any breach of any covenant or agreement made
hereunder by the Company or any Company Subsidiary (solely with respect to
covenants and agreements to be made or performed by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary prior to Closing) or any breach or inaccuracy of any of the
Company Representations.

11.7 _Calculation of Losses; Limitations_. The amount of any Loss for which
indemnification is provided under this _Article 11_ shall be net of any
amounts actually recovered by any Indemnitee under insurance policies with
respect to such Loss (provided, however, with respect to any Buyer Indemnitee,
such reduction shall apply only with respect to amounts actually recovered
under insurance policies maintained by the Company or any Company Subsidiary
prior to the Closing Date) and net of amounts accrued on the Company or any
Company Subsidiarys balance sheet as of the Closing Date and included in
Closing Working Capital with respect to such Loss, and shall be (i) increased
to take account of any net Tax cost actually incurred by the Indemnitee
arising from the receipt of indemnity payments hereunder (grossed up for
such increase) and (ii) reduced to take account of any net Tax benefit
actually realized by the Indemnitee arising from the incurrence or payment of
any such Loss. In computing the amount of any such 

 



51  Tax cost or Tax benefit, the Indemnitee shall be deemed to recognize all
other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any
item arising from the receipt of any indemnity payment hereunder or the
incurrence or payment of any indemnified Loss.

11.8 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Unless otherwise required by
applicable law, any indemnity payment made under this Agreement shall be
treated by all parties as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price for all
federal, state, local and foreign Tax purposes, and the parties shall file
their Tax Returns accordingly.

11.9 _Subrogation_. In the event of payment by or on behalf of any Indemnitor
to any Indemnitee (including pursuant to this _Article 11_ ) in connection
with any claim or demand by any Person other than the parties hereto or their
respective Affiliates, such Indemnitor shall be subrogated to and shall stand
in the place of such Indemnitee as to any events or circumstances in respect
of which such Indemnitee may have any right, defense or claim relating to such
claim or demand against any claimant or plaintiff asserting such claim or
demand. Such Indemnitee shall cooperate with such Indemnitor in a reasonable
manner, and at the cost of such Indemnitor, in presenting any subrogated
right, defense or claim.

11.10 _Indemnity Escrow_.

(a) In the event any Buyer Indemnitee shall have, prior to the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, delivered a Claims Notice in respect of
indemnification under this Agreement, such Buyer Indemnitee and the Seller
shall negotiate in good faith to reach an agreement upon (i) the
Buyer Indemnitees right for indemnification under this Agreement and the
amount of such Buyer Indemnitees Losses and (ii) the amount on deposit in the
Indemnity Escrow account that should be reserved (the " _Reserved Amount_ ")
in respect of such Claims Notice. Pending or absent a mutual agreement of the
Reserved Amount in respect of any Claims Notice, the Reserved Amount therefor
shall be the amount in good faith estimate by the Buyer Indemnitee based
on back-up documentation containing such detail as is reasonable under the
circumstances.

(b) Upon the agreement by the Seller and the Buyer Indemnitee or as finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in respect of any Claims
Notice, the Seller and the Buyer shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent under
the Escrow Agreement to pay to the Buyer Indemnitee the lesser of (i) the
amount of the Losses in respect of such Claims Notice and (ii) the balance
then on deposit in the Indemnity Escrow Account.

(c) On the first anniversary of the Closing Date, the Seller and the Buyer
shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement to pay to
Seller the excess of the balance then on deposit in the Indemnity Escrow
Account over the aggregate Reserved Amounts in respect of all unresolved
claims for indemnification made by the Buyer Indemnitees prior to such date,
in each case, if any.

 



52 (d) Following the first anniversary of the Closing Date, from time to time,
upon resolution of any Claims Notice in respect of any individual claim for
indemnification made by the Buyer Indemnitees and the appropriate amount from
the Indemnity Escrow Account shall have been paid to the Buyer Indemnitees in
respect of such Claims Notice, the Seller and the Buyer shall jointly
instruct the Escrow Agent to release to Seller the excess of the balance then
on deposit in the Indemnity Escrow Account over the aggregate Reserved Amounts
in respect of all remaining unresolved claims for indemnification made by the
Buyer Indemnitees prior to such date, in each case, if any.

prior written consent of any other party, assign all or any portion of
its rights under this Agreement to one or more of its Affiliates; _provided_
, _further_ , that no assignment shall relieve the assigning party of any of
its obligations hereunder. Any purported assignment without such required

rights, remedies or claims upon any Person or entity not a party or a

described negotiation shall end at the close of the first meeting of

preclude continuing or later negotiations, if desired. At no time prior to
the First Meeting shall either side initiate a legal action related to this

by agreement of the parties. However, this limitation is inapplicable to a
party if the other party refuses to comply with the requirements of this
_Section 12.13_.

12.14  _Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process_. Any legal action,
suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby may only be instituted in any state or

of any such court in any such action, suit or proceeding.

12.15 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST

otherwise breached and that each party hereto shall be entitled to seek an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions hereof and to
specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at
