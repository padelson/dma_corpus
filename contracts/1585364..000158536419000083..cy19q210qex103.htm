AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties,
agreements and covenants contained in this Agreement, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows: ARTICLE I

THE BLOCKER PURCHASE

1.01 Sale of Blocker Shares. Subject to and upon the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, immediately prior to the Effective Time, Blocker Seller shall
sell to US Buyer, and US Buyer shall purchase from Blocker Seller, all right,
title and interest in and to the Blocker Shares, free and clear of all Liens.

1.02 Consideration. In consideration for the Blocker Shares, US Buyer shall
pay Blocker Seller (collectively, the "Blocker Purchase Price"):

(a) an aggregate amount of cash equal to the amount set forth on the Estimated
Closing Statement under the heading "Blocker Closing Payment", as determined
in accordance with Section 3.03(a) (the "Blocker Closing Payment"); plus

(b) whether paid directly or through the release of the applicable withheld
amounts, an aggregate amount of cash equal to the portion (as determined by
the Representative based on the Distribution Principles) of any Future
Distribution Amount attributable to the Blocker Company Units.

1.03 Closing. The closing of the Blocker Purchase shall take place on the
Closing Date immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Blocker Closing");
provided that, in the event the Merger does not become effective, the Blocker
Closing shall be deemed void and to not have occurred.

ARTICLE II 
THE MERGER

2.01 Merger. Subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and the DLLCA, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into
the Company, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and
the Company shall continue as the surviving limited liability company. The
Company, as the surviving limited liability company in the Merger, is
hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Surviving Company."

2.02 Effective Time; Closing. At the Closing, the Company, Buyer and Merger
Sub shall cause a certificate of merger in the form of Exhibit B attached
hereto (the "Certificate of Merger") to be executed, acknowledged and filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, and shall make all other
filings or recordings required by the DLLCA to effectuate the Merger. The
Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is
duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such
later date as Buyer and the Company shall agree and shall specify in the
Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DLLCA (the "Effective Time").

2.03 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of DLLCA.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from and after the Effective
Time, all of the assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Company, and all
debts, Liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, Liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company.

2.04 Certificate of Formation. The certificate of formation of Merger Sub in
effect at the Effective Time shall be the certificate of formation of the
Surviving Company until amended in accordance with applicable Law. 2.05 Limited Liability Company Agreement. The limited liability company
agreement of Merger Sub in effect at the Effective Time shall be the limited
liability company agreement of the Surviving Company until amended in
accordance with applicable Law; provided that such limited liability company
agreement shall maintain the same economics and ownership of the Blocker
Company Units owned by Blocker as was maintained by the limited liability
company agreement of the Surviving Company immediately before the Effective
Time.

2.06 Managers and Officers. From and after the Effective Time, until
successors are duly elected or appointed in accordance with the terms of the
operating agreement of the Surviving Company and applicable Law, the managers
and officers of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall be the managers and
officers, as applicable, of the Surviving Company.

2.07 Conversion of Company Units. On the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the Parties or any of the Unitholders, the following
shall occur:

(a) Common Units and Vested Incentive Units. Each Common Unit and each Vested
Incentive Unit outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Common Units and Vested Incentive Units to be canceled pursuant to Section
2.07(b), if any, and Blocker Company Units) shall be canceled and extinguished
and shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to:

(i) a portion of the Estimated Closing Cash Payment as set forth on the
Estimated Closing Statement under the heading "Designated Unitholders Payment"
as determined in accordance with Section 3.03(a), plus

(ii) the portion (as determined by the Representative based on the
Distribution Principles) of any Future Distribution Amount attributable to
such Common Unit or Vested Incentive Unit.

(b) Unvested Incentive Units. Each Incentive Unit outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that is not a Vested Incentive Unit shall be
canceled and extinguished and no cash or other consideration shall be paid
with respect thereto.

(c) Cancellation of Treasury Units. Each Common Unit or Incentive Unit held
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Company in treasury, if any, or
held by Buyer or any of its subsidiaries (excluding the Blocker Company Units)
shall be canceled and no cash or other consideration shall be paid with
respect thereto.

(d) Blocker Company Units. Each Blocker Company Unit shall be converted into
and exchanged for one validly issued Common Unit or one validly issued
Incentive Unit, as applicable, of the Surviving Company, in each case, with
the same economics as the Blocker Company Units owned by Blocker immediately
prior to the Effective Time (which Common Units and Incentive Units of the
Surviving Company shall, for the avoidance of doubt, continue to be held by
Blocker) and there shall be no payments made to US Buyer or Blocker in respect
of the Blocker Company Units pursuant to this Section 2.07.

(e) Merger Sub Units. The limited liability company interests of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and exchanged for validly issued Common Units and Incentive
Units of the Surviving Company with the same economics as the Common Units and
Vested Incentive Units outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than the Blocker Company Units owned by Blocker). (f) Books and Records. All consideration paid to the Designated Unitholders in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been
exchanged and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Common
Units and Incentive Units (other than the Blocker Company Units) outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and the books of the Company
shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
transfer books of the Company with respect to the equity interests that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after
the Effective Time, any holder of Common Units and Incentive Units (other than
the Blocker Company Units) as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights as an equity holder of the Company (or, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Surviving Company), except as specifically provided in
this Agreement or by applicable Law.

2.08 Unitholders Payments; Letters of Transmittal.

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company, Irish Buyer and US Buyer shall enter
into a paying agent agreement, in the form attached to this Agreement as
Exhibit C, with Acquiom Financial LLC (the "Paying Agent" and such agreement,
the "Paying Agent Agreement"). The Paying Agent shall act as paying agent in
effecting payments to Designated Unitholders and the exchange of cash for
Common Units and Incentive Units (other than the Blocker Company Units).

(b) Within fifteen Business Days following the date of this Agreement, to the
extent not delivered prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company shall,
or shall instruct the Paying Agent to, deliver to each Designated Unitholder a
letter of transmittal, in the form of Exhibit D attached hereto (the "Letter
of Transmittal").

(c) If a Designated Unitholder delivers its duly completed and validly
executed Letter of Transmittal to the Paying Agent prior to the Closing, then
at the Closing the Company shall instruct the Paying Agent to deliver to such
Designated Unitholder the portion of the Estimated Closing Cash Payment
payable to such Designated Unitholder pursuant to Section 2.07(a)(i). If a
Designated Unitholder delivers its duly completed and validly executed Letter
of Transmittal to the Paying Agent after the Closing, then promptly
thereafter, the Company shall instruct the Paying Agent to deliver to such
Designated Unitholder the portion of the Estimated Closing Cash Payment
payable to such Designated Unitholder pursuant to Section 2.07(a)(i), and any
Future Distribution Amount held by the Paying Agent that such Designated
Unitholder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.07(a)(ii) at that
time, if any. From and after the Closing, each Common Unit and Incentive Unit
(other than the Blocker Company Units and any Common Units or Incentive Units
cancelled pursuant to Section 2.07(b) or Section 2.07(c)) shall represent
solely the right to receive the portion of the Transaction Consideration into
which the Common Units and Incentive Units shall have been converted pursuant
to Section 2.07, without interest.

(d) Any portion of the consideration paid to the Paying Agent by Irish Buyer
pursuant to Section 3.02(b) that remains unclaimed by the Designated
Unitholders twelve months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Irish
Buyer, upon demand, and any such Designated Unitholder who has not delivered
its duly completed and validly executed Letter of Transmittal to the Paying
Agent on or prior to such date shall thereafter look only to Irish Buyer for
payment of such consideration; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing,
Irish Buyer shall not be liable to any Designated Unitholder for any amounts
paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by the Designated Unitholders
five years after the Effective Time (or if earlier, immediately prior to such
time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, the property of Irish Buyer free and clear of any claims or interest of
any Person previously entitled thereto.

2.09 Required Withholding. (a) Each of Buyer, the Escrow Agent, the Paying Agent and the Surviving
Company (and any other Person that has any withholding obligation with respect
to any payment made pursuant to this Agreement or any other agreements
referenced herein) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement or
any other agreements referenced herein such amounts as may be required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code, or under any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law; provided that, except with respect to
payments in the nature of compensation to be made to employees or former
employees of any of the Group Companies, if Buyer, the Escrow Agent, the
Paying Agent or the Surviving Company determines that an amount is required to
be deducted and withheld, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide the payee, at least three Business Days prior to the date the
applicable payment is scheduled to be made, (i) with written notice of the
intent to deduct and withhold, which shall include a copy of the calculation
of the amount to be deducted and withheld and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to
provide forms or other evidence that would exempt such amounts from
withholding (or reduce such withholding); provided, further, that such notice
obligation shall not be applicable with respect to any payment to a Person who
does not deliver (i) IRS Form W-9 or applicable IRS Form W-8, and (ii) (A) in
the case of Blocker Seller, the certificate described in Section 3.02(e)(iii)
or (B) subject to Section 2.09(b), in the case of a Person other than Blocker
Seller, a statement that such Person is not a "foreign person" for purposes of
Sections 1445 and 1446(f) of the Code in the form of Exhibit E-1 attached to
this Agreement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and
remitted to the proper Taxing Authority, the amount of such consideration
shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person to whom such consideration would otherwise have been paid.

(b) The Representative, the Company and Buyer shall cooperate with each other,
as and to the extent reasonably requested by any of the foregoing, in
connection with the computation and verification of any amounts required to be
withheld, including any "amount realized" with respect to the Transactions,
and as determined under Code Section 1446(f), by causing the Company to
provide to Buyer prior to the Closing Date a certification as described in
Section 7.03 of IRS Notice 2018-29 or other information to determine any
amount included in amounts realized pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.752-1(h)).

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each Designated
Unitholder shall, in such Person\'s applicable Letter of Transmittal, if the
Reimbursement Conditions are satisfied, agree to pay to Buyer the excess of:
(A)(x) the amount of any withholding taxes required to be withheld by the
Company with respect to such Designated Unitholder under Section 1446(a) of
the Code with respect to the portion of the U.S. federal income tax period of
the Company that begins before the Closing Date (excluding, in each case, any
interest and penalties with respect to such matters and any amount that is
actually withheld from such Designated Unitholder\'s pro rata portion of the
Estimated Closing Cash Payment or any Future Distribution Amount), but only to
the extent that such amount actually paid by the Company constitutes an
advance payment of, or an offset to, a Tax liability imposed on such
Designated Unitholder; or (y) the amount of any U.S. state non-resident
withholding taxes required to be paid by the Company with respect to such
Designated Unitholder as a result of a Pass-Through Income Tax Return prepared
pursuant to and in accordance with the procedures of Section 9.01 or the
resolution of the applicable PT-Tax Proceeding pursuant to and in accordance
with the procedures set forth in Section 9.03 (excluding, in each case, any
penalties and interest with respect to such matter and any amount that is
actually withheld from such Designated Unitholder\'s pro rata portion of the
Estimated Closing Cash Payment or any Future Distribution Amount), but only to
the extent that such amount actually paid by the Company constitutes an
advance payment of, or an offset to, a Tax liability imposed on such
Designated Unitholder; over, in the case of both clause (A)(x) and clause
(A)(y), (B) the amount of any proceeds or other third-party recovery
(including pursuant to the RandW Policy) to which Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including the Company and its Subsidiaries) are entitled with respect to any
such Taxes. The Letter of Transmittal shall also provide that if Buyer or any
of its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) receives a
refund of any amount for which Buyer has received a payment from a Designated
Unitholder, Buyer shall promptly remit such refund to the Designated
Unitholder.

3.03 Estimated Closing Cash Payment Adjustment.

(a) Estimated Closing Cash Payment.

(i) Not less than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Representative shall deliver to Buyer a statement (the "Estimated Closing
Statement") that sets forth (including, in each case, reasonable supporting
documentation and detail as to how each was determined) (A) the Company\'s
good faith estimate of the Cash Amount, the outstanding amount of all Funded
Debt as of the Adjustment Time, the Transaction Expenses, the Tax Liability
Amount, the Blocker Tax Liability Amount, the Working Capital (and the Working
Capital Surplus or Working Capital Deficit, if any, implied thereby), (B) the
Closing Cash Payment resulting therefrom (the "Estimated Closing Cash
Payment"), (C) the Representative\'s determination, based on the Distribution
Principles, of the portion of the Estimated Closing Cash Payment payable to
Blocker Seller and (D) the Representative\'s determination, based on the
Distribution Principles, of the portion of the Estimated Closing Cash Payment
payable to each Designated Unitholder.

(ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Buyer and its
representatives may make inquiries of or provide comments to the Company
regarding questions or comments concerning, or disagreements with, the
Estimated Closing Statement or arising in the course of Buyer\'s review
thereof. If Buyer shall object to any of the information set forth on the
Estimated Closing Statement, then Buyer and the Company shall negotiate in
good faith concerning Buyer\'s proposed adjustments to the Estimated Closing
Statement, if any, but in the absence of an agreement between Buyer and the
Company with respect to such proposed adjustments, the Estimated Closing
Statement as prepared by the Company shall control. In no event shall the
Closing be delayed as a result of this Section 3.03(a)(ii).

(b) Final Calculations.

(i) Within ninety days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver
to the Representative a statement that sets forth (including, in each case,
reasonable supporting documentation and detail as to how each was determined)
(A) the Cash Amount, the outstanding amount of all Funded Debt as of the
Adjustment Time, the Transaction Expenses, the Tax Liability Amount, the
Blocker Tax Liability Amount and the Working Capital (and the Working Capital
Surplus or Working Capital Deficit, if any, implied thereby) and (B) the
Closing Cash Payment resulting therefrom (the "Closing Statement"). If the
Representative has any objections to the Closing Statement, the Representative
shall deliver to Buyer a written statement (an "Objection Statement") setting
forth its objections (the "Objection Disputes") to the Closing Statement,
which Objection Statement shall set forth in reasonable detail each such
disagreement and the amount thereof. Any amount(s) set forth on the Closing
Statement not included in a timely delivered Objection Statement as the
subject of an Objection Dispute shall be treated as final, binding and non-
appealable by the Parties. If an Objection Statement is not delivered to Buyer within 45 days after receipt of the Closing Statement by the
Representative, then the Closing Statement as originally received by the
Representative shall be the final Closing Statement, and accordingly, final,
binding and non-appealable by the Parties. If an Objection Statement is timely
delivered, then Buyer and the Representative shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve any Objection Disputes. If such negotiations result in a written
resolution executed by Buyer and the Representative as to any Objection
Dispute, such written resolution shall be final, binding and non-appealable by
the Parties.

(ii) If Buyer and the Representative cannot reach a final resolution on all of
the Objection Disputes within 30 days after the delivery of the Objection
Statement, the Representative and Buyer shall submit each unresolved Objection
Dispute to KPMG US LLP (the "Firm") to resolve such Objection Disputes. If
KPMG US LLP refuses or is otherwise unable to act as the Firm, then Buyer and
the Representative shall cooperate in good faith to appoint a nationally
recognized independent accounting or valuation firm mutually agreeable to
Buyer and the Representative, in which event "Firm" shall mean such firm. The
Firm shall be requested to render a written determination of the unresolved
Objection Disputes (acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator) within
forty-five days following its retention, which determination must be in
writing and must set forth, in reasonable detail, the basis therefor and must
be based solely on (A) the definitions and other applicable provisions of this
Agreement, (B) a single written presentation (which presentation shall be
limited to the unresolved Objection Disputes) submitted by each of Buyer and
the Representative to the Firm within fifteen days after its retention (which
the Firm shall forward to the other Party) and (C) one written response
submitted by each of Buyer and the Representative to the Firm within fifteen
days after receipt of each presentation (which the Firm shall forward to the
other Party) and not on independent review. Buyer and the Representative will
instruct the Firm not to assign a value to any item in dispute greater than
the greatest value for such item assigned by Buyer, on the one hand, or the
Representative, on the other hand, or less than the smallest value for such
item assigned by Buyer, on the one hand, or the Representative, on the other
hand. The Firm\'s determination of such Objection Disputes shall be final and
binding upon the Parties and not subject to review by a court or other
tribunal. The terms of appointment and engagement of the Firm shall be as
reasonably agreed upon between Buyer and the Representative, and any
associated engagement fees shall initially be allocated 50% to Buyer and 50%
to the Representative; provided that such fees, costs and expenses of the Firm
will ultimately be allocated between Buyer, on the one hand, and the
Representative, on the other hand, in the same proportion that the aggregate
amount of the disputed items so submitted to the Firm that is unsuccessfully
disputed by such Party (as finally determined by the Firm) bears to the total
amount of disputed items submitted. For example, if the Representative submits
an adjustment of $1,000 for a specific item in the Objection Statement, and if
Buyer contests only $500 of the amount claimed by the Representative, and if
the Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding the Representative $300
of the $500 contested, then the fees, costs and expenses of the Firm will be
allocated 60% (i.e., 300/500) to Buyer and 40% (i.e., 200/500) to the
Representative. Except as provided in this Section 3.03(b)(ii), all other
costs and expenses incurred by the Parties in connection with resolving any
dispute hereunder before the Firm shall be borne by the Party incurring such
costs and expense. The process set forth in this Section 3.03(b) shall be the
exclusive remedy of the Parties for any disputes related to items required to
be reflected on the Closing Statement or included in the calculation of
Working Capital, the Cash Amount, the Tax Liability Amount, the Blocker Tax
Liability Amount, the outstanding amount of all Funded Debt as of the
Adjustment Time or the Transaction Expenses.

(iii) The Closing Statement (as adjusted by the agreement of the
Representative and Buyer and/or the determination of the Firm, as applicable)
shall be deemed the final Closing Statement for the purposes of this Section
3.03(b) and, accordingly, shall be final, binding and non-appealable by the
Parties.

(iv) If the Closing Cash Payment based on the final Closing Statement as
finally determined pursuant to this Section 3.03(b) is greater than the
Estimated Closing Cash Payment, (x) 

Buyer shall promptly (but in any event within five Business Days after the
final Closing Statement is determined pursuant to this Section 3.03(b)) pay
(A) to Blocker Seller, an amount equal to the applicable portion (as
determined by the Representative based on the Distribution Principles) of such
difference allocable to Blocker Seller (the "Blocker Adjustment Payment") and
(B) to the Paying Agent, (I) the amount of such difference, less (II) the
Blocker Adjustment Payment (which amount the Company shall instruct the Paying
Agent to distribute to the Designated Unitholders based upon each such
Designated Unitholder\'s applicable portion thereof (as determined by the
Representative based on the Distribution Principles), except as otherwise
determined by the Representative in accordance with Section 14.17), in each
case, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
designated by Blocker Seller or the Paying Agent, as applicable, and (y) Buyer
and the Representative shall promptly (but in any event within five Business
Days after the final Closing Statement is finally determined pursuant to this
Section 3.03(b)) deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint written instruction
instructing the Escrow Agent to release the Adjustment Escrow Fund (A) to
Blocker Seller, in an amount equal to the applicable portion (as determined by
the Representative based on the Distribution Principles) of the Adjustment
Escrow Fund allocable to Blocker Seller and (B) to the Paying Agent, the
remaining portion of the Adjustment Escrow Fund (which amount the Company
shall instruct the Paying Agent to distribute to the Designated Unitholders
based upon each such Designated Unitholder\'s applicable portion (as
determined by the Representative based on the Distribution Principles)
thereof, except as otherwise determined by the Representative in accordance
with Section 14.17), in each case, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to such accounts designated by Blocker Seller or the Representative, as
applicable.

(v) If the Closing Cash Payment based on the final Closing Statement

determined pursuant to this Section 3.03(b) is less than the Estimated Closing
Cash Payment, Buyer and the Representative shall promptly (but in any event
within five Business Days after the final Closing Statement is finally
determined pursuant to this Section 3.03(b)) deliver to the Escrow Agent a
joint written instruction instructing the Escrow Agent to release the
Adjustment Escrow Fund (x) to Buyer, in an amount equal to the lesser of (A)
the amount by which the Estimated Closing Cash Payment is greater than the
Closing Cash Payment based on the final Closing Statement determined pursuant
to this Section 3.03(b) (the "Seller Purchase Price Adjustment Payment"), and
(B) the Adjustment Escrow Fund, (y) to Blocker Seller, in an amount equal to
the applicable portion (as determined by the Representative based on the
Distribution Principles) of the remaining Adjustment Escrow Fund (if any,
after payment pursuant to clause (x)), and (z) to the Paying Agent, the
remaining portion of the Adjustment Escrow Fund (if any, after payment
pursuant to clauses (x) and (y)) (which amount the Company shall instruct the
Paying Agent to distribute to the Designated Unitholders based upon each such
Designated Unitholder\'s applicable portion (as determined by the
Representative based on the Distribution Principles) thereof, except as
otherwise determined by the Representative in accordance with Section 14.17),
in each case, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such accounts
designated by Buyer, Blocker Seller or the Representative, as applicable. If
the Seller Purchase Price Adjustment Payment exceeds the Adjustment Escrow
Fund, the Representative shall promptly inform the Blocker Seller and the
Designated Unitholders of such excess, including the Blocker Seller\'s and
each Designated Unitholder\'s respective payment obligation. Notwithstanding
anything contained in this Agreement, Blocker Seller and the Designated
Unitholders, severally and not jointly in accordance with their respective
Unitholder Percentage, shall promptly (but in any event within ten Business
Days after the final Closing Statement is finally determined pursuant to this
Section 3.03(b)) pay Buyer the amount by which the Seller Purchase Price
Adjustment Payment exceeds the Adjustment Escrow Fund.

3.04 Cooperation. During the period of time from and after the
Representative\'s receipt of the Closing Statement through the determination
of the final Closing Statement in accordance with Section 3.03(b), Buyer
shall, and shall cause Blocker, the Surviving Company, its Subsidiaries and
their respective officers, employees, consultants, accountants and agents to
(a) reasonably cooperate with the Representative and its accountants and other
representatives in connection with their review of the Closing Statement (including by providing the Representative with reasonable access
during business hours and under reasonable circumstances to the employees of
the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries who are knowledgeable about the
information contained in, and the preparation of, the Closing Statement) and
(b) provide reasonable access during business hours and under reasonable
circumstances to any books, records and other information reasonably requested
by the Representative and its accountants or other representatives, in each
case, to the extent relevant to the Representative\'s review of the Closing
Statement and determination of the Closing Cash Payment or any component
thereof.

3.05 Representative\'s Determination of the Amounts Owed to Blocker Seller and
the Designated Unitholders. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the Parties agree that Buyer, Merger Sub and the Surviving Company
shall be entitled to rely solely on the Representative\'s determination of the
portion of the Closing Cash Payment or any Future Distribution Amount payable
to Blocker Seller and each Designated Unitholder. Buyer, Merger Sub and the
Surviving Company shall not be responsible for any such determinations.

Buyer Return by the Firm in accordance with Section 9.01(c)(iii)); provided

manner consistent with the past procedures and practices and accounting
methods of the Group Companies (except as otherwise agreed to by the
Representative, in its sole discretion or, at the election of the Buyer,
consistent with a Pre-Closing Buyer Return) and then, to the extent necessary
upon resolution of such matter by the Firm, such Buyer Return shall be amended
and refiled consistent with such resolution by the Firm. The Representative
and Buyer shall cooperate to timely file the Buyer Returns but, for the
avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall sign and file, or cause to be signed and

filed in a manner consistent with the past procedures and practices and
accounting methods of Blocker and the Group Companies and this ARTICLE IX;

with preparing any Pre-Closing Buyer Return or any Buyer Return, Buyer
believes that it is affirmatively required under applicable Law to prepare or
file any Pre-Closing Buyer Return or Buyer Return in a manner inconsistent
with past practices, procedures and accounting methods of the Group Companies,
then Buyer shall promptly deliver written notice of such belief to the
Representative, together with sufficient information setting forth the legal
basis for determining that such action is so affirmatively required, and the
Representative shall have a reasonable period to notify Buyer if it agrees or

Representative does not agree with Buyer\'s conclusion, then such disagreement
shall be promptly submitted to and resolved by the Firm (with the fees and
expenses of the Firm borne by Buyer unless the Firm agrees with Buyer\'s
position, in which event they would be borne by the Representative); provided
that if the Firm determines that applicable law affirmatively requires the
preparation and filing of a Pre-Closing Buyer Return or a Buyer Return to be
prepared in a manner inconsistent with the past practices, procedures and
accounting methods, then Buyer shall have the right to prepare such Pre-
Closing Buyer Return or Buyer Return consistent with such decision in
providing such Pre-Closing Buyer Return or Buyer Return to the Representative

9.01(b), as applicable.

affect any amounts payable by the Unitholders or their direct or indirect
equityholders or members: (a) other than Tax Returns that are filed pursuant

a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (b) after the date any Pre-Closing Buyer Return or
Buyer Return is filed, amend or otherwise modify any such Tax Return, (c) make
or change any Tax election or accounting method or practice with respect to,
or that has retroactive effect to, any Pre-Closing Tax Period or (d) except

(including any settlement or disposition thereof) regarding any Taxes or any
Tax Return filed by the Group Companies with respect to Pre-Closing Tax

liable pursuant to Section 2.09(c); provided that Buyer shall have the right
to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own

judgment, or settle, compromise or discharge any such claim, audit,
examination, or administrative or court proceeding without the prior written
consent of Buyer (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) if such action would have the effect of increasing the present or
future Tax Liability of the Company, and (y) a "push out" election shall be
made under Section 6226 of the Code and the applicable regulations promulgated
thereunder to the extent permitted with respect to a PT-Tax Proceeding. The
Representative and Buyer shall jointly control any PT-Tax Proceeding with

relating to any Tax periods and shall abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any Taxing Authority, and shall give the Representative

such books and records prior to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for that Tax period, and if the
Representative so requests, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, allow the Representative to take possession of such books and
records rather than destroying or discarding such books and records.

9.05 No Code Section 338 or Section 336 Election. Buyer shall not, and shall
cause its Affiliates (including Blocker and the Group Companies) not to, make
any election under Section 338 or 336 of the Code (or any similar provision

and no Party shall take a position inconsistent therewith for any Tax purpose.

Period, the Parties agree (i) the Company shall use the "interim closing
method" (and the "calendar day convention") pursuant to Code Section 706 (and

varying interests in the Company such that any income, gain, loss and
deduction (and any other items) for the portion of such Straddle Period ending
on and including the Closing Date shall be allocated solely to the members of
the Company with respect to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) all deductions of
the Group Companies attributable to the Transactions (including any deductions
attributable to the Transaction Tax Deductions) shall be taken into account in
the Pre-Closing Tax Period (and allocated solely to the members of the Company
with respect to the Pre-Closing Tax Period) to the extent "more likely than
not" deductible (or deductible at a higher level of confidence) in the Pre-
Closing Tax Period, determined as if the tax year ended on and included the

Revenue Procedure 2011-29 to any "success based fees" to the extent
applicable, (iii) any financing or refinancing arrangements entered into at
any time by or at the direction of Buyer or its Affiliates or any other

connection with the Transactions shall not be taken into account in the Pre-
Closing Tax Period, and (iv) any items of income, gain, loss and deduction
attributable to transactions outside the Ordinary Course of business on the
Closing Date after the time of the Closing shall not be taken into account in
the Pre-Closing Tax Period.

(c) If Buyer is a U.S. corporation, Buyer shall cause Blocker to join Buyer\'s
"consolidated group" (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(h))
effective on the day after the Closing Date. In such event, the Parties agree
that Buyer and its Affiliates and the Group Companies (i) shall not make an

allocate items (or any make any similar election or ratably allocate items

state income tax purposes, Buyer and the Representative shall allocate the
Transaction Consideration (other than the Blocker Purchase Price) plus a
ratable share of the applicable Liabilities of the Group Companies and any

forth on the Allocation Schedule attached hereto as Exhibit H for purposes of
determining the portion of the gain or loss recognized upon the sale of the
Common Units and Incentive Units pursuant to the Merger that is attributable
to the Company\'s "unrealized receivables," "inventory items" (as such terms
are defined in Section 751 of the Code), and other items. Neither Buyer nor
the Representative shall, and Buyer shall cause its Affiliates not to, take
any position in any audits, tax returns or otherwise which is inconsistent
with such allocation unless required to do so by applicable Law or good faith
resolution of a tax contest.

the Paying Agent Agreement, the Letters of Transmittal and the certificates of
the Parties delivered pursuant to Section 3.02 (collectively, the "Transaction

their subject matter and supersede all prior agreements and understandings
(oral or written) between the Parties with respect to such subject matter,

and effect in accordance with its terms. The Exhibits and Schedules constitute
a part of this Agreement as though set forth in full above.

Buyer, the Company, the Representative and Blocker Seller; provided that
waivers to this Agreement shall be deemed effective upon the execution by the
Party against whom enforcement is sought. No failure to exercise, and no delay
in exercising, any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall
operate as a waiver, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right,
power or privilege hereunder preclude the exercise of any other right, power
or privilege. No waiver of any breach of any provision shall be deemed to be a
waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach of the same or any other
provision, nor shall any waiver be implied from any course of dealing between
the Parties. No extension of time for performance of any obligations or other
acts hereunder or under any other Transaction Document shall be deemed to be
an extension of the time for performance of any other obligations or any other
acts.

14.06 Binding Effect; Assignment. The rights and obligations of this Agreement
shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective
successors and assigns. Nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement shall

agents of Blocker and the Group Companies are express third party
beneficiaries of Section 8.02 and (b) the Unitholders and Blocker Seller are
express third party beneficiaries of Section 8.05. Except as expressly
provided herein, the rights and obligations of this Agreement may not be
assigned by any Party without the prior written consent of each other Party.

rights hereunder for collateral security purposes to any lender providing
financing to Buyer.

14.07 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be an original but all of which together
shall constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by electronic mail
transmission of a ".pdf" or other similar data file shall be effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart to this Agreement.

14.08 Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an
article, section, paragraph, clause, schedule or exhibit, such reference shall
be deemed to be to an article, section, paragraph, clause, schedule or exhibit
of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation." Words of one gender shall be held to
include the other genders. The word "or" shall not be exclusive. Unless
otherwise indicated, the words "herein," "hereof," "hereunder" or "hereby" and
similar terms are to be deemed to refer to this Agreement as a whole and not
to any specific section. The words "day" and "days" shall be held to refer to
calendar day(s). The words "year" and "years" shall be held to refer to
calendar year(s), unless otherwise indicated. The headings contained herein
and on the Schedules are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in
any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Unless otherwise
specified herein, references to any statute, listing rule, rule, standard,
regulation or other law include a reference to the corresponding rules and
regulations and each of them as amended, modified, supplemented, consolidated,
replaced or rewritten from time to time. References to any section of any

successor to such section. References to any Contract (including this
Agreement) or organizational document are to the Contract or organizational

unless otherwise stated.

14.09 Schedules. Any information set forth in one section of the Schedules
will be deemed to apply to other sections of the Schedules to the extent its
relevance to such other section is reasonably apparent from the face of such
disclosure (notwithstanding the omission of a reference or cross-reference
thereto). The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item
in the Schedules hereto is not intended to imply that such amounts, or higher
or lower amounts, or the items so included, or other items not included, are
or are not required to be disclosed, and no Party shall use the fact of the
setting of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any such item in any
dispute or controversy with any Party as to whether any obligation, item or
matter not described herein or included in a Schedule is or is not required to
be disclosed (including whether such amounts or items are required to be
disclosed as material) or that the amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the
items so included, or other items not included, are within or outside the
Ordinary Course. The information contained in the Schedules is disclosed
solely for the purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained
therein shall be deemed to be an admission by any Party to any third party of
any matter whatsoever, including of any violation of Law or breach of any
agreement.

14.10 Governing Law; Interpretation. This Agreement shall be governed by and
interpreted and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of
Delaware. Any and all claims, controversies, causes of action and Proceedings
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, whether sounding in contract,
tort, or statute, shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to any conflict-of-laws or other rule that
would result in the application of the laws of a different jurisdiction.

14.11 Forum Selection; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

(a) Any Proceeding against Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company, any of the
Unitholders, 
Blocker Seller, the Surviving Company or the Representative arising out of,
relating to, or with respect to, this Agreement or the Transactions shall be
brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in New Castle
County in the State of Delaware (the "Designated Courts"), and the Parties
hereto accept the exclusive jurisdiction of the Designated Courts for the
purpose of any such Proceeding. Each Party hereby irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection which it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of any such Proceeding in any Designated Court and
hereby further irrevocably waives any claim that any such Proceeding brought
in the Designated Courts has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each Party
agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document sent in
accordance with Section 14.02 shall be effective service of process in any
such Proceeding.

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE OUT
OF, OR WITH RESPECT TO, THIS AGREEMENT OR

65

THE TRANSACTIONS IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND
THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OR ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH
PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS OF THIS SECTION 14.11(b). EITHER PARTY MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL
COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF
THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

14.12 Specific Performance. Each of the Parties agrees that this Agreement is
intended to be legally binding and specifically enforceable pursuant to its
terms and that Buyer, the Company, Blocker Seller and the Designated
Unitholders would be irreparably harmed if any of the provisions of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms and that
monetary damages would not provide adequate remedy in such event. Accordingly,
in addition to any other remedy to which a Party may be entitled at Law, a
Party shall be entitled to injunctive relief without the posting of any bond
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms
and provisions hereof. Each Party further waives any defense that a remedy at
Law would be adequate in any action or Proceeding for specific performance or
injunctive relief hereunder.

14.13 Arm\'s Length Negotiations; Drafting. Each Party expressly represents
and warrants to the other Parties that before executing this Agreement, such
Party has fully informed itself of the terms, contents, conditions and effects
of this Agreement, such Party has relied solely and completely upon its own
judgment in executing this Agreement and such Party has had the opportunity to
seek and has obtained the advice of counsel before executing this Agreement,
which is the result of arm\'s length negotiations conducted by and among the
Parties and their respective counsel. This Agreement shall be deemed drafted
jointly by the Parties and nothing shall be construed against one Party or
another as the drafting Party.

14.14 Time. With regard to all dates and time periods set forth or referred to
in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

14.15 Made Available. The phrase "made available to Buyer" or similar phrases

attorneys, in each case, at least one day prior to the date of this Agreement.

14.16 Confidentiality; Public Announcements.

(a) Except as may be required by Law, or as otherwise permitted or expressly

contemplated herein, no Party shall, and each Party shall cause its respective
Affiliates, employees, agents and representatives not to, disclose to any
third party the existence of this Agreement or the subject matter or terms
hereof, without the prior consent of Buyer, the Company and Representative;
provided that the Parties and their respective Affiliates, employees, agents
and representatives shall be permitted to (a) disclose any such information to
their attorneys, advisors and representatives and (b) disclose and use such information in connection with enforcing their rights and fulfilling their
obligations under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document.

(b) The Parties agree that no public release, public filing or public
announcement concerning this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or
the Transactions shall be issued by any Party or any of their Affiliates
without the prior written consent of Buyer and the Representative (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as
such release or announcement may be required by applicable Law or the rules or
regulations of any securities exchange, in which case the applicable Party
shall allow the other Parties reasonable time to comment on, and shall
consider in good faith any comments received by such other Parties to, such
release or announcement in advance of such issuance.

(c) Prior to the Closing, Buyer, the Company and the Representative shall
mutually agree upon a press release announcing the consummation of the
Transactions and Buyer and the Company may issue such press release following
the Closing without the consent of any other Party. In connection with the
preparation of any Securities Exchange Commission filing required to be made
by Buyer in connection with the Transactions, each Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts upon the request of Buyer to furnish Buyer
with all reasonable information concerning such Party as may be reasonably
necessary in connection with such filing, to the extent such information is
then reasonably available to such Party.

14.17 Designation of the Representative.

(a) Designation. RGHSR is hereby designated to serve as the representative of
the Unitholders and Blocker Seller (the "Representative") with respect to the
matters expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents to be performed by the Representative.

(b) Authority. By executing a Letter of Transmittal (or, in the case of
Blocker Seller, this Agreement), each Designated Unitholder and Blocker Seller
hereby irrevocably appoints the Representative as such Person\'s agent, proxy
and attorney-in-fact for all purposes of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement,
the Paying Agent Agreement and any other agreement entered into in connection
herewith (including the full power and authority on such Person\'s behalf) (i)
to consummate the Transactions, (ii) to pay expenses incurred by or on behalf
of such Person or the Representative in connection with the Transactions,
including the negotiation and performance of the Transaction Documents
(whether incurred on or after the date of this Agreement), (iii) to calculate
any amounts payable to such Person pursuant to any Transaction Document, (iv)
to execute such further agreements or instruments of assignment in accordance
with this Agreement, or as Buyer shall reasonably request, or which the
Representative shall consider necessary or proper to effectuate the
Transactions, all of which shall have the effect of binding such Person as if
such Person had personally executed such agreement or instrument, (v) to
resolve any adjustments or issues relating to any component of the Closing
Cash Payment or Future Distribution Amounts, (vi) to receive notices and other
deliverables hereunder on behalf of such Person, (vii) to execute and deliver
on behalf of such Person any amendment or waiver to any Transaction Document,
(viii) to take all other actions to be taken by or on behalf of such Person in
connection with the Transactions, (ix) to dispute, compromise, settle and pay
any claims made in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions and (x)
to do each and every act and exercise any and all rights which such Person is
permitted or required to do or exercise under the Transaction Documents. Such
agency, proxy and attorney-in-fact and all authority granted hereunder are
coupled with an interest, are therefore irrevocable without the consent of the
Representative and shall survive the death, incapacity, bankruptcy,
dissolution or liquidation of such Person. If, after the execution of this
Agreement, any Designated Unitholder or Blocker Seller dies, dissolves or
liquidates or becomes incapacitated or incompetent, then the Representative is
nevertheless authorized, empowered and directed to act in accordance with this
Agreement as if that death, dissolution, liquidation, incapacity or
incompetency had not occurred and regardless of notice thereof. All decisions and actions by the
Representative shall be binding upon all of the Designated Unitholders and
Blocker Seller and neither Blocker Seller nor any Designated Unitholder shall
have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.

(c) Representative Holdback. The Representative Holdback shall be withheld and
paid directly to an account maintained by the Representative as a fund for the
fees and expenses of the Representative incurred in its capacity as such, with
any balance of the Representative Holdback not utilized for such purposes to
be returned to Blocker Seller and the Designated Unitholders in accordance
with their Designated Unitholder Percentages. In the event that the
Representative Holdback is insufficient to satisfy the fees and expenses of
the Representative incurred in its capacity as such, the Representative shall
be entitled to recover any such expenses from any portion of the Adjustment
Escrow Fund to be distributed to Blocker Seller and the Designated
Unitholders. The Representative shall also be entitled to recover any
remaining expenses directly from Blocker Seller and the Designated Unitholders
severally in accordance with their respective Unitholder Percentage (and not
jointly or jointly and severally), and the Representative shall not have any
obligation to personally advance funds in connection with the performance of
any duties under this Agreement.

(d) Authority; Indemnification. Buyer shall be entitled to rely on any action
taken by the Representative, pursuant to Section 14.17(b) (each, an
"Authorized Action"), and each Authorized Action shall be binding on Blocker
Seller and each Designated Unitholder as fully as if such Person had taken
such Authorized Action. Buyer agrees that the Representative, as the
Representative, shall have no Liability to Buyer for any Authorized Action,
except to the extent that such Authorized Action is found by a final order of
a court of competent jurisdiction to have constituted actual fraud; provided
that the foregoing shall not limit any Liability that Blocker Seller or the
Designated Unitholders may have to Buyer with respect to such Authorized
Action. Blocker Seller and each Designated Unitholder, severally in accordance
to its Unitholder Percentage, and not jointly or jointly and severally, will
indemnify, reimburse and hold harmless the Representative against all
expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and
reasonably incurred by the Representative in connection with any Proceeding to
which the Representative is made a party by reason of the fact that the
Representative is or was acting as the Representative pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement.

(e) Duties of the Representative. The Representative shall have only the
duties expressly stated in the Transaction Documents, and shall have no other
duty, express or implied. The Representative is not, by virtue of serving as
Representative, a fiduciary of Blocker Seller, any Designated Unitholders or
any other Person. The Representative, in its capacity as such, has no personal
responsibility or Liability for any representation, warranty or covenant of
the Company or any other Person. The Representative shall not be required to
make any inquiry concerning either the performance or observance of any of the
terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement.

(f) Exculpation. The Representative shall not be liable to Blocker Seller or
any Designated Unitholder for any action taken or omitted by it or any agent
employed by it under any Transaction Document, except to the extent that such
action or omission is found by a final order of a court of competent
jurisdiction to have constituted actual fraud. The Representative shall not be
liable to Blocker Seller or any Designated Unitholder for any apportionment or
distribution of the Transaction Consideration except to the extent that such
apportionment or distribution is found by a final order of a court of
competent jurisdiction to have constituted actual fraud. Neither the
Representative nor any agent employed by it shall incur any Liability to
Blocker Seller or any Designated Unitholder relating to the performance of its
other duties hereunder, except to the extent that the Representative is found
by a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction to have committed actual
fraud in connection therewith. 14.18 Company Representation. Buyer, for itself and on behalf of its
respective Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) and their respective directors,
equityholders, members, partners, officers, employees and Affiliates, hereby
agrees that, in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing between
Buyer, the Surviving Company and/or its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the
Representative, Blocker Seller or any Designated Unitholder, on the other
hand, Kirkland and Ellis LLP may represent the Representative, Blocker Seller or
such Designated Unitholder in such dispute, even though the interests of the
Representative, Blocker Seller or such Designated Unitholder may be directly
adverse to Buyer, the Surviving Company and/or its Subsidiaries and even
though Kirkland and Ellis LLP may have represented the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries in the Transactions. Buyer and Merger Sub further agree that, as
to all communications among Kirkland and Ellis LLP, the Representative, the
Company, and of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective Affiliates that
relate in any way to the Transactions, the attorney-client privilege and the
expectation of client confidence belongs to the Representative and shall not
pass to or be claimed by Buyer, the Surviving Company or any of their
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute
arises between Buyer, the Surviving Company or any of their Subsidiaries and a
third party (other than a party to any Transaction Document or any Affiliate
of any such party) after the Closing, the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of
confidential communications by Kirkland and Ellis LLP to such third party;
provided that neither the Surviving Company nor its Subsidiaries may waive
such privilege without the prior written consent of the Representative. In
addition, all of the client files and records in the possession of Kirkland and
Ellis LLP related to the Transactions will be property of (and be controlled
by) the Representative and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall be entitled to retain copies of, or have access to, any such records.

14.19 Acknowledgements. The representations and warranties of the Company
expressly set forth in ARTICLE VI and the representations and warranties of
Blocker Seller expressly set forth in ARTICLE V constitute the sole and
exclusive representations and warranties made to Buyer and its Affiliates or
any other Person with respect to the Group Companies, the Unitholders, Blocker
Seller, Blocker and their respective Affiliates in connection with the
Transactions, and Buyer, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates,
acknowledges and agrees that any other representations and warranties of any
kind or nature, express or implied, are specifically disclaimed by the Group
Companies, the Unitholders, Blocker, Blocker Seller and their respective
Affiliates and shall not form the basis of any claim against the Group
Companies, the Unitholders, Blocker, Blocker Seller, any of their respective
Affiliates or any other Person. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer, on its
own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates, acknowledges and agrees that Buyer
and its Affiliates have not relied on any representations or warranties
whatsoever, whether express or implied, other than the representations and
warranties of the Company expressly set forth in ARTICLE VI and the
representations and warranties of Blocker Seller expressly set forth in
ARTICLE V. In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer, on its own behalf and on
behalf of its Affiliates, acknowledges that Buyer and its Affiliates have
conducted, to their satisfaction, an independent investigation of the
financial condition and position, results of operations, assets, liabilities,
properties and projected operations of Blocker and the Group Companies prior
to making their determination to proceed with the Transactions and have
completed such investigations of Blocker and the Group Companies as they deem
necessary and appropriate, and have received all of the information that they
have requested from the Company and its Subsidiaries and Blocker in connection
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents and the consummation of the Transactions. In connection with
Buyer\'s and its Affiliates\' investigation of Blocker and the Group
Companies, Buyer and its Affiliates have received certain projections,
including projected statements of operating revenues and income from
operations of the Group Companies, and certain business plan information.
Buyer, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates, acknowledges that
there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates,
projections and other forecasts and plans, that Buyer and its Affiliates are
familiar with such uncertainties and that Buyer and its Affiliates are taking
full responsibility for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and
accuracy of all estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans so
furnished to it, including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
such estimates, projections and forecasts. 14.20 Guaranty.

(a) The Guarantor, intending to be legally bound, hereby irrevocably,
unconditionally and absolutely guarantees to Blocker Seller and the Company
the full and punctual payment by US Buyer and Irish Buyer of all of US
Buyer\'s and Irish Buyer\'s respective obligations arising (i) at or prior to
the Closing pursuant to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including US Buyer\'s and Irish Buyer\'s payment obligations set forth
in Section 3.02(b)(i) and 3.02(b)(ii), or (ii) pursuant to Section 13.02 upon
termination of this Agreement (collectively, the "Guaranteed Obligations").
The Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that the obligation of the Guarantor
under this Section 14.20 is one of payment, not collection, and a separate
action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against the Guarantor to
enforce this Section 14.20, irrespective of whether any action is brought
against US Buyer or Irish Buyer or whether US Buyer or Irish Buyer is joined
in any such action or actions. The Guarantor further acknowledges and agrees
that the obligations of the Guarantor under this Section 14.20 shall be
unconditional and absolute and no release or extinguishments of US Buyer or
Irish Buyer obligations or liabilities, whether by decree in any bankruptcy
proceeding or otherwise, shall affect the continuing validity and
enforceability of this guarantee; provided, however, that the Guarantor shall
be entitled to assert as a defense to any claim for payment or performance of
the Guaranteed Obligations any and all of the rights, defenses, counterclaims,
exculpations, set-offs, indemnities and limitations on liability to which US
Buyer or Irish Buyer may be entitled to assert under this Agreement, including
that (i) such Guaranteed Obligations are not currently due under the terms of
this Agreement, or (ii) that such Guaranteed Obligations have previously been
paid or performed in full. The foregoing guarantee shall remain in full force
and effect until the date on which each Guaranteed Obligation has been
completely performed and/or paid in full, as applicable. The Guarantor agrees
that it will reimburse Blocker Seller and the Company for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and
expenses) that are incurred by Blocker Seller and the Company in connection
with any action pursuant to which this Section 14.20 is enforced against the
Guarantor pursuant to a final non-appealable order.

(b) The Guarantor hereby represents and warrants to Blocker Seller and the
Company, as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date, that:

(i) The Guarantor is a Ireland public limited company duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of Ireland and has all requisite
power and authority to enter into and perform its obligations under this
Agreement.

(ii) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the
Guarantor, and this Agreement is the legal, valid and binding obligation of
the Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms,
except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other
similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors\' rights generally. All
necessary consents, approvals and authorizations have been provided by the
applicable governing body and equityholders of the Guarantor in connection
with this Agreement.

(iii) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the Transactions will (A) violate, conflict with or result in
a breach of or constitute a default under any provision of the Guarantor\'s
organizational documents, (B) violate, conflict with or result in a breach of
or constitute a default under any judgment, order, decree, rule or regulation
of any court or Governmental Authority to which the Guarantor is subject or
(C) violate, conflict with or result in a breach of any Law. (iv) The Guarantor has, as of the date of this Agreement, and will have for so
long as

any Guaranteed Obligations remain outstanding, access to sufficient funds to
guarantee, in cash, the payment by US Buyer and Irish Buyer of the Guaranteed
Obligations.
