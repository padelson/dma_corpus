pursuant to _Section 2.09_ , to the seller of such Share in cash, without
interest, on the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement.

  

  

(c) Buyer expressly reserves the right at any time to, in its sole discretion,
waive, in whole or in part, any of the Offer Conditions and to make any change
in the terms of, or conditions to, the Offer; _provided_ , that, without the
prior written consent of the Company, Buyer shall not (and Parent shall cause
Buyer not to):

  

  

(i) waive or change the Minimum Condition (except to the extent contemplated
under _paragraph (A)_ of _Annex I_ );

  

  

 

15  

  


 

  

(ii) decrease the Offer Consideration;

  

  

(iii) change the form of consideration to be paid in the Offer;

  

  

(iv) decrease the number of Shares sought in the Offer;

  

  

(v) extend or otherwise change the Expiration Time, except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement; or

  

  

(vi) impose additional Offer Conditions or otherwise amend, modify or
supplement any of the Offer Conditions or terms of the Offer in a manner
adverse to the holders of Shares.

  

  

(d) The Offer shall initially expire at 9:00 a.m. (New York City time), or at
such other time as the Parties may mutually agree, on the date that is the
later of (i) twenty-one (21) Business Days (calculated in accordance with Rule
14d-1(g)(3) under the 1934 Act) following the commencement of the Offer and
(ii) six (6) Business Days after the date of the EGM (such initial expiration
date and time of the Offer, the " _Initial Expiration Time_ ") or, if the
Offer has been extended pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 2.01(e)_ ,
the date and time to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial
Expiration Time, or such later expiration date and time to which the Offer has
been so extended, the " _Expiration Time_ ").

  

  

(e) Subject to _Article 8_ , Buyer may or shall (in which case Parent shall
cause Buyer to), as applicable, extend the Offer from time to time as follows:

  

  

(i) Buyer shall (and Parent shall cause Buyer to) extend the Offer for the
minimum period as required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position
of the SEC, the staff thereof or the NYSE applicable to the Offer;

  

  

(ii) if, at the then-scheduled Expiration Time, any of the Offer Conditions
has not either been (A) satisfied or (B) waived by Buyer (to the extent such
waiver is not prohibited under this Agreement and applicable Law), then Buyer
shall (and Parent shall cause Buyer to) extend the Offer on one or more
occasions in consecutive periods of up to ten (10) Business Days each (with
each such period to end at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the last Business
Day of such period) (or such other duration as may be agreed to by Buyer and
the Company) in order to permit the satisfaction of such Offer Condition(s);
_provided_ , that if Buyer determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel, that at any then-scheduled Expiration Time, the
Offer Condition set forth in paragraph (B) or paragraph (C) of _Annex I_ is
not reasonably likely to be satisfied within such ten (10) Business Day
extension period, then Buyer may extend the Offer on such occasion for periods
of up to twenty (20) Business Days; _provided_ _further_ , that (x) Buyer
shall not be required to extend the Offer to a date later than the End Date
(as the End Date may be extended pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(i)_ ) and (y) if
the sole then-unsatisfied Offer Condition is the Minimum Condition, Buyer
shall not be required to extend the Offer on more than two (2) occasions in
consecutive periods of up to ten (10) Business Days each (with each such
period to end at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the last Business Day of
such period) (or such other duration as may be agreed to by Buyer and the
Company); or

  

  

 

16  

  


 

  

(iii) Buyer may extend the Offer to such other date and time as may be
mutually agreed by Parent and the Company in writing.

  

  

(f) Following the Acceptance Time, Buyer shall (and Parent shall cause Buyer
to) (and the Offer Documents shall so indicate) provide a subsequent offering
period (" _Subsequent Offering Period_ ") in accordance with Rule 14d-11
promulgated under the 1934 Act of not less than ten (10) Business Days
(calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the 1934
Act). In the event that prior to the expiration of the Subsequent Offering
Period, Buyer or one of its Affiliates has publicly indicated its intention
to, subject to the terms of this Agreement, effectuate the Asset Sale, Buyer
shall (and Parent shall cause Buyer to) (and the Offer Documents shall so
indicate) extend the Subsequent Offering Period for at least five (5) Business
Days to permit any remaining Minority Shareholders to tender their Shares in
exchange for the Offer Consideration (such extension, the " _Minority Exit
Offering Period_ ").

  

  

(g) The Offer may not be terminated prior to the Initial Expiration Time or
the then-scheduled Expiration Time (as the same may be extended pursuant to
_Section 2.01(e)_ ) unless this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
_Section 8.01_. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to _Section
8.01_ , Buyer shall (and Parent shall cause Buyer to) promptly (and in any
event within twenty-four (24) hours following such valid termination)
terminate the Offer and not acquire any Shares pursuant thereto. If the Offer
is terminated in accordance with this Agreement by Buyer prior to the
acceptance for payment and payment for Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer,
Buyer shall (and Parent shall cause Buyer to) promptly return, and shall cause
any depositary acting on behalf of Buyer to return, in accordance with
applicable Law, all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof. Nothing
in this _Section 2.01(g)_ shall affect any termination rights under _Article
8_.

  

  

(h) As soon as practicable on the Offer Commencement Date, Parent and Buyer
shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with
respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements thereto and
including exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ "), which shall contain or
incorporate by reference an offer to purchase and a related letter of
transmittal and other appropriate ancillary offer documents required to be
included therein (such Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant
to which the Offer will be made, together with any amendments or supplements
thereto and including exhibits thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and (ii)
cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares to the
extent required by applicable United States federal securities Laws and any
other applicable Law. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Buyer
all information concerning the Company required by the 1934 Act and applicable
Law, or as reasonably requested by Parent, to be set forth in the Offer
Documents. Each of Parent and Buyer, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Schedule TO and the Offer
Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become (or
shall have become known to be) false or misleading in any material respect.
Parent and Buyer shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Schedule
TO as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and the Offer Documents as so
corrected to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case to the extent
required by applicable United States federal securities Laws and any other
applicable Law. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents
each time before any such document is filed with the SEC, and Parent and Buyer
shall consider in good faith including in such document (and any amendments
thereto) all comments reasonably proposed by the Company and its counsel.
Parent and Buyer shall provide the Company and its counsel with (A) any
comments or other communications, whether written or oral, that Parent and
Buyer or their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff
or other Governmental Authorities with respect to the Schedule TO or the Offer
Documents promptly after receipt of those comments or other communications and
(B) a reasonable opportunity to participate in the response of Parent and
Buyer to those comments and to provide comments on that response (and Parent
and Buyer shall consider in good faith including all comments reasonably
proposed by the Company and its counsel), including by participating with
Parent and Buyer or their counsel in any discussions or meetings with the SEC
or other Governmental Authorities to the extent such participation is not
prohibited by the SEC or other Governmental Authorities.

Section 2.02 _Company Action_.

  

  

(a) The Company hereby approves and consents to the Offer and the other
Signing Transactions. The Company shall promptly (and in any event within five
(5) Business Days prior to the Offer Commencement Date) furnish Parent and
Buyer with (i) a list of its shareholders and mailing labels containing the
names and addresses of its record holders of Shares, (ii) any available
listing and computer file containing the names and addresses of all record
holders of Shares and lists of securities positions of Shares held in stock
depositories and (iii) copies of all lists of shareholders, security position
listings and computer files in the Company's possession or control regarding
the beneficial owners of Shares, in each case, true and correct as of the most
recent practicable date, and shall provide to Parent and Buyer such additional
information (including updated lists of shareholders, mailing labels and lists
of securities positions) and such other assistance as Parent or Buyer may
reasonably request in connection with the Offer. In the event that the Company
is prohibited from providing any such information, (A) it shall request
permission from the applicable shareholders to provide such information to
Parent and Buyer and (B) if the information requested is not received at least
five (5) Business Days prior to the Offer Commencement Date, the Company shall
deliver to such shareholders all information that would otherwise be required
to be provided by Parent or Buyer to such shareholders of the Company in
connection with the Offer, and, notwithstanding this _Article 2_ , neither
Parent nor Buyer shall have any obligation to deliver such information to such
shareholders under this Agreement. Except as required by applicable Law, and
except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and
any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer, (i) Parent and its
Affiliates and Representatives shall hold in confidence the information
contained in such labels, listings and files, shall use such information only
in connection with the Transactions, and (ii) if this Agreement is terminated,
Parent and Buyer shall deliver to the Company and shall use their reasonable
best efforts to cause their Affiliates and Representatives to deliver to the
Company all copies and any extracts or summaries from such information then in
their possession.

  

  

 

18  

  


 

  

(b) On the Offer Commencement Date, the Company shall, concurrently with the
filing of the Schedule TO, file with the SEC and disseminate to holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable United States
federal securities Laws and any other applicable Law, a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any
amendments or supplements thereto and including exhibits thereto, the "
_Schedule 14D-9_ ") that, subject to _Section 5.03(d)_ , shall reflect the
Company Recommendation. Parent and Buyer shall promptly furnish to the Company
all information concerning Parent, Buyer or any of their applicable Affiliates
required by the 1934 Act and applicable Law, or as reasonably requested by the
Company, to be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company, on the
one hand, and Parent and Buyer, on the other hand, agrees promptly to correct
any information provided by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have become (or shall
have become known to be) false or misleading in any material respect. The
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so
corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of
Shares, in each case to the extent required by applicable United States
federal securities Laws and any other applicable Law. Parent, Buyer and their
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Schedule 14D-9 each time before it is filed with the SEC, and the Company
shall consider in good faith including in such document (and any amendments
thereto) all comments reasonably proposed by Parent, Buyer and their counsel.
The Company shall provide Parent, Buyer and their counsel with (i) any
comments or other communications, whether written or oral, that the Company or
its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff or other
Governmental Authorities with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after
receipt of those comments or other communications and (ii) a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the Company's response to those comments and to
provide comments on that response (and the Company shall consider in good
faith including all comments reasonably proposed by Parent, Buyer and their
counsel), including by participating with the Company or its counsel in any
discussions or meetings with the SEC or other Governmental Authorities to the
extent such participation is not prohibited by the SEC or other Governmental
Authorities.

  

  

Section 2.03 _Outstanding Equity Awards_.

  

  

(a) _Company PSUs and Vested Company RSUs_. At the Closing, each Company PSU
that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing (whether vested or
unvested) and each Company RSU that is outstanding and vested as of
immediately prior to the Closing or that is held by a non-employee director of
the Company (whether vested or unvested), in each case, shall, without any
action on the part of Parent, Buyer, the Company, the holder thereof or any
other Person, be canceled and (consistent with the Company Equity Plan)
converted into and shall become a right to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the Offer
Consideration by (y) the total number of Shares subject to such Company PSU or
Company RSU as of immediately prior to the Closing (which, in the case of
Company PSUs, shall vest based on achievement of actual performance conditions
in accordance with the terms of the award).

  

  

 

19  

  


 

  

(b) _Unvested Company RSUs_. Except as otherwise agreed between Parent and the
holder of a Company RSU, at the Closing, each Company RSU that is outstanding
and unvested as of immediately prior to the Closing and that is not held by a
non-employee director of the Company (whether vested or unvested) shall
without any action on the part of Parent, Buyer, the Company, the holder
thereof or any other Person, be canceled and (consistent with the Company
Equity Plan) converted into a restricted stock unit award (an " _Adjusted RSU_
"), with substantially the same terms and conditions (including with respect
to vesting) as were applicable to such Company RSU immediately prior to the
Closing, with respect to a number of shares of Parent common stock that is
equal to the product (rounded to the nearest whole share) obtained by
multiplying (x) the Exchange Ratio by (y) the total number of Shares subject
to such Company RSU as of immediately prior to the Closing.

  

  

(c) _Vested Company Options_. At the Closing, each Company Option that is
outstanding and vested as of immediately prior to the Closing shall, without
any action on the part of Parent, Buyer, the Company, the holder thereof or
any other Person, be canceled and (consistent with the Company Equity Plan)
converted into and shall become a right to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of the Offer
Consideration over the applicable per Share exercise price of such Company
Option multiplied by (y) the number of Shares subject to such Company Option
as of immediately prior to the Closing.

  

  

(d) _Unvested Company Options_. Except as otherwise agreed between Parent and
the holder of a Company Option, at the Closing, each Company Option that is
outstanding and unvested as of immediately prior to the Closing shall, without
any action on the part of Parent, Buyer, the Company, the holder thereof or
any other Person, be canceled and (consistent with the Company Equity Plan)
converted into a stock option award (an " _Adjusted Option_ "), with
substantially the same terms and conditions (including with respect to
vesting) as were applicable to such Company Option immediately prior to the
Closing, (i) with respect to a number of shares of Parent common stock that is
equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole share) obtained by
multiplying (x) the Exchange Ratio by (y) the total number of Shares subject
to such Company Option as of immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) at an
exercise price per share that is equal to the quotient (rounded up to the
nearest cent) obtained by dividing (x) the exercise price per share of such
Company Option (y) by the Exchange Ratio.

  

  

(e) The payments in respect of Company Equity Awards described in _Section
2.03(a)_ or _Section 2.03(c)_ shall be subject to _Section 2.09_.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) with respect to any
Company Equity Award that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation
subject to Section 409A of the Code, to the extent that payment of the amounts
described in _Section 2.03(a)_ or _Section 2.03(c)_ would otherwise cause the
imposition of a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such payment
shall instead be made at the earliest time permitted under the Company Equity
Plan and applicable award agreement that shall not result in the imposition of
such Tax or penalty and (ii) with respect to Company Equity Awards held by
individuals subject to Taxes imposed by the Laws of a country other than the
United States, the Parties shall cooperate in good faith prior to the Closing
with the goal of minimizing the Tax impact of the provisions set forth in
_Section 2.03(a)_ or _Section 2.03(c)_.

  

  

 

20  

  


 

  

(f) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing (but no later than the
second payroll date after the Closing), the applicable holders of Company
Equity Awards shall receive the payments described in _Section 2.03(a)_ and
_Section 2.03(c)_ from the Company or its applicable Subsidiary or Affiliate
through its payroll system or payroll provider. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if any such payment owed to a holder of such a Company Equity Award cannot be
made through the Company's (or its applicable Subsidiary's or Affiliate's)
payroll system or payroll provider, then the Company (or its applicable
Subsidiary or Affiliate) shall issue a check for such payment to such holder
as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date.

  

  

(g) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
and in any event prior to the Closing, the Company, the Company Board and the

amendments as may be necessary to effectuate the provisions of this _Section
2.03_. The Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary to provide that

share capital of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of
Company Equity Awards after the Closing. On or as soon as reasonably practical

Adjusted Options and Adjusted RSUs.

(vii) conduct such other business as may properly come before the meeting.

  

  

(b) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement but, in the
case of the Proxy Statement, in no event later than the fifteenth (15th)
Business Day after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and
file with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement to be sent to the Company's

the Company, as applicable, and the Company shall consider in good faith
including in the EGM Materials all comments reasonably proposed by Parent,

22  

  


 

  

(c) The Company shall consult with Parent and Buyer regarding the date of the
EGM (or any Subsequent EGM) and, unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with _Section 8.01_ , shall not cancel, postpone or adjourn the EGM
(or any Subsequent EGM) without the prior written consent of Parent and Buyer;
_provided_ , that the Company may, on no more than one (1) occasion, following
reasonable consultation with Parent and Buyer, adjourn, postpone or cancel and
reconvene the EGM solely to the extent reasonably necessary (x) to ensure that
any supplement or amendment to the relevant EGM Materials that the Company
Board, after consultation with outside counsel, reasonably determines is
necessary to comply with applicable Law is made available to the Company's
shareholders in advance of the EGM (and any Subsequent EGM) or (y) to solicit
additional proxies in favor of the approvals set forth in _Section 2.04(a)_ ,
if as of the date of the scheduled EGM there are not sufficient proxies that
have been received approving such matters. In the event the EGM is adjourned,
postponed or cancelled and reconvened pursuant to the foregoing proviso, the
Company shall duly give notice of and reconvene the EGM on a date scheduled by
mutual agreement of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Buyer, on the

as practicable following the date of such adjournment, postponement or
cancellation but, in any event, no later than the day that is thirty-five (35)
days following the date of such adjournment, postponement or cancellation (or,
in the case of any Subsequent EGM, a date that shall be prior to the date on
which the Expiration Time shall occur).

  

  

(d) The Company shall ensure that the EGM (and any Subsequent EGM) is called,
noticed, convened, held and conducted in compliance in all material respects
with all applicable Laws. The approval of the matters set forth in _Section
2.04(a)(i)-(vi)_ shall be the only matters that the Company shall propose to
be acted on by the shareholders of the Company at the EGM (and any Subsequent
EGM), unless otherwise reasonably proposed by the Company and approved in
advance in writing by Parent and Buyer (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Company
Board determines in its reasonable discretion that any additional shareholders
resolutions should be adopted in order to approve any of the Signing
Transactions, or if the Governance Resolutions or the Asset Sale Resolutions
have not been adopted at the EGM, then, in each case, the Company shall,
following consultation with Parent and Buyer, duly call and give notice of
another EGM (a " _Subsequent EGM_ "), which shall take place at a date
reasonably acceptable to Parent and Buyer and not later than a date that shall
be prior to the date of the Expiration Time, at which the Governance
Resolutions or the Asset Sale Resolutions, or the additional resolutions as
referred to above shall be considered or reconsidered, as the case may be.

  

  

 

23  

  


 

  

(f) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject to the
Company's rights to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.01_
, the Company agrees that (i) its obligation to duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold the EGM (and any Subsequent EGM) in accordance with and
subject to the terms hereof and (ii) its obligations pursuant to this _Section
2.04_ , in each case, shall not be affected by the commencement, public
proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Alternative
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal) or any Adverse
Recommendation Change. Unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
_Section 8.01_ , the Company agrees that it shall not submit to the vote of
the shareholders of the Company any Alternative Acquisition Proposal (whether
or not a Superior Proposal) or any matters relating thereto.

  

  

(g) At and prior to the EGM (and any Subsequent EGM), the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to secure the approval of the matters set forth in
_Section 2.04(a)_.

  

  

Section 2.05 _Directors_.

  

  

(a) Parent, Buyer and the Company shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to ensure that the Company Board will, upon the Closing, be comprised
of at least seven (7) directors, (i) at least five (5) of whom may be
designated in writing by Parent and Buyer (the " _Buyer Directors_ "), in
their sole discretion, as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event
prior to convening the EGM, and (ii) at least two (2) of whom shall initially
be current non-executive directors of the Company designated by the Company
and Buyer by mutual written agreement (if and to the extent that they shall
agree to continue to serve on the Company Board after the Closing), and who
shall at all times be independent from Parent, Buyer and the Majority
Shareholders and shall at all times qualify as independent in accordance with
the independence standards set forth in the Dutch Corporate Governance Code
2008; _provided_ , that, if and to the extent that the current non-executive
directors of the Company do not agree to serve on the Company Board after the
Closing, Buyer shall (and Parent shall cause Buyer to) designate replacement
directors who shall at all times be independent from Parent, Buyer and the
Majority Shareholders and who shall at all times qualify as independent in
accordance with the independence standards set forth in the Dutch Corporate
Governance Code 2008, as promptly as reasonably practicable and in any event
prior to convening the EGM (the directors so designated, " _Independent
Directors_ ").

  

  

(b) Each Independent Director shall resign from, and the Company shall take
such other action reasonably necessary to ensure that each such Independent
Director ceases to be a director of, the Company Board upon the earliest to
occur of (i) such time after the Acceptance Time as Buyer and its Affiliates,
in the aggregate, own one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding
Shares and (ii) the Second Step Distribution having been made and the
subsequent liquidation and dissolution of the Company (the " _Liquidation_ ")
having been completed.

  

  

 

24  

  


 

  

(c) If, at any time after the Closing, an Independent Director resigns from,
or otherwise ceases to be a member of, the Company Board, or ceases to be
independent from Parent, Buyer or the Majority Shareholders, in each case,
prior to the date of resignation contemplated by _Section 2.05(b)_ , Parent
shall procure that the respective Independent Director shall be replaced by a
new director that is independent from Parent, Buyer and the Majority
Shareholders and shall at all times qualify as independent in accordance with
the independence standards set forth in the Dutch Corporate Governance Code

and will not (a) materially contravene, conflict with or result in any
material violation or breach of any provision of the Company Organizational

to the loss of a benefit or right under, or result in the creation of any Lien
in or upon any of the properties, assets or rights of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries under, or require any consent, waiver or approval of any

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives to
afford Parent, Buyer and their Representatives reasonable access on reasonable
advance notice and in a manner not unreasonably disruptive to the operations
of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, during normal business
hours, to the officers, senior employees, Representatives, auditors,
properties, offices and other facilities and the books and records of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, and shall use reasonable best efforts to
promptly furnish or cause to be furnished to Parent, Buyer and their
Representatives copies (including in electronic form) of books, records and
other financial, operating and other data and information as Parent, Buyer or
their Representatives may reasonably request in writing; _provided_ , that
such access shall not permit Parent, Buyer and their Representatives to
conduct any invasive environmental testing or sampling at any of the
properties, offices and other facilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be
obligated to disclose any information (i) if providing such access or
disclosing such information would cause significant competitive harm to the
Company or its Subsidiaries if the Transactions are not consummated, (ii) if
providing such access or disclosing such information would violate any
applicable Law (including antitrust and privacy Laws) or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or (iii) that would, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company, result in the loss of attorney-client
privilege with respect to such information or would constitute a waiver of any
other privilege or trade secret protection held by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; _provided_ , that the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts (A) to allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not
result in a loss of attorney-client privilege or waiver of any other privilege
or trade secret protection or violation of any such applicable Law or binding
agreement or (B) to develop an alternative to providing such information so as
to address such matters that is reasonably acceptable to Parent, Buyer and the
Company. The Company shall advise Parent and Buyer in such circumstances that
it is unable to comply with Parent's and Buyer's reasonable requests for
information pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, and the Company
shall reasonably describe the reasons why such information is being withheld.
The Company shall be entitled to have Representatives present at all times
during any inspection by Parent, Buyer or their Representatives pursuant to
this _Section 5.02(a)_. No notice, access, review or investigation pursuant to
this _Section 5.02_ or information provided, made available or delivered to
Parent, Buyer or their Representatives pursuant to this _Section 5.02_ or
otherwise shall affect any representations or warranties of the Company or
conditions or rights of Parent or Buyer contained in this Agreement. No
investigation after the date of this Agreement shall affect or be deemed to
modify or supplement any representation or warranty made by the Company
herein.

  

  

 

57  

  


 

  

(b) All information and materials provided pursuant to this Agreement shall be
subject to the provisions of the confidentiality agreement dated as of March

the Confidentiality Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed
terminated as of the Closing.

  

  

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to give Parent or Buyer,
directly or indirectly, rights to control the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries before the Closing.

  

  

Section 5.03 _No Solicitation; Adverse Recommendation Change_.

  

  

(a) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective directors and officers not to, and the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts to cause its and
their respective Representatives not to, and shall not publicly announce any
intention to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly take
any action to facilitate or knowingly encourage (including by providing
information, cooperation or assistance) any inquiries or the making of any
proposal or offer that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to,
an Alternative Acquisition Proposal, (ii) other than informing Persons of the
provisions contained in this _Section 5.03_ , enter into, continue or

intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other Contract (whether or not binding) with respect to an
Alternative Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors and officers to, and
shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause each of the Representatives
of the Company and its Subsidiaries to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any and all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person
conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to any Alternative
Acquisition Proposal, and shall not modify, amend or terminate, or waive,
release or assign, any provisions of any confidentiality or standstill
agreement (or any similar agreement) to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party relating to any such Alternative Acquisition Proposal
and shall enforce the provisions of any such agreement; _provided_ , that the
Company shall, subject to and in accordance with _Section 5.03(b)_ , be
permitted to release or waive any such standstill obligations solely to the
extent necessary to permit the party referenced therein to submit an
unsolicited bona fide written Alternative Acquisition Proposal to the Company
Board on a confidential basis conditioned upon such Person agreeing that the
Company shall not be prohibited from providing any information to Parent and
Buyer regarding any such Alternative Acquisition Proposal in accordance with
the terms of this _Section 5.03_. The Company shall promptly (and in any event
within five (5) Business Days of the date of this Agreement) request each
Person that has, prior to the date of this Agreement, executed a
confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of any
Alternative Acquisition Proposal to, in accordance with the terms of such
agreement, return or destroy all confidential information furnished prior to
the execution of this Agreement to or for the benefit of such Person by or on
behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company agrees that it
shall promptly inform its Representatives of the obligations undertaken in

prior to the Acceptance Time, in the event that the Company receives an
unsolicited bona fide written Alternative Acquisition Proposal, the Company
may take the following actions upon giving notice to Parent (but only if (x)
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the Company directors' fiduciary duties under the Laws of
The Netherlands, (y) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such
Alternative Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected
to lead to a Superior Proposal and (z) the submission of such Alternative
Acquisition Proposal did not result from or arise in connection with a breach
of this _Section 5.03_ ):

  

  

(i) furnish non-public information with respect to the Company and its

Proposal; _provided_ , that (A) prior to furnishing any such non-public
information, it receives from such Person or group an executed confidentiality
agreement containing terms at least as restrictive to the Person or group as
the terms contained in the Confidentiality Agreement are to Parent or Buyer,
and which shall not contain any exclusivity provision or other term that would
restrict, in any manner, the Company's ability to consummate the Transactions
or to comply with its disclosure obligations to Parent and Buyer pursuant to
this Agreement (an " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and (B) prior
to or contemporaneously with furnishing any such non-public information to
such Person or group, it furnishes such non-public information to Parent or
Buyer to the extent Parent or Buyer has not previously been provided with such
information; and

  

  

(ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person or group with

reasonably be expected to lead to any Alternative Acquisition Proposal, the
Company shall provide Parent and Buyer with written notice of the material
terms and conditions of such Alternative Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry, and the identity of the Person or group making any such Alternative
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, if not previously provided pursuant

above and continuing until such Alternative Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry is withdrawn, (i) the Company (or its outside legal counsel) shall
keep Parent and Buyer (or their outside legal counsel) informed on a
reasonably current basis regarding the status and material terms (including
any changes thereto) of discussions and negotiations relating to any such
Alternative Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry (and within twenty-four
(24) hours after any changes to the material terms thereof) and (ii) the
Company shall, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within twenty-four
(24) hours following the receipt or delivery thereof), provide Parent and

the third (3rd) Business Day prior to the then-scheduled Expiration Time, or
the EGM or any Subsequent EGM, as applicable); or (E) publicly propose to do
any of the foregoing (any action described in this _clause (i)_ being referred
to as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "); or

  

  

 

60

allow the Company or any of its Affiliates to execute or enter into, any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger

partnership agreement or other similar Contract (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement as provided in _Section 5.03(b)_ ) (A) relating to
any Alternative Acquisition Proposal or any offer or proposal that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Alternative Acquisition Proposal or (B)
requiring it (or that would require it) to abandon, terminate or fail to
consummate the Transactions (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ").

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section 5.03(d)_ ,
solely in response to a Superior Proposal received by the Company Board after
the date of this Agreement, the Company Board may, at any time prior to the
Expiration Time, make an Adverse Recommendation Change, validly terminate this
Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal in accordance with _Section 8.01(d)(i)_ or authorize, resolve, agree
or propose publicly to take any such action, only if all of the following
conditions are met:

  

  

(i) the Company has not breached any of its obligations under this _Section
5.03_ (where such breach proximately caused such Superior Proposal being
received by the Company);

Days' prior written notice, which shall state expressly (1) that it has
received a Superior Proposal, (2) the material terms and conditions of the
Superior Proposal (including the consideration offered therein and the
identity of the Person or group making the Superior Proposal), and shall have
contemporaneously provided an unredacted copy of the Alternative Acquisition
Agreement and all other written materials, proposals, agreements or documents
related to the Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the financial terms or any other material term or condition of
such Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and a new two (2) Business
Day period) and (3) that, subject to _clause (iii)_ below, the Company Board
has determined to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or terminate
this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.01(d)(i)_ , as applicable, and
the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the failure to
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or terminate this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 8.01(d)(i)_ , as applicable, would be inconsistent
with the Company directors' fiduciary duties under the Laws of The Netherlands
and (B) prior to making such an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating
this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.01(d)(i)_ , as applicable, to the
extent requested in writing by Parent and Buyer, engaged in good faith
negotiations with Parent and Buyer during such four (4) or two (2) Business
Day period, as applicable, to amend this Agreement in such a manner that the
Alternative Acquisition Agreement ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal;
and

  

  

 

61  

  


 

  

(iii) no earlier than the end of the four (4) or two (2) Business Day period,
as applicable, the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that, in
light of such Superior Proposal and taking into account any revised terms
proposed by Parent and Buyer, such Superior Proposal continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal and that the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change and/or terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.01(d)(i)_
would continue to be inconsistent with the Company directors' fiduciary duties
under the Laws of The Netherlands.

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section 5.03(d)_ ,
upon the occurrence of any Intervening Event, the Company Board may, at any

all of the following conditions are met:

  

  

(i) the Company shall have (A) provided to Parent and Buyer four (4) Business
Days' prior written notice, which shall (1) set forth in reasonable detail
information describing the Intervening Event and the rationale for the Adverse
Recommendation Change and (2) state expressly that, subject to _clause (ii)_
below, the Company Board has determined to effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change and the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the
failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with
the Company directors' fiduciary duties under the Laws of The Netherlands and
(B) prior to making such an Adverse Recommendation Change, to the extent
requested in writing by Parent and Buyer, engaged in good faith negotiations
with Parent and Buyer during such four (4) Business Day period to amend this
Agreement in response to the Intervening Event in such a manner that the
failure of the Company Board to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to the Intervening Event in accordance with _clause (ii)_ below would
no longer be inconsistent with the Company directors' fiduciary duties under
the Laws of The Netherlands; and

  

  

(ii) no earlier than the end of the four (4) day Business Period, the Company
Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisors, that, in light of such Intervening Event
and taking into account any revised terms proposed by Parent and Buyer, the
failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would continue to be
inconsistent with the Company directors' fiduciary duties under the Laws of
The Netherlands (it being understood and agreed that any material change to
the circumstances giving rise to the Intervening Event that was previously the
subject of a notice hereunder shall require a new notice to Parent as provided
above; _provided_ , that, with respect to each such material change, each
reference in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii) to a "four (4) Business Day"
period shall be changed to refer to a "two (2) Business Day" period).

  

  

(g) Unless this Agreement is otherwise terminated pursuant to _Article 8_ ,
neither the Company nor the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall
take any action to make the provisions of any "fair price," "business
combination," "control share acquisition" or other state takeover statute or
similar Law inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by an Alternative
Acquisition Proposal.

  

  

 

62  

  


 

  

(h) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from taking and disclosing to the Company's shareholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
1934 Act (or any similar communication to shareholders in connection with the
making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer); _provided_ that any
such disclosure shall be deemed an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the
Company Board expressly publicly, definitively and without qualification
reaffirms the Company Recommendation.

  

  

Section 5.04 _Compensation Arrangements_. Prior to the Closing, the Company
(acting through the Company Board and the Compensation Committee) shall take
all steps that may be required, necessary or advisable to cause each (a)
Employment Compensation Arrangement that has been or, after the date of this
Agreement, shall be entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
with any current or former Company Service Provider, (b) to be approved as an
"employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement"
within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) promulgated under the 1934 Act and to
satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule
14d-10(d) promulgated under the 1934 Act.

  

  

Section 5.05 _Delisting_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall
cooperate with Parent and Buyer and use reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws
and rules and policies of the NYSE to cause the delisting of the Company and

Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act.

  

  

Section 5.07 _Anti-Takeover Measures_. The Company and the Company Board (and
any applicable committees thereof) shall take all actions within their power
and authority necessary so that no Anti-Takeover Measure is or becomes
applicable to any of the Transactions. If any Anti-Takeover Measure becomes
applicable to any of the Transactions, the Company and the Company Board (and
any applicable committees thereof) shall grant such approvals and take such
actions within their power and authority as are necessary so that any such
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act within their power and
authority to eliminate such Anti-Takeover Measures in respect of such
Transactions.

  

  

Section 5.08 _Certain Agreements_. Concurrently with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the Company, the Majority Shareholders and/or
their applicable Affiliates have duly executed and delivered to Parent true
and correct copies of (a) an amendment to the Contract set forth on _Section
5.08(a)_ of the Company Letter terminating each such Contract effective as of
the Closing on the terms set forth therein and (b) a Contract transferring to
the Company, concurrently with the execution thereof, certain Intellectual
Property Rights as set forth therein, each of which amendments and such
Contract shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be modified or
superseded at any time prior to the Closing.

ARTICLE 6 
  
  _COVENANTS OF BUYER_

  

  

Parent and Buyer jointly and severally agree that:

  

  

Section 6.01 _Director and Officer Liability_.

  

  

(a) For six (6) years after the Closing, Parent shall cause the Company and
its Subsidiaries to indemnify and hold harmless the present and former
directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries (each, an "
_Indemnified Person_ ") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Closing to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law. In the event
that any Indemnified Person is made party to any Action that would be
indemnifiable pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall
cause the Company to advance fees, costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorney's fees and disbursements) as incurred by such Indemnified Person in
connection with and prior to the final disposition of such Action, subject to
the execution by such Indemnified Person of appropriate undertakings to repay
such advanced fees, costs and expenses if it is ultimately determined that
such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification, in each case
except to the extent prohibited under applicable Law. For a period of six (6)
years following the Closing, Parent shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries under any and all indemnification agreements in
effect as of the date hereof between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and any Indemnified Person (the " _Indemnification Agreements_ "). In
addition, for a period of six (6) years following the Closing, Parent shall
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to cause the articles of association
and rules and regulations of the Company Board (or other similar
organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries to contain
provisions with respect to exculpation of Liability of all Indemnified
Persons, indemnification of all Indemnified Persons and advancement of fees,
costs and expenses that are no less advantageous in the aggregate to the
intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions contained in the
Company Organizational Documents as of the date hereof. To the maximum extent
permitted by applicable Law, such indemnification and exculpation shall be
mandatory rather than permissive.

  

  

(b) Parent shall obtain, or cause to be obtained, effective as of the Closing,
a "tail" insurance policy with a claims period of six (6) years after the
Closing with respect to directors' and officers' Liability insurance covering
each Person currently covered by the Company's directors' and officers'
Liability insurance policy for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Closing on terms that are no less favorable to those of such policy of the
Company in effect on the date of this Agreement, which insurance shall, prior
to the Closing, be in effect and prepaid for such six (6)-year period;
_provided_ , that in no event shall the total cost for such prepaid "tail"
insurance policy exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the annual premiums
paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance (the " _Premium
Cap_ "), and if the total cost for such prepaid "tail" policy exceeds the
Premium Cap, then Parent may obtain, or cause to be obtained, a prepaid "tail"
policy with the maximum coverage available for a total cost of the Premium
Cap. If Parent for any reason fails to obtain, or cause to be obtained, such
"tail" insurance policy as of the Closing, Parent shall continue, or cause to
be continued, to maintain in effect, for a period of six (6) years from and
after the Closing, the directors' and officers' Liability insurance in place
as of the date of this Agreement or a comparable policy with the Company's
current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Company's current directors' and officers' Liability
insurance carrier on terms no less favorable than those of such policy in
effect on the date of this Agreement (but in no event at a total cost for such
policy in excess of the Premium Cap).

  

  

 

64  

  


 

  

(c) If Parent, Buyer, the Company or any of their respective successors or
assigns (other than pursuant to the Transactions) (i) shall consolidate with,
or merge with or into, any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall
transfer all or substantially all of its properties or assets to any Person,
then, in each case, Parent or Buyer, as applicable, shall take such action as
may be necessary so that such Person shall assume all of the applicable
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.01_.

  

  

(d) Each of the Indemnified Persons is intended to be Third-Party
beneficiaries of this _Section 6.01_ , with full rights of enforcement as if
such Indemnified Person was a party hereto. The rights of any Indemnified
Person under this _Section 6.01_ shall be in addition to, and not in
substitution of, any other rights that such Persons may have under the Company
Organizational Documents, the Indemnification Agreements or applicable Law
(whether at Law or in equity).

  

  

Section 6.02 _Employee Matters_.

  

  

(a) For a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first (1st)
anniversary of the Closing Date, each employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries who remains employed by Parent, Buyer or any of their Affiliates
(each, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") shall receive from Parent or Buyer (or
their applicable Affiliate) (i) at least the same base salary and the same
target annual bonus opportunity that was provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date; (ii) long-term incentive opportunities
that are substantially as favorable in the aggregate as the long-term
incentive opportunities provided to similarly situated employees of Parent,
Buyer or their Affiliates and (iii) other compensation and employee benefits
(excluding those contemplated by clauses (i) and (ii) and severance (which is
covered in _Section 6.02(b)_ )) that are substantially as favorable in the
aggregate to the compensation and benefits provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent, Buyer or their Affiliates.

  

  

(b) Any Continuing Employee who incurs a termination of employment during the
period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first (1st)
anniversary of the Closing Date shall be entitled to receive the severance
payments and benefits that such Continuing Employee would have been entitled
to receive from the Company and its Affiliates under its applicable written
severance plans and policies as in effect immediately prior to the Closing and
that have been made available to Parent and Buyer in accordance with _Section
3.18(b)_ of this Agreement.

  

  

 

65  

  


 

  

(c) Parent and Buyer shall, and shall cause any of their applicable Affiliates
to, use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive all limitations as to any
pre-existing condition or waiting periods in its applicable welfare plans with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to each
Continuing Employee under any welfare plans that such Continuing Employee may
be eligible to participate in after the Closing and (ii) credit each
Continuing Employee for any copayments, deductibles, offsets or similar
payments made under a Company Plan during the plan year that includes the
Closing for purposes of satisfying any applicable copayment, deductible,
offset or similar requirements under the comparable plans of Parent, Buyer or
any of their Affiliates. As of the Closing, Parent and Buyer shall, or shall
cause any of their applicable Affiliates to, credit to Continuing Employees
the amount of vacation time that such employees had accrued under any
applicable Company Plan as of the Closing, in each case, insofar as not
prohibited by applicable Law. In addition, as of the Closing, Parent and Buyer
shall, and shall cause their applicable Affiliates to give Continuing
Employees full credit for purposes of eligibility, vesting and determination
of level of benefits under any employee benefit and compensation plans or
arrangements (including for purposes of vacation and severance but excluding
for any purpose benefits under defined benefit plans, retiree medical plans,
frozen or grandfathered benefit plans or benefit plans under which similarly-
situated employees of Parent and its Affiliates do not receive any service
credit) maintained by Parent, Buyer or their applicable Affiliates that such
Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate in after the Closing for
such Continuing Employees' service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to the same extent that such service was credited for purposes of any
comparable Company Plan immediately prior to the Closing, except, in each
case, to the extent such treatment would result in duplicative benefits.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding the generality of _Section 9.10_ , the provisions of this
_Section 6.02_ are solely for the benefit of the Parties, and no current or
former Company Service Provider or any other individual associated therewith
shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this
_Section 6.02_. In no event shall the terms of this Agreement be deemed to
confer upon any Company Service Provider any right to continued employment
with Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, following the Acceptance Time,
the Company and its Subsidiaries) or to limit the ability of Buyer, or any of
its Affiliates to terminate the employment of any employee at any time and for
any reason. Nothing herein shall be deemed to establish, amend, modify or
cause to be adopted any Company Plan or any other benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by Buyer, the Company or any
of their respective Affiliates.

  

  

(e) From and after the Closing Date, Parent and Buyer shall cause the Company
and its Subsidiaries to honor the terms of all Labor Agreements to which the
Company or its Subsidiaries are bound. In addition, the terms of employment of
all Continuing Employees represented by a labor union, works council or other
labor organization in connection with their employment or any other Continuing
Employees employed in any jurisdiction where it is not permitted to
differentiate between union and non-union employees in terms of compensation
and/or benefits shall be governed by any such obligations, rather than the
terms of this Agreement.

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, from and after
the Closing Date, Parent and Buyer shall cause the Company to honor, in
accordance with their terms without giving effect to any amendments thereto
after the Closing Date except if adopted in accordance with the terms of the
applicable arrangement, all benefits and obligations under the employment and
severance agreements of the Company and its Affiliates.

  

  

 

66  

  


 

  

(g) The occurrence of the Closing shall be deemed to be a change in control
(or a similar term) under all Company Plans.

  

  

(h) Any written or oral communications to any Company Service Provider
pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that relate to or are affected
by the Transactions shall be provided to Parent for prior approval by Parent
(such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), it
being agreed that Parent shall have a reasonable time to review any such
communication and that Parent and the Company shall cooperate in providing any
such mutually agreeable communication.

  

  

ARTICLE 7 
  
  _COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES_

  

  

The Parties agree that:

  

  

Section 7.01 _Regulatory Approvals; Efforts_.

  

  

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Parties shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to consummate and make effective the Transactions in
accordance with the terms hereof and subject to _Section 7.01(g)_. Without
limiting the foregoing, during the Pre-Closing Period, the Parties shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to (i) promptly obtain all
authorizations, consents, Orders and approvals of all Governmental Authorities
or other Persons that may be, or become, necessary for the performance of
their respective obligations pursuant to this Agreement and the consummation
of the Transactions, (ii) take all actions as may be requested by any such
Governmental Authority to obtain such authorizations, consents, Orders and
approvals and (iii) avoid entry of, or effect the dissolution of, any Order
that would have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the
consummation of the Transactions. The Parties shall cooperate in seeking to
promptly obtain all such authorizations, consents, Orders and approvals. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party agrees to (A)
make an appropriate and complete filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions within ten (10)
Business Days of the date of this Agreement, (B) make all other required
filings with respect to the EU Merger Regulation and the Other Required
Antitrust Approvals and any other applicable Antitrust Laws promptly (and

to any inquiries or requests received from the United States Federal Trade
Commission, the United States Department of Justice or any other Governmental
Authority in connection with antitrust or related matters.

  

  

(b) The Parties shall consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in
good faith the views of one another, in connection with, and each Party shall
provide to the other Parties in advance, any material written analyses,
presentations, memoranda, briefs and proposals made or submitted to any
Governmental Authority by or on behalf of any Party hereto in connection with
proceedings relating to any Antitrust Laws; _provided_ , that each Party may
limit disclosure of commercially sensitive portions of such materials to the
outside legal counsel and consultants of the other Parties.

  

  

 

67  

  


 

  

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Party shall give
the other Parties prompt notice of any pending or threatened request, inquiry,
or Action brought by a Governmental Authority, or brought by a Third Party
before any Governmental Authority, in each case with respect to the
Transactions under any Antitrust Laws (an " _Antitrust Investigation_ "). With
respect to any such Antitrust Investigation, and subject to applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of information and appropriate agreements to limit
disclosure to outside counsel and consultants retained by such counsel and to
preserve the attorney-client or other legal privileges, each Party shall use
its reasonable best efforts to (i) keep the other Parties informed as to the
status of any such request, inquiry, or Action, (ii) promptly inform the other
Parties of any communication (excluding non-material communications) to or
from the United States Federal Trade Commission, United States Department of
Justice or any other Governmental Authority, in connection with any such
request, inquiry or Action (and, if in writing, furnish the other Parties with
a copy of such communication), (iii) give each other reasonable advance notice
of all meetings or teleconferences (excluding non-material teleconferences)
with any Governmental Authority in connection with any such request, inquiry
or Action and (iv) consult in advance and cooperate with the other Parties and
consider in good faith the views of the other Parties in connection with
(including providing reasonable opportunity for the other Parties to comment
upon) any material analysis, presentation, memorandum, brief or proposal to be
made or submitted to any such Governmental Authority.

  

  

(d) The Company, Parent and Buyer shall promptly furnish to each other all
information required or requested to be included in any application, filing or
submission to be made pursuant to the rules and regulations of any
Governmental Authority in connection with the applications or other filings to
be made under applicable Antitrust Laws. The Parties shall have the right to
review in advance, and to the extent practicable each shall consult the other
on, all the information relating to Parent, Buyer or the Company, as the case
may be, and any of their respective Affiliates that appear in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to (in each case, including any
amendments thereto), any Third Party and/or any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Transactions or filings to be made under applicable
Antitrust Laws (and any amendments thereto), and shall consider in good faith
comments proposed by Buyer or the Company, as the case may be; _provided_ ,
that with respect to any documents or materials required to be filed under
applicable Antitrust Laws that contain information (i) that is commercially
sensitive or (ii) the provision of which would infringe Antitrust Laws, such
information may be provided solely to those individuals acting as outside
legal counsel for the other Parties; _provided_ _further_ , that such counsel
shall not disclose such information to such other Parties and shall enter into
a joint defense agreement in customary form with outside legal counsel for the
providing Party, if requested.

  

  

(e) Each Party further agrees to cooperate with the others in order to resolve
any investigation or other inquiry concerning the Transactions initiated by
the United States Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice or any Governmental Authority. Each Party
shall promptly notify the others of any material written notice or other
communication received by such Party from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Transactions and, to the extent reasonably practicable,
all discussions, telephone calls and meetings with a Governmental Authority
regarding the Transactions shall include the Representatives of the Company,
on the one hand, and Parent and Buyer, on the other hand.

  

  

 

68  

  


 

  

(f) In the event that any Action is commenced challenging the Transactions as
violating any Antitrust Law, each Party shall cooperate with each other Party
and use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such
Action and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Order resulting
therefrom, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and
that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Transactions;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the obligations in this _Section 7.01(f)_ shall
expire as of the End Date.

  

  

(g) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to, promptly, and in any event
prior to the End Date, take all actions necessary to (x) secure the approvals,
expiration or termination of any waiting period (and any extension thereof)
applicable to the consummation of the Transactions under the HSR Act or EU
Merger Regulation and the Other Required Antitrust Approvals and (y) resolve
any objections asserted with respect to the Transactions under applicable Law
raised by any Governmental Authority, in each case, to the extent necessary in
order to prevent the entry of any Legal Restraint that would prevent,
prohibit, restrict or delay the consummation of the Transactions, _provided_ ,
that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary in this
Agreement, in no event shall Parent or any of its Subsidiaries be obligated
to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not agree to (other than at the
written request of Parent, in which case the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall, provided the effectiveness of any such action is conditioned on the
Closing), (i) proffer to, or agree to, sell, divest, lease, license, transfer,
dispose of or otherwise encumber or hold separate and agree to sell, divest,
lease, license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber before or after the
Acceptance Time, any assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines,
businesses or interest therein of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries or
Parent and any of its Subsidiaries (or to consent to any such sale,
divestiture, lease, license, transfer, disposition or other encumbrance by the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries or Parent and any of its Subsidiaries of
any of their respective assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines,
businesses or interest therein), (ii) agree to any material changes (including
through a licensing arrangement) or restriction on, or other impairment of
Parent's, the Company's or any of their respective Subsidiaries' ability to
own or operate, any such assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines,
businesses or interests therein or Parent's and Buyer's ability to vote,
transfer, receive dividends or otherwise exercise full ownership rights with
respect to the capital stock of the Company or (iii) agree to other
structural, behavioral or conduct relief with respect to the behavior of
Parent, Buyer or the Company and any of their Subsidiaries (each of the
actions described in the preceding _clauses (i)_ , _(ii)_ and _(iii)_ , a "
_Remedy Action_ "), unless such Remedy Action(s) do not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a material impact on the benefits that Parent reasonably
expects to derive from the Transactions.

  

  

(h) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent shall have principal responsibility for determining the
timing and sequence of seeking the required authorizations, consents, Orders
and approvals under applicable Antitrust Laws and other Laws and from any
Governmental Authorities and strategy with respect to obtaining any such
authorizations, consents, Orders and approvals.

  

  

 

69  

  


 

  

(i) Parent and Buyer, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand,
agree to refrain from, and to cause each of their respective Affiliates to
refrain from, acquiring or agreeing to acquire any assets or businesses that
would reasonably be expected to (1) prevent, materially impede, or materially
delay receipt of any authorizations, consents, Orders, or approvals of
Governmental Authorities, or (2) prevent, materially delay, or materially
impede the Closing.

  

  

Section 7.02 _Certain Filings_. The Parties shall cooperate with one another
(a) in connection with the preparation of the Company Disclosure Documents,
the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents, (b) in determining whether any action
by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required,
or any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are reasonably required to be
obtained from parties to any Contracts, in connection with the consummation of
the Transactions and (c) in taking such actions or making any such filings,
furnishing information required in connection therewith or with the Company
Disclosure Documents, the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents and seeking
timely to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers.

  

  

Section 7.03 _Further Assurances_. If, at any time before or after the
Acceptance Time, the Company or Buyer reasonably believes that any further
instruments, deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances are reasonably
necessary or desirable to consummate the Transactions or to carry out the
purposes and intent of this Agreement, then, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Company and Buyer shall, and Buyer shall
cause Parent to, execute and deliver all such proper deeds, assignments,
instruments and assurances and do all other things reasonably necessary or
desirable to consummate the Transactions and to carry out the purposes and
intent of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 7.04 _Public Announcements_. Parent and Buyer, on the one hand, and
the Company, on the other hand, shall consult with one another prior to
issuing, and provide each other with the opportunity to review and comment
upon, any press release, public announcement, public statement or other public
disclosure with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions and shall not
issue any such press release, public announcement, public statement or other
public disclosure prior to such consultation without the prior written consent
of the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), except as may be required by applicable Law or by the rules and
regulations of the NYSE, in which event Parent and Buyer, on the one hand, and
the Company, on the other hand, shall endeavor, on a basis reasonable under
the circumstances, to provide a meaningful opportunity to Parent and Buyer or
the Company, as applicable, to review and comment upon such press release,
public announcement, public statement or other public disclosure in advance
and shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested thereto; _provided_ , that (a) each of the Company, on the
one hand, and Parent and Buyer, on the other hand, may make press releases or
public announcements concerning this Agreement or the Transactions that
consist solely of information previously disclosed in previous press releases
or public announcements made by Parent, Buyer and/or the Company in compliance
with this _Section 7.04_ and (b) each of the Company, on the one hand, and
Parent and Buyer, on the other hand, may make any public statements in

press releases, public disclosures, public statements or other public
disclosures made by Parent, Buyer and/or the Company in compliance with this
_Section 7.04_. The Company, Parent and Buyer agree to issue (or cause to be
issued) the previously agreed upon form of joint press release announcing the

hand, shall give prompt notice to the other Party of (i) any Action commenced
or, to such Party's knowledge, threatened, against the Company or any of its
Affiliates or Parent or any of its Affiliates, that purports to prevent,
materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the Offer, the Asset
Sale, Compulsory Acquisition, the Liquidation, the Second Step Distribution or
any of the other Transactions or that makes allegations that, if true, would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be,
and (ii) (A) in the case of the Company, the knowledge of the Company of any
breach of or inaccuracy in its representations or warranties set forth in this
Agreement or failure to perform its covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement to the extent such inaccuracy, breach or failure to perform would
reasonably be expected to give rise to, individually or in the aggregate, the
failure of any Offer Condition set forth in paragraph (D) or paragraph (E) of
_Annex I_ or (B) in the case of Parent and Buyer, the knowledge of Parent or
Buyer of any breach of, or inaccuracy in, the representations or warranties of
Parent and Buyer set forth in this Agreement or failure to perform the
covenants or agreements of Parent and Buyer set forth in this Agreement to the
extent such inaccuracy, breach or failure to perform would reasonably be
expected to, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially delay or
materially impair the ability of Buyer to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or to consummate the Transactions; _provided_ , that the delivery of
any notice pursuant to this _Section 7.05_ shall not cure any breach of any
representation, warranty, obligation, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement or otherwise limit or affect any remedies available hereunder to the
Party receiving such notice.

  

  

Section 7.06 _Litigation_. Except as otherwise set forth in _Section 7.01_ ,

Buyer, (ii) fully participate in (at Parent's or Buyer's sole expense), but
not control, the defense of such Transaction Litigation, (iii) consult on any
settlement with respect to such Transaction Litigation and (iv) fully
participate in any negotiations or mediation with respect to any settlement
with respect to such Transaction Litigation, and no such settlement shall be

or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, against the Company, members
of the Company Board or any Subsidiary of the Company and shall keep Parent
and Buyer informed on a current basis with respect to the status thereof.

any portion of the Debt Financing, in each case, as may be reasonably
requested by Parent (the financings described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii)
collectively, the " _Financing_ "); _provided_ , that such requested
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the
Company or its Subsidiaries. Such cooperation by the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall include, at the reasonable request of Parent, using their
reasonable best efforts to:

  

  

(i) furnish such financial statements and other financial data and other
information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries and requested by
Parent or its Representatives as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to

recent fiscal year ended at least sixty (60) days prior to the Closing Date
and unaudited financial statements relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries for any quarterly interim period or periods (other than the
fourth fiscal quarter) ended after the date of its most recent audited

(and the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year) and (y) as otherwise
required in connection with the Financing; _provided_ , that the Company's
public filings with the SEC under the 1934 Act of any such financial
statements shall satisfy the requirements of subclause (x) to the extent
containing the information described therein;

  

  

(ii) cause its independent accountants to cooperate with any Financing sources
consistent with such independent accountants' customary practice and obtain
customary accountants' "comfort letters" (including customary "negative
assurances") and customary consents to the inclusion of audit reports in

(iii) provide information related to the Company and its Subsidiaries
reasonably necessary to assist Parent or any of its Affiliates in the

72

of the Financing (subject to advance review of and consultation with respect
to such use); _provided_ , that such logos are used solely in a manner that is
reasonable and customary for such purposes and that is not intended to or
reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective products, services, offerings or intellectual property
rights;

  

  

(v) participate (and cause senior management and representatives, with
appropriate seniority and expertise, to participate) in a reasonable and

and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such
third party to the Company's and its Subsidiaries' disclosure of such
information to Parent, Buyer and its Financing sources), (E) take any action

pursuant to this _Section 7.07(a)_ with respect to any Financing that is not

the Company for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Company,
its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives in connection

shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives, from and against any and all losses suffered or
incurred by any of them in connection with any Financing and any information
utilized in connection therewith (other than material misstatements or
omissions in information provided by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
for use in any such Financing), except to the extent arising out of gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

  

(c) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, deliver all
notices, reasonably cooperate with Parent and take all other actions
reasonably requested by Parent to facilitate the termination at the Closing of
all commitments in respect of the Credit Agreement, the repayment in full on
the Closing Date (or in the case of any letters of credit, cash
collateralization, to the extent that Parent shall not have entered into an
alternative arrangement with the issuing bank) of all obligations in respect
of the indebtedness under the Credit Agreement, and the release on the Closing
Date of any Liens securing all such indebtedness and guarantees in connection
therewith. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall use reasonable best efforts and shall reasonably
cooperate with Parent to obtain and deliver to Parent at least three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date an executed payoff letter with respect
to the Credit Agreement (the " _Payoff Letter_ "), in form and substance
customary for transactions of this type, from the applicable agent on behalf
of the Persons to whom such indebtedness is owed, which Payoff Letter together
with any related release documentation shall, among other things, include the
payoff amount and provide that Liens (and guarantees), if any, granted in
connection with the Credit Agreement relating to the assets, rights and
properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries securing such indebtedness
shall, upon the payment of the amount set forth in the Payoff Letter at or
prior to the Closing, be released and terminated. The obligations of the
Company pursuant to this _Section 7.07(c)_ shall be subject to Parent
providing all funds required to effect all such repayments and cash
collateralization of (or alternative arrangement with respect to) letters of
credit at or prior to the Closing.

  

  

 

74  

  


 

  

(d) At the request of Parent, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, issue at the time requested by Parent (which time may be
prior to the Closing Date) one or more notices to effect the optional
redemption or prepayment of all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount
of the 2022 Notes in accordance with the terms of the Indenture on (or, at the
option of Parent, following) the Closing Date; _provided_ , that to the extent
such notice can be conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing, it will be so
conditioned. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall, or shall cause their
counsel to, on or prior to the Closing Date, furnish legal opinions in
customary form and scope relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries or
required by the Indenture in connection with the matters contemplated by this
_Section 7.07(d)_.

  

  

(e) Each of Parent and Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain the
Financing in an amount sufficient, together with any other sources available
to Parent and Buyer, to provide Buyer funds sufficient to consummate the
Transactions and to pay the related fees and expenses on the Closing Date.
Parent shall give the Company prompt notice upon becoming aware of, or
receiving notice or other communication with respect to, any material breach
of or default under, or any event or circumstance that (with or without
notice, lapse of time or both) could reasonably be expected to give rise to
any material breach of or default under, the Debt Commitment Letter by a party
thereto or any termination, withdrawal or rescission of the Debt Commitment
Letter.

  

  

(f) Parent and Buyer acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of any Financing
is not a condition to the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, if any Debt
Financing has not been obtained, Parent and Buyer shall continue to be
obligated, prior to any valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.01_ , and subject to the fulfillment or waiver of the Offer
Conditions set forth in _Annex I_ , to complete the Offer and consummate the
Transactions.

Liability for damages resulting from such Party's fraud, solely as it relates
to the covenants contained in this Agreement or the representations and

78  

  


 

  

(c) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
8.03_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without these
agreements, the Parties would not have entered into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to

Action that results in an Order in its favor for such payment, the Company
shall pay to Parent its reasonable and documented costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such
Action, together with interest on each such amount at the rate equal to the
prime lending rate prevailing during such period as published in The Wall
Street Journal, Eastern Edition, calculated on a daily basis from the date
such amounts were required to be paid to the date of actual payment. In the
event this Agreement is terminated and Parent is entitled to receive the
Company Termination Compensation pursuant to _Section 8.03(b)_ , the Company
Termination Compensation shall, subject to _Section 9.12_ and except with
respect to claims for fraud solely as it relates to the covenants contained in
this Agreement or the representations and warranties expressly made in
_Article 3,_ and Willful Breach, be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent
and its Affiliates against the Company and its former, current or future
shareholders, directors, officers, Affiliates, agents or other Representatives
for any loss suffered as a result of any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement or the Transactions (for the
avoidance of doubt, other than any rights and claims Parent and Buyer may have
under the Tender and Support Agreements or the amendment to the Contract set
forth on _Section 5.08(a)_ of the Company Letter, to the extent provided
therein, following the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.01(d)(i)_ ). Upon such payment of the Company Termination
Compensation by the Company, neither the Company nor any of its former,
current or future shareholders, directors, officers, Affiliates, agents or
other Representatives shall have any further Liability relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the Transactions, except with respect to fraud solely
as it relates to the representations and warranties expressly made in _Article
3_ and Willful Breach. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company
Termination Compensation on more than one occasion.

written instrument signed by the Party against whom the waiver or extension is

of any right hereunder shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver
of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or
agreement in this Agreement, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
right.

Section 9.09 _Counterparts; Electronic Delivery; Effectiveness_. This
Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be
an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were
upon the same instrument. Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered by fax
or .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or similar attachment to email (any such delivery,
an " _Electronic Delivery_ "), shall be treated in all manner and respects as
an original executed counterpart and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. No party may raise the use of an Electronic Delivery to

was transmitted or communicated through the use of Electronic Delivery, as a
defense to the formation of a Contract, and each Party hereby forever waives
any such defense, except to the extent that such defense relates to lack of
authenticity. This Agreement shall become effective when each Party shall have
received a counterpart of this Agreement signed by each other Party. Until and
unless each Party has received a counterpart of this Agreement signed by each
other Party, this Agreement shall have no effect and no Party shall have any
right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication).

  

  

Section 9.10 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,
including the Annexes and Exhibits hereto, the Company Letter and the
Confidentiality Agreement, and the other documents delivered in connection
with this Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties
with respect to the Transactions. This Agreement is not intended to, and shall
not, confer upon any Person other than the Parties any rights or remedies;
_provided_ , that (a) the provisions of _Section 6.01_ are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each indemnified or insured party
(including the Indemnified Persons), his or her heirs and representatives; (b)
the provisions of _Section 2.04(a)(iv)_ and _Section 2.05(e)_ are intended to
be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Company directors in
office at the time of holding the EGM or Subsequent EGM, as applicable, and
any Independent Director as referred to in _Section 2.05_ and all members of
the Company Board resigning at the Acceptance Time; and (c) the provisions of
the proviso to _Section 9.03(a)_ , _9.08_ , _9.13_ and this _Section 9.10_ are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Debt
Financing Sources.

  

  

Section 9.11 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated, so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is
not affected in any material way. Upon such a determination, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

Section 9.12 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage, for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an
adequate remedy, will occur in the event that the Parties do not perform their
obligations under the provisions of this Agreement in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Subject to the following
sentence, the Parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other
equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the Chosen
Courts without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, (b) the
provisions set forth in _Section 8.03_ (i) are not intended to and do not
adequately compensate for the harm that would result from a breach of this
Agreement and (ii) shall not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in
any respect any Party's right to specific performance and (c) the right of
specific performance is an integral part of the Transactions and without that
right, none of the Parties would have entered into this Agreement. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with
this _Section 9.12_ shall not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with any such Order or injunction.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company agrees that it shall not bring or support any Action (whether based in
contract, tort or otherwise) against the Debt Financing Sources in any way
relating to this Agreement or the Offer, including any dispute arising out of
or relating in any way to any commitment letter, engagement letter or
definitive financing document in connection with the Transactions or the
consummation or performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court
of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable Law,
exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York (and the appellate courts
thereof). The Company further agrees that all of the provisions set forth in
_Section 9.08_ shall apply to any Action referenced in this _Section 9.13(a)_.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company agrees that all Actions (whether based in contract, tort or otherwise)
against the Debt Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or
the Offer, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to any
commitment letter, engagement letter or definitive financing document in
connection with the Transactions, or the performance thereof, shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of New
York; _provided_ , that on or prior to the Closing Date, the definitions of
Company Material Adverse Effect and the representations set forth in this
Agreement shall, for the purposes of any commitment letter, engagement letter
or definitive financing document in connection with the Transactions, be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of laws provision or
rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would
cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware.

  

  

 

84  

  


 

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Representatives or Affiliates
(for the avoidance of doubt, which shall not include Parent and its
Affiliates) shall have any rights or claims against any Debt Financing Source
in connection with or related to this Agreement, the Offer or any commitment
letter, engagement letter or definitive financing document in connection with
the Transactions, or any alternate financing in connection therewith. In
addition, no Debt Financing Source shall have any liability or obligation to
the Company or any of the Company's Affiliates (for the avoidance of doubt,
which shall not include Parent and its Affiliates) or representatives in
connection with or related to this Agreement, the Offer or any commitment
letter, engagement letter or definitive financing document in connection with
the Transactions, including for any consequential, special, exemplary,
punitive or indirect damages (including any loss of profits, business or
anticipated savings) or damages of a tortious nature. Nothing set forth in
this _Section 9.13_ shall modify or alter the rights of Parent or Buyer under
any commitment letter, engagement letter or definitive financing document in
connection with the Transactions or between or among Parent or Buyer or their
respective Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any Debt Financing Source, on
the other hand, entered into in connection with or as contemplated by this
Agreement, and in the event of a conflict between the foregoing and any
commitment letter, engagement letter or any such definitive financing
documentation, as applicable, the provisions of such commitment letter,
engagement letter or definitive financing documentation, as applicable, shall
govern and control.

Offer Conditions

  

  

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement or the Offer and in
addition to (and not in limitation of) Parent's and Buyer's right and
obligation to extend, terminate, amend and/or modify the Offer pursuant to the
provisions of the Agreement, subject to any applicable rules and regulations
of the SEC, neither Parent nor Buyer shall be required to accept for payment
or pay for any Share validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer unless, as of the scheduled Expiration Time:

  

  

A. there shall have been validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the
Offer, and not properly withdrawn, a number of Shares (excluding Shares
tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been
delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee prior to the
Expiration Time) that, together with the Shares then owned by Parent or its
Affiliates, represents at least ninety-five percent (95%) of the Company's
issued and outstanding capital (geplaatst en uitstaand kapitaal) immediately
prior to the Expiration Time (the " _Minimum Condition_ "); _provided_ , that
if, prior to the Expiration Time the Asset Sale Resolutions have been adopted
at the EGM (or any Subsequent EGM), the reference to "ninety-five percent
(95%)" in the foregoing definition of Minimum Condition shall be deemed to be
a reference to "eighty percent (80%)"; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if
all of the Offer Conditions have been satisfied or waived other than the
Minimum Condition, and Buyer has extended the Offer on two (2) occasions in
consecutive periods of ten (10) Business Days each in accordance with _Section
2.01(e)(ii)_ of the Agreement, Buyer may in its sole discretion, by written
notice to the Company, amend the reference to "ninety-five percent (95%)" in
the foregoing definition of Minimum Condition to "seventy-five percent (75%)",
in which case the reference to "ninety-five percent (95%)" in the foregoing
definition of Minimum Condition shall be deemed to be a reference to "seventy-
five percent (75%)";

  

  

B. any waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the
consummation of the Transactions under the HSR Act and the EU Merger
Regulation shall have expired or been terminated and the Other Required
Antitrust Approvals shall have been received and be in full force and effect
or their relevant waiting periods (and any extension thereof) shall have
expired or been terminated;

  

  

C. no applicable Law or Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent),
entered, enacted, promulgated, enforced or issued by any court or other
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction (collectively, the " _Legal
Restraints_ ") shall be in effect that prohibits, renders illegal or enjoins,
the consummation of the Offer, the Asset Sale, the Compulsory Acquisition, the
Liquidation, the Second Step Distribution or the other Transactions;

  

    

  


 

  

D. the representations and warranties of the Company (i) set forth in _Section
3.11(a)_ of the Agreement shall be true and correct in all respects at and as
of the Expiration Time with the same effect as though made at and as of the
Expiration Time, (ii) set forth in _Section 3.05(a)_ of the Agreement shall be
true and correct in all respects (except for de minimis inaccuracies) at and
as of the Expiration Time with the same effect as though made at and as of the
Expiration Time (except to the extent expressly made at and as of an earlier
date, in which case at and as of such earlier date), (iii) set forth in
_Section 3.01_ , _Section 3.02_ , _Section 3.05(b)_ , _Section 3.05(c)_ ,
_Section 3.06_ , _Section 3.22_ and _Section 3.23_ of the Agreement shall be
true and correct in all material respects at and as of the Expiration Time
with the same effect as though made at and as of the Expiration Time (except
to the extent expressly made at and as of an earlier date, in which case at
and as of such earlier date) and (iv) set forth in the Agreement, other than
those Sections specifically identified in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this
paragraph (D), shall be true and correct (disregarding all qualifications or
limitations as to "materiality", "Company Material Adverse Effect" and words
of similar import set forth therein) at and as of the Expiration Time with the
same effect as though made at and as of the Expiration Time (except to the
extent expressly made at and as of an earlier date, in which case at and as of
such earlier date), except, in the case of this _clause (iv)_ , where the
failure to be true and correct would not have or reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect;

  

  

E. the Company shall have performed or complied with, in all material
respects, each of the obligations, agreements and covenants, required to be
performed by, or complied with by, it under the Agreement at or prior to the
Expiration Time;

  

  

F. since the date of the Agreement, there shall not have occurred any Effect
that would have or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect; _provided_ that _clause
(ii)_ of the definition of Company Material Adverse Effect shall be excluded
from such definition for the purposes of determining the satisfaction of this
paragraph (F);

  

  

G. the resignations of the existing members of the Company Board as
contemplated by _Section 2.05(a)_ of the Agreement, shall have been obtained;

  

  

H. the Governance Resolutions shall have been adopted at the EGM;

  

  

I. the Company shall have delivered to Buyer a certificate signed by an
executive officer of the Company, dated as of the Expiration Time, certifying
that the Offer Conditions specified in paragraphs (D), (E) and (F) have been
satisfied; and

  

    

  


 

  

J. the Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

  

  

The foregoing conditions in this _Annex I_ are for the sole benefit of Parent
and Buyer and may be asserted by Parent or Buyer regardless of the
circumstances giving rise to any such conditions and, other than the Minimum
Condition, may be waived, subject to applicable Law, by Parent or Buyer in
whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion,
in each case, subject to the terms of the Agreement. The foregoing conditions
shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the rights and obligations
of Parent or Buyer to extend, terminate, amend and/or modify the Offer in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Agreement and the applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC. The failure by Parent or Buyer at any time
to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any
such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be
asserted at any time and from time to time. In addition, each of the foregoing
conditions is independent of any of the other foregoing conditions; the
exclusion of any event from a particular condition does not mean that such
event may not be included in another condition.

  

  

Capitalized terms used in this _Annex I_ and not defined in this _Annex I_
shall have the meanings set forth in the Purchase Agreement, dated as of May
15, 2017, by and between Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (" _Parent_ "), Thermo
Fisher (CN) Luxembourg S.a r.l. (" _Buyer_ ") and Patheon N.V. (the "
_Company_ ") (the " _Agreement_ ").       '
