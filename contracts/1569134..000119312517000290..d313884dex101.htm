reasonable costs or expenses with respect to Taxes indemnified hereunder. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | The Partnership shall be liable for, and shall indemnify and

amount of any Taxes imposed on or incurred by or with respect to the Target
Group or the Target Entity Assets for a taxable period beginning before and
ending after the Closing Date which is allocable to the period ending on or
prior to the Closing Date, the determination shall be made, in the case of
property or _ad valorem_ taxes or franchise taxes (which are measured by, or
based solely upon capital, debt or a combination of capital and debt), by pro
rating such Taxes ratably on a _per diem_ basis and, in the case of other

responsibility for such Taxes hereunder. The parties shall cooperate in order
to take all necessary and reasonable steps to claim any such refund. 
---|---|--- 

Section 5.2 _Tax Returns_.

 



     | (a) | With respect to any Tax Return attributable to a taxable
period ending on or before the Closing Date that is required to be filed
either before or after the Closing Date with respect to the Target Group or

loss, deduction and credit required to be included therein, cause such Tax
Return to be filed timely with the appropriate Taxing Authority, unless
otherwise required to be filed by the Partnership, and be responsible for the
timely payment (and entitled to any refund) of all Taxes due with respect to
the period covered by such Tax Return. Subject to  _Section 5.2_ __ _(b)_ the
Partnership shall cause all other Tax Returns relating to the Target Entities
or the Target Entity Assets to be prepared and filed.

Tax Return to be prepared, cause to be included in such Tax Return all items
of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit required to be included therein,
furnish a copy of such Tax Return to Operations, and cause such Tax Return to
be filed timely with the appropriate Taxing Authority. The Partnership shall

right to recover from Operations the amount of Taxes attributable to the
portion of the taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date pursuant

Return to be prepared in accordance with past Tax accounting practices used
with respect to the Tax Returns in question (unless such past practices are no
longer permissible under the Applicable Law), and to the extent any items are
not covered by past practices, in accordance with reasonable tax accounting
practices selected by the filing party with respect to such Tax Return under
this Agreement with the consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed)
of the non-filing party. 
---|---|--- 

Section 5.3 _Transfer Taxes_.

 

All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar
Taxes and fees arising out of or in connection with the transactions effected
pursuant to this Agreement (the " _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be borne 50% by
Operations and 50% by the Partnership. The Partnership shall file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to such Transfer
Taxes. If required by Applicable Law, Operations and the Partnership shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax
Returns and other documentation.

 

Section 5.4 _Allocation of Cash Amount_.

 

The Partnership and Operations will use commercially reasonable efforts to
agree upon an allocation of the entire Cash Amount among the Target Entity
Assets in compliance with the principles of Section 1060 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder. If Operations and the Partnership agree to

reporting asset values and other items for purposes of all federal, state, and
local Tax Returns, including without limitation Internal Revenue Service Form
8594, and (b) that neither Operations nor the Partnership or any of their
respective Affiliates will take a position on any Tax Return, or before any
Governmental Authority in connection with the examination of a Tax Return or
in any tax proceeding that is in any manner inconsistent with such
allocation, except as required by Applicable Law or with the written consent
of the other party.

 

Section 5.5 _Additional Tax Matters_.

 

The parties acknowledge that the members of the Target Group and Operations
are disregarded for federal income tax purposes as entities apart from
Development; accordingly, references to Operations or the Target Group in this

The obligations set forth in this _Article V_ shall survive until the date
that is ninety (90) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations (including all periods of

excluding Development, its Affiliates and the Target Group (the "
_Partnership Indemnified Parties_ ") harmless from and against any and all
Damages suffered or incurred by any Partnership Indemnified Party as a result
of or arising out of (i) any breach or inaccuracy of a representation or
warranty of Development or Operations in this Agreement or the Assignment
Agreement, or (ii) any breach of any agreement or covenant on the part of

Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, the Partnership, from
and after the Closing Date, shall indemnify, defend and hold Development, its

_Development Indemnified Parties_ ") harmless from and against any and all
Damages suffered or incurred by the Development Indemnified Parties as a
result of or arising out of (i) any breach or inaccuracy of a representation
or warranty of the Partnership in this Agreement or the Assignment Agreement,
or (ii) any breach of any agreement or covenant on the part of the
Partnership made under this Agreement or the Assignment Agreement or in

warranties of Development and Operations contained in Section __ _ 3.10_,
nothing in this _Article VI_ , other than _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ through
_Section_ __ _ 6.8_, shall apply to liability with respect to Taxes, the
liability with respect to which shall be as set forth in Article _V_.

 



26 Section 6.4 _Survival_.

 

All the provisions of this Agreement shall survive the Closing,
notwithstanding any investigation at any time made by or on behalf of any
party hereto, provided that the representations and warranties set forth in
_Article III_ and _Article IV_ shall terminate and expire on the date that is
fifteen (15) months following the Closing Date, except (a) the

shall or may be sought pursuant to this _Article VI_ on the basis of that
representation and warranty by any Person who would have been entitled
pursuant to this _Article VI_ to indemnification on the basis of that
representation and warranty prior to its termination and expiration, provided
that in the case of each representation and warranty that shall terminate and
expire as provided in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.4_, no claim presented in
writing for indemnification pursuant to this _Article VI_ on the basis of that
representation and warranty prior to its termination and expiration shall be
affected in any way by that termination and expiration. The indemnification

Agreement to be performed after the Closing shall survive the Closing.

 

Section 6.5 _Demands_.



     | (a) | Each indemnified party hereunder agrees that promptly upon
its discovery of facts giving rise to a claim for indemnity under the
provisions of this Agreement, including receipt by it of notice of any demand,
assertion, claim, action or proceeding, judicial or otherwise, by any third
party (such claims for indemnity involving third-party claims being
collectively referred to herein as the " _Third Party Indemnity Claim_ "),
with respect to any matter as to which it claims to be entitled to indemnity
under the provisions of this Agreement, it will give prompt notice thereof in
writing to the indemnifying party, together with a statement of such
information respecting any of the foregoing as it shall have. Such notice
shall include a formal demand for indemnification under this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the indemnified party fails to notify the
indemnifying party thereof in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement in sufficient time to permit the indemnifying party or its counsel
to defend against a Third Party Indemnity Claim and to make a timely  

---|---|--- 
 



27 relating to such Third Party Indemnity Claim shall not be relieved except in
the event and only to the extent that the indemnifying party is prejudiced or
damaged by such failure. 
---|--- 

Section 6.6 _Right to Contest and Defend_.



     | (a) | The indemnifying party shall be entitled, at its cost and
expense, to contest and defend by all appropriate legal proceedings any Third
Party Indemnity Claim for which it is called upon to indemnify the
indemnified party under the provisions of this Agreement; _provided_ , that
notice of the intention to so contest shall be delivered by the indemnifying
party to the indemnified party within thirty (30) days from the date of
receipt by the indemnifying party of notice by the indemnified party of the
assertion of the Third Party Indemnity Claim. Any such contest may be
conducted in the name and on behalf of the indemnifying party or the
indemnified party as may be appropriate. Such contest shall be conducted by
reputable counsel employed by the indemnifying party and not reasonably
objected to by the indemnified party, but the indemnified party shall have the
right but not the obligation to participate in such proceedings and to be
represented by counsel of its own choosing at its sole cost and expense. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | The indemnifying party shall have full authority to
determine all action to be taken with respect thereto; _provided_ , _however_
, that the indemnifying party will not have the authority to subject
the indemnified party to any obligation whatsoever, other than the
performance of purely ministerial tasks or obligations not involving material
expense or injunctive relief. If the indemnifying party does not elect to
contest any such Third Party Indemnity Claim, the indemnifying party shall be
bound by the result obtained with respect thereto by the indemnified party. If
the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third Party Indemnity Claim,
the indemnified party shall agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge
of a Third Party Indemnity Claim that the indemnifying party may recommend and
that by its terms obligates the indemnifying party to pay the full amount of
the liability in connection with such Third Party Indemnity Claim, which
releases the indemnified party completely in connection with such Third Party
Indemnity Claim and which would not otherwise adversely affect the indemnified
party as determined by the indemnified party in its sole discretion.  
---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to
assume the defense of any Third Party Indemnity Claim (and shall be liable
for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel incurred by the indemnified
party in defending such Third Party Indemnity Claim) if the Third Party
Indemnity Claim seeks an order, injunction or other equitable relief or
relief for other than money damages against the indemnified party which the
indemnified party reasonably determines, after conferring with its outside
counsel, cannot be separated from any related claim for money damages. If  

---|---|--- 
 



28 Party Indemnity Claim can be so separated from that for money damages, the
indemnifying party shall be entitled to assume the defense of the portion
relating to money damages. 
---|--- 

Section 6.7 _Cooperation_.

 

If requested by the indemnifying party, the indemnified party agrees to
cooperate with the indemnifying party and its counsel in contesting any Third
Party Indemnity Claim that the indemnifying party elects to contest or, if
appropriate, in making any counterclaim against the person asserting the Third
Party Indemnity Claim, or any cross-complaint against any person, and the
indemnifying party will reimburse the indemnified party for any expenses
incurred by it in so cooperating. At no cost or expense to the indemnified
party, the indemnifying party shall cooperate with the indemnified party and
its counsel in contesting any Third Party Indemnity Claim.

Section 6.8 _Right to Participate_.

 

The indemnified party agrees to afford the indemnifying party and its counsel
the opportunity to be present at, and to participate in, conferences with all
Persons, including Governmental Authorities, asserting any Third Party
Indemnity Claim against the indemnified party or conferences with
representatives of or counsel for such Persons.

 

Section 6.9 _Payment of Damages_.

 

The indemnification required hereunder shall be made by periodic payments of
the amount of Damages in connection therewith within ten (10) days as and
when reasonably specific bills are received by, or Damages are incurred and
reasonable evidence thereof is delivered to, the indemnifying party. In
calculating any amount to be paid by an indemnifying party by reason of
the provisions of this Agreement, the amount shall be reduced by all
insurance proceeds and any indemnification reimbursement proceeds received
from third parties credited to or received by the indemnified party related to
the Damages.

 

Section 6.10 _Direct Claim_.

 

Any claim by an indemnified party with respect to any Damages which do not
result from a Third Party Indemnity Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") will be
asserted by giving the indemnifying party reasonably prompt written notice
thereof, stating the nature of such claim in reasonable detail and indicating
the estimated amount, if practicable. The indemnifying party will have a
period of ninety (90) days from receipt of such Direct Claim within which to
respond to such Direct Claim. If the indemnifying party does not respond
within such ninety (90) day period, the indemnifying party will be deemed to
have accepted such Direct Claim. If the indemnifying party rejects such
Direct Claim, the indemnified party will be free to seek enforcement of its
rights to indemnification under this Agreement.

 



29 Section 6.11 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 



     | (a) | To the extent that the Partnership Indemnified Parties would
otherwise be entitled to indemnification for Damages pursuant to ___Section
6.1(i)_ , Development and Operations shall be liable only if (i) the Damages
with respect to any individual claim exceed $25,000 (the " _Minimum Claim
Amount_ ") and (ii) the Damages for all claims that exceed the Minimum Claim
Amount exceed, in the aggregate, $1,400,000 (the " _Deductible Amount_ "),
and then Development and Operations shall be liable only for Damages to the
extent of any excess over the Deductible Amount. In no event shall
Developments and Operations aggregate liability to the
Partnership Indemnified Parties under ___Section 6.1_ exceed $14,000,000 (the
" _Ceiling Amount_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Deductible Amount
and the Ceiling Amount shall not apply to breaches or inaccuracies
of representations and warranties contained in _Section_ __ _ 3.1_,
_Section_ __ _ 3.2_, _Section_ __ _ 3.4_, and _Section_ __ _ 3.18_. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | Additionally, neither the Partnership, on the one hand, nor
Development and Operations, on the other hand, will be liable as an indemnitor
under this Agreement for any consequential, incidental, special, indirect
or exemplary damages suffered or incurred by the indemnified party or parties
except to the extent resulting pursuant to Third Party Indemnity Claims. 
---|---|--- 
 

Section 6.12 _Sole Remedy_.

 

No party shall have liability under this Agreement, the Assignment Agreement

2. _No Setoff or Deductions_. All payments by the Guarantor hereunder shall be paid in full, without setoff or counterclaim or any deduction or withholding whatsoever, including, without limitation, for any and all present and future taxes. 

 

3. _No Termination_. This Guaranty is a continuing and irrevocable guaranty of all Guaranteed Obligations now or hereafter existing and shall remain in full force and effect until all Guaranteed Obligations and any other amounts payable under this Guaranty are indefeasibly paid and performed in full and the Guaranteed Obligations are terminated. 

 

4. _Waiver of Notices_. The Guarantor waives notice of the acceptance of this Guaranty and of the extension or continuation of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof. The Guarantor further waives presentment, protest, notice, dishonor or default, demand for payment and any other notices to which the Guarantor might otherwise be entitled. 

 

5. _Subrogation_. The Guarantor shall exercise no right of subrogation, contribution or similar rights with respect to any payments it makes under this Guaranty until all of the Guaranteed Obligations and any amounts payable under this Guaranty are indefeasibly paid and performed in full and any commitments of Owner or facilities provided by Owner with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations are terminated. If any amounts are paid to the Guarantor in violation of the foregoing limitation, then such amounts shall be held in trust for the benefit of Owner and shall forthwith be paid to Owner to reduce the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured. 6. _Waiver of Suretyship Defenses_. The Guarantor agrees that Owner may, at any time and from time to time, and without notice to the Guarantor, make any agreement with Operator or with any other person or entity liable on any of the Guaranteed Obligations or providing collateral as security for the Guaranteed Obligations, for the extension, renewal, payment, compromise, discharge or release of the Guaranteed Obligations or any collateral (in whole or in part), or for any modification or amendment of the terms thereof or of any instrument or agreement evidencing the Guaranteed Obligations or the provision of collateral, all without in any way impairing, releasing, discharging or otherwise affecting the obligations of the Guarantor under this Guaranty. The Guarantor waives any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of the Operator or any other guarantor, or the cessation from any cause whatsoever of the liability of the Operator, or any claim that the Guarantors obligations exceed or are more burdensome than those of the Operator and waives the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting the liability of the guarantor hereunder. The Guarantor waives any right to enforce any remedy which Owner now has or may hereafter have against the Operator and waives any benefit of and any right to participate in any security now or hereafter held by Owner. Further, the Guarantor consents to the taking of, or failure to take, any action which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risks of the Guarantor under this Guaranty or which, but for this provision, might operate as a discharge of the Guarantor. 

 

7. _Exhaustion of Other Remedies Not Required_. The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder are those of primary obligor, and not merely as surety, and are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations. The Guarantor waives diligence by Owner and action on delinquency in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof, including, without limitation any provisions of law requiring Owner to exhaust any right or remedy or to take any action against the Operator, any other guarantor or any other person, entity or property before enforcing this Guaranty against the Guarantor. 

 

8. _Reinstatement_. Notwithstanding anything in this Guaranty to the contrary, this Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations is revoked, terminated, rescinded or reduced or must otherwise be restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Operator or any other person or entity or otherwise, as if such payment had not been made and whether or not Owner is in possession of or has released this Guaranty and regardless of any prior revocation, rescission, termination or reduction. 

9. _Stay of Acceleration_. In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is stayed, upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Operator or any other person or entity, or otherwise, all such amounts shall nonetheless be payable by the Guarantor immediately upon demand by Owner. 

10. _Expenses_. The Guarantor shall pay on demand all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses and the allocated cost and disbursements of internal legal counsel) in any way relating to the enforcement or protection of Owners rights under this Guaranty, including any incurred in the preservation, protection or enforcement of any rights of Owner in any case commenced by or against the Guarantor under the Bankruptcy Code (Title 11, United States Code) or any similar or successor statute. The obligations of the Guarantor under the preceding sentence shall survive termination of this Guaranty.

12. _Amendments_. No provision of this Guaranty may be waived, amended, supplemented or modified, except by a written instrument executed by Owner and the Guarantor. 

13. _No Waiver; Enforceability_. No failure by Owner to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy or power hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law or in equity. The unenforceability or, invalidity of any provision of this Guaranty shall not affect the enforceability or validity of any other provision herein.

15. _Condition of the Operator_.
