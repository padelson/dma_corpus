Notwithstanding the foregoing proviso, to the extent a Change (by itself or
when aggregated or taken together with any and all other Changes) both (A)
results from, arises out of, or is attributable to the matters described in

Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other companies

ARTICLE II 
THE OFFER 

  

    2.1 _ The Offer. _ 

  

  

 (a) _ Commencement of the Offer._ As promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within seven (7) Business Days) after the date of this Agreement, Acquisition Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock at a price per share equal to the Offer Price (as adjusted as provided in _Section 2.1(c)_, if applicable). 

  

 (b) _ Terms and Conditions of the Offer._ The obligations of Acquisition Sub to, and of Parent to cause Acquisition Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject to the conditions set forth in _Annex A_ (the "Offer Conditions"). The Offer Conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Acquisition Sub, and Parent and Acquisition Sub may waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition at any time and from time to time, in their sole discretion, other than the Minimum Tender Condition, which may be waived by Parent and Acquisition Sub only with the prior written consent of the Company, and may be asserted by Parent or Acquisition Sub regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such conditions other than as a result of a breach by Parent or Acquisition Sub. Parent and Acquisition Sub expressly reserve the right to increase the Offer Price or to waive or make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless otherwise provided in this Agreement or previously approved by the Company in writing, Acquisition Sub shall not, and Parent shall not permit Acquisition Sub to, (i) reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock sought to be purchased in the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price, (iii) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (iv) amend, modify or waive the Minimum Tender Condition, (v) add to the Offer Conditions or amend, modify or supplement any Offer Condition in a manner adverse to any holder of Company Common Stock, (vi) terminate the Offer, or extend or otherwise amend or modify the expiration date of the Offer, in any manner 

  

      

  

other than in compliance with the terms of this Agreement or (vii) except as
provided in _Section 2.1(d)_, provide any "subsequent offering period"
within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  

 (c) _ Adjustments to Offer Price._ The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to Acquisition Sub\'s acceptance for payment of, and payment for, Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer, and such adjustment to the Offer Price shall provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action. 

  

 (d) _ Expiration and Extension of the Offer._ Unless extended as provided in this Agreement, the Offer shall expire on the date (the "Initial Expiration Date") that is no sooner than twenty (20) Business Days (calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act) after the commencement of the Offer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, on the Initial Expiration Date or any subsequent date as of which the Offer is scheduled to expire, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived (to the extent waivable in accordance with the terms hereof), subject to Parent\'s and the Company\'s right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_, then Acquisition Sub shall extend (and re-extend) the Offer and its expiration date beyond the Initial Expiration Date for one or more periods, in consecutive increments of up to ten (10) Business Days each, ending no later than the Outside Date (the length of each such period to be determined by Parent in its sole discretion subject to the foregoing conditions), to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Acquisition Sub shall, without the consent of the Company, extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff or any rule or regulation of the Nasdaq, in each case, applicable to the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Acquisition Sub elects to increase the Offer Price it shall be required to extend the Initial Expiration Date or such other subsequent date as of which the Offer is scheduled to expire for the minimum period required under the Securities Laws. If necessary to obtain sufficient shares of Company Common Stock (without regard to shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Top-Up or shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee) to reach the Short-From Threshold, Acquisition Sub may, in its sole discretion, provide for a "subsequent offering period" (and one or more extensions thereof) in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act of up to ten (10) Business Days. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Offer, Acquisition Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to) immediately accept for payment, and pay for, all shares of Company Common Stock that are validly tendered pursuant to the Offer during such "subsequent offering period". 

  

 (e) _ Payment._ On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Acquisition Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly after the applicable expiration date of the Offer (as it may be extended in accordance with _Section 2.1(d)_) and in any event in compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act. The last payment for shares of Company Common Stock accepted for payment pursuant to and subject to the conditions of the Offer, including pursuant to any subsequent offering period, is referred to in this Agreement as the "Offer Closing", and the date on which the Offer Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Offer Closing Date". 

  

 (f) _ Termination of Offer._ The Offer may not be terminated prior to the Initial Expiration Date, or any subsequent date as of which the Offer is scheduled to expire, unless this Agreement 

  

      

  

is validly terminated in accordance with _Section 10.1_. If this Agreement
is validly terminated pursuant to _Section 10.1_, Acquisition Sub shall,
and Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to, (i) promptly (and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours of such termination) terminate the Offer and in
any event shall not acquire any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant
thereto and (ii) promptly return, and shall cause any depositary acting on
behalf of Acquisition Sub to return, in accordance with applicable Law, all
tendered shares of Company Common Stock to the registered holders thereof.

  

 (g) _ Offer Documents._ On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, and including all exhibits thereto, the "Schedule TO"), which shall include, as exhibits, an offer to purchase and a related letter of transmittal, a summary advertisement and other ancillary Offer documents pursuant to which the Offer will be made (such Schedule TO and the documents attached as exhibits thereto, together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the "Offer Documents") and promptly thereafter shall cause the proper dissemination of the Offer Documents to the holders of the Company Common Stock as required by applicable Law. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Acquisition Sub all information concerning the Company that may be required by applicable securities Laws or reasonably requested by Parent or Acquisition Sub for inclusion in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect and provide additional information for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such Party determines that failure to include such information would cause the Offer Documents to omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and the Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall promptly notify the Company upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC or any request from the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Offer Documents, and shall provide the Company with copies of all correspondence between Parent, Acquisition Sub and their respective Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents, and Parent and Acquisition Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in the formulation of any written response to any such written comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC. Prior to the filing of the Offer Documents (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the dissemination thereof to the holders of Company Common Stock, or responding to any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect thereto, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose comments on such document or response.

this Agreement, shall contain the Company Board Recommendation, and promptly
thereafter shall mail the Schedule 14D-9 to the holders of the Company Common
Stock. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company
in writing all information concerning Parent and Acquisition Sub that may be
required by applicable securities laws or reasonably requested by the Company
for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the
Company shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect and provide additional information
for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such
Party determines that failure to include such information would cause the
Offer Documents to omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein. The Company shall take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule
14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and the Schedule 14D-9, as so
corrected, to be disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock, in each
case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. The
Company shall promptly notify Parent and Acquisition Sub upon the receipt of
any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC or any request from the SEC
or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Schedule 14D-9,
and shall provide Parent and Acquisition Sub with copies of all
correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand,
and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand. The Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to
any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect to the Schedule
14D-9, and the Company shall provide Parent and Acquisition Sub and their
respective counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in the formulation
of any written response to any such written comments of the SEC or the staff
of the SEC. Prior to the filing of the Schedule 14D-9 (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or the dissemination thereof to the holders of Company
Common Stock, or responding to any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC
with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent and Acquisition Sub
and their respective counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose
comments on such document or response. The Company hereby consents to the
inclusion in the Offer Documents of a description of the Company Board
Recommendation.

   

 (b) _ Stockholder Lists._ In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the Company shall cause its transfer agent to furnish Acquisition Sub promptly with mailing labels containing the names and addresses of the record holders of Company Common Stock as of the most recent practicable date, together with copies of all lists of stockholders, security position listings, computer files and all other information in the Company\'s possession or control regarding the beneficial owners of Company Common Stock, and shall furnish to Acquisition Sub such information (including updated lists of stockholders, security position listings and computer files) and assistance as Parent or Acquisition Sub may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of the Company Common Stock. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall not use or disclose the information contained in any such labels, lists, listings and files other than in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request, deliver to the Company or destroy all copies of such information then in their possession or control in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. 

  

      

                                    

   

  

 (c) _ Directors._ 

    

 (i) As of the Acceptance Date, and at all times thereafter, Parent shall be entitled to elect or designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board as is equal to the product of the total number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to the directors elected or designated by Parent pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent, Acquisition Sub and their Affiliates bears to the total number of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding. After the Acceptance Date, the Company shall, upon Parent\'s reasonable request, take all actions as are reasonably necessary or desirable to enable Parent\'s designees to be so elected or designated to the Company Board, including promptly filling vacancies or newly created directorships on the Company Board, promptly increasing the size of the Company Board (including amending the Company By-Laws if necessary to increase the size of the Company Board) and/or promptly securing the resignations of such number of its incumbent directors as is necessary to effect the foregoing agreement, and shall cause the Parent\'s designees to be so elected or designated at such time. After the Acceptance Date, the Company shall also, upon Parent\'s request, cause the directors elected or designated be Parent to the Company Board to serve on and constitute the same percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the Company Board of (i) each committee of the Company Board, (ii) each board of directors (or similar body) of each of the Company\'s Subsidiaries and (iii) each committee (or similar body) of each such board, in each case to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the Nasdaq. After the Acceptance Date, the Company shall also, upon Parent\'s request, take all action necessary to elect to be treated as a "controlled company" as defined by Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4350(c) and make all necessary filings and disclosures associated with such status, The provisions of this _Section 2.2(c)_ are in addition to and shall not limit any rights that Parent, Acquisition Sub or any of their respective Affiliates may have as a record holder or beneficial owner of shares of Company Common Stock as a matter of applicable Law with respect to the election of directors or otherwise. 

  

 (ii) The Company\'s obligations to appoint Parent\'s designees to the Company Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under this _Section 2.2(c)_, including mailing to stockholders (together with Schedule 14D-9) any information required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 to enable Parent\'s designees to be elected or designated to the Company Board at the time or times contemplated by this _Section 2.2(c)_. Parent shall supply or cause to be supplied to the Company any information with respect to Parent, Acquisition Sub, their respective officers, directors and Affiliates and the proposed designees to the Company Board as shall be required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. 

  

 (iii) After Parent\'s designees are elected or designated to, and constitute a majority of, the Company Board pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)(i)_, and prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Company Board to maintain at least three (3) directors who are members of the Company Board on the date hereof, each of whom shall be an "independent director" as defined by Rule 4200(a)(15) of the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules and eligible to serve on the Company\'s audit committee under the Exchange Act and Nasdaq rules and at least one of whom shall be an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item 401(h) of Regulation S-K and the instructions thereto (the "Continuing Directors"); _provided_ , _however_ , that if any Continuing Director is unable to serve due to death, disability or resignation, the Company shall take all necessary action (including creating a committee of the Company Board) so that the remaining Continuing Director or Continuing Directors shall be entitled to 

   

      

   

elect or designate another Person who satisfies the foregoing independence
requirements to fill such vacancy, and such Person shall be deemed to be a
Continuing Director for purposes of this Agreement. After Parent\'s designees
are elected or designated to, and constitute a majority of, the Company Board
pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)(i)_, and prior to the Effective Time, in
addition to any approvals of the Company Board or the Company Stockholders as
may be required by the Company Certificate of Incorporation, the Company By-
Laws or applicable Law, any (i) amendment or modification of this Agreement
which materially effects the holder of the Common Stock, (ii) termination of
this Agreement by the Company, (iii) extension of time for performance of any
obligations of Parent or Acquisition Sub hereunder, (iv) waiver of any
condition to the Company\'s obligations hereunder, (v) exercise or waiver of
the Company\'s rights or remedies hereunder, (vi) amendments to the Company
Certificate of Incorporation or the Company By-Laws, (vii) authorization of
any agreement between the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and Parent, Acquisition Sub or any of their Affiliates, on the other
hand, or (viii) taking of any other action by the Company in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may, in each case, be
effected only if there are in office one (1) or more Continuing Directors and
such action has been approved by a majority of the Continuing Directors then
in office; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall designate, prior
to the Acceptance Date, two (2) alternative Continuing Directors that the
Company Board shall appoint in the event of the death, disability or
resignation of the Continuing Directors, each of whom shall, following such
appointment to the Company Board, be deemed to be a Continuing Director
for purposes of this Agreement. The Continuing Directors shall have, and
Parent shall cause the Continuing Directors to have, the authority to retain
such counsel (which may include current counsel to the Company or the Company
Board) and other advisors at the expense of the Company as determined by the
Continuing Directors, and the authority to institute any action on behalf of
the Company to enforce performance of this Agreement.

   

  

    
 2.3 _ Top-Up. _ 

  

  

 (a) _ Top-Up._ The Company hereby grants to Acquisition Sub an irrevocable right (the "Top-Up"), exercisable only on the terms and conditions set forth in this _Section 2.3_, and only for so long as this Agreement has not been terminated pursuant to _Section 10.1_, to purchase at a price per share equal to the Offer Price that number of newly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Company Common Stock (the "Top-Up Shares") that, when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries at the time of the Top-Up Closing (after giving effect to the Offer Closing), shall constitute 90% of the shares of the Company Common Stock outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Shares; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Top-Up may not be exercised (i) to purchase an amount of Top-Up Shares in excess of the number of shares of Company Common Stock authorized and unissued (treating shares owned by the Company as treasury stock as unissued) and not otherwise reserved or committed for issuance at the time of exercise of the Top-Up, (ii) unless the Offer Closing shall have occurred and (iii) unless, immediately after such exercise, Parent and its Subsidiaries would own 90% of the Company Common Stock then outstanding. The Top-Up shall be exercisable only once and must be exercised in whole, not in part. 

  

 (b) _ Exercise of Top-Up; Top-Up Closing._ Subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 2.3(a)_ and the satisfaction of the conditions to the Merger, including _Section 9.1(b)_, if there shall not have been validly tendered in the Offer and not validly withdrawn that number of shares of Company Common Stock which, when added to the shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries, would represent at least 90% of the shares of the Company Common Stock outstanding on the Offer Closing Date (the "Short-Form Threshold"), Acquisition Sub shall be deemed to have exercised the Top-Up for such number of Top-Up Shares as is necessary for 

  

      

  

Acquisition Sub to reach the Short-Form Threshold and on such date shall give
the Company prior written notice specifying the number of shares of Company
Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries at
the time of such notice (giving effect to the Offer Closing). The Company
shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice (and in
any event no later than the Offer Closing Date), deliver written notice to
Acquisition Sub specifying, based on the information provided by Acquisition
Sub in its notice, the number of Top-Up Shares to be purchased. At the
closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares (the "Top-Up Closing"), which
shall take place at the location of the Merger Closing specified in _Section
3.2_ and shall take place simultaneously with, or as soon as reasonably
practicable after, the Offer Closing, the purchase price owed by Acquisition
Sub to the Company to purchase the Top-Up Shares shall be paid to the Company,
at Acquisition Sub\'s option, (i) in cash, by wire transfer of same-day
funds, or (ii) by (x) paying in cash, by wire transfer of same-day funds, an
amount equal to not less than the aggregate par value of the Top-Up Shares
and (y) executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note having a
principal amount equal to the aggregate purchase price pursuant to the Top-Up
less the amount paid in cash pursuant to the preceding _clause (x)_ (the
"Promissory Note"). The Promissory Note (i) shall be unsecured, non-
transferable and due on the first anniversary of the Top-Up Closing, (ii)
shall bear simple interest of 5% per annum (payable on maturity), (iii) shall
be full recourse to Parent and Acquisition Sub, (iv) may be prepaid, in whole
or in part, at any time without premium or penalty, and (v) shall have no
other material terms. At the Top-Up Closing, the Company shall cause a
Certificate representing the Top-Up Shares to be issued and delivered to
Acquisition Sub, which Certificate shall include any legends that are required
under applicable Law.

  

 (c) _ Exemption from Registration._ Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Shares that Acquisition Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up will not be registered under the Securities Act, and will be issued in reliance upon an applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub hereby represents and warrants to the Company that Acquisition Sub will be, upon the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, an "accredited investor", as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Acquisition Sub agrees that the Top-Up is being, and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up will be, acquired by Acquisition Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act). 

  

 (d) _ No Effect on Appraisal Rights._ The Parties agree that any impact on the value of the shares of Company Common Stock as a result of the issuance of the Top-Up Shares will not be taken into account in any determination of the fair value of any Appraisal Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL as contemplated by _Section 3.7(c)_, and that none of the Parties shall take any position to the contrary in any appraisal proceeding. 

  

  

    
 2.4 _ Notices of Guaranteed Delivery. _ For purposes of this Agreement, including the exercise of the Top-Up, and the Offer, unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the Company and Parent, any shares of Company Common Stock subject to notices of guaranteed delivery shall be deemed not to be validly tendered into the Offer unless and until the shares of Company Common Stock underlying such notices of guaranteed delivery are delivered to or on behalf of Acquisition Sub.

    3.1 _ The Merger. _ Upon the terms and subject to the

Effective Time,

        

the separate corporate existence of Acquisition Sub shall cease, and the

 3.2 _ The Closing. _ The closing of the Merger (the "Merger Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m. local time on the date of, or as soon as reasonably practicable (but in no event later than the second Business Day) following, the Offer Closing (or the Top-Up Closing if the Top-Up has been exercised), provided that the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE IX_ have been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by Law) waived (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Merger Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions) at such time, at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, located at 4 Times Square, New York, NY 10036, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. The date on which the Merger Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Merger Closing Date". 

  

    
 3.3 _ The Effective Time. _ Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as promptly as reasonably practicable on the Merger Closing Date, the Parties shall file a certificate of ownership and merger or a certificate of merger (in either case, the "Certificate of Merger") in such form as is required by, and executed and acknowledged in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and shall make all other filings and recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective on such date and time as the Certificate of Merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such other date and time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger. The date and time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement as the "Effective Time". 

  

    
 3.4 _ Effect of the Merger. _ The Merger shall have the effects set forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Acquisition Sub, and all of the claims, obligations, liabilities, debts and duties of the Company and Acquisition Sub shall become the claims, obligations, liabilities, debts and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

    
 3.5 _ Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws. _ 

  

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, the Company Certificate of Incorporation as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended so as to read in its entirety as set forth in Exhibit A attached hereto and, as so amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law, subject to _Section 7.1_. 

  

 (b) The Parties shall take all necessary action such that, at the Effective Time, the Company By-Laws as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended so as to read in their entirety as set forth in Exhibit B attached hereto and, as so amended, shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law, subject to _Section 7.1_. 

  

  

    
 3.6 _ Directors and Officers. _ 

  

  

 (a) _ Directors._ The Parties shall take all necessary action such that the directors of Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. 

  

 (b) _ Officers._ The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. 

  

       

    
 3.7 _ Effect on Capital Stock. _ 

  

  

 (a) _ Capital Stock._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company, or the holders of any of the following securities, the following shall occur: 

    

 (i) _Capital Stock of Acquisition Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Acquisition Sub that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.00025 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. Each certificate evidencing ownership of such shares of common stock of Acquisition Sub shall thereafter evidence ownership of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (ii) _Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (A) shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company, or by any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company, in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (B) except as provided in _Section 3.7(c)_, the Appraisal Shares) shall be automatically converted, subject to _Section 3.7(b)_, into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any dividends declared from and after the date hereof with a record date prior to the Effective Time that remain unpaid at the Effective Time and that are due to such holder. 

  

 (iii) _Owned Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company or by any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company, in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor. 

    

 (b) _ Adjustment to the Merger Consideration._ Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement but without duplication of the provisions of _Section 2.1(c)_, if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, there shall be any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.7(a)(ii)_ shall be equitably adjusted to reflect the effect thereof, and such adjustment to the Merger Consideration shall provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action. 

  

 (c) _ Appraisal Rights._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Appraisal Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.7(a)(ii)_, but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. At the Effective Time, the Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and 

  

      

  

shall cease to exist, and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of
such Appraisal Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect
or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal
under Section 262 of the DGCL or a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that such holder is not entitled to the right of appraisal provided
by Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair
value of such holder\'s Appraisal Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL shall
cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the
Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section 3.7(a)(ii)_, without any interest
thereon. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands for
appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands
and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received by the
Company, and Parent shall have the right to direct all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), voluntarily make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or
agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing.

  

 (d) _ Company Restricted Stock._ Each holder of an outstanding award of Company Restricted Stock shall have the right to tender such Company Restricted Stock into the Offer. Effective upon the first acceptance for payment by Acquisition Sub of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer (the "Acceptance Time"), each share of Company Restricted Stock shall become fully vested, and the restrictions thereon shall lapse. The Company shall take all actions necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this _Section 3.7(d)_ under the Company Stock Plans and any other plan or arrangement of the Company, including delivering all notices and making any determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a committee thereof. 

  

 (e) _ Company Options._ Neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall assume any Company Stock Options in connection with the Offer, Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. At the Acceptance Time, each outstanding, unexpired and unexercised Company Stock Option shall vest and become exercisable. To the extent not exercised prior to the Effective Time, then upon the Effective Time each Company Stock Option shall be deemed to be exercised and canceled, with each former holder of any such cancelled Company Stock Option becoming entitled to receive from the Company, at the Effective Time or as soon as practicable thereafter, in consideration of the deemed exercise and cancellation of such Company Stock Option, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option; _provided_ that if the exercise price per share of any such Company Option is equal to or greater than the per share Merger Consideration, such Company Option shall be canceled and terminated without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. The Company shall take all actions necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this _Section 3.7(e)_ under all Company Stock Option agreements and any other plan or arrangement of the Company, including delivering all required notices and making any determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a committee thereof. 

  

  

    
 3.8 _ Exchange of Certificates. _ 

  

  

 (a) _ Payment Agent._ Prior to the Merger Closing Date, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the "Paying Agent") for the payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this _ARTICLE III_ and, in connection therewith, shall enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent in the form reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Paying Agency Agreement"). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger 

  

      

  

Consideration as required to be paid pursuant to this Agreement (such cash
being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). If any holder
of Appraisal Shares shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw
or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, or a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to
the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then Parent shall deposit with
the Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration as required to be paid pursuant to this Agreement with
respect to such Appraisal Shares, and the Exchange Fund shall be deemed to
include the cash so deposited.

  

 (b) _ Certificate Exchange Procedures._ As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and which shall otherwise be in customary form (including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an "agent\'s message" with respect to shares held in book-entry form)), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of record of a Certificate shall, upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash which the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to _Section 3.7(a)(ii)_, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration and any dividends declared with a record date prior to the Effective Time that remain unpaid at the Effective Time with respect to such Company Common Stock may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other similar taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration and any such dividends to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.8(b)_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration which the holder thereof has the right to receive in respect of such Certificate pursuant to this _ARTICLE III_ and any dividends declared with a record date prior to the Effective Time that remain unpaid at the Effective Time and that are due to such holder. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this _ARTICLE III_. 

  

 (c) _ No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ All cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this _ARTICLE III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, it shall be canceled against delivery of cash to the holder thereof as provided in this _ARTICLE III_. 

  

 (d) _ Termination of the Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates who have not 

  

      

  

theretofore complied with this _ARTICLE III_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent for, and Parent shall remain liable for, payment of their claims for
the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this _ARTICLE III_ and
any dividends declared with a record date prior to the Effective Time
that remain unpaid at the Effective Time and that are due to any such holder.

  

 (e) _ No Liability._ None of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official in compliance with any applicable state, federal or other abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on which the related Merger Consideration would, pursuant to applicable Law, escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to such time, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (f) _ Investment of Exchange Fund._ The Paying Agent shall invest the cash in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody\'s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker\'s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $5.0 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available). Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid solely to Parent, and any Taxes resulting therefrom shall be paid by Parent. Nothing contained herein and no investment losses resulting from investment of the Exchange Fund shall diminish the rights of any holder of Certificates to receive the Merger Consideration as provided herein. To the extent that there are any losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Payment Agent to promptly pay the Merger Consideration to all holders of Certificates, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Payment Agent to make such payments. 

  

 (g) _ Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration and any dividends declared with a record date prior to the Effective Time that remain unpaid at the Effective Time with respect thereto. 

  

 (h) _ Withholding Rights._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Offer Price, Merger Consideration, Equity Award Amount and any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or any holder of a Company Stock Option or Company Restricted Stock (together, the "Company Equity Awards"), as applicable, such amounts as Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of applicable tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock or the holder of the Company Equity Award, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent. 

  

      

                                    

    

    
 3.9 _ Necessary Further Actions. _ If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Acquisition Sub, the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company and Acquisition Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances, and to do, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or Acquisition Sub, all such other acts and things as may be necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

 (iii) if requested by Parent, the Company shall have made its Representatives available during the period beginning at 5:00 p.m. Central Time on the day of delivery by the Company to Parent of such Recommendation Change Notice and ending four (4) Business Days later at 5:00 p.m. Central Time (the "Recommendation Change Notice Period") to discuss with Parent\'s Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement intended by Parent to cause such Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal or to eliminate the need for the Company Board to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change as a result of an Intervening Event, as applicable; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in the event that (x) after delivery of a Recommendation Change Notice in connection with a Superior Proposal, there has been a material change or revision to the terms of such Superior Proposal or (y) after delivery of a Recommendation Change Notice in connection with an Intervening Event, there has been a material change in the facts, events or 

   

      

   

circumstances relating to such Intervening Event, then, in either case, the
Company shall notify Parent of such material change or revision within 24
hours following such change or revision, and in connection with such change
or revision the then-current Recommendation Change Notice Period shall be
extended such that at least two (2) Business Days remain in
such Recommendation Change Notice Period subsequent to the time the Company
so notifies Parent of such material change or revision;

  

 (iv) Parent shall have notified the Company that it has elected not to negotiate with the Company with respect to modification to the terms and conditions of this Agreement or the Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with financial advisor and outside legal counsel), after considering the terms of any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by Parent, that the failure to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change would still be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. 

    

 (d) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and/or (ii) making any disclosure to the Company Stockholders if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law; _provided_ that any Company Board Recommendation Change will be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section 6.4 _shall be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or create a material risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Any access to the Company\'s properties shall be subject to the Company\'s reasonable security measures and insurance requirements and shall not include the right to perform invasive testing. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information obtained by Parent or any of its financial advisors, business consultants, legal counsel, accountants and other agents and representatives in connection with any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section 6.4_.

ARTICLE VII 
COVENANTS OF PARENT AND ACQUISITION SUB 

   

    7.1 _ Directors\' and Officers\' Indemnification and
Insurance. _ 

  

  

 (a) The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under (i) any indemnification, expense advancement and exculpation provision set forth in any certificate of incorporation or by-laws or comparable organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement and (ii) all indemnification agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or former directors and officers and any person who becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Persons"). 

  

 (b) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Persons to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including advances for reasonable fees and expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, provided the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification), judgments, fines and, subject to approval by Parent (which shall not be 

  

      

  

unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any threatened or actual Action to which such Indemnified
Person is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on,
or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that such
individual is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person or (ii) this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether asserted or
arising before or after the Effective Time.

  

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, in cooperation with Parent, and, if the Company is unable to, Parent shall (or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) obtain and fully pay for "tail" prepaid insurance policies with a claims period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better rating as the Company\'s current insurance carrier with respect to directors\' and officers\' liability insurance and fiduciary insurance (collectively, "DandO Insurance"), for the Indemnified Persons, with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at least as favorable, in the aggregate, as the Company\'s existing DandO Insurance with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time (including with respect to acts or omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby). If such "tail" prepaid insurance policies have been obtained, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time to maintain such policies in full force and effect, for their full term, and to continue to honor its respective obligations thereunder. If the Company fails to obtain such "tail" prepaid insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect, at no expense to the beneficiaries, for a period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time for the Indemnified Persons, the DandO Insurance (provided that Parent (or any successor) may substitute therefor policies of at least the same terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage and amounts which are, in the aggregate, as favorable to the Indemnified Persons as provided in the existing policies as of the date of this Agreement, from an insurance carrier with the same or better rating as the Company\'s current insurance carrier); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event will Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required, and the Company shall not be permitted, to expend for such policies pursuant to this _Section 7.1_ an annualized premium amount in excess of 200% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance and, if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall, and the Company may, obtain a substantially similar policy (from an insurance carrier with the same or better rating as the Company\'s current insurance carrier) with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount. Each Indemnified Person is, and the Indemnified Persons collectively are, intended third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.1_, and each such Person shall have a right to enforce the rights hereunder as if such person was a party to this Agreement. 

   

 (d) Any Indemnified Person wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (b) of this _Section 7.1_, upon learning of any such Legal Proceeding, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Person, except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the indemnifying party. In the event of any such Legal Proceeding arising after the Effective Time, (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Persons (which acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to such Indemnified Persons for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if Parent or the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Persons advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between Parent or the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Persons, or between the Indemnified 

  

      

  

Persons, the Indemnified Persons may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses
of such counsel for the Indemnified Persons promptly as statements therefor
are received; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph (d) to
pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Persons in any
jurisdiction unless the use of one counsel for such Indemnified Persons would
present such counsel with a conflict of interest; _provided_ that the fewest
number of counsels necessary to avoid conflicts of interest shall be used,
(ii) the Indemnified Persons will cooperate in the defense of any such matter
and (iii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for
any settlement effected without their prior written consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not have any
obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Person if and to the extent that a
court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such
determination shall have become final, that the indemnification of such
Indemnified Person in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable Law.

  

 (e) Each Indemnified Person is, and the Indemnified Persons collectively are, intended third party beneficiaries of this Section 

  

 (f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors\' and officers\' insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _Section 7.1_ is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 (c) For a period of not less than one year following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) provide Continuing Employees (to the extent they remain employed by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries following the Effective Time), compensation and employee benefits (exclusive of equity-based compensation) substantially no less favorable in the aggregate than the compensation and benefits provided to the respective Continuing Employees immediately before the Effective Time. 

  

 (d) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or Parent\'s or the Surviving Corporation\'s Subsidiaries, as applicable, to, give each Continuing Employee full credit for such Continuing Employees\' service with the Company and its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility and vesting and, for purposes of vacation and severance only for purposes of benefit accruals, under any benefit plans made available to the Continuing Employee by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to the same extent recognized by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service shall not be 

  

      

  

recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication
of benefits with respect to the same period of service.

  

 (e) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or Parent\'s or the Surviving Corporation\'s Subsidiaries, as applicable, to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations otherwise applicable to Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents under any plan of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent that provides health benefits in which Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate following the Effective Time, other than any limitations that were in effect with respect to such employees as of the Effective Time under the analogous Employee Plan, (ii) honor any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents under the health plans in which they participated immediately prior to the Effective Time during the portion of the calendar year prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums under health plans of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries in which they are eligible to participate after the Effective Time in the same plan year in which such deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums were incurred, (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to a Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents at or after the Effective Time, in each case to the extent such Continuing Employee or eligible dependent had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous Employee Plan prior to the Effective Time, and (iv) credit the accounts of Continuing Employees under any plan of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries which is a flexible spending plan with any unused balance in the account of such Continuing Employee under the analogous Employee Plan. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be credited to such Continuing Employee following the Effective Time, and shall not be subject to accrual limits or other forfeiture and shall not limit future accruals. 

   

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to terminate the employment of, any Continuing Employee for any reason, or (ii) subject to the limitations and requirements specifically set forth in this _Section 7.2_, require Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue in effect any Employee Plan or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time. 

  

  

    
 7.3 _ Obligations of Acquisition Sub. _ Parent shall take all action necessary to cause Acquisition Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. 

  

    
 7.4 _ Other Actions by Parent and Acquisition Sub. _ Parent shall, promptly following the execution of this Agreement, approve and adopt this Agreement in its capacity as sole stockholder of Acquisition Sub in accordance with applicable Law and the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of Acquisition Sub and deliver to the Company evidence of its vote or action by written consent so approving and adopting this Agreement. 

  

    
 7.5 _ Tax Matters. _ All transfer, stamp, documentary, sales, use, registration, value-added and other similar Taxes (including all applicable real estate transfer Taxes and real property transfer gains Taxes and including any filing and recording fees) and related amounts (including any penalties, interest and additions to Tax) and all such reasonable costs (including accounting and legal fees) associated with filing all Tax Returns related to transfer Taxes incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby ("Transfer Taxes") shall be paid by Parent. Parent shall be responsible for filing all Tax Returns related to Transfer Taxes. 

        

All Parties hereto shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to avail
themselves of any available exemptions from any such Transfer Taxes, and to

 10.3 _ Fees and Expenses_.  

  

  

 (a) _ General._ Except as set forth in _Sections 7.5, 8.2 and 10.3_, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party or Parties, as applicable, incurring such expenses whether or not the Offer or the Merger is consummated. 

  

 (b) In the event that (i) this Agreement is validly terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 10.1(b)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 10.1(e) _, (ii) at or prior to the time of any such termination of this Agreement a third party shall have publicly disclosed a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal pursuant to which the holders of Company Common Stock would be paid a price per share of Company Common Stock in excess of the Merger Consideration, and (iii) within nine (9) months following the termination of this Agreement, the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal is consummated (it being understood that for purposes of the preceding two references to "Acquisition Proposal", the references to "20%" and "80%" in the definition of "Acquisition Transaction" shall be deemed to be references to "50%"), then, in any such case, the Company shall pay to Parent an amount equal to the sum of (x) $4,500,000 and (y) all reasonably documented fees and expenses incurred by Parent or its Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including all reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including all reasonable fees and expenses of outside counsel, accountants, investment bankers, experts and consultants to Parent or its Subsidiaries) incurred by or on behalf of Parent or its Subsidiaries in connection with the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby up to a maximum of $2,000,000 (the "Parent Expenses") (the sum of (x) and (y) being hereinafter referred to as the "Termination Fee"), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent, within two (2) Business Days after such transaction is consummated.

 (c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 10.1(d)_, the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent, as a condition to the effectiveness of such termination.

 (e) Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in this _Section 10.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the Termination Fee due pursuant to _Section 10.3_, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a Legal Proceeding that results in an award against the Company for such fee, the Company shall pay Parent its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses) in connection with such Legal Proceeding, together with interest on the amount of the applicable fee from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the prime lending rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to be made. 

   

 (f) In no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Company pays the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 10.3_, then any such payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Acquisition Sub against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future officers, directors, partners, equity holders, managers, members, Affiliates or successors and none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates or successors shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

successors and permitted assigns and (ii) inure to the benefit of the Parties

 11.4 _ Entire Agreement. _ This Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the Parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to herein or therein, including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Annexes hereto, constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , the Confidentiality Agreement shall not be superseded, shall survive any termination of this Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect until the earlier to occur of (a) the Effective Time and (b) the date on which the Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance with its terms or is validly terminated by the parties thereto. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARENT, ACQUISITION SUB OR ANY OF THEIR AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES OR REPRESENTATIVES, ON THE ONE HAND, NOR THE COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES OR REPRESENTATIVES, ON THE OTHER HAND, MAKES ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES TO THE OTHER, AND EACH PARTY HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED (INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE), OR AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY OTHER INFORMATION, MADE (OR MADE AVAILABLE) BY ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER OR THE OTHER\'S REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING. 

  

    
 11.5 _ Third Party Beneficiaries. _ This Agreement is not intended to, and shall not, confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, except (a) for the provisions of _Section 7.1_, (b) prior to the Effective Time, for the right of the Company, on behalf of the Company Stockholders, to pursue damages (including damages based on loss of the economic benefits of the transaction to Company Stockholders based on the consideration that would have otherwise been payable to holders of shares of the Company Common Stock, the loss of market value or decline in stock price of such Company Common Stock or otherwise) and other relief (including equitable relief) in the event of Parent\'s or Acquisition Sub\'s breach of this Agreement, and (c) from and after the Effective Time, the rights of holders of shares of the Company Common Stock and other Company Securities to receive the Merger Consideration, as set forth in _ARTICLE III_. 

  

    
 11.6 _ Severability. _ In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision. 

  

    
 11.7 _ Specific Performance. _ The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that in any such case any breach of this Agreement could not be adequately compensated by monetary damages alone. Accordingly, the Parties agree that, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 10.1_, each Party shall be entitled to an 

        

injunction or injunctions, or any other appropriate form of specific
performance or equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of
competent jurisdiction, in each case in accordance with _Section 11.9_, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under the
terms of this Agreement at law or in equity. Each Party hereto accordingly
agrees not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy
of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of
such Party under this Agreement all in accordance with the terms of this
_Section 11.7_. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to post a bond or
undertaking in connection with such order or injunction sought in accordance
with the terms of this _Section 11.7_.

  

    
 11.8 _ Governing Law. _ THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER AT LAW, IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT) THAT MAY BE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BASED UPON, RELATING TO ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, OR THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE HEREOF OR THEREOF, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, REGARDLESS OF THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS THEREOF. 

  

    
 11.9 _ Consent to Jurisdiction_.  

  

  

 (a) Each of the Parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the United States District Court sitting in New Castle County in the State of Delaware or Delaware Superior Court, for the purpose of any Legal Proceeding directly or indirectly based upon, relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof or thereof, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect to such action or proceeding shall be brought in, and may be heard and determined exclusively in, such state or federal courts. Each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue in, and any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any action or proceeding so brought. Each of the Parties agrees that a final judgment in any action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. 

  

 (b) Each of the Parties irrevocably consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process in any other action or proceeding relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on behalf of itself or its property, by personal delivery of copies of such process to such Party at the addresses set forth in _Section 11.2_. Nothing in this  _Section 11.9_ shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law. 

  

  

    
 11.10 _ WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. _ EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BASED UPON, RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE HEREOF OR THEREOF. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, 

        

(II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATION OF THIS
WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL

(A) ANNEX A 

  

  Conditions to the Offer 

  

 Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or this Agreement, Acquisition Sub shall not be required to, and Parent shall not be required to cause Acquisition Sub to, accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Acquisition Sub\'s obligation to pay for or return tendered shares of Company Common Stock promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), pay for any shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer if: (a) there shall not be validly tendered prior to the expiration of the Offer a number of shares of Company Common Stock that when added to the number of shares owned by Parent and Acquisition Sub and their respective Affiliates, represent a majority of the sum of (x) the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock as of the expiration of the Offer, _plus_ (y) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable to holders of Company Stock Options with respect to which either (i) the exercise price is less than the Offer Price or (ii) the Company or its Representatives have received notices of exercise prior to the expiration of the Offer (and as to which shares of Company Common Stock have not yet been issued to such exercising holders of Company Stock Options) (the "Minimum Tender Condition"); (b) the waiting period applicable to the purchase of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of the Merger under the HSR Act (or any extension thereof) shall have neither expired nor terminated; or (c) any of the following conditions shall have occurred and be continuing as of the expiration of the Offer: 

  

  

 (i) there shall be pending any Legal Proceeding brought by any Governmental Authority against Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company challenging the acquisition by Parent or Acquisition Sub of any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer or seeking to make illegal, restrain or prohibit the making or consummation of the Offer or the Merger; 

  

 (ii) there shall be any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent in nature) issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other restraint or prohibition of any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction in effect, or any Law enacted, entered, promulgated, enforced or deemed applicable by any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction and remaining in effect, that, in any such case, prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the Offer or the Merger; 

  

 (iii) any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall not be true and correct (disregarding all qualifications or limitations as to "materiality," "Company Material Adverse Effect" and words of similar import set forth therein), except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect and except, in each case, to the extent such representations and warranties are made as of a specific date (in which case such representations and warranties shall not be true and correct (subject to such qualifications) as of such specific date only); 

  

 (iv) the Company shall have failed to perform or comply in all material respects with its obligations required to be performed or complied with by it under this Agreement; 

  

 (v) since the date of this Agreement, there shall have occurred any change, circumstance, event or occurrence that has had or could reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; or 

  

 (vi) this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms. 

  

  

 At the request of Parent, the Company shall deliver to Parent a certificate executed on behalf of the Company by the chief executive officer or the chief financial officer of the Company certifying that 

        

none of the conditions set forth in _clauses (c)(iii)_, _(c)(iv)_ , and
_(c)(v)_ above shall have occurred and be continuing as of the expiration of
the Offer.

   

 The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Acquisition Sub and, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, may be waived by Parent and Acquisition Sub in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion (other than the Minimum Tender Condition unless such waiver is consented to in writing by the Company), and may be asserted by Parent or Acquisition Sub regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such conditions (other than as a result of a material breach by Parent or Acquisition Sub). The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the rights of Parent and Acquisition Sub to extend, terminate, amend and/or modify the Offer pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The failure by Parent or Acquisition Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time. 

  

 The capitalized terms used in this _Annex A_ and not defined in this _Annex A_ shall have the meanings set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January 29, 2013, by and among BioCore Holdings, Inc., BC Acquisition Corp. and BioClinica, Inc.

the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as set forth in Title 8
of the Delaware Code (the "GCL").

  

 _ FOURTH:_ The total number of shares of stock which the
Corporation shall have authority to issue is 10,000 shares of Common Stock,
each having a par value of $0.00025.

  

 _ FIFTH:_ The following provisions are inserted for the management
of the business and the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation, and for
further definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the
Corporation and of its directors and stockholders:

  

  

 (1) The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors. 

  

 (2) The directors shall have concurrent power with the stockholders to make, alter, amend, change, add to or repeal the By-Laws of the Corporation. 

  

 (3) The number of directors of the Corporation shall be as from time to time fixed by, or in the manner provided in, the By-Laws of the Corporation. Election of directors need not be by written ballot unless the By-Laws so provide. 

   

 (4) No director shall be personally liable to the Corporation or any of its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the director\'s duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) pursuant to Section 174 of the GCL or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. Any repeal or modification of this Article FIFTH by the stockholders of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to such repeal or modification. 

   

 (5) In addition to the powers and authority hereinbefore or by statute expressly conferred upon them, the directors are hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the GCL, this Certificate of Incorporation, and any By-Laws adopted by the stockholders; provided, however, that no By-Laws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the directors which would have been valid if such By-Laws had not been adopted. 

  

  

 _ SIXTH:_ Meetings of stockholders may be held within or without
the State of Delaware, as the By-Laws may provide. The books of
the Corporation may be kept (subject to any provision contained in the GCL)
outside the State of Delaware at such place or places as may be designated
from time to time by the Board of Directors or in the By-Laws of the
Corporation.

        

 _ SEVENTH:_ The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter,
change or repeal any provision contained in this Certificate
of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and
all rights conferred upon stockholders herein are granted subject to this
reservation.

  

 _ EIGHTH:_ The Corporation shall indemnify its directors and
officers to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by law, as now
or hereafter in effect, and such right to indemnification shall continue as
to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer of the Corporation and
shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and personal and
legal representatives; _provided_ , _however_ , that, except for proceedings
to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall not be obligated
to indemnify any director or officer (or his or her heirs, executors or
personal or legal representatives) in connection with a proceeding (or part
thereof) initiated by such person unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was
authorized or consented to by the Board of Directors. The right to
indemnification conferred by this Article EIGHTH shall include the right to
be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending or otherwise
participating in any proceeding in advance of its final disposition.

  

 The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, provide rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to employees and agents of the Corporation similar to those conferred in this Article EIGHTH to directors and officers of the Corporation. 

   

 The rights to indemnification and to the advance of expenses conferred in this Article EIGHTH shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under this Certificate of Incorporation, the By-Laws of the Corporation, any statute, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. 

  

 Any repeal or modification of this Article EIGHTH by the stockholders of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses of a director or officer of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification with respect to any acts or omissions occurring prior to such repeal or modification.

ARTICLE II 

_MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS 
_

  

    Section 2.1 _ Place of Meetings. _ Meetings of the
stockholders for the election of directors or for any other purpose shall be
held at such time and place, either within or without the State of Delaware,
as shall be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors.

  

    
 Section 2.2 _ Annual Meetings. _ The Annual Meeting of Stockholders for the election of directors shall be held on such date and at such time as shall be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors. Any other proper business may be transacted at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 

  

    
 Section 2.3 _ Special Meetings. _ Unless otherwise required by law or by the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation, as amended and restated from time to time (the "Certificate of Incorporation"), Special Meetings of Stockholders, for any purpose or purposes, may be called by either (i) the Chairman, if there be one, or (ii) the President, (iii) any Vice President, if there be one, (iv) the Secretary or (v) any Assistant Secretary, if there be one, and shall be called by any such officer at the request in writing of (i) the Board of Directors, (ii) a committee of the Board of Directors that has been duly designated by the Board of Directors and whose powers and authority include the power to call such meetings or (iii) stockholders owning a majority of the capital stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote. Such request shall state the purpose or purposes of the proposed meeting. At a Special Meeting of Stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall be specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto). 

  

    
 Section 2.4 _ Notice. _ Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting shall be given which shall state the place, date and hour of the meeting, and, in the case of a Special Meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Unless otherwise required by law, written notice of any meeting shall be given not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting. 

  

    
 Section 2.5 _ Adjournments. _ Any meeting of the stockholders may be adjourned from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place, and notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting, the Corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, notice of the adjourned meeting in 

        

accordance with the requirements of Section 4 hereof shall be given to each
stockholder of record entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting.

  

    
 Section 2.6 _ Quorum. _ Unless otherwise required by applicable law or the Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of a majority of the Corporation\'s capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business. A quorum, once established, shall not be broken by the withdrawal of enough votes to leave less than a quorum. If, however, such quorum shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, in the manner provided in Section 5 hereof, until a quorum shall be present or represented. 

  

    
 Section 2.7 _ Voting. _ Unless otherwise required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws or permitted by the rules of any stock exchange on which the Corporation\'s shares are listed and traded, any question brought before any meeting of the stockholders, other than the election of directors, shall be decided by the vote of the holders of a majority of the total number of votes of the Corporation\'s capital stock represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on such question, voting as a single class. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, and subject to Section 11(a) of this Article II, each stockholder represented at a meeting of the stockholders shall be entitled to cast one (1) vote for each share of the capital stock entitled to vote thereat held by such stockholder. Such votes may be cast in person or by proxy as provided in Section 8 of this Article II. The Board of Directors, in its discretion, or the officer of the Corporation presiding at a meeting of the stockholders, in such officer\'s discretion, may require that any votes cast at such meeting shall be cast by written ballot. 

  

    
 Section 2.8 _ Proxies. _ Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of the stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted upon after three years from its date, unless such proxy provides for a longer period. Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy, the following shall constitute a valid means by which a stockholder may grant such authority: 

  

  

 (i) A stockholder may execute a writing authorizing another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy. Execution may be accomplished by the stockholder or such stockholder\'s authorized officer, director, employee or agent signing such writing or causing such person\'s signature to be affixed to such writing by any reasonable means, including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature. 

  

 (ii) A stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram or cablegram to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such telegram or cablegram, provided that any such telegram or cablegram must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the telegram or cablegram was authorized by the stockholder. If it is determined that such telegrams or cablegrams are valid, the inspectors or, if there are no inspectors, such other persons making that determination shall specify the information on which they relied. 

  

  

Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the
writing, telegram or cablegram authorizing another person or persons to act as
proxy for a stockholder may be substituted or used in lieu of the original
writing, telegram or cablegram for any and all purposes for which the original
writing, telegram or cablegram could be used; provided, however, that such
copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete
reproduction of the entire original writing, telegram or cablegram.

        

    
 Section 2.9 _ Consent of Stockholders in Lieu of Meeting. _ Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, any action required or permitted to be taken at any Annual or Special Meeting of Stockholders of the Corporation may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of the stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporation\'s registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.

ARTICLE VIII 

_INDEMNIFICATION 
_

  

    Section 8.1 _ Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or
Proceedings other than Those by or in the Right of the Corporation. _
Subject to Section 3 of this Article VIII, the Corporation shall indemnify any
person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the
right of the Corporation), by reason of the fact that such person is or was a
director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of
the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys\'
fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and
reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or
proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such

        

person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of
the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had
no reasonable cause to believe such person\'s conduct was unlawful. The
termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement,
conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of
itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in
a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the
best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action
or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such person\'s conduct was
unlawful.

  

    
 Section 8.2 _ Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings by or in the Right of the Corporation. _ Subject to Section 3 of this Article VIII, the Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys\' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper. 

  

    
 Section 8.3 _ Authorization of Indemnification. _ Any indemnification under this Article VIII (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the present or former director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made, with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such determination, (i) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of such directors designated by a majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (iv) by the stockholders. Such determination shall be made, with respect to former directors and officers, by any person or persons having the authority to act on the matter on behalf of the Corporation. To the extent, however, that a present or former director or officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding described above, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys\' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case. 

  

    
 Section 8.4 _ Good Faith Defined. _ For purposes of any determination under Section 3 of this Article VIII, a person shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe such person\'s conduct was unlawful, if such person\'s action is based on the records or books of account of the Corporation or another enterprise, or on information supplied to such person by the officers of the Corporation or another enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Corporation or another enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the Corporation or another enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care by the Corporation or another enterprise. The provisions of this Section 4 

        

shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the circumstances
in which a person may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct
set forth in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be.

  

    
 Section 8.5 _ Indemnification by a Court. _ Notwithstanding any contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article VIII, and notwithstanding the absence of any determination thereunder, any director or officer may apply to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or any other court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware for indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible under Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article VIII. The basis of such indemnification by a court shall be a determination by such court that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be. Neither a contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article VIII nor the absence of any determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a presumption that the director or officer seeking indemnification has not met any applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to this Section 5 shall be given to the Corporation promptly upon the filing of such application. If successful, in whole or in part, the director or officer seeking indemnification shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such application. 

  

    
 Section 8.6 _ Expenses Payable in Advance. _ Expenses (including attorneys\' fees) incurred by a director or officer in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article VIII. Such expenses (including attorneys\' fees) incurred by former directors and officers or other employees and agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Corporation deems appropriate. 

  

    
 Section 8.7 _ Nonexclusivity of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses. _ The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article VIII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the Certificate of Incorporation, these By-Laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such person\'s official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of the Corporation that indemnification of the persons specified in Section 1 and Section 2 of this Article VIII shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law. The provisions of this Article VIII shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any person who is not specified in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article VIII but whom the Corporation has the power or obligation to indemnify under the provisions of the DGCL, or otherwise. 

  

    
 Section 8.8 _ Insurance. _ The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person\'s status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article VIII. 

       

                                    

    

    
 Section 8.9 _ Certain Definitions. _ For purposes of this Article VIII, references to "the Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors or officers, so that any person who is or was a director or officer of such constituent corporation, or is or was a director or officer of such constituent corporation serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article VIII with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued. The term "another enterprise" as used in this Article VIII shall mean any other corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise of which such person is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent. For purposes of this Article VIII, references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director or officer with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation" as referred to in this Article VIII. 

  

    
 Section 8.10 _ Survival of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses. _ The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article VIII shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. 

  

    
 Section 8.11 _ Limitation on Indemnification. _ Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article VIII to the contrary, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification (which shall be governed by Section 5 of this Article VIII), the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify any director or officer (or his or her heirs, executors or personal or legal representatives) or advance expenses in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or consented to by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. 

  

    
 Section 8.12 _ Indemnification of Employees and Agents. _ The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, provide rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to employees and agents of the Corporation similar to those conferred in this Article VIII to directors and officers of the Corporation. 

  

    
ARTICLE IX

_

  

    Section 9.1 _ Amendments. _ These By-Laws may be altered,
amended or repealed, in whole or in part, or new By-Laws may be adopted by
the stockholders or by the Board of Directors; provided, however, that notice
of such alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption of new By-Laws be contained
