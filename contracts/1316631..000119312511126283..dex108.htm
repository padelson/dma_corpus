Clearance, if any.



   8.3 | Seller and Purchaser shall notify each other in writing without

under this Agreement and/or the Commitment Letter and (ii) that the assumption
of all rights and obligations of Purchaser under this Agreement by way of the

terminated pursuant to this Section 8.7, neither Purchaser nor Seller shall
have any obligation or liability towards the other Party except that any
liability of any Party for damages already due on the date of termination or
for damages for a wilful breach of any covenants of this Agreement shall
