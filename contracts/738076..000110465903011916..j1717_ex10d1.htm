Statement shall be accompanied by a report setting forth (i) the Working
Capital of the Business, as reflected in the Final Statement, and (ii) the

thirty (30) days following the delivery to Buyer of the Final Statement,
Buyer shall notify Seller of any dispute of any item contained in the Final
Statement, which notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for
such dispute. If Buyer fails to notify Seller of any such dispute within such
thirty (30)-day period, the Final Statement shall be deemed to be accepted by
Buyer. In the event that Buyer shall so notify Seller of any dispute, Buyer
and Seller shall cooperate in good faith to resolve such dispute as promptly

Independent Accounting Firm, an engagement letter containing customary terms.
All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by Seller Group and Buyer.
The Independent Accounting Firm shall act as an arbitrator to determine,
based solely on presentations by Seller Group and Buyer, and not by
independent review, only those issues still in dispute and shall be limited
to those adjustments, if any, that need be made to the Final Statement to
comply with the standards referred to in Section 1.7(a). The Independent
Accounting Firms determination shall be requested to be made within thirty
(30) days of its selection, shall be set forth in a written statement
delivered to Seller and Buyer and shall be final, binding and conclusive. The
Final Statement, as modified by resolution of any disputes by Buyer and
Seller Group or by the Independent Accounting Firm, shall be the "

## ** _Section 2.3_** Employees and Employee Benefits

  



  

### (a) Prior to the Closing, Buyer may, in its sole discretion, offer to
employ any Business Employee (as defined in Section 3.14(b)) on an at-will
basis and pursuant to the terms of the offer presented by Buyer, which may
vary from the terms of employment with Seller. If requested by Seller,
Buyer shall provide Seller with such information relating to the terms of
Buyers offer of employment to the Eligible Employees as is reasonably
necessary to allow Seller to determine whether or not the Eligible Employees
may be entitled to severance benefits from Seller.  Buyer shall communicate
in writing to Seller as soon as practicable the names of those Business
Employees to whom Buyer determines it will not make offers of employment.
Buyer shall finalize its list of Business Employees to which it will make
offers of employment (the " **Eligible Employees** ") and communicate that
list to Seller no later than the earlier to occur of: (i) Closing or (ii) the
forty-fifth day after the date of this Agreement. When the Buyer
communicates to Seller in writing that it will not offer employment to an
Eligible Employee, such person shall cease to be an Eligible Employee but
shall continue to be a Business Employee. Buyer shall make good faith offers
of employment to at least 300 Business Employees. Such Eligible Employees who
become employees of Buyer following the Closing are referred to herein as the
" **Affected Employees**." Prior to Closing, Seller Group shall provide
Buyer with a list of all independent contractors currently providing services
primarily related to the Business. Seller Group shall be responsible, except
as otherwise specifically provided herein, for all obligations and Employment
Liabilities of Business Employees up to and including the Closing Date,
including any severance payments of such employees arising in connection with
the termination of their employment with the Seller Group, the Ancillary
Agreements and any Employment Liabilities. Seller Group shall be responsible
for all obligations to and Employment Liabilities of all Business Employees
up to and following the Closing, except for Affected Employees, with respect
to whom Seller Group shall be responsible for all obligations and
Employment Liabilities up to the Closing.  Following the Closing, the
Affected Employees shall become participants in the employee benefit plans of
Buyer as the Affected Employees become eligible to participate in such plans
pursuant to their terms. For purposes of this Agreement, Buyers employee
benefit plans include, but are not limited to, all "employee benefit plans"
within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended (" **ERISA** "), and employee fringe benefit programs
of Buyer. Seller Group shall use commercially reasonable efforts, upon
Buyers request, and at Buyers expense to assist in the transition of
Affected Employees to Buyer.  From and after the Closing, Seller Group shall
(i) sponsor, (ii) assume or (iii) retain, as the case may be, and be
solely responsible for all Employment Liabilities whether incurred before, on
or after the Closing.

  

### 

  

As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Seller Group shall provide
Buyer with such documents as Buyer shall reasonably request to assure itself
that the accounts of the Affected Employees under the 3Com Corporation 401(k)
Plan (" **Seller Savings Plan** ") if distributed to such Affected
Employees, would be eligible rollover distributions and with such documents
and other information as Buyer shall reasonably request to assure itself that
the Seller Savings Plan and the trust established pursuant thereto are
qualified and tax-exempt under Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code.
 Effective as of the Closing Date, each Affected Employee who was
a participant in the Seller Savings Plan shall cease to have any
contributions made on his or her behalf, except for contributions
attributable to compensation earned on or before such date under such Seller
Savings Plan. Each Affected Employee who is a participant in a Seller Savings
Plan shall be given the opportunity to "roll over" such account balance by
way of an eligible rollover distribution to the UTStarcom, Inc. 401(k) Plan
(the " **Buyer 401(k) Plan**"), subject to the approval of the administrator
of the Buyer 401(k) Plan and in accordance with the provisions of such
Plan and applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, each Affected Employee who was eligible

  



  

9      
   



  

to participate in a Seller Savings Plan will first become eligible to
participate in the Buyer 401(k) Plan as soon as reasonably practicable after
the Closing Date and pursuant to the terms of such plan.

  



  

### (b) Seller Group agrees and acknowledges that the selling group (as
defined in Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9, QandA-3(a)) of which it is a
part (the " **Selling Group** ") will continue to offer a group health plan
to its employees after the Closing Date to the extent required by Law and,
accordingly, that Seller and the Selling Group shall be solely responsible
for providing continuation coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (" **COBRA** ") to those individuals
who are MandA qualified beneficiaries (as defined in Treasury Regulation
Section 54.4980B-9, QandA-4(a)) with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (collectively, the " **M andA Qualified Beneficiaries**"). The
members of the Seller Group shall be responsible for all COBRA obligations,
liabilities and claims related to MandA Qualified Beneficiaries and all other
qualified beneficiaries (as defined in Code Section 4980B(g)(1)) with respect
to Seller Groups health plans.

  

### 

  

### (c) Buyer shall provide each Affected Employee credit, for purposes of
any service requirements for participation or vesting (and not for benefit
accrual purposes), under each employee benefit plan, program, or arrangement
of the Buyer or its affiliates in which such employee is eligible to
participate, for his or her periods of service with the Seller or any
Subsidiary, as appropriate, credited under a similar plan, program
or arrangement prior to the Closing Date or as reflected in Sellers or
any Subsidiarys records, as applicable, which method of crediting service
shall be at Buyers discretion, subject to appropriate break-in-service rules
(or other applicable legal restrictions) and the applicable provisions of the
Buyers employee benefit plan, program or arrangement and applicable tax
qualification requirements. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the
contrary, none of the provisions contained herein shall operate to duplicate
any benefit provided to any Affected Employee or the funding of any such
benefit.

  

### 

  

### (d) Nothing contained herein, expressed or implied, is intended to confer
upon any Affected Employee any right to continued employment for any period
by reason of this Agreement. Nothing contained herein is intended to confer
upon any Affected Employee any particular term or condition of employment
other than with respect to the particular employee benefit plans or severance
plans, policies or arrangements expressly referred to in this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (e) Buyer shall neither assume nor substitute for any outstanding options
to purchase Seller common stock or any other equity-based compensation award
held by Affected Employees.  Affected Employees shall only be eligible to
participate in the Buyers equity plans (including the Buyers Employee Stock
Purchase Plan) pursuant to the terms and conditions of such plans.

  

### 

  

### (f) Seller agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to encourage the
Eligible Employees to accept any offers of employment extended by Buyer
pursuant to Buyers standard form of employment offer letter. Buyer shall
have the right, within forty-five (45) days of the date of this Agreement, to
designate twenty (20) Business Employees with expertise related to "voice
over Internet protocol" technology, products and services as " **Designated
Employees**."  In the event any Designated Employee rejects Buyers offer
of employment, such Designated Employee shall become an " **Ineligible
Employee**." Seller may elect to retain or hire up to six Ineligible
Employees without any obligation to Buyer. However, to the extent Seller
retains or hires more than six Ineligible Employees at any time through the
one-year anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller shall be obligated to pay to
Buyer a sum equal to twelve (12) months of salary then paid by Seller of each
such retained or hired employee (in excess of six).

## ** _Section 7.4_** Third Party Indemnification

  

## ** _ _**

  

The obligations of any indemnifying party to indemnify any indemnified party

(a " **Claim** "), will be subject to the following terms and conditions:

  



  

### (a) Any party against whom any Claim is asserted will give the party
required to provide indemnity hereunder written notice of, and copies of
correspondence and documentation relating to, any such Claim promptly after
learning of such Claim, and the indemnifying party may at its option
undertake the defense thereof by representatives of its own choosing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any party seeks equitable
relief against Buyer with respect to any Claim, Buyer shall have the option
to undertake the

  

### 

  

42      
   



  

### defense thereof by representatives of its own choosing and at its own
expense, and the parties shall agree upon an arrangement to protect the
rights of Buyer, with respect to the equitable relief claim, and Seller with
respect to the remaining claims, provided that if after good faith
negotiations the parties are unable to reach such an arrangement, Buyer may
elect to either (i) tender the defense of all claims by such third party to
Seller, or (ii) assume the defense of all claims by such third party, in
which case Seller shall have no further obligation with respect to the Claim
or indemnity therefore.  Failure to give prompt notice of, or copies of
correspondence and documentation relating to, a Claim hereunder shall not
affect the indemnifying partys obligations under this Section 7.4, except to
the extent that the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced by such
failure to give prompt notice or copies of such correspondence and
documentation. If the indemnifying party, within thirty (30) days after
notice of any such Claim, fails to assume the defense of such Claim, the
indemnified party against whom such claim has been made will (upon further
notice to the indemnifying party) have the right to undertake the defense,
compromise or settlement of such claim on behalf of and for the account and
risk, and at the expense, of the indemnifying party, subject to the right of
the indemnifying party to assume the defense of such Claim at any time prior
to settlement, compromise or final determination thereof.

  

### 

  

### (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.4 to the contrary, (i) the
indemnified party shall not settle a claim for which it is indemnified
without the prior written consent of the indemnifying party, and (ii) the
indemnifying party shall not enter into any settlement or compromise of any
action, suit or proceeding or consent to the entry of any judgment to be
borne by the indemnifying party without the prior written consent of the
indemnified party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

  

### 

  

## ** _Section 7.5_** Sole Remedy

  

## ** _ _**

  

After the Closing, (a) the indemnification provisions set forth in
this Article VII, (b) the specific performance provisions of Section 9.13
