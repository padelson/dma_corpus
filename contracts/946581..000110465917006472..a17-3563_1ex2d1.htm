(iii) the aggregate amount of USD 6,429,500 is paid by Parent, the Purchaser

and the other agreements to be entered into in connection with the

Stock delivered to the Sellers pursuant to this Section 3.3 or otherwise
pursuant to this Agreement will not be registered at the time of issuance
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " **Securities Act** "), or
any federal, state, domestic, foreign or other securities laws on the grounds
that the offer and sale of Parent Common Stock contemplated by this Agreement
are exempt from registration under the Securities Act and applicable state
securities or blue sky laws, and that Purchasers reliance upon such
exemptions is predicated upon the Seller Fundamental Representations and
Warranties set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

Each Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees that the shares of Parent Common
Stock received pursuant to this Agreement must be held indefinitely unless
such shares are subsequently registered under the Securities Act and qualified

or the book entry notation for such shares at Parents transfer agent,
acquired by the Sellers hereunder will bear substantially the following legend

Sellers pursuant to the terms hereunder, any such additional legend as
provided in such Founding Sellers Employment Agreement) reflecting the
applicable restrictions on the transfer of such securities:

 



 

"THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED OR QUALIFIED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT
OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR ANY STATE SECURITIES LAWS AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED,
SOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

3.3.3 Condition subsequent ( _condici on resolutoria_)

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Parties agree
that the transfer of ownership over the Shares to the Purchaser hereunder is
subject to the non-satisfaction on the terms set forth herein of the following
condition subsequent ( _condici on resolutoria_) (the " **Condition** ").

 



 

Completion of the transfer of ownership over the Shares shall be rescinded in
the event that any of the Sellers notify the Notary by e-mail addressed to the

received the full portion of the Purchase Price payable to such Seller in
accordance with Sections 3.3.1(i) and 3.3.1(iv).

 



 

The Condition is agreed for the benefit of the Sellers and, on that basis, the
Sellers agree that the Condition shall be waived for all purposes as soon as
(x) each of the Sellers has notified the Notary by e-mail addressed to the
Notary Email Address (or in any other way acceptable to the Notary) that it or
he has received the full portion of the Purchase Price payable to such Seller
in accordance with Section 3.3.1; or (y) the Purchaser delivers to the Notary

Price in accordance with Section 3.3.1(i); and (ii) the irrevocable
instruction of Take-Two Holdings III LLC to American Stock Transfer and Trust

it will do so in accordance with such instruction letter.

 



 

All the e-mails sent by the Sellers to the Notary in connection with the

also be required to be sent to the Parent and Purchaser in accordance with
Section 9.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (x) in case any of

such Seller in accordance with Section 3.3.1(i) and 3.3.1(iv) by 6:00 pm CET
on February 3, 2017, such Seller will promptly notify the Purchaser via email
to the address set forth in Section 9.2 and will use all reasonable efforts to
assist the Purchaser so that it can receive the full portion of the Purchase
Price payable to it or him as soon as practicable, and any failure to so
notify the Purchaser pursuant to this clause (x) shall constitute a waiver by
any such Seller of the Condition for all purposes hereunder and (y) in case
the Condition is waived by the Sellers, the Purchaser will still use best
efforts to ensure that each Seller receives the full portion of the Purchase
Price payable to it or him in accordance with Section 3.3.1(i) and 3.3.1 (iv).

 



 

Upon satisfaction of the Condition on the terms set forth herein, (x) each
Seller shall promptly return to the Purchaser (or its designee) the portion of

3.4 Adjustments to the Purchase Price

 



 

3.4.1 Adjustment for net working capital, Indebtedness and Transaction
Expenses

 



 

Within ninety (90) days after the date hereof, the Purchaser will provide to
the Representatives a statement (the " **Post-Closing Statement** ") setting
forth a calculation of: (i) the actual Net Working Capital Position, (ii) the
Actual Transaction Expenses, and (iii) the Actual Indebtedness (the
calculation and determination of the actual Net Working Capital Position, the
Actual Transaction Expenses and the Actual Indebtedness, jointly, the "
**Purchaser Determination** "), as of Closing, and the supporting
documentation and calculations necessary for the purposes of determining the
Purchaser Determination.

 



 

The Sellers shall have forty-five (45) days to review the Post-Closing
Statement after it (and the necessary supporting documentation and
calculations) has been provided by the Purchaser (the " **Determination Review
Period** ").

 



 

The Sellers will accept the Purchaser Determination if (i) all Representatives
so confirm in writing in accordance with Section 9 below to the Purchaser
before the expiration of the Determination Review Period or (ii) after the
expiration of the Determination Review Period none of the Representatives has
rejected the Purchaser Determination in accordance with Section 9.

 



 

If any of the Representatives (the " **Rejecting Sellers** ") rejects the
Purchaser Determination (such rejection to include the grounds for it and a
determination of the adjustment that the Rejecting Sellers believe that should
be made), the Rejecting Sellers and the Purchaser shall negotiate in good
faith during a period of thirty (30) days to try to reach an agreement as to
the determination of the adjustment to be made under this Section 3.4.1.

 



 

If the Rejecting Sellers and the Purchaser reach an agreement during the
period mentioned in the immediately preceding paragraph, the adjustment shall
be made in the terms agreed by the Rejecting Sellers and the Purchaser and in
accordance with them, and any such agreement shall be binding on all Sellers
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Seller that was not a Rejecting
Seller).

 



 

If after the aforementioned negotiation period the Rejecting Sellers and the
Purchaser are unable to reach an agreement as to the determination of the Net
Working Capital Position and/or the calculation of Actual Transaction Expenses
and/or the calculation of the Actual Indebtedness, the determination and
calculation of such amounts (and therefore the adjustment to be made
hereunder) shall be entrusted by the Sellers and the Purchaser to any of
Deloitte, KPMG or PWC (in the interest of the Sellers and the Purchaser)
appointed by mutual agreement of the Rejecting Sellers and the Purchaser and,
failing such agreement within ten (10) days, by a drawing lot (the entity so
determined, the " **Determination Expert** "). The statutory auditor of any
Buying Party and of the

 



       
 

 



 

Companies shall be excluded and shall not be selected to act as Determination
Expert.

 



 

The Determination Expert shall have thirty (30) days from the date of its
appointment to issue its report, and shall submit a draft of it to the Sellers
and the Purchaser before being issued and shall receive the comments that the
Sellers and the Purchaser may deem convenient but, for the avoidance of doubt,
the Determination Expert shall not be bound by any of such comments. The
Parties shall cooperate in good faith to provide to the Determination Expert
any supporting documentation that it requires and, specifically, the Purchaser
shall cause the Companies to provide such documentation to the Determination
Expert.

 



 

The Determination Expert shall determine, based solely on the materials
presented to it and upon information received in response to requests for
additional or clarifying information and not by independent review, only those
issues in dispute specifically identified by the Rejecting Sellers.

 



 

The determination of the Net Working Capital Position and the calculation of
Actual Transaction Expenses and Actual Indebtedness (in each case, as
applicable to the extent such determination or calculation was in dispute)
made by the Determination Expert shall (i) not assign a value to any item
higher than the highest value for such item claimed by either party or less
than the lowest value for such item claimed by either party, and (ii) be final
and binding on the Sellers and the Purchaser.

 



 

For the purposes of this Section 3.4.1, (i) there must be no duplication and,
therefore, any debt or account payable of any nature already taken into
account for the determination of the actual Net Working Capital Position as of
the Closing shall not be considered for the determination of the Actual
Transaction Expenses and the Actual Indebtedness and vice versa. Any amount
finally payable hereunder by the Sellers or the Purchaser shall be referred to
as the " **Net Adjustment Amount** " and such Net Adjustment Amount shall be
determined by calculating the sum (positive or negative) of (i) the actual Net
Working Capital Position minus the Net Working Capital Target, **_minus_**
(ii) the Actual Transaction Expenses minus the Estimated Transaction Expenses,
**_minus_** (iii) the Actual Indebtedness minus the Estimated Indebtedness.

 



 

If the Net Adjustment Amount is a positive amount, the Purchaser will pay such
positive amount to the Sellers in cash within five (5) Business Days in each
Seller Pro Rata Share by electronic bank transfer of immediately available
funds with value date on such date and without deduction for any charge,
commission or other item of any nature. Any such payment shall be made
directly to the Payment Accounts or as otherwise may be notified to the
Purchaser pursuant to Section 9.

 



 

If the Net Adjustment Amount is a negative amount, the Sellers (in each Seller
Pro Rata Share) shall within fifteen (15) Business Days reimburse the
Purchaser

 



      
 

 



 

for such negative amount in cash. For the avoidance of doubt, any
reimbursement obligation of the Sellers under this Section 3.4.1 shall be
joint ( _individual y mancomunada_ ). The Purchaser shall, at its sole
discretion, be entitled to off-set ( _compensar_ ) any amounts owed to it
hereunder with any adjustment to be made in favor of the Sellers under Section
3.4.2 and 3.4.3, if any. If the amount of such adjustments is not sufficient
to fully satisfy the Sellers reimbursement obligation (or there are no
adjustments to be made under any of such Sections or the adjustments to be
made thereunder are not yet determined by any reason other than a breach of
the Parties of their obligations thereunder) then such off-setting may, at the
Purchasers sole discretion, be made with the Escrow Amount and each of the
Representatives shall execute a joint instruction letter (together with the
Purchaser) to effect such off-setting.

 



 

The fees of the Determination Expert shall be borne by the Rejecting Sellers
individually ( _individualmente_ ) based on the Pro Rata Share inter se if the
determination of the Net Adjustment Amount made by the Determination Expert is
closer to the Purchaser Determination than it is to the determination made by
the Rejecting Sellers. If the determination of the Net Adjustment Amount made
by the Determination Expert is closer to the determination or calculation made
by the Rejecting Sellers than to the Purchaser Determination, the fees of the
Determination Expert shall be borne by the Purchaser.

 



 

Any payment made under this Section 3.4.1 shall be considered, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, as an adjustment to the Initial Purchase Price.

 



 

3.4.2 Reduction of the cost of the Phantom Share Plan

 



 

 ** _Schedule 3.4.2_** contains, opposite the name of each beneficiary of the
Phantom Share Plan (each, a " **Beneficiary** "), the amount payable to each
such Beneficiary assuming that each of such Beneficiaries fully complies with
the requirements set forth in the Phantom Share Plan to receive such payment
in full.

 



 

In the event that a Beneficiary ceases to meet the requirements to receive all
or any part of the amount payable to it under the Phantom Share Plan before
the date in which such payment becomes due under the Phantom Share Plan (a "
**Beneficiary Departure** "), then the Purchaser shall pay to the Sellers
within ten (10) Business Days of such payment becoming due under the Phantom
Share Plan the difference between (x) the amount set forth for the relevant
Beneficiary in Schedule 3.4.2 and (y) the amount, if any, paid to such
Beneficiary under the Phantom Share Plan following the Beneficiary Departure
(such difference, the " **Reduced Incentive Amount** ").

 



 

The Purchaser shall notify the Sellers in writing of any Beneficiary Departure
no later than five (5) Business Days following the end of each calendar
quarter during which a Beneficiary Departure occurs.

 



      
 

 



 

The Purchaser shall pay the Reduced Incentive Amount to the Sellers in cash by
electronic bank transfer of immediately available funds with value date on
such date and without deduction for any charge, commission or other item of
any nature. The payment of the Reduced Incentive Amount shall be made directly
to the Payment Accounts or as otherwise may be notified to the Purchaser
pursuant to Section 9\. Such payments shall be allocated to the Sellers for
each such Sellers Pro Rata Share.

 



 

Any payment made to the Sellers under this Section 3.4.2 shall be considered,
to the fullest extent permitted by Law, as an adjustment to the Initial
Purchase Price.

 



 

3.4.3 Tax savings of the Phantom Share Plan

 



 

In the event that the payments to the Beneficiaries pursuant to the Phantom
Share Plan result in a reduction of any actual cash income Tax payment that is
paid by any of the Companies (including any tax group of which the Companies
is a part after Closing) in respect of the applicable tax year during which
such payments to the Beneficiaries took place (" **Tax Reduction Event** " and
the total aggregate amount of all such reductions, the " **Tax Reduction
Amount** "), then the Tax Reduction Amount shall be payable to the Sellers
pursuant to the terms and conditions hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, the
amount of any Tax Reduction Amount shall be determined in accordance with the
following formula:

 



 

N = T x (A  B)

 



 

Where "N" is the amount of the Tax Reduction Amount, "T" is the income Tax
rate applicable to the Companies (or to any Tax group of which the Companies
are a part after Closing), "A" is the sum of all income Tax items of the
Companies or any Tax group of which the Companies are a part (ignoring any
income Tax items relating to the payments to the Beneficiaries), and "B" is
the sum of all income Tax items of the Company or any Tax group of which the
Companies are a part, including any income Tax items relating to the payments
to the Beneficiaries. A Tax Reduction Amount shall only be payable to the
Sellers if N is a positive number.

 



 

Any Tax Reduction Event shall not be treated as occurring any sooner than the
date on which any Tax Return reflecting any reduction in actual cash Tax
payment is filed by any of the Companies (or any Tax group of which the
Companies is a part), provided that the Purchaser shall cause the Companies to
file such Tax Returns within the deadline required by Applicable Law.

 



 

Upon any Tax Reduction Event occurring, the Purchaser shall pay the Tax
Reduction Amount to the Sellers no less than ten (10) Business Days after the
relevant Tax Reduction Event (the " **Tax Reduction Amount Payment Date** ")
in cash by electronic bank transfer of immediately available funds with value
date on such date and without deduction for any charge, commission or other
item of any

 



      
 

 



 

nature. The payment of the Tax Reduction Amount shall be made directly to the
respective Payment Accounts or as otherwise may be notified to the Purchaser
pursuant to Section 9\. Such payment shall be allocated to the Sellers on the
Pro Rata Share.

 



 

The Purchaser shall notify the Sellers on the Tax Reduction Amount Payment
Date of the Purchasers calculation of the Tax Reduction Amount and provide
the Sellers with relevant underlying supporting documentation.

 



 

Any payment made under this Section 3.4.3 shall be considered, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, as an adjustment to the Initial Purchase Price.

 



 

3.5 Resolution of disputes regarding any Phantom Share Plan Adjustments

 



 

In the event of any dispute regarding the calculation of any Phantom Share
Plan Adjustments, the Parties shall jointly appoint an independent accounting
firm of international standing to act as an independent expert (the "
**Accounting Expert** "). Where the Parties cannot agree upon the identity of
such Accounting Expert, such Accounting Expert shall be appointed by the Dean
of the College of Economists of Barcelona at the request of either Party.

 



 

Each Party agrees to execute, if requested by the Accounting Expert, a
reasonable engagement letter, including as the case may be customary

Parties. The Accounting Experts fees and disbursements shall be borne by the
Parties equally (and, as between the Sellers, for each such Sellers Pro Rata
Share in accordance with the percentage set forth on Schedule 3.2 hereto
corresponding to each such Seller).

 



 

Any adjustment determined by the Accounting Expert shall be paid in cash by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Payment Accounts (if
Sellers are owed payment) or to the account or accounts specified by the
Purchaser (if the Purchaser is owed payment) within ten (10) Business Days
after the content of the any Disputed Amounts is agreed to by the Parties or
any remaining Disputed Amounts are ultimately determined by the Accounting
Expert.

extent available to the Purchaser and the Companies (i) a description of the
circumstances giving rise to such claim for indemnification pursuant to
Section 7, and (ii) a description and calculation of the Damages, only if it
is reasonably possible to make such calculation.

 



 

8.1 Procedure in absence of a Third Party Claim

 



      
 

 



 

(a) Each of the Sellers (acting through the corresponding Representative) may
accept or reject the claim of the Purchaser reflected in the Notice of
Inaccuracy within the fifteen (15) days following receipt thereof. If any
Sellers (acting through the corresponding Representative) do not accept in
writing the claim within the indicated period, it shall be deemed that they
reject the corresponding claim. Upon acceptance of any such claim, the
accepting Sellers shall pay any and all amounts due in respect thereof
pursuant to Section 7 in cash to the applicable members of the Purchaser Group
in the applicable amounts, in each case promptly and in any event within ten
(10) days following such acceptance.

 



 

(b) If any Sellers (acting through the corresponding Representative) reject
the claim (or are deemed to reject the claim), they will negotiate with the
Purchaser, in good faith, during a period of fifteen (15) days, or such
shorter period as necessary in the Purchasers reasonable judgment to ensure
the Purchaser and any other applicable member of the Purchaser Group is not
disadvantaged under Applicable Law in its pursuit of its claim, following the
date of receipt of the Notice of Inaccuracy, and will try to reach an
agreement as to whether or not the Sellers should pay such Damages for the
reasons set out in the Notice of Inaccuracy and the amount of such Damages.

 



 

(c) If such Sellers (acting through the corresponding Representative) and the
Purchaser are unable to reach an agreement within the term set out in
paragraph (b) above, the Purchaser and each other member of the Purchaser
Group shall be permitted to pursue all available remedies under this Agreement
to resolve the indemnification claim.

 



 

(d) Each Seller will pay an indemnification under this Section 8.1 if: (i)
such Seller accepts the claim of the Purchaser within the term set out in
paragraph (a) or (ii) such Seller and the Purchaser reach an agreement
pursuant to paragraph (b), in which case such Seller will pay the amount
agreed within ten (10) days from the date of such settlement; and (iii) in any
other case, promptly but only to the extent there is a final arbitration award
( _laudo arbitral firme_ ) or settlement ( _acuerdo transaccional_ )
confirming the right of the Purchaser to be indemnified under this Agreement
for the reasons set out in the relevant Notice of Inaccuracy, in which case
such Seller will pay the Damages indicated in the final arbitration award (
_laudo arbitral firme_ ) or settlement ( _acuerdo transaccional_ ) and in
accordance with it, but subject in any case to the limitations contemplated in
this Agreement.

 



 

(e) Nothing in this Section 8.1 shall be deemed to require the Sellers to act
jointly ( _mancomunadamente_ ) so that, for example, if one of the Sellers
accepts the Notice of Inaccuracy within the term set out in paragraph (a),
such Seller will pay the indemnification calculated in accordance with Section
7 to the Purchaser or the applicable member of the Purchaser Group in the
timeframe provided in this Section 8.1, and the remaining provisions of this
Section 8.1 shall apply to the remaining Sellers.

 



      
 

 



 

8.2 Procedure in case of a Third Party Claim

 



 

(a) In the event there is a Third Party Claim which may result in the
obligation of the Sellers to pay an indemnification pursuant to Section 7, the
Purchaser shall give notice of the Third Party Claim to the Sellers within a
period of five (5) days from the date on which the Purchaser or the Companies
become aware of it.

 



 

(b) The Sellers (acting through the corresponding Representative) shall have a
period of ten (10) days, or such shorter period as necessary in the
Purchasers reasonable judgment to ensure the Purchaser is not disadvantaged
under Applicable Law in its pursuit of any Third Party Claim, from receipt of
the notice referred to in the previous paragraph (or any lesser period
reasonably required by the Third Party Claim) to notify the Purchaser whether
(i) they accept the Third Party Claim, or (ii) reject it. A lack of response
from the Sellers within the said period shall be deemed rejection by the
Sellers of their liability in connection with the Third Party Claim.

 



 

(c) If the Sellers (acting through the corresponding Representative) accept
the Third Party Claim in accordance with the foregoing paragraph, the Sellers
shall pay the Damages deriving from the Third Party Claim in accordance with
the rules established in the foregoing Section 7 within ten (10) days
following the date on which the term set out in the preceding paragraph
expires.

 



 

(d) If any Sellers (acting through the corresponding Representative) reject
(or are deemed to reject) the Third Party Claim, such Sellers shall have the
right (bearing on a Pro Rata Share among such Sellers all of the costs and
expenses incurred) (acting through the corresponding Representative) to
conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim (other than in respect of any
Third Party Claim (i) where such action is brought by any Governmental
Authority, (ii) involving any request for equitable relief that may be binding
on Parent, Purchaser, any of the Companies or any of their respective
Affiliates, (iii) that would or could reasonably be expected to result in a
material adverse effect on the business, operations, results of operations or
reputation (professional or otherwise) of Purchaser, the Company and its
Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) or Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates, including any material relationships with material customers or
suppliers), or (iv) if the remaining amount in the Escrow Account (less any
amounts represented by outstanding claims) is less than fifty percent (50%) of
the alleged Damages relating to such Third Party Claim, if and only if all the
Sellers that may be liable in connection with the Third Party Claim under this
Agreement (1) retain counsel reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser and permit
the Purchaser to participate in the defense of such claim, at its own expense,
with co-counsel of its choice to the extent that the Purchaser reasonably
believes that such matter shall materially affect its ongoing business, and
(2) agree to jointly conduct such defense in a reasonable manner; and in such
case it will be specifically deemed that the Sellers agree (and each such
Seller hereby does agree) to promptly indemnify the Purchaser pursuant to
Section 8.2(e) below. If not all the Sellers

 



      
 

 



 

that may be liable in connection with the Third Party Claim agree to conduct
the defense pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Section
8.2(d), then the Companies and/or the Purchaser shall conduct the defense of
such Third Party Claim in their sole discretion, provided, however, that (x)
the Companies and the Purchaser (as appropriate in each case) shall only be
entitled to reach a settlement agreement ( _acuerdo transaccional_ ) in
respect of the Third Party Claim with the prior written consent of the
Sellers, not to be unreasonably withheld, and (y) the Sellers (as appropriate
in each case) shall only be entitled to reach a settlement agreement (
_acuerdo transaccional_ ) in respect of the Third Party Claim with the prior
written consent of the Purchaser, not to be unreasonably withheld.

 



 

In case the defense against the Third Party Claim is conducted by the
Companies and/or the Purchaser, the Sellers will be given access to all the
documents received or delivered by the Companies and/or the Purchaser and
reasonably requested by the Sellers in connection with such Third Party Claim.

 



 

If the defense against the Third Party Claim is conducted by the Sellers the
Purchaser will be given access to all the documents received or delivered by
the Sellers and reasonably requested by the Purchaser in connection with such
Third Party Claim.

 



 

(e) If the Third Party Claim to which any of the Sellers object in accordance
with the provisions of this Section 8.2 is eventually resolved (i) by a final
judicial judgment ( _sentencia judicial firme_ ) or a final arbitration award
( _laudo arbitral firme_ ) in favor of the third party claimant, or (ii) by a
binding settlement ( _acuerdo transaccional_ ) as a result of which the third
party claimant is paid any amount, such objecting Sellers shall promptly pay
the Damages deriving from the Third Party Claim in cash after applying the
rules set forth in the foregoing Section 7\. The payment will be made within
ten (10) days of the date of said judgment, award or settlement.

 



 

If and to the extent the Sellers control the defense of any Third Party
Claim, and such Third Party Claim is dismissed and the third party claimant is
ordered to pay to the Companies and/to the Purchaser fees or costs of any
nature in respect of such proceedings, such amounts, if delivered, shall be
immediately reimbursed to the Sellers in the Pro Rata Share.

 



 

(f) Nothing in this Section 8.2 shall be deemed to require the Sellers to act
jointly ( _mancomunadamente_ ) in accepting or rejecting any Third Party Claim
(but may otherwise require the Sellers to act jointly ( _mancomunadamente_ )
in accordance with its terms) so that, for example, if one of the Sellers
accepts the Third Party Claim within the term set out in paragraph (b), such
Seller will pay Damages calculated in accordance with Section 7 to the
Purchaser within ten (10) days following the date on which the term set out in
paragraph (b) expires and the remaining provisions of this Section 8.2 shall
apply to the remaining Sellers.

 



      
 

 



 

8.3 Effect of Seller Acceptance; Effected Sellers

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
the acceptance (or payment) by any or some portion of the Sellers of any claim
by Purchaser or any member of the Purchaser Group for indemnification or
repayment of any Damages pursuant to Section 7 shall not relieve, reduce or
otherwise affect the obligations (for payment or otherwise) or liability of
any other Sellers pursuant to Sections 7 and 8 hereof (or otherwise under this
Agreement) in respect of such claim, Damages or the underlying facts and
circumstances giving rise thereto, and the remaining provisions of Section 8.1
and Section 8.2 shall apply to those other Sellers.

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
the rights and obligations of the Sellers pursuant to this Section 8 in
respect of any claim (including any Third Party Claim), shall exclusively
refer, in each place, solely to those Sellers who may be liable for Damages
pursuant to such claim (including any Third Party Claim), subject in all
situations to such references (i) including any Seller who becomes potentially
liable for such Damages and (ii) excluding any Seller upon such Seller either
(x) accepting such claim and making payment in full to the Purchaser or such
other members of the Purchaser Group, as applicable, as required by Section 7
and 8 of this Agreement, or (y) ceasing to be potentially liable for such
Damages (provided that such Seller may become a "Seller" for purposes of this
Section 8 in respect of such a claim (including any Third Party Claim)
pursuant to subclause (x) above).

Closing with respect to Damages in connection with any actual or threatened
action, suit, claim, proceeding or investigation (each a " **D andO Claim**") to
the extent that any such DandO Claim is based on, or arises out of the fact that
such DandO Beneficiary is or was a director or officer of any of the Companies
at any time prior to the Closing, solely to the extent that any such DandO Claim
pertains to any matter or fact arising, existing or occurring prior to or at
the Closing, regardless of whether such DandO Claim is asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Closing. The provisions of this Section 10 are intended to
be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each such DandO Beneficiary
and such Persons estate, heirs and representatives and are in addition to,
and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such Person may have pursuant to law, the organizational

11.1 All information (i) regarding the Parties which is or has been provided
by one Party to the other Parties, whether in writing, verbally or by any
other means, and whether before or after signature of this Agreement, and (ii)
regarding the Companies (including their operations, results of operations and
prospects) must be maintained in confidence (x) in the case of clause (i)
above, by such other Parties, and (y) in the case of clause (ii) above, by the
Sellers, except in the following cases:

 



 

(a) when disclosure of the confidential information is required from a Party,
its parent company or any entity in the Partys Group by Law or by requirement
or recommendation of a Governmental Authority, provided that it previously
informs the other Parties and takes all reasonable action, at the expense of
such other Parties, to keep such confidential information confidential and
subject to a protective order or similar protection;

 



 

(b) solely in the case of clause (i) above, when the confidential information
is disclosed to directors, partners, managers, stockholders, members,

stockholders, members, employees, consultants or advisers covenant to keep the

(c) solely in the case of clause (i) above, when the confidential information
is disclosed to directors, executives, employees, advisers or auditors of
third parties in relation to transactions and operations of a corporate nature

limited partnership agreement, management agreement or any other similar
agreement to which the Investor Seller or any Affiliate of such Investor

11.2 Any communication addressed to third parties relating to this Agreement
(or to the transactions covered herein) which is not based on a demand or

due date, interest shall automatically accrue thereon from such payment due

demand or notice being necessary. The applicable annual interest rate in such
case shall be equal to four percent (4%).

 



 

12.2 Any default interest so accrued shall be considered due and payable
within five (5) Business Days of accrual, shall be compounded monthly and
shall bear default interest as soon as it is compounded.

 



 

12.3 Such default interest shall be paid at the time of payment, in whole or

(ii) execute and deliver all instruments and documents of every kind
incidental to the foregoing with the same effect as if such Idinvest Party had

its name in the second column of **_Schedule 17.1.1_** (the " **Parent Lock-up
Shares** ") until the periods set forth in the third column of such Schedule

the " **Lock-up Periods** ").

 



 

Once the applicable Lock-up Periods have elapsed, each Investor Seller shall
be entitled to transfer all or part of the relevant Parent Lock-Up Shares in
its sole and absolute discretion.

 



 

17.1.2 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each Investor
Seller shall be entitled to sell all or part of its Parent Lock-up Shares (in
each Investor Sellers sole and absolute discretion) before the expiration of
the relevant Lock-Up Periods in any of the following cases:

Agreement; (y) the transferee (the " **Initial Investor Transferee** ") shall
retransfer its Parent Lock-Up Shares to the Investor Transferor (or to any
other Group company of the Investor Transferor) if it ceases to be a member of
the Group of the Initial Transferor and (z) as a condition to any transfer of
Parent Lock-Up Shares permitted by this Section 17.1.2(i), the Investor
Transferor shall procure that the Investor Transferee enters into a deed of

(ii) in the case of any tender offer for the shares of the Parent (whether

the Parent) or in connection with a delisting (without any reasonably
contemporaneous re-listing on the same or a different exchange) of the Parent
Shares or a third party acquisition or other third party business combination
transaction involving the Parent.

 



 

17.2 Founding Sellers Lock-up

 



 

Each Founding Seller hereby agrees not to transfer any Parent Founder Shares
until the third year anniversary of the date hereof (the " **Founding Sellers
Lock-Up** ").

 



 

If before the expiration of the Founding Sellers Lock-Up:

 



 

(i) any of the Founding Sellers is a Bad Leaver, then (i) the Parent Founder
Shares issued to such Founding Seller shall be immediately forfeited and
deemed transferred to an entity designated by the Purchaser for no
consideration, and (ii) such Founding Seller shall immediately transfer such
Parent Founder Shares back to an entity designated by the Purchaser pursuant
to and in compliance with all applicable securities Laws and the requirements
of any exchange or Governmental Authority and take all actions and
complete/execute all documents as reasonably requested by the Purchaser to
effect such transfer; and,

 



 

(ii) at least two (2) of the Founding Sellers are a Bad Leaver, then all the
Parent Founder Shares issued to all the Founding Sellers (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Founding Seller which is not a Bad Leaver) shall be
(i) immediately forfeited and deemed transferred to an entity designated by
the Purchaser for no consideration, (ii) each Founding Seller shall
immediately transfer such Parent Founder Shares back to an entity designated
by the Purchaser pursuant to and in compliance with all applicable securities
Laws and the requirements of any exchange or Governmental Authority and take
all actions and complete/execute all documents as reasonably requested by the
Purchaser to effect such transfer.

 



      
 

 



 

Furthermore, if before the expiration of the Founding Sellers Lock-Up (x) any
tender offer for at least a majority of the shares of the Parent is launched
(whether such tender offer is supported or not supported by the Board of
Directors of the Parent) and successfully consummated; (y) a delisting
(without any reasonably contemporaneous re-listing on the same or a similar
exchange) of the Parent Shares occurs or (z) there is a third party
acquisition of or other third party business combination transaction involving
the Parent, whereby the shareholders of Parent prior to the transaction cease
to own at least a majority of the outstanding equity interests of the
surviving entity following the transaction, then, in any of such events
(jointly, a **"Parent Corporate Event"** ) the Founding Sellers shall not be
released from the Founding Sellers Lock-Up but, upon expiration of the period
of the Founding Sellers Lock-Up, (i) in the case of clause (x) or (y), each
Founding Seller, in his sole discretion, shall be entitled to transfer all or
part of their Parent Founder Shares to the Parent for a consideration equal to
the consideration (cash and/or shares and/or any other form of consideration)
that they would have been entitled to receive if the Parent Founder Shares
would not have been subject to the Founding Sellers Lock-Up at the time the
corresponding Parent Corporate Event was consummated and (ii) in the case of
clause (z), such Parent Founder Shares shall be cancelled and automatically
converted into the consideration (cash and/or shares and/or any other form of
consideration) that they would have been entitled to receive if the Parent
Founder Shares would not have been subject to the Founding Sellers Lock-Up at
the time the corresponding Parent Corporate Event was consummated.

 



 

17.3 Founding Sellers Non-Competition

 



 

During the two (2) years from the date in which the relevant Founding Seller
ceases to render services to any Parent Group company (the " **Non-Competition
Period** "), such Founding Seller undertakes, whether as principal, manager,
employee, agent, consultant, independent contractor, officer, shareholder,
director, partner, debt or equity investor or owner (other than a passive
ownership or investment position of less than one percent (1%) of the
outstanding equity or voting interests in any company whose shares are
publicly traded, as long as such Founding Seller does not participate in the
management, direction or operations of any such publicly held Person), by
himself or through, for or on behalf of or in conjunction with any other
Person, including any Affiliates or Representatives (Founding Sellers,
together with any such Persons, the " **Restricted Parties** "), to refrain
from:

 



 

(i) promoting, engaging or holding interests in any business that is
competitive with the Business, except that the Founding Sellers may own voting
securities of the Parent;

 



 

(ii) entering into an employment, commercial, advisory, administration or
other service or professional relationship with Persons which compete with the
Business (other than the Parent Group); or otherwise working for, or

 



      
 

 



 

accepting a position in any such Persons, and from managing or representing
such Persons, whether or not for remuneration; and

 



 

(iii) using, registering or applying for domain names, denominations,
trademarks, logotypes, commercial names, or any other type of distinctive sign
identical or confusingly similar to those used by the Companies, the Parent or
the Parent Group.

 



 

17.4 Employee Non-Solicitation

 



 

In exchange for the benefits that will be obtained as a result of the

agreement or similar agreement with the Company and/or among all or certain of
the shareholders of the Company (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Existing Shareholders Agreement), any commercial arrangement or other
agreement between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and

Person or entity claiming by, through or under any of the foregoing to,
irrevocably and unconditionally release, acquit, waive and forever discharge
the Released Parties from, and covenant not to sue the Released Parties with
respect to, any and all Claims, in each case, effective as of, and contingent
upon the occurrence of, the Closing; provided that the foregoing is not a
release, or waiver of, any claims by such Seller (or such Sellers Affiliates,
Representatives, successors, heirs, beneficiaries, assigns and any other
Person with a right to claim by, through or under any of the foregoing)

related to the matters described in clause (i) of this Section 18.4, with
respect to any counterclaim against any such Released Party directly relating
to such Claim or the facts and circumstances underlying such Claim.

with the operations herein described, and that there are no side agreements or
additional agreements entered into by any of the Parties in connection hereto.

In the event of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement being
declared null and void, the remaining terms and conditions of this Agreement
shall remain in force without being affected by the said declaration of
nullity. The Parties shall consult and use their best efforts to agree upon a
valid and enforceable provision which shall be a reasonable substitute for

this Agreement.

Parties.

exercise thereof or the exercise of any other such right, power or privilege.

The Parent hereby expressly, irrevocably, jointly and severally, absolutely

de orden_ ) in respect of its obligations under this Section 22 and agrees to
be treated as a co-debtor with the Purchaser for all purposes. Consequently,
the Sellers shall be entitled to make, at their sole discretion, a claim
against the Purchaser or the Parent or against both of them simultaneously,
without first proceeding against, claiming payment from, or pursuing any other
remedy whatsoever against either of them.

the ICC in accordance with its regulations. The arbitration shall take place
in Barcelona (Spain) and shall be conducted in English.

 



 

23.4 The decision of the arbitrators must be issued within a maximum term of
three (3) months from the date the arbitrators have accepted its appointment.

 ** _Annex 1.1_**

 



 

 **Exclusions from the definition of Damages**

 



 

The following concepts are excluded from the definition of Damage and the
Sellers shall therefore not be subject to any liability in respect thereof:

 



 

(a) Any indirect damages ( _da ños indirectos_), any loss of profit or income
( _lucro cesante_ ), moral or reputational damages ( _da ños morales o de
imagen_), in each case to the extent not reasonably foreseeable, or any form
of punitive or exemplary damages whether actual or prospective;

 



 

(b) damages which are contingent only or otherwise not capable of being
quantified, unless and until such damages become quantifiable or give rise to
an actual loss, liability, payment or cash out of the Purchaser or the
Companies or any member of the Purchaser Group;

 



 

(c) damages that are actually recovered by the Buying Parties or the Companies
under insurance policies which the Buying Parties or the Companies have in
place, or from any other third party with indemnification obligations or from
any other Person subject to liability in respect thereof, in each case net of
any deductible, costs of collection or other limitations adverse to the
Purchaser or the Companies or any member of the Purchaser Group;

 



 

(d) damages solely to the extent attributable to (i) any act, omission,
transaction, arrangement or filing carried out by the Buying Parties or any of
the Companies after the date hereof (including any act, omission, transaction
or arrangement resulting in the interruption of any Tax or other statute of
limitations); (ii) a cessation, or any change in the nature or conduct, of any
business carried out by the Companies after the date hereof; (iii) any Third
Party Claim in respect of which the Purchaser has not materially complied with
its obligations under Section 8.2, including any admission of liability made
after the date hereof by the Purchaser, the Companies or their respective
agents or representatives (excluding the Sellers or their representatives);
(iv) any changes in Law or any change in the interpretation thereof; (v) any
change in accounting or taxation policies of the Purchaser or the Companies
after the date hereof;

 



 

(e) damages which are, and solely to the extent so, remedied by the Sellers to
the reasonable satisfaction of the Purchaser. No damage shall be considered a
Damage to the extent that the Purchaser has not used (or caused the Companies
to use) all reasonable efforts required by Applicable Law to mitigate the
scope and extent of the damages incurred;

 



 

(f) damages which were, and solely to the extent, accrued for on the Financial
Statements or in the Management Accounts. In this respect, in calculating the
amount of any Damages suffered by the Purchaser or the Companies, any excess

      
 

 



 

of accounting provisions or reserves in the Financial Statements or in the
Management Accounts which are unnecessary or greater than the amount of the
item in respect of which it is provided or reserved shall have no effect on
the amount of Damages;

 



 

(g) damages which (i) have not been resolved in writing by the Sellers and the
Purchaser or (ii) are not the subject of a final and binding court or
arbitration resolution which declares the Sellers obligation to indemnify the
Purchaser therefor under this Agreement; and

 



 

(h) damages solely to the extent arising from, based on or otherwise related
to facts or circumstances comprised within the Purchasers Knowledge other
than in respect of Pre-Closing Tax Liabilities or the Seller Representations
and Warranties set forth in clause 12 of Annex 5.2.

payment, charge, cost or expense takes place or is incurred, in each case

3.7 _Earn-Out_

 



 

3.7.1 FY 2017 Earn-Out

 



 

If EBITDA of the Company for the FY 2017 is greater than the FY 2017 Target
EBITDA, then the Founding Sellers (and not, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Investor Sellers) shall be entitled to receive the FY 2017 Earn-Out Payment
for the amount resulting from the following formula:

 



 

N = (E-the FY 2017 Target EBITDA) x 4.5, if and only if, N < the Earn-Out
Payment Maximum or in all other instances N shall equal the Earn-Out Payment
Maximum

 



 

Where "N" is the aggregate amount of the FY 2017 Earn-Out Payment payable to
the Founding Sellers and "E" is the EBITDA for the FY 2017. The FY 2017 Earn-
Out Payment, if any, shall be allocated among the Founding Sellers in the
Founder Proportion. For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the FY 2017 Earn-Out Payment payable to the Founding
Sellers equals "N" only so long as "N" does not exceed the Earn-Out Payment
Maximum; and if "N" does exceed such amount, then (i) "N" shall be deemed to
equal the Earn-Out Payment Maximum for all purposes hereunder, and (ii) no
amount shall be payable pursuant to Section 3.7.2 of this Annex 3.7.

 



 

3.7.2 FY 2018 Earn-Out Payment

 



 

If EBITDA of the Company for the FY 2018 is greater than the FY 2018 Target
EBITDA, then the Founding Sellers (and not, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Investor Sellers) shall be entitled to receive the FY 2018 Earn-Out Payment
for the amount resulting from the following formula:

 



 

X = (E-the FY 2018 Target EBITDA) x 4.5, subject to adjustment as described
below

 



 

Where "X" is the aggregate amount of the FY 2018 Earn-Out Payment payable to
the Founding Sellers and "E" is the EBITDA for the FY 2018. The FY 2018 Earn-
Out Payment, if any, shall be allocated among the Founding Sellers in the

      
 

 



 

Founder Proportion. For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the FY 2018 Earn-Out Payment payable to the Founding
Sellers equals "X" only so long as "X" plus "N" does not exceed the Earn-Out
Payment Maximum; and if "X" plus "N" does exceed such amount, then the
aggregate FY 2018 Earn-Out Payment shall be deemed to equal the Earn-Out
Payment Maximum minus "N" for all purposes hereunder.

 



 

3.7.3 Maximum amount of the Earn-Out Payment

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, the FY 2017 Earn-Out Payment and the FY 2018 Earn-
Out Payment shall not exceed, individually or in the aggregate, the Earn-Out
Payment Maximum.

 



 

3.7.4 Determination of the Earn-Out Payment

 



 

No later than sixty (60) days after the end of each of the FY 2017 and the FY
2018 (in respect of the FY 2017 Earn-Out Payment and the FY 2018 Earn-Out
Payment, respectively), the Purchaser shall deliver to the Founding Sellers
its good faith determination of the EBITDA for the FY 2017 and of the EBITDA
for the FY 2018, including the supporting documentation of such determination
(the " **Purchaser EBITDA Determination** ").

 



 

The Founding Sellers shall have thirty (30) days to review the Purchaser
EBITDA Determination after the Purchaser EBITDA Determination (and necessary
supporting documentation) has been provided by the Purchaser (the " **EBITDA
Review Period** "). The Founding Sellers will accept the Purchaser EBITDA
Determination if (i) the Founding Sellers so confirm in writing in accordance
with Section 9 of the Agreement to the Purchaser before the expiration of the
EBITDA Review Period or (ii) after the expiration of the EBITDA Review Period
the Founding Sellers have not rejected in accordance with Section 9 the
Purchaser EBITDA Determination.

 



 

If the Founding Sellers reject the Purchaser EBITDA Determination (such
rejection to include the grounds for it and a determination of the adjustment
that the Founding Sellers believe that should be made), the Founding Sellers
and the Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith during a period of thirty (30)
days to try to reach an agreement as to the determination of the EBITDA for
the FY 2017 and/or the EBITDA for the FY 2018 for the purposes of this
Section.

 



 

If the Founding Sellers and the Purchaser reach an agreement during the period
mentioned in the immediately preceding paragraph, the EBITDA for the FY 2017
and/or the EBITDA for the FY 2018 (as applicable) shall be determined in the
terms agreed by the Founding Sellers and the Purchaser and in accordance with
them.

 



 

If after the aforementioned negotiation period the Founding Sellers and the

      
 

 



 

Purchaser are unable to reach an agreement as to the determination of the
EBITDA for the FY 2017 and/or the EBITDA for the FY 2018 (as applicable), the
determination of such magnitudes shall be entrusted by the Founding Sellers
and the Purchaser to any of Deloitte, KPMG or PWC (in the interest of the
Founding Sellers and the Purchaser) appointed by mutual agreement of the
Founding Sellers and the Purchaser and, failing such agreement within ten (10)
days, by a drawing lot (the entity so determined, the " **EBITDA Expert** ").
The statutory auditor of any Buying Party and the Companies shall be excluded
and shall not be selected to act as EBITDA Expert.

 



 

The EBITDA Expert shall issue its report within thirty (30) days from the date
of its appointment and submit a draft of such report to the Founding Sellers
and the Purchaser before being issued. The EBITDA Expert shall receive the
comments that the Founding Sellers and the Purchaser may deem convenient but,
for the avoidance of doubt, the EBITDA Expert shall not be bound by any of
such comments. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to provide to the
EBITDA Expert any supporting documentation that it requires and, specifically,
the Purchaser shall cause the Companies to provide such documentation to the
EBITDA Expert.

 



 

The EBITDA Expert shall determine, based solely on the materials presented to
it and upon information received in response to requests for additional or
clarifying information from the Founding Sellers or the Purchaser, as
applicable, and not by independent review, only those issues in dispute
specifically identified by the Founding Sellers.

 



 

The determination of the EBITDA for the FY 2017 and/or the EBITDA for the FY
2018 (as applicable) made by the EBITDA Expert shall (i) not assign a value to
any item higher than the highest value for such item claimed by either party
or less than the lowest value for such item claimed by either party, and (ii)
be final and binding on the Founding Sellers and the Purchaser.

 



 

The fees of the EBITDA Expert shall be borne by the Founding Sellers in the
Founders Proportion if the determination of the relevant EBITDA (i.e., 2017
EBITDA or 2018 EBITDA) made by the EBITDA Expert is closer to the Purchaser
EBITDA Determination than it is to the determination of the EBITDA made by the
Founding Sellers. If the determination of the EBITDA made by the EBITDA Expert
is closer to the EBITDA determination made by the Founding Sellers than to the
Purchaser EBITDA Determination, the fees of the EBITDA Expert shall be borne
by the Purchaser.

 



 

3.7.5 Payment of the Earn-Out Payment

 



 

An amount equal to 70% of the corresponding Earn-Out Payment (i.e., FY 2017
Earn-Out Payment or FY 2018 Earn-Out Payment, as applicable) (rounded up such
that the value of the payments made pursuant to this Section 3.7.5 equal in

      
 

 



 

value the corresponding Earn-Out Payment) shall be paid by the Purchaser to
the Founding Sellers within five (5) Business Days from its determination in
accordance with Section 3.7.4 of this Annex 3.7 in cash by electronic bank
transfer of immediately available funds and without deduction for any charge,
commission or other item of any nature, directly to the Payment Account of
each Founding Seller or as otherwise may be notified to the Purchaser pursuant
to Section 9 of the Agreement.

 



 

An amount equal to 30% of the corresponding Earn-Out Payment shall by paid by
the Purchaser through the issuance and delivery to the Founding Sellers,
within five (5) Business Days from the final determination of the Earn-Out
Payment, of a number of Parent Shares calculated as follows:

 



 

Z = A / FMV

 



 

Where

 



 

"Z" is the number of Parent Shares to be issued to the Founding Sellers under
this Section (which number shall be allocated among the Founding Sellers in
the Founder Proportion and which such number of Parent Shares issued to each
Founding Seller shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share);

 



 

"A" is an amount equal to 30% of the FY 2017 Earn-Out Payment or the FY 2018
Earn-Out Payment (as applicable); and

 



 

"FMV" for each Parent Share equals the trailing thirty (30) day average
Closing Parent Share Price for the period prior to the date of issuance.

 



 

Such Parent Shares shall be issued (x) without any charge, commission, fee or
other item of any nature payable by the Founding Sellers and (y) free from
Charges and Encumbrances (other than Permitted Charges and Encumbrances and
any transfer restrictions imposed by applicable securities Law).

 



 

Any Parent Shares delivered to the Founding Sellers under this Section 3.7.5
shall not be subject to any restriction on its transfer (including, in
particular, the restrictions set forth in Section 17 of the Agreement), other
than any transfer restrictions imposed by applicable securities Law, and, for
the avoidance of doubt, the obligation of the Purchaser and the Parent to
issue and deliver such Parent Shares is an unconditional obligation not
subject to any (or all) of the Founding Sellers being or not being a Leaver by
any reason whatsoever at the time of issuance of the Parent Shares.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the aggregate number of
Parent Shares to be delivered to the Founding Sellers under this Section 3.7.5
shall, when taken together with all other Parent Shares delivered pursuant to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby exceed nineteen and
ninety-nine one-

      
 

 



 

hundredths percent (19.99%) of the total outstanding number of Parent Shares
as of either (x) the day hereof or (y) the applicable date of determination of
such number of shares to be delivered (such amount, the " ** _Parent Share
Cap_** "), the Founding Sellers shall receive, in lieu of such number of
Parent Shares as required to bring the total number of Parent Shares so
delivered less than the Parent Share Cap, cash equal to the FMV of such
shares, with such reduction in the number of shares to be delivered determined
on a pro rata basis amongst the Founding Sellers in accordance with each such
Founding Sellers Founder Proportion.

      
 

 



 

 ** _Annex 5.1_**

 



 

 **Sellers  Fundamental Representations and Warranties**

 



 

 **1.** **Existence and capacity. No conflict.**

 



 

1.1 Each Seller has full power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and each other agreement contemplated hereby to which it is a party,
to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement and each agreement contemplated by this Agreement to which it

of, or registration, qualification, designation, declaration or filing with,
any domestic or foreign governmental, regulatory or administrative authority,

required in connection with its execution of this Agreement and any other
agreement referred to herein to which it is a party, or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this

      
 

 



 

Agreement or by such other agreements.

 



 

 **2.** **Ownership of the Shares. Absence of Charges and Encumbrances.**

 



 

2.1 Each Seller is the sole lawful owner of the Shares detailed for such
Seller in **_Schedule III_**.

 



 

2.2 The Shares owned by such Seller are free and clear from all Charges and
Encumbrances (other than Permitted Charges and Encumbrances) and all the
Shares owned by each Seller have been fully paid in.

 



 

2.3 Upon the granting, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, of
the Deed of Sale and Purchase and payment for the Shares, the Purchaser shall
acquire good and valid title to such Shares, free and clear of any Charge and
Encumbrance (other than Permitted Charges and Encumbrances).

 



 

2.4 The transactions whereby each Seller has acquired the Shares are legal and
valid and no claim has been filed against such Seller in connection therewith.

 



 

2.5 Immediately before the Closing neither the Seller nor any of its
Affiliates is a party to any agreement, contract, arrangement or understanding
with any of the Companies. As a sole exception to the foregoing
representation:

 



 

(a) Mr. Horacio Martos Borja (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not any other
Seller other than himself) represents and warrants that he is solely a party
to that certain services agreement executed by the Company, on the one side,
and him, on the other, on November 7, 2016;

 



 

(b) Mr. Andres Bou Ortiz (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not any other

and him, on the other, on November 7, 2016; and,

 



 

(c) Mr. Marc Canaleta Caupena (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not any other
Seller other than himself) represents and warrants that he is a party to the
existing employment agreement executed by the Company, on the one side, and
him, on the other.

 



 

 **3.** **Securities Laws; Investment**

 



 

3.1 Each Seller is receiving the shares of Parent Common Stock as provided
under the terms of the Agreement for investment for its own account and not
with a view to, or for resale in connection with, the distribution or other
disposition thereof.

 



 

3.2 Each Seller has been given the opportunity to obtain any information or
other documents which he, she or it deems necessary to evaluate the merits and
risks related to his, her or its investment in the shares of Parent Common
Stock, and

      
 

 



 

such Sellers knowledge and experience in financial and business matters are
such that such Seller is capable of evaluating the capital structure of Parent
and its subsidiaries, the business of Parent and its subsidiaries (including
the Purchaser) and the merits and risks of owning the shares of Parent Common
Stock.

 



 

3.3 Each Sellers financial condition is such that such Seller can afford to
bear the economic risk of holding the shares of Parent Common Stock for an
indefinite period of time and has adequate means for providing for his, her or
its current needs and contingencies and to suffer a complete loss of his, her
or its investment in the shares of Parent Common Stock. Such Sellers overall
commitment to investments which are not readily marketable is not
disproportionate to its net worth. Such Sellers investment in the shares of
Parent Common Stock will not cause such overall commitment to become
excessive.

 



 

3.4 Each Seller has had an opportunity to consult independent tax and legal
advisors, and such Sellers decision to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby has been based solely upon such Sellers evaluation. Such
Seller is not relying on any statements made by Parent, the Purchaser or any
of their respective Affiliates, members, directors, officers, managers,
attorneys, employees, agents or other professional advisors in connection with
its decision to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, other than as
set forth in this Agreement or as expressly provided in the other agreements
delivered in connection with this Agreement.

 



 

3.5 Each Seller understands that, other than pursuant to an exemption from
registration under the Securities Act or in connection with a registration
thereunder, substantial restrictions exist on transferability of the shares of
Parent Common Stock and any portion thereof and that such Seller may not be
able to liquidate its investment in the shares of Parent Common Stock. Such
Seller understands that any instruments representing the shares of Parent
Common Stock may bear legends restricting the transfer thereof. Such Seller
has been advised that an investment in the shares of Parent Common Stock is
speculative and is subject to a number of risks (including the risk that
Parent, the Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates will
not generate any profits and the other risks set forth in the SEC Documents),
and should be considered only by Persons who are able to sustain a complete
loss of their investment and to hold the shares of Parent Common Stock for a
significant and indefinite period of time.

 



 

 **4.** **Accredited Investor; Citizenship**

 



 

4.1 Each Seller is an accredited investor as defined in Rule 501(a) of
Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.

 



 

4.2 Each Seller is a citizen solely of those nations set forth opposite its
name on **_Schedule 1.1 (ter)_** and is not a citizen or resident (permanent
or otherwise) of the United States of America.

      
 

 



 

 **5.** **Sanctioned Person**

 



 

5.1 Such Seller is not, and is not controlled by, owned by, or acting on
behalf of (i) any national of or entity operating in or organized under the
laws of Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Sudan, or other countries that are
subject to comprehensive U.S. foreign assets control regulations that prohibit
or require prior U.S. government licensing for transactions involving persons
under U.S. jurisdiction; (ii) any Person designated on the OFAC list of
"Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons" or on any list of
targeted Persons issued under any Economic Sanctions Law; (iii) any Person or
entity designated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury as a financial
institution of primary money laundering concern, or (iv) any Person otherwise
prohibited from engaging in financial transactions with U.S. persons.

is (A) generally available to the public on the date hereof (e.g. "shrink
wrap" licenses); and (B) licensed for an annual fee of less than USD 10,000
annually; (ii) all material computer software owned, or purported to be owned
by the Companies (the " **Proprietary Software** "); and (iii) social media
accounts, that are owned by or licensed to the Companies (the " **Companies
Intellectual Property** "). The Companies are up to date with the payments of
the corresponding fees due to the Spanish Office of Patents and Trademarks or
other intellectual or industrial property competent public bodies or other
registration entities in connection with the Companies Intellectual Property.
The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
adversely alter or impair the Companies right in or to any Intellectual
Property Rights used by the Companies.

 



 

8.2 The Companies Intellectual Property is valid and subsisting and the
Companies are the exclusive owners of, and enjoy all rights of ownership with
respect to the Companies Intellectual Property, free and clear of any Charges
and

      
 

 



 

Encumbrances, and no royalties, honoraria or fees are payable by the Companies
to other Persons by reason of the ownership or use of the Companies
Intellectual Property. The Companies Intellectual Property comprises all
rights necessary to operate the business of the Companies as presently
conducted. To the Founding Sellers knowledge, no employee or outside
contractor of the Companies has misappropriated any trade secrets or other
confidential information of any other Person in the course of the performance
of his or her duties as an employee or outside contractor of the Companies.

 



 

8.3 The operation of the business by the Companies as presently conducted is
not infringing any Intellectual Property Rights of any third party. The
Companies have not received any threat, demand or notice of claim that remains
unsettled from any Person, whether in writing or otherwise, asserting that the
Companies use, manufacture, importation or sale of products constitutes any
infringement, interference, violation, misappropriation, breach or wrongful
use of the Intellectual Property Rights of any other Person. To the Founding
Sellers knowledge, no third party is infringing the Company Intellectual
Property.

 



 

8.4 The Companies are not a party to any proceeding or outstanding decree,
order, Judgment, agreement or stipulation restricting in any manner the use,
transfer, or licensing by the Companies of any Intellectual Property Rights
necessary to conduct their business as presently conducted, or which may
affect the validity, use or enforceability of the Companies Intellectual
Property. To the Founding Sellers knowledge, the Companies have not been named
in any suit, action or proceeding which involves a claim of infringement,
misappropriation or violation of any Intellectual Property Rights of any third
party.

 



 

8.5 The Companies have taken all reasonable steps (including, without
limitation, entering into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements and
work for hire or intellectual property assignment agreements with all officers
and employees of, and consultants to, the Companies with access to or
knowledge of any Intellectual Property Rights) necessary to establish
ownership in the Companies of all Companies Intellectual Property and to
safeguard and maintain the secrecy and confidentiality of all trade secrets
comprising the Companies Intellectual Property. All programs, modifications,
enhancements or other inventions, improvements, discoveries, methods or works
of authorship that were created by any employee of the Companies were made in
the regular course of such employees employment or service relationships with
the Companies and, as such, constitute "works made for hire" in those
jurisdictions that recognize this legal concept or principle. No present or
former employee, officer, director, agent, outside contractor or consultant of
the Companies holds any right, title or interest, directly or indirectly, in
whole or in part, in or to any Company Intellectual Property.

 



 

8.6 Neither the Companies nor (to the Founding Sellers knowledge) any other
Person acting on behalf of the Companies, have disclosed or delivered to any

      
 

 



 

other Person, or permitted the disclosure or delivery from any escrow agent or
other Person, of any source code of the Proprietary Software. The Companies
maintain (i) machine readable copies of the Proprietary Software, and (ii)
reasonably complete technical documentation or user manuals for material
releases or versions thereof currently in use by the Companies, currently made
available to the Companies customers, or currently supported by the
Companies. The Companies maintain at least one copy of the source code of the
Proprietary Software, and such code is maintained under strict confidentiality
and in accordance with appropriate industry-standard safekeeping for
proprietary source code taking into account the size and resources of the
Company.

 



 

8.7 The computer software, computer hardware, firmware, networks, interfaces
and related systems (collectively, " **Computer Systems** ") used by the
Companies are sufficient in all material respects for such Companies current
needs in the operation of the business of the Companies as presently
conducted, and, to the Founding Sellers knowledge, in the past twelve (12)
months there have been no material failures, crashes, security breaches or
other adverse events affecting the Computer Systems which have caused material
disruption to the business of the Companies. The Companies provide for the
back-up and recovery of material data and have implemented disaster recovery
plans and, as applicable, have taken all reasonable steps to implement such
plans. The Companies have taken reasonable actions to protect the integrity
and security of the Computer Systems and the information stored therein from
unauthorized use, access, or modification by third parties.

 



 

8.8 The Proprietary Software does not contain any computer code or any other
mechanisms which may (i) disrupt, disable, erase or harm in any way such
Proprietary Softwares operation, or cause the Proprietary Software to damage
or corrupt any data, hardware, storage media, programs, equipment or
communications, or (ii) permit any Person to access the Proprietary Software
without authorization. The Proprietary Software complies with any applicable
warranty or contractual commitment relating to the use, functionality, or
performance of the Proprietary Software, and there are no pending or
threatened claims alleging any such failure. There exist no technical problems
with any Proprietary Software that materially and adversely affect the
performance of such Proprietary Software or cause such products to fail to
substantially conform to their written specifications other than routine
software bugs and/or glitches that may be remedied in the ordinary course of
the business of the Companies.

 



 

8.9 None of the Proprietary Software contains, is derived from, or is
distributed, integrated, or bundled with software subject to any license
commonly referred to as a "copyleft" or "open source" license that, as used,
modified, integrated, bundled, or distributed by the Companies: (i) requires
or conditions the use or distribution of such Proprietary Software on the
disclosure, licensing or distribution of any source code for any portion of
the Proprietary Software; or

      
 

 



 

(ii) otherwise imposes an obligation on the Companies to distribute any
Proprietary Software on a royalty-free basis.
