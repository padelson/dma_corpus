 ARTICLE 2  

 EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE
CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS;  

 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES 

  

  2.1 _Manner of Converting Shares._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of capital stock of the Company or Merger Subsidiary, the shares of capital stock of the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall be converted or cancelled as follows: 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (a) Each issued and outstanding share of Company Common 
Stock, other than the Dissenting Shares, will be converted into  the
following (the " _Merger Consideration_ "):  
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (i) with respect to each share of Company Common Stock
not  constituting a Cash Share, the right to receive that number of  shares
of Buyer Common Stock equal to the sum of: (i) the  Tranche A Exchange Ratio
plus (ii) the Tranche B Exchange  Ratio; and  
      
      |   (ii) with respect to each share of Company Common Stock 
constituting a Cash Share, cash in an amount equal to the  quotient of $150
million (the " _Cash  Consideration_ ") divided by the number of Cash
Shares  issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time.  
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (b) Any Company Common Stock held by any Subsidiary of
the  Company, Buyer or its Subsidiaries will be automatically  cancelled and
cease to exist, and no stock or other  consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.  
      
      |   (c) Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary,
par  value $0.01 per share, will be converted into one share of  common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.  
    

  2.2 _Dissenting Shares._ Each outstanding share of Company Common Stock, the holder or beneficial owner of which has perfected such holder or beneficial owners right to dissent under Section 23-1-44-11 of the IBCL, and has not effectively withdrawn or lost that right as of the Effective Time (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive the Merger Consideration, and the holder thereof shall be entitled only to those rights as are granted by the IBCL. If, after the Effective Time, a holder or beneficial owner of Dissenting Shares fails to perfect, withdraws or loses the right to dissent, such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to be converted into, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1, without interest thereon, upon delivery of a share surrender certificate in the form of _Exhibit D_ (a " _Share Surrender Certificate_ ") representing Company Common Stock previously constituting Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Buyer (i) prompt notice upon receipt by the Company of any notice of intent to demand payment of the fair value of any shares of the Company Common Stock and of withdrawals of any such notice of intent and any other instruments provided pursuant to the IBCL and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to the exercise of dissenters rights under the IBCL. The Company shall not voluntarily make any payment with respect to any   ##### 

  

 exercise of dissenters rights and shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Buyer, settle or offer to settle any demand for fair value of
Dissenting Shares under the IBCL. Any payments made in respect of Dissenting
Shares shall be made by the Surviving Corporation. 

  

  2.3 _Exchange and Payment Procedures._ Upon delivery of a Share Surrender Certificate (other than a Share Surrender Certificate representing Dissenting Shares) to Buyer, Buyer will issue in the name of, and deliver to, the holder of such Share Surrender Certificate (each, a " _Holder_ ") (a) a certificate representing that number of shares of Buyer Common Stock into which the shares of the Company Common Stock previously represented by the Share Surrender Certificate are converted in accordance with Section 2.1(a)(i); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that 8,181,818 of such shares of Buyer Common Stock will be issued in the name of, and delivered to, the Escrow Agent to be held on behalf of the Holders (in proportion to their ownership of Company Common Stock, excluding Cash Shares and Dissenting Shares) and distributed by the Escrow Agent in accordance with an escrow agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit A-2 hereto (the " _Escrow Shares Escrow Agreement_ ") and Section 2.7 (with such shares being referred to as the " _Escrowed Shares_ "), and (b) if such Share Surrender Certificate represents Cash Shares, cash in the amount of the Cash Consideration to which such Holder is entitled in accordance with Section 2.1. If the Merger Consideration is to be delivered to any person other than the person in whose name the Share Surrender Certificate delivered in exchange therefor is registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be delivered to a transferee if the Share Surrender Certificate is presented to the Buyer, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect that transfer and by evidence reasonably satisfactory to Buyer that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until delivered as contemplated by this Section 2.3, the shares of Company Common Stock represented by each Share Surrender Certificate (other than a Share Surrender Certificate representing shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(b)) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon delivery the Merger Consideration contemplated by this Agreement. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable hereunder to holders of Company Common Stock.  

  2.4 _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares._ No dividends or other distributions declared or paid after the Effective Time with respect to Buyer Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the Shareholder of any undelivered Share Surrender Certificate with respect to the Buyer Common Stock represented until the holder of record of such Share Surrender Certificate shall deliver such Share Surrender Certificate. Subject to the effect of unclaimed property, escheat and other applicable laws, following delivery of any such Share Surrender Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Buyer Common Stock issued in exchange therefor (or the person who would be the record holder if fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock were issued in exchange therefor), without interest, (i) at the time of such delivery, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Buyer Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to delivery and a payment date subsequent to delivery payable with respect to such whole shares of Buyer Common Stock.  

  2.5 _No Further Ownership Rights in the Company Common Stock._ After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration or transfers of shares of Company Common Stock.  

  (a) The payment of the Merger Consideration to be made to Shareholders upon conversion of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to those shares of Company Common Stock.  

  (b) If, after the Effective Time, Share Surrender Certificates are presented to Buyer for any reason, the shares represented thereby shall be exchanged as provided in this Article 2.   ##### 

  

  2.6 _No Fractional Shares._   

  (a) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock shall be issued.  

  (b) After aggregating all fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock that otherwise would be issuable to a Shareholder at the Closing or the Final Distribution, any remaining fraction shall be rounded to the nearest whole share.  

  2.7 _Final Distribution._   

  (a) " _Final Average Price_ " means the average per-share closing price of a share of Buyer Common Stock, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape, rounded to the nearest whole dollar for the period of 15 consecutive trading days ending on the fifth day before the Final Pricing Date.  

  (b) If the Final Average Price is equal to or less than $55, then, on the Final Pricing Date, the Escrow Agent will cause certificates representing all of the Escrowed Shares to be delivered to, and issued in the name of, the Holder on behalf of which such Escrowed Shares were being held. If the Final Average Price is greater than $55, then, on the Final Pricing Date, the Escrow Agent will cause certificates representing the appropriate number of Escrowed Shares indicated on  _Exhibit E_ hereto to be delivered to Buyer and cause certificates representing the remaining Escrowed Shares, if any, to be delivered to, and issued in the name of, the Holder on behalf of which such Escrowed Shares were being held;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the distribution of shares to the Buyer will be done in such a manner so as not to alter the relative percentage of remaining Escrowed Shares to which each Holder is entitled.  

  (c) The Buyer will cooperate with the Escrow Agent, will deliver (or cause its transfer agent to deliver) such additional certificates representing shares of Buyer Common Stock issued in such names and amounts as the Escrow Agent may reasonably request, and take such other actions as the Escrow Agent may reasonably request in order to consummate the Final Distribution in accordance with this Section 2.7.  

  (d) To the extent that the Escrow Agent receives any dividends or distributions with respect to any given Escrowed Share, such dividends and distributions will be held by the Escrow Agent and distributed by the Escrow Agent to the party to which the Escrow Agent delivers such Escrowed Share.    

 ARTICLE 3  

 CLOSING; FINAL PRICING DATE  

  3.1 _Closing._ Subject the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the parties obligations to effect the Merger set forth in Article 9, the parties hereto shall cause the closing of the Merger and the payment of the Merger Consideration (the " _Closing_ ") to occur on January 3, 2003, or such other date as the Buyer and the Company may agree (the actual date of such closing being the " _Closing Date_ "). The distribution of the Escrowed Shares (the " _Final Distribution_ ") will occur on the Final Pricing Date. The " _Final Pricing Date_ " shall be the first business day that is thirty days after Buyer sends written notice to the Shareholders requesting that the Final Pricing Date occur; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Final Pricing Date must occur after the Closing Date and on or before December 15, 2003. The Closing and the Final Distribution shall occur at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the Closing Date and the Final Pricing Date, as the case may be, at the offices of Faegre and Benson LLP in Minneapolis, Minnesota, or at such other time and place as Buyer and the Company or the Shareholders, as the case may be, may agree.   ##### 

    

 ARTICLE 4  

 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY  

  Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, or as specifically disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Buyer pursuant to Section 8.5 (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ "), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Buyer as follows:  

  4.1 _Organization and Good Standing._ Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has all requisite corporate or similar powers and authority and possesses all franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations, consents, orders and approvals, and has made each registration, declaration or filing with any governmental authority or any other person, necessary to enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and assets and to conduct its businesses as currently conducted (except for any failure to possess a Permit or make a registration, declaration or filing that could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect). Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified to conduct business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except where the failure to be duly qualified or in good standing could not be reasonably expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has delivered to Buyer (or permitted Buyer to inspect) true and complete copies of the Articles of Incorporation of the Company as currently in effect, the Bylaws of the Company as currently in effect, and the comparable charter and organizational documents of each Subsidiary, in each case as currently in effect. " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means with respect to the Company or Buyer, as applicable, a material adverse effect upon the business, operations, results of operations, properties, or financial condition of that party and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, or on that partys ability to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby.  

  4.2 _Capital Stock._ The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 25 million Class C shares, 25 million Class N-D1 shares, 25 million Class L shares, 25 million Class L-D1 shares, 25 million Class L-D2 shares, 25 million Class L-D3 shares, and 669,445 Class E shares, all without par value. Of such authorized shares, as of the date of this Agreement, 10,000 Class C shares, 9,992,261.42 Class L shares, and 281,881.797 Class N-D1 shares are issued and outstanding. Section 4.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies for each series or class of Company Common Stock, the series or class of shares, each Shareholder of such shares and the percentage of the total issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock held by such Shareholder; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the parties agree that the Company may amend and update Section 4.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule from time to time prior to Closing to account for any changes caused by permitted issuances of or permitted transfers of Company Common Stock that occur after the date of this Agreement. The shares of Company Common Stock identified on Section 4.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule are the only issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company. Each share of the Company Common Stock is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and no shares of the Company Common Stock were issued in violation of the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company, any provision of law or any pre-emptive right of any person. No pre-emptive rights exist with respect to any equity interest of the Company. The shares of Company Common Stock identified on Section 4.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule represent each and every equity interest of any nature in the Company, and no person or entity of any nature holds, or is entitled to receive, any option (other than options to purchase such number of shares of Company Common Stock, issuable to such persons, and at such exercise prices as are set forth in Section 4.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule), warrant, convertible instrument or security, put, call, contract or commitment of any nature whereby any person or entity has or may receive any interest in or right to acquire any common stock of the Company or any other equity interest of any nature in the Company (other than as provided in this Agreement).  

  4.3 _Execution and Delivery._ This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and is a valid and binding obligation and agreement of the Company enforceable in accordance with its terms (except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, conservatorship, receivership, liquidation, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors rights generally). The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company (a) will not violate, contravene, result in a breach of or   ##### 

  

 constitute a default (with due notice or lapse of time or both) under the
Companys Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, or any note, mortgage,
contract, instrument, judgment, law, rule, regulation or decree to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or
their respective properties and assets are bound, and (b) will not afford
any lender the right to accelerate, declare at once due and payable or demand
prepayment of (or any penalty, charge or premium with respect to) any
indebtedness of the Company. The Company is not a party to (and has no
Knowledge of any threat of) any litigation or other claim or proceeding which
calls into question the validity or enforceability of this Agreement
or seeks to delay or prevent any transaction contemplated hereby. A party
will be deemed to have " _Knowledge_ " of a particular fact or other matter
if (A) one or more of the executive officers of the party is actually aware
of such fact or other matter or (B) a prudent individual could be expected
to discover or otherwise become aware of such fact or other matter in the
course of conducting a reasonably comprehensive investigation concerning the
existence of such fact or other matter. 

  

  4.4 _Subsidiaries; Equity Interests._ All the outstanding shares of stock of (and each other equity interest in) each corporation or other entity in which the Company holds (directly or indirectly) 50% or more of any class of stock or other equity interest (each a " _Subsidiary_ " and collectively, the " _Subsidiaries_ ") are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and, are owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company, free and clear of all liens of any kind or nature whatsoever. The name and jurisdiction of organization of each Subsidiary and its direct majority shareholder is identified in the Company Disclosure Schedule. All Subsidiaries are wholly owned either directly or indirectly by the Company.  

  4.5 _Consents._ No consent, approval, license, permit, order or authorization (" _Consent_ ") of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any federal, state, local or foreign government or any court of competent jurisdiction, administrative agency or commission or other governmental authority or instrumentality, domestic or foreign (a " _Governmental Entity_ ") or any other person not a party to this Agreement is required with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary in connection with the Companys execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, other than (a) the filing of the Joint Proxy Statement, in compliance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), (b) the filing of the Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Indiana, (c) compliance with and filings under the United States Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_ "), and (d) possibly certain foreign antitrust filings which will be confirmed by Buyer and the Company prior to the Closing Date.

limitations on or extending the period for the assessment or  collection of
any Tax which is still in effect. No audit or  other examination of any
Return of the Company and the  Subsidiaries is in progress that is likely to
have a Material  Adverse Effect, and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary

Neither the Company  nor any Subsidiary is required to include in income
any  adjustment pursuant to Section 481(a) of the Code by reason  of a
voluntary change in accounting method initiated by the  Company or such
Subsidiary nor, to the Companys Knowledge,  has the IRS proposed any such
adjustment or change in accounting  method.  
    

  (c) No Taxes arising by reason of transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed to cause the representations in Section 4.7(b) not to be true and correct at any time through and including the Effective Time.  

  4.8 _Absence of Claims._ No action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim (including assertion of any claim for Taxes, interest or penalties) is pending or threatened by any Governmental Entity against or with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary or any properties or assets of the Company or any Subsidiary that is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

  (a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has been, and is now being, operated in compliance with applicable laws, statutes, rules, regulations, ordinances, directives and orders, whether federal, state, local or foreign (collectively, " _Laws_ "), including those relating to pollution or protection of the environment or emissions, discharges or releases of pollutants, contaminants, chemicals or industrial, toxic or hazardous substances into the environment and remediation thereof, except for any instances of non-compliance which could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.  

  (b) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received a written notice, order or directive by any Governmental Entity that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has failed to comply with any Laws or that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is required to obtain any Permit not held by the Company, other than any that have been fully resolved or any that relate to events of non-compliance or failures to obtain that could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

  4.11 _Title to Assets._ Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has good and valid title to all assets reflected on the Principal Balance Sheet or acquired after the Balance Sheet Date (except those sold or otherwise disposed of for fair value since the Balance Sheet Date in the Ordinary Course of Business and not in violation of this Agreement), in each case free and clear of all liens of any kind except (i) mechanics, carriers, workmens, warehousemans or other like liens arising or incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business, (ii) liens which secure indebtedness reflected as a liability on the Principal Balance Sheet, (iii) liens for taxes and assessments not yet due and payable and (iv) other imperfections of title or encumbrances, if any, which individually, and in the aggregate, are not material in amount and do not materially impair the continued use and operation of the assets to which they relate (all items included in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) above being collectively " _Permitted Liens_ "). All leased property used, held for use or necessary in the business of the Company or any Subsidiary is in all material respects in the condition required of such property by the terms of the lease.   #####

Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is the sole and exclusive owner of, or otherwise has a valid license or right to use, all such Proprietary Rights, free and clear of any encumbrance, except for such encumbrances which are not reasonably likely to cause a Material Adverse Effect. " _Proprietary Rights_ " means all material inventions, patents, patent applications, patent disclosures, trademarks, service marks, logos, trade names, domain names, copyrights, trade secrets and all other intellectual property (whether patentable or unpatentable) owned or necessary to own, maintain and operate the Companys or its Subsidiaries properties, assets and business (as now conducted), and each of the Company or its Subsidiaries has the right to use all of its Proprietary Rights in all jurisdictions in which the Company or such Subsidiary conducts its business, except to the extent that such inability to use such Proprietary Rights would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.  

  (b) (i) Each individual and entity, including each employee, agent, consultant and contractor, who has contributed to or participated in any way in the conception, creation, reduction to practice and/or development of Proprietary Rights owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries was, at the time of such contribution or participation, a party to and bound by a valid, enforceable, duly executed agreement with the Company containing appropriate confidentiality provisions, standard "work-made-for-hire" provisions, in accordance with applicable law, and a valid written assignment in favor of the Company as assignee that has conveyed to the Company all right, title and interest in and to all worldwide intellectual rights in the Proprietary Rights; (ii) no Proprietary Rights have been declared unenforceable or otherwise invalid by any court or governmental agency and no party is currently pursuing or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatening to pursue such action; and (iii) there is no existing infringement, misuse, or misappropriation of any Proprietary Rights by others, in each of the foregoing cases, except to the extent that the same is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

  4.15 _ERISA Compliance; Excess Parachute Payments._   

  (a) With respect to each "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of the United States Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ")), "employee welfare benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(l) of ERISA), and all other material employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements, which in each case is maintained, or contributed to, by the Company or any Subsidiary for the benefit of any current or former employees, officers or directors of the Company or any Subsidiary or under which the Company or any Subsidiary has any current or potential liability (the " _Benefit Plans_ "): 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (i) The Company has made available to Buyer true,
complete  and correct copies of (a) each Benefit Plan (or, in the  case of
any unwritten Benefit Plan, a description thereof),  (b) the three most
recent annual reports on Form 5500  filed with the Internal Revenue Service
with respect to each  Benefit Plan (if any such report was required), (c)
the  most recent summary plan description for each Benefit Plan for  which
such summary plan description is required and any  subsequent summaries of
material modification, (d) each  trust agreement and group annuity contract
relating to any  Benefit Plan, (e) the most recent actuarial and financial 
valuation prepared for any Benefit Plan and (f) the most  recent favorable
IRS determination letter for each such Benefit  Plan that is intended to
qualify under Section 401(a) of  the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the  " _Code_ ").  
      
      |   (ii) Each Benefit Plan is in compliance in all material 
respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and  all other
applicable laws and has been administered in  compliance with its terms and
the terms of all applicable  collective bargaining agreements, and no
individuals other than  current or former employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries,  or the dependents of such current or former employees where 
applicable, have participated in any of the Benefit Plans. Other  than
routine claims for benefits received in the Ordinary Course  of Business,
there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the  Company, threatened claims,
suits or investigations related to  any Benefit Plan.  
      
      |   (iii) All Benefit Plans intended to be qualified under 
Section 401(a) of the Code have been the subject of  determination letters
from the Internal Revenue Service to the  effect that such Benefit Plans are
so qualified and exempt from  federal income taxes under Sections 401(a) and
501(a),  respectively, of the Code, and no such determination letter has 
been revoked nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, has  revocation been
threatened, nor has any event occurred since the  date of its most recent
determination letter or application  therefor in any respect that would
adversely affect its  qualification or materially increase its costs.  
      
      |   (iv) No Benefit Plan, other than any Benefit Plan that is
a  "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of  Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA,
had, as of the respective last  annual valuation date for each such Benefit
Plan, an  "unfunded benefit liability" (as such term is defined  in Section
4001(a)(18) of ERISA), based on actuarial  assumptions that have been
furnished to Buyer. None of the  Benefit Plans has an "accumulated funding
deficiency"  (as such term is defined in Section 302 of ERISA or Section 
412 of the Code), whether or not waived. None of the Company,  any
Subsidiary, any officer of the Company or any Subsidiary or  any of the
Benefit Plans which are subject to ERISA, including  any trusts created
thereunder or any trustee or administrator  thereof, has engaged in a
"prohibited transaction" (as  such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA
or  Section 4975 of the Code) or any other breach of fiduciary 
responsibility that could subject the Company, any Subsidiary or  any officer
of the Company or any Subsidiary to the tax or  penalty on prohibited
transactions imposed by such  Section 4975 or to any  ##### 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   liability under Section 502(i) or 502(l) of ERISA.  None of
such Benefit Plans and trusts has been terminated, nor  has there been any
"reportable event" (as that term is  defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) with
respect to any  Benefit Plan since January 1, 2000. Neither the Company nor 
any entity required to be treated as a single employer with the  Company
under Section 414 of the Code currently has any  unsatisfied liability under
Title IV of ERISA with respect  to any Benefit Plan.  
    

  4.16 _Collective Bargaining Agreements._ Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any collective bargaining agreement or union contract with, and no employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is represented by, any union or other collective bargaining unit.

  4.17 _Litigation._   

  (a) There is no suit, action or proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against or directly affecting the Company or any Subsidiary that has resulted or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, nor is there any judgment outstanding as unsatisfied against the Company or any Subsidiary that has resulted or could reasonably be expected to result in a liability of more than $100,000.

  4.20 _Directors and Officers. Exhibit G_ lists the names of all officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries.  

  4.21 _Brokers._ Except for fees payable to Morgan Stanley, the Company is under no obligation to any broker, finder or other intermediary that would cause Buyer or the Company to become liable for payment of any fee or expense in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 ARTICLE 10  

 INDEMNIFICATION  

  10.1 _Indemnification._   

  (a) Founder hereby indemnifies and holds harmless Buyer and its affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders and assignees from and against any and all liabilities, damages, losses, costs and expenses whatsoever (including reasonable attorneys fees) (each a " _Loss_ " and collectively, " _Losses_ ") arising out of or resulting from: 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (i) any breach, in a material respect, of a
representation,  warranty, agreement or covenant made in this Agreement by
the  Company or in any statement, document, exhibit or certification 
furnished by the Company pursuant hereto, or the nonperformance  of any
covenant or obligation to be performed by the Company (or  which the Company
was to cause to be performed) pursuant to this  Agreement; and  
      
      |   (ii) any actions, suits, proceedings, demands,
judgments,  costs, legal fees and other expenses incident to any of the 
foregoing.  
    

  (b) Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Founder against any and all Losses arising out of or resulting from: 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (i) any breach of any representation, warranty,
agreement  or covenant made in this Agreement by Buyer or in any statement, 
document, exhibit or certification furnished by Buyer pursuant  hereto, or
the nonperformance of any covenant or obligation to  be performed by Buyer
(or which Buyer was to cause to be  performed) pursuant to this Agreement;
and  
      
      |   (ii) any actions, suits, proceedings, demands,
judgments,  costs, legal fees and other expenses incident to any of the 
foregoing.  
    

  (c) An indemnified party hereunder (the " _Claiming Party_ ") shall give the indemnifying party prompt written notice of any claim of a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") as to which the Claiming Party proposes to demand indemnification hereunder. The indemnifying party shall forthwith assume the Good Faith Defense of such Third Party Claim at its own expense and may settle such Third Party Claim, but shall not, without the consent of the Claiming Party, agree to (i) any injunctive relief affecting the Claiming Party or (ii) any settlement that would adversely affect the business or operations of the Claiming Party. For purposes hereof, " _Good Faith Defense_ " means legal defense conducted by reputable counsel of good standing selected with the consent of the Claiming Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If a Good Faith Defense is not commenced within 20 days following receipt of notice of the Third Party Claim from the Claiming Party (or such shorter period, if any, during which a defense must be commenced in order for the defendant to preserve its rights), the Claiming Party may, at its option, settle or defend such claim at the   ##### 

  

 expense of the indemnifying party. Subject to the other provisions of this
Section 10.1, in the event that (x) a final judgment or order in favor of
such third party is rendered against the Claiming Party, that is not subject
to appeal or with respect to which the time to appeal has expired without an
appeal having been made, or (y) such Third Party Claim is settled in
accordance with this Section 10.1(c), resulting in liability on the part of
the Claiming Party, then the amount of such liability together with costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), incurred by the Claiming
Party shall be paid by the indemnifying party. 

  

  (d) In addition to and not in limitation of Section 10.1(c) hereof, an indemnified party hereunder shall give prompt written notice to an indemnifying party of each claim for indemnification hereunder as to which such indemnified party proposes to demand indemnification, specifying the amount and nature of such claim. The failure to give such notice to the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party of any liability hereunder unless the indemnifying party was prejudiced thereby under this Section 10.1, and then only to the extent of such prejudice.  

  (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (i) (A) subject to Section 10.1(e)(i)(C) hereof, 
Buyers right to indemnity pursuant to this Agreement shall  be limited, in
the aggregate, to an amount equal to $300,000,000;  
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (B) subject to Section 10.1(e)(i)(C) hereof, the 
Founder shall have no obligation to indemnify Buyer pursuant to  this
Agreement until the aggregate amount of indemnification to  which Buyer is
entitled (including for Third Party Claims)  exceeds $30,000,000 (" _Buyer s
Threshold_"),  in which case, Buyers right to indemnification will only  be
for losses in excess of Buyers Threshold; and  
      
      |   (C) clauses (A) through (B) of this  Section 10.1(e)(i)
shall have no effect on and shall not  limit in any manner whatsoever Buyers
rights to indemnity  or the indemnity obligations of Founder with respect to
any  breach by the Company of any representation or warranty  contained in
Section 4.2.  
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (ii) (A) Founders right to indemnity pursuant to  this
Agreement shall be limited, in the aggregate, to an amount  equal to
$300,000,000; and  
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (B) Buyer shall have no obligation to indemnify Founder 
pursuant to this Agreement until the aggregate amount of  indemnification to
which Founder is entitled (including for  Third Party Claims) exceeds
$30,000,000 (" _Founder s  Threshold_"), in which case, the Founders right
to  indemnification will only be for Losses in excess of  Founders
Threshold;  
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (iii) the right to indemnity under this Section 10.1 
shall terminate on the second anniversary of the Effective Time,  except for
the following:  
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (A) for any claim based on breach of (x) any 
representation or warranty of the Company contained in  Section 4.2, for
which such right to indemnity shall  continue if made prior to expiration of
the applicable period of  limitations imposed by statute with respect
thereto, or  (y) any other representation or warranty made herein or in  any
statement, exhibit, certificate or schedule furnished  hereunder with an
intent to deceive or defraud or with reckless  disregard for the truth or
accuracy thereof, for which such  right to indemnity shall continue if made
prior to expiration of  the applicable statute of limitations; and  
      
      |   (B) with respect to any claim for indemnity hereunder
that  shall have been made on or prior to the second anniversary (or  if
within Section 10.1(e)(iii)(a) hereof, prior to the  expiration of the
applicable period of limitations imposed by  statute with respect thereto),
the right to indemnity shall not  terminate until the final determination and
satisfaction of such  claim;  
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (iv) if any indemnification is recoverable under more
than  one provision hereof, the indemnified party shall be entitled to 
assert a claim for such indemnification until the expiration of  the  ##### 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   longest period of time within which to assert a claim for 
indemnification under any of the provisions of this Agreement  that are
applicable; and  
      
      |   (v) any amount payable under this Section 10.1 by an 
indemnifying party may, if not promptly paid by the indemnifying  party, be
set off against and withheld from any amount then owed  by the indemnified
party to the indemnifying party.  
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (f) _Reduction for Insurance._ The amount of 
indemnification that a party hereto is required to pay to, for,  or on behalf
of any indemnified party pursuant to this  Section 10.1 shall be reduced by
(but only to the extent  of) any insurance proceeds that are actually
recovered by such  indemnified party in reduction of the related Loss.
Further, if  an indemnified party has received, or if an indemnifying party 
has paid on the indemnified partys behalf, an indemnity  payment in respect
of a Loss and the indemnified party  subsequently receives, directly or
indirectly, insurance  proceeds in respect of such Loss, then such
indemnified party  will promptly pay to the indemnifying party the amount of
such  insurance proceeds, or, if less, the amount of such payment.  
      
      |   (g) _Payment of Losses in Cash or Buyer Common Stock. _
Founder may, at Founders option, pay any amounts owed  to Buyer under this
Article 10 in either: (i) cash; or  (ii) in shares of Buyer Common Stock
valued per share at  the weighted average of the per-share closing prices on
the New  York Stock Exchange Composite Tape of the shares of Buyer Common 
Stock received by Founder hereunder on the Closing Date and the  Final Price
Date.  
    

 ARTICLE 11  

 NON-COMPETITION  

  11.1 _Covenant Not to Compete._ In order to further ensure that Buyer receives the expected benefits of the Merger, Founder hereby agrees that, throughout the period that commences on the Closing Date and ends on the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Non-Compete Period_ "), Founder will not at any time directly or indirectly, except following Buyers written consent: 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (a) own, operate, invest in, lend money to, be employed
by,  consult with, render services to, act as agent, officer or  director
for, acquire or hold any interest in (i) any  business of any nature that
competes with any business currently  owned or operated by the Company or its
Subsidiaries (except for  the businesses to be transferred to "Newco" as 
contemplated by _Exhibit H_) or (ii) any corporation,  partnership,
association or other entity of any nature that  owns, operates or has an
interest in any business described in  the immediately preceding clause (i)
(except that nothing herein  shall prohibit Founder from owning not more than
1% of the  outstanding shares of any class of stock of a corporation if 
such class of stock is regularly traded on a recognized national  securities
exchange);  
      
      |   (b) employ or attempt to employ any person who is now
or  later becomes a director, officer or employee of the Company,  Buyer or
their subsidiaries (except for persons who are  terminated by the Surviving
Corporation and except for persons  employed in connection with the
businesses to be transferred to  "Newco" as contemplated by _Exhibit H_),
or  otherwise interfere with or disrupt any employment relationship 
(contractual or other) of the Company, Buyer or their  subsidiaries; or  
      
      |   (c) solicit, request, advise or induce any present 
customer, supplier or other business contact of the Company,  Buyer or their

  (a) Founder hereby specifically acknowledges and agrees that (i) this Article 11 and each provision hereof are reasonable and necessary to ensure that Buyer receives the expected benefits of the Merger, (ii) Buyer has refused to enter into this Agreement in the absence of this Article 11, and (iii) violation of this Article 11 will harm Buyer to such an extent that monetary damages alone would be an inadequate remedy.   ##### 

 

  (b) Therefore, in the event of any violation by Founder of any provision of this Article 11, (i) Buyer (in addition to all other remedies Buyer may have) shall be entitled to a temporary restraining order, injunction and other equitable relief (without posting any bond or other security) restraining Founder from committing or continuing such violation and (ii) in the case of any violation of Section 11.1 hereof, the duration of the Non-Compete Period shall be extended beyond its then-scheduled termination date for a period equal to the duration of the violation.

 AGREEMENT  

  NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual covenants and undertakings set forth in this Agreement, Manager, Founder and the Company, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: 

        |

Management  Period and while Founder and/or trusts, limited liability 
companies or similar entities which Founder has created or may  create for
estate planning or similar purposes owns, in the  aggregate, at least 5% of
all outstanding stock of the Buyer,  each individual now serving as a
director of a Selected Entity  (each, a " _Selected Director_ ") shall
continue to  serve in such capacity for as long as such Selected Director
is  available to serve. Therefore, at all such times, the Company:  (a)
shall take such actions as are within its control to  continue the service of
each Selected Director in his or her  current capacity as a director of a
Selected Entity,  (b) shall refrain from taking any action to terminate
such  service of any Selected Director in such capacity, except for  any
termination of a Selected Director for Cause (as defined  below) and (c)
shall, in the event of death, Incapacity (as  defined below) or resignation
of a Selected Director, appoint a  replacement for such Selected Director
selected by the Founder  or his designee. Thereafter, any replacement for a
Selected  Director shall be a " _Selected Director_ " for all  purposes
under this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the  term " _Incapacity_ "
means inability to perform  the duties of a director of the applicable Board
by reason of  physical or mental illness or impairment for an uninterrupted 
period of at least 180 days. As used in this Agreement, the  term " _Cause_ "
means (x) a violation of any  fiduciary duty or duty of loyalty owed by the
Selected Director  to the Company, (y) acts or omissions not in good faith
or  which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of  law and
(z) commission of a crime or other public  misconduct materially detrimental
to the reputation of the  Company.

      |   4. _Compensation_   
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (a) _Management Fee._ During the Management Period, 
the Company shall pay to Manager a monthly management fee (the  " _Management
Fee_ ")  of Dollars  ($ )*,  made
on the first day of each month of the Management Period, as  may be pro rated
to account for commencement of the Management  Period other than on the first
day of a month and the expiration  of the Management Period other than on the
last day of a month.  
      
      |   (b) _Incentive Fee._ The parties acknowledge that the 
existing value of the Selected Businesses can be enhanced by  experienced and
knowledgeable management, and that future  increases in sustainable revenues
and improved margins would be  reflected in an increased value for the
Selected Businesses.  Accordingly, in addition to the Management Fee set
forth in  clause (a) above, the Company shall pay to Manager for each 
Compensation Period (as defined below) an incentive fee (the  " _Incentive
Fee_ ") based on such increases in  value, if any, of the Selected
Businesses. The Incentive Fee  shall be equal to forty-five percent (45%) of
any Incremental  Net Value (as defined below) of the Selected Businesses,
taken  as a whole; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the  Incremental Net
Value Percentage is greater than the Incremental  Net Sales Percentage, the
Incentive Fee shall be equal to  forty-five percent (45%) of the Adjusted
Incremental Net Value  (as defined below). The Incentive Fee shall be payable
for each  Compensation Period as soon as possible after the close of the 
Compensation Period, but in any event, within ten  (10) business days after
such amount is determined;  _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to the
beginning of  each Compensation Period, the Company and Manager agree to 
negotiate in good faith to establish, if possible, a deferred  compensation
arrangement for such payments that qualifies as a  so-called "Rabbi Trust" or
similar arrangement for  federal income tax purposes since it is to the
mutual advantage  of Company and Manager to defer the payments provided for
under  this clause (b) for cash flow and income tax planning  purposes. As
used in this Agreement, the term  " _Compensation Period_ " means the first 
24 months of the Management Period, and each successive  period of 24 months
during the   * The Management Fee shall be determined based on the expected costs of the total compensation and benefits of the personnel of Manager, plus the expected costs of Managers support and overhead, all as reasonable in referrence to the historical amounts for such costs for the pre-Closing operations of Cook Group Incorporated (both in the U.S. and Europe).   ##### 

  

 Management Period, and the last series of consecutive months in the
Management Period even if less than 24 months. 

 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   As used in this Agreement, the following terms have the 
following meanings:  
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (i) " _Fair Market Value_ " means the value of  the
Selected Businesses (or any portion thereof, as applicable)  as determined by
the mutual agreement of Manager and the  Company, or if such agreement is not
reached within ten  (10) days of the end of any Compensation Period or
within  ten (10) days of the request of either Manager or the  Company, then
the value of the Selected Businesses (or any  portion thereof, as applicable)
as determined by an independent  appraiser (the " _Appraiser_ "). The
Appraiser  shall be Mercer Capital, Inc. of Memphis, Tennessee; the 
appraisal division of Ernst and Young LLP,  headquartered in Dallas, Texas; or
any appraiser that  Manager chooses from a list of independent appraisers
approved  by the Company from time to time. Once selected, the Appraiser 
shall have a reasonable amount of time to determine such Fair  Market Value
and provide its determination of Fair Market Value,  including its
methodology and formula for calculating Fair  Market Value, to the Company
and Manager. Unless the Company  gives written notice of a reasonable and
good-faith objection to  the Fair Market Value as stated in such report or
the  methodology or formula used by the Appraiser in determining the  Fair
Market Value before the close of business on the  15th day after receipt
thereof, the Fair Market Value  determined by the Appraiser shall become
binding on such  15th day and shall be the " _Final Fair Market  Value._ "
If the Company gives written notice to Manager  before the close of business
on such 15th day of a  reasonable and good-faith objection to any material
aspect(s) of  the Fair Market Value as stated in such report or the 
methodology or formula used by the Appraiser in determining the  Fair Market
Value, then all aspects of the methodology and  formula other than those
material aspects as to which the  reasonable and good-faith objection was
made shall become  binding, and the Company and Manager shall discuss the 
objection. If the Company and the Manager agree in writing to a  revision in
the methodology or formula for determining Fair  Market Value which results
in a recalculation of the Fair Market  Value, then such recalculated Fair
Market Value shall be the  Final Fair Market Value. If the Company and
Manager do not  execute such a written agreement within 15 days after 
notice of objection, then the parties shall submit the matter(s)  objected to
(and only such matter(s)) to the appraisal division  of Pricewaterhouse
Coopers LLP or such other appraiser on whom  the parties shall mutually agree
(the " _Second  Appraiser_ ") to resolve the matter(s) and submit a 
recalculated Fair Market Value, which determination shall be  binding on
Manager and the Company. "Fair Market  Value" shall be determined by the
Appraiser or the Second  Appraiser, as the case may be, applying customary
appraisal  standards on a consistent basis with previous appraisals under 
this Agreement and shall be equal to the net amount that a  willing buyer
would pay to a willing seller for the Company,  neither being under any
compulsion to buy or sell or grant  rights, and both having reasonable
knowledge of all relevant  facts. The fees and expenses of any Appraiser and
the Second  Appraiser shall be borne solely by the Company.  
      
      |   (ii) " _Net Value_ " means as of a specified  date, the
aggregate amount that would be distributable to the  owner(s) of the Selected
Businesses, assuming that no reserves  are necessary, if the Selected
Businesses were to be sold as of  the time of measurement and the proceeds
distributed to the  owner(s), as such hypothetical distributable amount is 
determined based on the then Fair Market Value of the Selected  Businesses
and prior to any deduction for income taxes by reason  of the hypothetical
sale, _plus_ the amount of any  dividends or other distributions made from
the operations of the  Selected Businesses during the applicable Compensation
Period,  all as adjusted to account for any Transfer of any Selected 
Business(es) or any portion(s) thereof during the applicable  Compensation
Period.  
      
      |   (iii) " _Highest Net Value_ " means the  highest Net
Value of the Selected Businesses, taken as a whole,  as of the end of any
prior Compensation Period.  ##### 

 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (iv) " _Incremental Net Value_ " means the  difference
between the Net Value of the Selected Businesses,  taken as a whole, as of
the end of a Compensation Period,  _minus_ the greater of: (x) the Net Value
of the  Selected Businesses, taken as a whole, as of the beginning of  the
same Compensation Period, and (y) the Highest Net  Value; _provided, however_
, that if such difference results  in a negative number, such number shall be
treated as  "zero" under this Agreement.  
      
      |   (v) " _Incremental Net Value Percentage_ "  means the
Incremental Net Value for a Compensation Period  divided by the Net Value of
the Selected Businesses, taken as a  whole, as of the beginning of the same
Compensation Period.  
      
      |   (vi) " _Period Net Sales_ " means the gross  invoice
price for all products and services sold by the Selected  Businesses to third
party customers in a Compensation Period,  less the reasonable and customary
accrual-basis deductions from  such gross amounts for such Compensation
Period for:  (i) normal and customary trade, cash and other discounts, 
allowances and credits actually allowed and taken directly with  respect to
sales of products; (ii) credits or allowances  actually granted for damaged
goods, returns or rejections of  products; (iii) sales or similar taxes
(including duties or  other governmental charges levied on, absorbed or
otherwise  imposed directly on the sales of products, including, without 
limitation, value added taxes or other governmental charges  otherwise
measured by the billing amount) which are included in  billing amount, and
excluding any taxes imposed on or measured  by the net income or profits of
the selling party;  (iv) uncollectable accounts; (v) charge back payments 
and rebates granted to managed health care organizations or to  federal,
state and local governments, their agencies and  purchasers and reimbursers
or to trade customers, including but  not limited to, wholesalers and chain
and pharmacy buying  groups; and (vi) rebates (or equivalents thereof) that
are  granted to or charged by national, state, provincial or local 
governmental authorities in countries other than the United  States. Such
amounts shall be determined from the books and  records of the Company or the
Selected Entities, as applicable,  maintained in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting  principles consistently applied.  
      
      |   (vii) " _Incremental Net Sales_ " means the  difference
between the Period Net Sales of the Selected  Business, taken as a whole, for
a Compensation Period,  _minus_ the Period Net Sales of the Selected
Businesses,  taken as a whole, for the prior Compensation Period or, in the 
case of the first Compensation Period, for the twenty-four  (24) months
ending on the date before the first day of the  first Compensation Period;
_provided however_ , that if such  difference results in a negative number,
such number shall be  treated as "zero" under this Agreement.  
      
      |   (viii) " _Incremental Net Sales Percentage_ "  means the
Incremental Net Sales for a Compensation Period  divided by the Period Net
Sales of all Selected Businesses,  taken as a whole, for the prior
Compensation Period or, in the  case of the first Compensation Period, for
the twenty-four  (24) months ending on the date before the first day of the 
first Compensation Period.  
      
      |   (ix) " _Adjusted Incremental Net Value_ "  means the Net
Value of the Selected Businesses, taken as a  whole, at the beginning of a
Compensation Period _plus_ an  amount equal to (x) such Net Value of the
Selected  Businesses, taken as a whole, at the beginning of such 
Compensation Period multiplied by (y) the Incremental Net  Sales
Percentage.  
   

        |

Company  shall not, at any time during the Management Period, Transfer  (as
defined below) any interest, whether legal, beneficial or  equitable, in any

tangible or intangible, without  requiring as a condition to such Transfer,
that the Transferee  (as defined below)  ##### 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   agree to expressly assume the Companys obligations under 
this Agreement (which assumption shall bind the Transferee to  abide by the
terms of this Agreement for the remainder of the  Management Period, and, in
any event, for a period of not less  than 18 months after the date of
Transfer), including the  engagement of Managers services pursuant to the
terms of  this Agreement and payment to Manager of the Management Fees and 
Incentive Fees to which Manager is entitled under this Agreement.  
      
      |   (c) Any purported or attempted Transfer which is not
made  in accordance with, or which violates any of, the provisions of  this
Agreement, shall be void and have no force or effect  whatsoever.  
      
      |   (d) For purposes of this Agreement, the term  "

---|--- 
      |   7. _Covenants of Manager and Founder_

termination date, if earlier  than the last day of the Management Period
(such period, the  " _Non-Compete Period _"):  
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (a) own, operate, invest in, lend money to, be employed
by,  consult with, render services to, act as agent, officer or  director
for, or acquire or hold any interest in (A) any  business of any nature that
competes with any Selected Business;  or (B) any corporation, partnership,
association or other  entity that owns, operates or has an interest in any
business  described in the immediately preceding clause (A) (except that 
nothing herein shall prohibit Founder from  ##### 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   owning not more than 5.0% of the outstanding shares of any
class  of stock of a corporation if such class of stock is regularly  traded
on a recognized national securities exchange);  
      
      |   (b) employ or attempt to employ any person who is now
or  later becomes a director, officer or employee of the Selected 
Businesses, or otherwise interfere with or disrupt any  employment
relationship (contractual or other) of the Selected  Businesses; or  
      
      |   (c) solicit, request, advise or induce any present or 
potential customer, supplier or other business contact of the  Selected
Businesses to cancel, curtail or otherwise adversely  change its relationship
with the Company.  
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   8. _Confidential Information_   
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   To the extent Manager, the Founder or the Company,
receive (the  _"Recipient"_ ) any non-public information  reasonably
believed by him or it to be, or otherwise marked as  being, of a confidential
nature with respect to any other party  to this Agreement or any of such
partys affiliates (the  _"Discloser"_ ), the Recipient shall, unless first 
obtaining the written consent of the Discloser, (a) treat  such information
confidentially using the same procedures it  uses to protect its own
confidential information, but with no  less than a reasonable standard of
care, and (b) shall not  use such information for its own benefit or the
benefit of any  third party, except as required to perform its duties under
this  Agreement. Nothing contained in this Section 8 shall  prohibit the
parties hereto from entering into additional or  superceding confidentiality
agreements in the event any of them  deems such an agreement reasonably
required to protect its  interests. In any such instance, the parties hereto
agree to  negotiate any such confidentiality agreement in good faith and 
with a view towards protecting the rights of those involved.  
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   9. _Remedies_   
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (a) _Specific Performance._ Each party agrees that 
Sections 7 and 8 and each provision of those sections are  reasonable and
necessary to ensure that the parties receive the  expected benefits of this
Agreement and that violation of either  or both of those Sections will cause
harm to the non-breaching  party to such an extent that monetary damages
alone would be an  inadequate remedy. Therefore, in the event of any
violation of  any provision of either or both of those Sections, (i) the 
adversely affected party (in addition to all other remedies it  may have)
shall be entitled to a temporary restraining order,  injunction and other
equitable relief (without posting any bond  or other security) restraining
the violating party from  committing or continuing such violation and (ii) in
the  case of any violation of Section 7, the duration of the  Non-Compete
Period shall be extended beyond its then-scheduled  termination date for a
period equal to the duration of the  violation.  
      
      |   (b) _Liquidated Damages._ Company acknowledges and 
agrees that the Founder and Manager have forgone significant  business
opportunities in order to enter into this Agreement,  and that any breach of
Sections 4 or 5 of this Agreement by  Company would result in damages to
Manager and Founder that are  impractical if not impossible to calculate.
Accordingly, in the  event of any such breach, Company shall be liable to pay
(in  addition to all other available rights and remedies, at law, in  equity
or otherwise) to Manager, as liquidated damages for the  loss of a bargain
and not as a penalty, an amount equal to:  (i) the total of all Management
Fees that would be earned  by Manager hereunder for the remainder of the
Management Period,  _plus_ (ii) the total of all Incentive Fees that would 
be earned by Manager hereunder (calculated assuming a 10% annual  increase in
the Incremental Net Sales Percentage and the  Incremental Net Value
Percentage) for the remainder of the  Management Period.  
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   10. _Other Provisions_   
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (a) _Representation of Manager._ Manager hereby 
represents and warrants that the execution, delivery and  performance of this
Agreement by Manager have been duly  authorized and approved by all necessary
corporate and other  action on the part of Manager and that this Agreement
represents  ##### 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   the binding obligation of Manager, enforceable against it in 
accordance with its terms, subject only to bankruptcy,  insolvency,
moratorium and other similar laws affecting  creditors rights generally.  
      
      |   (b) _Representation of Company._ The Company hereby 
represents and warrants that the execution, delivery and  performance of this
Agreement by the Company have been duly  authorized and approved by all
necessary corporate and other  action on the part of the Company and that
this Agreement  represents the binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable  against it in accordance with its terms, subject only to 
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium and other similar laws  affecting
creditors rights generally.  
      
      |   (c) _Separate Representation._ Founder hereby 
acknowledges that Founder has sought and received independent  advice from
counsel of Founders own selection in  connection with this Agreement and has
not relied to any extent  on any officer, director or shareholder of, or
counsel to, the  Company in deciding to enter into this Agreement.  
      
      |   (d) _Successors and Assigns._ This Agreement is 
binding on Founder, Manager and on the Company and each  partys permitted
successors and assigns. The rights and  obligations of the Company under this
Agreement may be assigned  to a successor without the prior written consent
of Manager and  Founder so long as such successor expressly assumes the 
obligations of the Company under the Agreement in a manner  satisfactory to
Founder in his sole discretion or otherwise  assumes the obligations of the
Company by operation of law,  including without limitation, through
consummation of the  transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. No
rights or  obligations of Manager or Founder under this Agreement may be 
assigned to any other person or entity without the consent of  the Company.  
      
      |   (e) _Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed 
by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the  State of
Indiana, without giving effect to the principles of  conflict of laws.  
      
      |   (f) _Severability._ Each provision of this Agreement 
is severable. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be 
unenforceable or in violation of any statute, rule, regulation,  order or
decree of any governmental authority, court or agency,  then such provision
shall be modified to the minimum extent  necessary so as to render it
enforceable and cure such  violation, and all other provisions hereof shall
remain in full  force and effect notwithstanding such violation.  
      
      |   (g) _Legal Relationship._ The relationship among the 
parties established by this Agreement is that of independent  contracting
parties, and no provision of this Agreement shall be  construed to create a
partnership, joint venture, employment or  other similar relationship of
agency.  
      
      |   (h) _Notices._ All notices hereunder shall be in 
writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if delivered  by hand, by
facsimile transmission, by overnight courier service  or by prepaid United
States registered or certified mail, return  receipt requested, to the party
to receive the same at the  address set forth with the signature of such
party hereto or at  such other address as may have been furnished to the
sender by  notice under this Agreement. All notices shall be deemed given 
on the date on which delivered.  
      
      |   (i) _Entire Agreement._ This Agreement contains the 
entire understanding of the parties hereto with respect to the  subject
matter of this Agreement, and no provision hereof may be  altered, amended,
modified, waived, or discharged in any way  whatsoever except by written
agreement executed by both parties.  No delay or failure of either party to
insist, in any one or  more instances, upon performance of any of the terms
and  conditions of this Agreement or to exercise any rights or  remedies
hereunder shall constitute a waiver or a relinquishment  of such rights or
remedies or any other rights or remedies  hereunder. This Agreement may be
executed in any number of  counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original.  #####

  THIS SHAREHOLDERS AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made this day of , 2003, by and among Guidant Corporation, an Indiana corporation (the " _Company_ "), and the individuals and entities listed in _Annex A_ hereto (the " _Original Shareholders_ ").

---|--- 
      |   (v) through transactions of the type described in the
first  sentence of paragraph (f) of Rule 144 under the Securities  Act (as
in effect on the date of this Agreement and whether or  not such Disposition

Common Stock sold in such  transactions, together with all other sales of
Company Common  Stock made by any and all Shareholders under this

        |   
---|--- 
      |   Each Shareholder agrees that the foregoing restrictions
preclude  the Shareholder from engaging in any hedging or other  transaction
that is designed to or reasonably expected to lead  to or result in a
Disposition of Securities not excepted above,  even if the Securities would

other transactions  include any short sale (whether or not against the box)
or any  purchase, sale, or grant of any right (including any put or call 
option) with respect to any Securities or with respect to any  security
(other than a broad-based market basket or index) that  includes, relates to,
or derives any significant part of its  value from Securities. Any
Disposition or attempted Disposition  in violation of this Agreement shall be
void.  
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (b) Each Shareholder consents to the entry of stop-

---|--- 
      |   4. _Extraordinary Corporate Transactions._ The 
restrictions on Disposition of the shares of Company Common  Stock acquired
at the Closing or on the Second Payment Date set  forth herein shall not
apply to any Dispositions made pursuant  to a merger or consolidation, tender
offer, exchange offer, or  any other similar transaction involving common
stock of the  Company which is recommended, approved, or not opposed by the 
Companys board of directors.  
      
      |   5. _Demand Registration Rights._   
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (a) _Form S-3 Demand Registration._  
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (i) If the Company receives a written request
therefor from  a Shareholder, then the Company shall prepare and file with
the  SEC within 30 days of such request a registration statement  under the
Securities Act covering the shares of Company Common  Stock that are the
subject of the request and shall use its  reasonable best efforts to cause
the registration statement to  become effective. If the request is not made
on behalf of all  Shareholders, upon the making of the request, the Company
shall  promptly give notice to the other Shareholders. The Company  shall
include in the registration statement shares of Company  Common Stock held by
the other Shareholders for which it has  received written requests to
register from the other  Shareholders within 10 days after the Companys 
written notice to those Shareholders.  
      
      |   (ii) The Company shall be obligated to prepare,
file, and  cause to become effective only three registration statements (on 
Form S-3 or any other applicable form  (" _Form S-3_")) under this
Agreement, and to  pay all the expenses associated therewith, except as set
forth  below.  
      
      |   (iii) The Company shall not be obligated to
register any  shares under this Section 5(a) unless the Shareholders  making
the written requests for registration under subsection  (i) above hold at
least 25% of the total number of shares  of Company Common Stock then held by
all Shareholders.  
      
      |   (iv) The maximum number of shares of Company
Common Stock  included in any registration under this Section 5 shall not 
exceed one-third of the total number of shares of Company Common  Stock
acquired by all Shareholders in connection with the Merger.  
      
      |   (v) The initial registration request may not be
made by  Shareholders until after that date which is six months after the 
Final Pricing Date. The second registration request may not be  made by
Shareholders until that date which is six months after  the closing of the
sale of shares in connection with the initial  registration statement filed
under this Section 5\. The  third registration request may not be made by
Shareholders until  that date which is six months after the closing of the
sale of  shares in connection with the second registration statement  filed
under this Section 5.  ##### 

 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (b) _The Company s Right to Postpone or Suspend 
Registration._ The Company may postpone compliance with a  request for
registration under this Section 5 or may  suspend the ability to make sales
under the registration  statement filed pursuant thereto, if: (i), in the
good faith and  reasonable judgment of the Company, such compliance or
sales  would materially adversely affect a proposed financing, 
reorganization, recapitalization, merger, acquisition,  consolidation, or
similar transaction or other development  involving or with respect to the
Company or its subsidiaries  (including through the premature disclosure
thereof), or  (ii) the Company is conducting a public offering of capital 
stock (including during the effectiveness of any registration  statement
pertaining thereto) and the managing underwriter  concludes in its good faith
and reasonable judgment that such  compliance or sales would materially
adversely affect the  success of the offering. If the Company invokes this 
Section 5(b), then the Company shall give prompt written  notice, on a
confidential basis, of the postponement to the  requesting Shareholders. In
addition, each Shareholder agrees to  promptly suspend sales under the
registration statement during  any period that the Company notifies the
Shareholder that it is  preparing and filing an amendment or supplement to
the  registration statement or prospectus under subsections (d)(vi)  or
(vii) below.  
      
      |   (c) _Piggyback Registrations._ If at any time 
commencing six months after the Final Pricing Date but prior to  December 31,
2005, the Company determines to proceed with  the preparation and filing of a
registration statement under the  Securities Act in connection with the
proposed underwritten  public offering of shares of the common stock of the
Company for  cash, the Company shall give written notice thereof to each 
Shareholder then holding shares of Company Common Stock acquired  in
connection with the Merger. Upon the written request of any  such Shareholder
given within ten days after the date of any  such notice from the Company,
the Company shall cause all shares  of Company Common Stock to which any such
Shareholder has  requested registration to be included in the registration 
statement, all to the extent requisite to permit the sale or  other
disposition by such Shareholder of the shares to be so  registered;
_provided, however_ , that nothing shall prevent  the Company from abandoning
or delaying any such registration  initiated by it. The Company may require
that the shares of  Company Common Stock requested for inclusion by
Shareholders  pursuant to this Section 5(c) be included in the  underwriting
on the same terms and conditions as the shares of  common stock of the
Company otherwise being sold to the  underwriters. If in the discretion of
the managing underwriter  of such public offering the inclusion of all of the
shares of  Company Common Stock originally covered by request for inclusion 
in such registration made by any Shareholders would reduce the  number of
shares of common stock of the Company to be offered by  the Company or
interfere with the successful marketing of the  shares of common stock of the
Company offered by the Company,  the number of shares owned by any
Shareholder and otherwise to  be included in the underwritten public offering
may be reduced  or eliminated pro rata, in accordance with the original 
requested amounts, among such Shareholders requesting inclusion  in such
registration.  
      
      |   (d) _The Company s Obligations._ When the Company  is
required by this Section 5 to register shares of Company  Common Stock under
the Securities Act, then the Company shall:  
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (i) prepare and file with the SEC a registration
statement  on Form S-3 with respect to the shares requested to be 
registered and use its reasonable best efforts to cause the  registration
statement to become and remain effective to the  extent and for the time
customary in connection with a  firm-commitment underwriting;  
      
      |   (ii) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments to
the  registration statement and supplements to the prospectus  contained
therein as may be necessary to keep the registration  statement effective to
the extent and for the time customary in  connection with a firm-commitment
underwriting;  
      
      |   (iii) furnish to the participating Shareholders (and to
the  underwriter of the securities being registered) a reasonable  number of
copies of the registration statement, preliminary  ##### 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   prospectus (if any), final prospectus, and such other
documents  as such Shareholders or the underwriter may reasonably request 
in order to facilitate the sale of the shares;  
      
      |   (iv) notify the participating Shareholders, promptly
after  the Company receives notice thereof, of the time when the 
registration statement has become effective or a supplement to  any
prospectus forming a part of the registration statement has  been filed;  
      
      |   (v) notify the participating Shareholders promptly of
any  request by the SEC for the amending or supplementing of the 
registration statement or prospectus or for additional  information;  
      
      |   (vi) prepare and file with the SEC, promptly upon the 
request of the participating Shareholders, any amendments or  supplements to
the registration statement or prospectus that, in  the reasonable opinion of
counsel for such Shareholders (and  agreed with by counsel for the Company),
is required under the  Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder
in  connection with the distribution of the shares;  
      
      |   (vii) prepare and promptly file with the SEC, and
promptly  notify the Shareholders of, any filing of the amendment or 
supplement to the registration statement or prospectus as may be  necessary
to correct any statements or omissions if, at the time  when a prospectus
relating to those securities is required to be  delivered under the
Securities Act, the prospectus or any other  prospectus as then in effect
would include an untrue statement  of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary  to make the statements therein, in the light of
the  circumstances in which they were made, not misleading;  
      
      |   (viii) advise the participating Shareholders promptly
after  it receives notice of the issuance of any stop order by the SEC 
suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement or  the initiation
or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose  and promptly use its
reasonable best efforts to prevent the  issuance of any stop order or to
obtain its withdrawal if a stop  order is issued; and  
      
      |   (ix) include in the registration statement and any
related  prospectus filed pursuant to this Section a provision in 
substantially the form of _Annex B_ hereto under the  caption "Plan of
Distribution", and include in any  supplement to any prospectus filed in
connection with an  underwritten offering, language mutually agreed upon by
the  Company, the selling Shareholder or Shareholders and the  applicable
underwriter, investment bank or affiliate thereof  describing any
arrangements entered into by such underwriter,  investment bank or affiliate
thereof to hedge its economic  exposure with respect to any derivative
transaction entered into  between such underwriter, investment bank or
affiliate thereof  and any of the selling Shareholders.  
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (e) The Company shall not be obligated to honor a
request  or demand to register shares of Company Common Stock under this 
Section 5 if all such shares which could be registered  pursuant to such
request or demand are otherwise eligible for  immediate sale by the
Shareholder under Rule 144 under the  Securities Act.  
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   _6. Shelf Registration._  
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (a) The Merger Agreement provides that the Company
Common  Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger to the 
shareholders of Seller (including the Original Shareholders)  shall be
registered with the SEC on a registration statement on  Form S-4. If, for
whatever reason, the shares of Company  Common Stock to be issued to the
Original Shareholders are not  eligible for registration on a Registration
Statement on  Form S-4, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts 
to cause to be filed with the SEC as promptly as practicable  after the
Closing Date, but, in any event, within 30 days  after the Closing Date, a
registration statement on  Form S-3 (the " _Shelf Registration  Statement_
") covering the resale of the shares of  Company Common Stock not so
registrable on Form S-4 on a  continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the
Securities  Act, and to  ##### 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   have such Shelf Registration Statement declared effective by
the  SEC as promptly as practicable thereafter.  
      
      |   (b) The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to 
keep the Shelf Registration Statement effective for a period of  two years
after the Closing Date or such earlier date when all  shares of Company
Common Stock held by any Original Shareholder  covered by the Shelf
Registration Statement have been sold in  the manner set forth and as
contemplated in the Registration  Statement (the " _Effectiveness Period_
").  If the Shelf Registration Statement ceases to be effective for  any
reason at any time during the Effectiveness Period, the  Company shall within
thirty (30) days of such cessation of  effectiveness amend the Shelf
Registration Statement in a manner  reasonably expected to obtain the
withdrawal of the order  suspending the effectiveness thereof, or file an
additional  shelf registration statement on Form S-3 pursuant to  Rule 415
covering all of the shares of Company Common Stock  held by any Original
Shareholders (a " _Subsequent Shelf  Registration Statement_ "). If a
Subsequent Shelf  Registration Statement is filed, the Company shall use
its  reasonable best efforts to cause it to be declared effective as  soon
as practicable after such filing and to keep such  Subsequent Shelf
Registration Statement continuously effective  for the Effectiveness Period.
If any Subsequent Shelf  Registration Statement ceases to be effective for
any reason at  any time during the Effectiveness Period, this Section 8 
shall apply anew as if such Subsequent Shelf Registration  Statement were the
Shelf Registration Statement in the first  instance. As used in this
Agreement, the term "Shelf  Registration Statement" includes any Subsequent
Shelf  Registration Statement that may be prepared and filed pursuant  to
this Agreement, as the context requires.  
      
      |   (c) The Shelf Registration Statement shall be subject
to  the provisions of Section 5(b) of this Agreement. In  addition,
dispositions of any Company Common Stock under the  Shelf Registration
Statement shall be subject to the provisions  of Section 3(a)(i) through (vi)
of this Agreement.  
      
      |   (d) _The Company s Obligations._ In addition to  its
other obligations under this Section 6, the Company  shall:  
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (i) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments to
the  Shelf Registration Statement and supplements to the prospectus 
contained therein as may be necessary to keep the Shelf  Registration
Statement effective for the Effectiveness Period;  
      
      |   (ii) furnish to the Original Shareholders (and to the 
underwriter of the securities being registered) a reasonable  number of
copies of the Shelf Registration Statement,  preliminary prospectus (if any),
final prospectus, and such  other documents as such Original Shareholders or
the underwriter  may reasonably request in order to facilitate the sale of
the  shares;  
      
      |   (iii) notify the Original Shareholders, promptly after
the  Company receives notice thereof, of the time when the Shelf 
Registration Statement has become effective or a supplement to  any
prospectus forming a part of the Shelf Registration  Statement has been
filed;  
      
      |   (iv) notify the Original Shareholders promptly of any 
request by the SEC for the amending or supplementing of the  Shelf
Registration Statement or prospectus or for additional  information;  
      
      |   (v) prepare and file with the SEC, promptly upon the 
request of the Original Shareholders, any amendments or  supplements to the
Shelf Registration Statement or prospectus  that, in the reasonable opinion
of counsel for the Original  Shareholders (and agreed with by counsel for the
Company), is  required under the Securities Act or the rules and
regulations  thereunder in connection with the distribution of the shares;  
      
      |   (vi) prepare and promptly file with the SEC, and
promptly  notify the Original Shareholders of, any filing of the amendment 
or supplement to the Shelf Registration Statement or prospectus  as may be
necessary to correct any statements or omissions if,  at the time when a
prospectus relating to those securities is  required to be delivered under
the Securities Act, the  prospectus or any other prospectus as then in effect
would  include an untrue statement of a  ##### 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to  make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances  in which
they were made, not misleading;  
      
      |   (vii) advise the Original Shareholders promptly after
it  receives notice of the issuance of any stop order by the SEC  suspending
the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement  or the initiation or
threatening of any proceeding for that  purpose and promptly use its
reasonable best efforts to prevent  the issuance of any stop order or to
obtain its withdrawal if a  stop order is issued; and  
      
      |   (viii) before filing any Shelf Registration Statement
or  prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto (other than  documents
incorporated by reference into such Shelf Registration  Statement), provide
to each Original Shareholder and its counsel  a copy of the document to be
filed and allow not less than five  (5) business days to review and comment
on such document.  
      
      |   (ix) include a provision in substantially the form 
presented in Section 5(d)(ix) above in any Shelf  Registration Statement and
any related prospectus.  
   

        |

      |   _7. Agreements with Respect to Underwriters._  
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (a) Any offering of shares made pursuant to a
registration  statement filed under Section 5 hereof shall be made  through
a underwritten public offering. Furthermore, during the  time a Shelf
Registration Statement is effective, Shareholders  may seek to sell shares
thereunder in underwritten public  offerings; provided, however, that the
Shareholders shall not  undertake more than three underwritten offerings
under the Shelf  Registration Statement, shall not undertake any such
offerings  any sooner or more frequently than as provided in  Section
5(a)(v) above, shall require as a precondition that  Shareholders holding at
least 25% of the total number of shares  of Company Common Stock then held by
all Shareholders have  agreed to participate in such offering, and that the
maximum  number of shares of Company Common Stock included in any such 
offering shall not exceed one-third of the total number of  shares of Company
Common Stock acquired by all Shareholders in  connection with the Merger. Any
underwritten public offering  made by the Shareholders under this Agreement
shall be made  through one or more underwriters that are selected by the 
requesting Shareholders and reasonably acceptable to the  Company; it being
understood that any disclosure with respect to  the Company shall be prepared
by the Company or otherwise  approved by the Company.  
      
      |   (b) If any shares of Company Common Stock are to be sold
in  an underwritten public offering, then the Company shall enter  into an
underwriting or similar agreement among the Company, the  selling Shareholder
or Shareholders and the underwriters of the  type customary for registered
underwritten secondary offerings  of equity securities, which agreement shall
include, without  limitation, customary provisions relating to:  (i)
representations and warranties of the Company and the  selling Shareholder or
Shareholders; (ii) receipt by the  underwriters of accountants "comfort"
letters in  customary form for registered offerings of equity securities; 
(iii) receipt by the underwriters of disclosure opinions of  nationally
recognized outside counsel to the Company reasonably  acceptable to the
underwriters; (iv) receipt by the  underwriters of other customary opinions,
certificates and  closing documents; and (v) indemnification of, and 
contribution in connection with the liability of, the  underwriters and their
control persons, which provisions  referred to in this clause (v) shall be
reasonably  satisfactory to the underwriter. In addition, the Company will 
afford such underwriters a reasonable opportunity to conduct a  "due
diligence" investigation with respect to the  Company customary in scope for
underwritten offerings of equity  securities, which shall include: (A) making
available for  inspection by any underwriter and any attorney, accountant
or  other agent or representative retained by any underwriter all  relevant
financial and other records, corporate documents and  properties of the
Company and its subsidiaries as the  underwriter may reasonably request and
(B) causing the  Companys officers, directors and employees to answer all 
questions and supply all information reasonably requested by any  such
underwriter, attorney, accountant, agent or representative.  As used in this
Agreement, the term " _underwritten public  offering_ " shall include a  ##### 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   transaction in which an investment bank or affiliate thereof 
sells shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to any  registration statement
filed pursuant to Section 5 hereof  or any Shelf Registration Statement in
order to hedge its  economic exposure to a derivative transaction entered
into  between a Shareholder or Shareholders and such investment bank  or
affiliate thereof.  
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   8. _Fees, Costs, and Expenses._ All fees and expenses 
other than underwriting discounts, selling commissions, fees and 
disbursements of counsel and accountants for the Shareholders,  and transfer
taxes, if any, incurred in connection with respect  to a registration under
Section 5 or Section 6 hereof,  shall be borne by the Company, including,
without limitation,  all registration, filing, NYSE, and NASD fees,
printing  expenses, fees and disbursements of counsel and accountants for 
the Company, and all internal expenses of the Company. Fees and 
disbursements of counsel and accountants for the Shareholders  participating
in the registration, any underwriting discounts,  commissions, and transfer
taxes shall be borne by such  Shareholders.  
      
      |   9. _Indemnification Relating to Registration._ With 
respect to a registration under Section 5 or Section 6  hereof:  
   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (i) The Company shall indemnify the participating 
Shareholders and the underwriter or underwriters (as defined in  the
Securities Act) for such Shareholders and each person, if  any, who controls
any such Shareholder or any underwriter within  the meaning of the Securities
Act, against any loss, damage,  liability, cost, or expense to which a
Shareholder, underwriter,  or controlling person becomes subject under the
Securities Act  or otherwise, insofar as such losses, damages, liabilities, 
costs, or expenses are caused by an untrue statement or alleged  untrue
statement of any material fact contained in the  registration statement, any
prospectus contained therein, or any  amendment or supplement thereto, or
arise out of or are based  upon the omission or alleged omission to state
therein a  material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make 
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which  they were
made, not misleading. The Company shall not be liable,  however, to the
extent that any such loss, damage, liability,  cost, or expense arises out of
or is based upon an untrue  statement or alleged untrue statement or omission
or alleged  omission so made in conformity with information furnished by a 
Shareholder, underwriter, or controlling person in writing  specifically for
use in the preparation thereof.  
      
      |   (ii) Each participating Shareholder shall indemnify the 
Company, its directors and officers, any controlling person, and  any
underwriter from any loss, damage, liability, cost, or  expense to which the
Company, any controlling person, or any  such underwriter becomes subject
under the Securities Act or  otherwise, insofar as the losses, damages,
liabilities, costs,  or expenses are caused by any untrue or alleged untrue
statement  of any material fact contained in such registration statement, 
any prospectus contained therein or any amendment or supplement  thereto, or
arise out of or are based upon the omission or the  alleged omission to state
therein a material fact required to be  stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in  light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not  misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, 
that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or  omission or
alleged omission was so made in reliance upon and in  conformity with written
information furnished by the Shareholder  specifically for use in the
preparation thereof, or the failure  of the Shareholder to comply with the
Securities Act, including  the prospectus-delivery requirements thereof.  
      
      |   (iii) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party
under  the provisions of paragraph (i) or (ii) of this  Section 5(g) of
notice of the commencement of any action  involving the subject matter of the
foregoing indemnity  provisions, the indemnified party shall, if a claim
thereof is  to be made against the indemnifying party under the provisions 
of paragraph (i) or (ii), promptly notify the indemnifying  party of the
commencement thereof; but any delay in so notifying  the indemnifying party
will not relieve it from any liability  which it may have to any indemnified
party, unless the  indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such delay.
If such  an action is brought against any indemnified party and it  notifies
the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the  indemnifying party
shall have the right to participate in, and,  to the extent that it may wish, ##### 

        |   
---|--- 
      |   assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to the 
indemnified party; _provided_ , _however_ , if the  defendants in any action
include both the indemnified party and  the indemnifying party and the
indemnified party reasonably  concludes that there may be legal defenses
available to it or  other indemnified parties that are different from or
additional  to those available to the indemnifying party, or if there is a 
conflict of interest that would prevent counsel for the  indemnifying party
from also representing the indemnified party,  the indemnified party shall
have the right to select separate  counsel to participate in the defense of
the action on its  behalf. After notice from the indemnifying party to the 
indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense  thereof, the
indemnifying party shall not be liable to the  indemnified party under the
provisions of paragraph (i) or  (ii) for any legal or other expense
subsequently incurred  by the indemnified party in connection with the
defense thereof  other than reasonable costs of investigation, unless the 
indemnified party employs counsel in accordance with the proviso  of the
preceding sentence, the indemnifying party does not  employ counsel
satisfactory to the indemnified party to  represent the indemnified party
within a reasonable time after  the notice of the commencement of the action,
or the  indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for  the
indemnified party at its expense.  
      
      |   (iv) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the 
provisions of this Section 9 shall be superceded by the  provisions contained
in any underwriting or similar agreement  described in Section 7(b) above.

      |   (a) Each Shareholder hereby represents and agrees
that  neither (i) such Shareholders entering into this  Agreement nor (ii)
such Shareholders carrying out the  provisions of this Agreement, will
violate any other agreement  (oral, written or other) to which such
Shareholder is a party or  by which such Shareholder is bound.  
      
      |   (b) The Company hereby represents and agrees that
neither  (a) the Companys entering into this Agreement nor  (b) the

      |   11. _Lock-Up._ If, at any time, the Company registers 
any of its common stock or any other equity securities under the  Securities
Act on a registration statement on Form S-1,  Form S-2 or Form S-3 (or an
equivalent general  registration form then in effect) for purposes of a
primary  offering, secondary offering or a combined offering, from the  time
that the Company files such registration statement with the  SEC until 90
days after the effectiveness of the  registration statement relating thereto
or such shorter period  as may be required by the managing underwriter or
underwriters  of such offering, the Shareholders will not offer, issue,
sell,  agree or commit to issue, or sell or grant any option for the 
purchase of or solicit any offer to buy, any shares of common  stock of the
Company, other than in connection with any shares  of Company Common Stock

may be necessary to register or  qualify the shares of Company Common Stock
under the securities  or "blue sky" laws of all states in which such shares 
of Company Common Stock are to be offered or sold (as reasonably  designated
by any Shareholder), and the Company shall use its  reasonable best efforts
to cause such filings to become  effective as soon as practicable and to
continue to be effective  for the Effectiveness Period. The Company shall
promptly notify  each Shareholder of any proceeding or threatened proceeding
to  prevent any registration or qualification statement filed under  the
securities or "blue sky" laws of any jurisdiction  from becoming effective or
to suspend or revoke the  effectiveness of any such registration or
qualification or to  suspend the registration or qualification of shares of
Company  Common Stock for sale under the securities or "blue  sky" laws of
any jurisdiction.  #####

registration statement, current report  on Form 8-K, proxy or information
statement, annual report  on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q 
(collectively, " _SEC Filings_ "). The Company  shall, upon request of a

Company, whether or not  such filing is incorporated or deemed incorporated
by reference  in any registration statement filed pursuant to this
Agreement.  
      
      |   14. _Successors and Assigns._ The terms and conditions 
of this Agreement may not be transferred or assigned, except in  connection
with the sale or transfer of Company Common Stock  that is permitted and
authorized in accordance with subsections  (ii) or (iii) of Section 3(a) of

preceding sentence shall be effective only if written notice of  such
assignment, identifying the name and address of such  assignee, is given to
the Company, and such assignee agrees in  writing to be bound by this
Agreement. Nothing in this  Agreement, express or implied, is intended to
confer upon any  party, other than the parties hereto or their respective 
successors and assigns, any rights, remedies, obligations or  liabilities
under or by reason of this Agreement, except as  expressly provided in this
Agreement.  
      
      |   15. _Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed 
by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the  State of
Indiana, without giving effect to the principles of  conflict of laws.  
      
      |   16. _Severability._ Each provision of this Agreement 
is severable. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be 
unenforceable or in violation of any statute, rule, regulation,  order or
decree of any governmental authority, court or agency,  then such provision
shall be modified to the minimum extent  necessary so as to render it
enforceable and cure such  violation, and all other provisions hereof shall
remain in full  force and effect notwithstanding such violation.  
      
      |   17. _Termination._ This Agreement shall terminate at 
such time as the Shareholders in the aggregate hold less than 5%  of the
shares of Company Common Stock.

and conditions of this  Agreement or to exercise any rights or remedies
