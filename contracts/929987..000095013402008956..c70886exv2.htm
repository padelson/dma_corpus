escrow agreement, substantially in the form attached hereto as

deliver to the Escrow Agent, no later than the first business

thereon and additions thereto, the &#147;<I>Escrowed
Funds</I>&#148;), and (b)&nbsp;Buyer and the Company will cause
the parties thereto to deliver to the Escrow Agent two duly
executed originals of the Amended and Restated Stent Delivery

2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Exchange and Payment

(each, a &#147;<I>Holder</I>&#148;) (a)&nbsp;a certificate
representing that number of shares of Buyer Common Stock into
which the shares of the Company Common Stock previously
represented by the Share Surrender Certificate are converted in
accordance with Section&nbsp;2.1(a)(i); <I>provided</I>,
<I>however</I>, that 8,181,818 of such shares of Buyer Common
Stock will be issued in the name of, and delivered to, the
Escrow Agent to be held on behalf of the Holders (in proportion
to their ownership of Company Common Stock, excluding Cash
Shares and Dissenting Shares) and distributed by the Escrow
Agent in accordance with an escrow agreement substantially in
the form of Exhibit&nbsp;A-2 hereto (the &#147;<I>Escrow Shares
Escrow Agreement</I>&#148;) and Section&nbsp;2.7 (with such
shares being referred to as the &#147;<I>Escrowed
Shares</I>&#148;), and (b)&nbsp;if such Share Surrender
Certificate represents Cash Shares, cash in the amount of the
Cash Consideration to which such Holder is entitled in
accordance with Section&nbsp;2.1. If the Merger Consideration is
to be delivered to any person other than the person in whose
name the Share Surrender Certificate delivered in exchange
therefor is registered in the transfer records of the Company,
the Merger Consideration may be delivered to a transferee if the
Share Surrender Certificate is presented to the Buyer,
accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and
effect that transfer and by evidence reasonably satisfactory to
Buyer that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.
Until delivered as contemplated by this Section&nbsp;2.3, the
shares of Company Common Stock represented by each Share
Surrender Certificate (other than a Share Surrender Certificate
representing shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled in
accordance with Section 2.1(b)) shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
upon delivery the Merger Consideration contemplated by this

payable hereunder to holders of Company Common Stock.

Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall
be paid to the Shareholder of any undelivered Share Surrender
Certificate with respect to the Buyer Common Stock represented
until the holder of record of such Share Surrender Certificate
shall deliver such Share Surrender Certificate. Subject to the
effect of unclaimed property, escheat and other applicable laws,
following delivery of any such Share Surrender Certificate,
there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates
representing whole shares of Buyer Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor (or the person who would be the record holder
if fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock were issued in
exchange therefor), without interest, (i)&nbsp;at the time of
such delivery, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such whole shares of Buyer Common Stock and

Shareholders upon conversion of shares of Company Common Stock

pertaining to those shares of Company Common Stock.

Certificates are presented to Buyer for any reason, the shares
represented thereby shall be exchanged as provided in this

of Buyer Common Stock shall be issued.

Tape, rounded to the nearest whole dollar for the period of 15
consecutive trading days ending on the fifth day before the
Final Pricing Date.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;If the Final Average Price is equal to or less than
$55, then, on the Final Pricing Date, the Escrow Agent will
cause certificates representing all of the Escrowed Shares to be
delivered to, and issued in the name of, the Holder on behalf of
which such Escrowed Shares were being held. If the Final Average
Price is greater than $55, then, on the Final Pricing Date, the
Escrow Agent will cause certificates representing the
appropriate number of Escrowed Shares indicated on
<I>Exhibit&nbsp;E</I> hereto to be delivered to Buyer and cause
certificates representing the remaining Escrowed Shares, if any,
to be delivered to, and issued in the name of, the Holder on
behalf of which such Escrowed Shares were being held;
<I>provided</I>, <I>however</I>, that the distribution of shares
to the Buyer will be done in such a manner so as not to alter
the relative percentage of remaining Escrowed Shares to which
each Holder is entitled.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;The Buyer will cooperate with the Escrow Agent, will
deliver (or cause its transfer agent to deliver) such additional
certificates representing shares of Buyer Common Stock issued in
such names and amounts as the Escrow Agent may reasonably
request, and take such other actions as the Escrow Agent may
reasonably request in order to consummate the Final Distribution
in accordance with this Section&nbsp;2.7.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d)&nbsp;To the extent that the Escrow Agent receives any
dividends or distributions with respect to any given Escrowed
Share, such dividends and distributions will be held by the
Escrow Agent and distributed by the Escrow Agent to the party to
which the Escrow Agent delivers such Escrowed Share.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, or as
specifically disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by
the Company to Buyer pursuant to Section&nbsp;8.5 (the
&#147;<I>Company Disclosure Schedule</I>&#148;), the Company
hereby represents and warrants to Buyer as follows:

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Organization and Good
Standing.</I> Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has all
requisite corporate or similar powers and authority and
possesses all franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations,
consents, orders and approvals, and has made each registration,
declaration or filing with any governmental authority or any
other person, necessary to enable it to own, lease or otherwise
hold its properties and assets and to conduct its businesses as
currently conducted (except for any failure to possess a Permit
or make a registration, declaration or filing that could not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect). Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries is duly qualified to conduct business and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is
necessary, except where the failure to be duly qualified or in
good standing could not be reasonably expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has delivered to Buyer (or permitted Buyer to inspect)
true and complete copies of the Articles of Incorporation of the
Company as currently in effect, the Bylaws of the Company as
currently in effect, and the comparable charter and
organizational documents of each Subsidiary, in each case as
currently in effect. &#147;<I>Material Adverse Effect</I>&#148;
means with respect to the Company or Buyer, as applicable, a
material adverse effect upon the business, operations, results
of operations, properties, or financial condition of that party
and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, or on that party&#146;s
ability to consummate the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Capital Stock.</I> The

25&nbsp;million Class&nbsp;L-D1 shares, 25&nbsp;million
Class&nbsp;L-D2 shares, 25&nbsp;million Class&nbsp;L-D3 shares,

caused by permitted issuances of or permitted transfers of
Company Common Stock that occur after the date of this
Agreement. The shares of Company Common Stock identified on
Section&nbsp;4.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule are the only
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company.
Each share of the Company Common Stock is duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and no shares of
the Company Common Stock were issued in violation of the
Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company, any
provision of law or any pre-emptive right of any person. No
pre-emptive rights exist with respect to any equity interest of
the Company. The shares of Company Common Stock identified on
Section&nbsp;4.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule represent
each and every equity interest of any nature in the Company, and
no person or entity of any nature holds, or is entitled to

of shares of Company Common Stock, issuable to such persons, and
at such exercise prices as are set forth in Section&nbsp;4.2 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule), warrant, convertible
instrument or security, put, call, contract or commitment of any
nature whereby any person or entity has or may receive any
interest in or right to acquire any common stock of the Company
or any other equity interest of any nature in the Company (other

been duly executed and delivered by the Company and is a valid
and binding obligation and agreement of the Company enforceable

interference, infringement or misappropriation (including any
offers to license, or any claim that the Company must license or
refrain from using any right); and (iii)&nbsp;the Company has
not received any charge, complaint, claim, demand or notice
which challenges the legality, validity, enforceability, use or

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp;Founder hereby specifically acknowledges and agrees
that (i)&nbsp;this Article&nbsp;11 and each provision hereof are
reasonable and necessary to ensure that Buyer receives the
expected benefits of the Merger, (ii)&nbsp;Buyer has refused to
enter into this Agreement in the absence of this
Article&nbsp;11, and (iii)&nbsp;violation of this
Article&nbsp;11 will harm Buyer to such an extent that monetary
damages alone would be an inadequate remedy.

(b)&nbsp;Therefore, in the event of any violation by Founder of
any provision of this Article&nbsp;11, (i)&nbsp;Buyer (in
addition to all other remedies Buyer may have) shall be entitled
to a temporary restraining order, injunction and other equitable
relief (without posting any bond or other security) restraining
Founder from committing or continuing such violation and
(ii)&nbsp;in the case of any violation of Section&nbsp;11.1
hereof, the duration of the Non-Compete Period shall be extended
beyond its then-scheduled termination date for a period equal to
the duration of the violation. If any provision or application
of this Article&nbsp;11 is held unlawful or unenforceable in any
respect, this Article&nbsp;11 shall be revised or applied in a
manner that renders it lawful and enforceable to the fullest
extent possible.

    federal income tax purposes since it is to the mutual advantage
    of Company and Manager to defer the payments provided for under

    shall be Mercer Capital, Inc. of Memphis, Tennessee; the
    appraisal division of Ernst&nbsp;&#38; Young&nbsp;LLP,
    headquartered in Dallas,&nbsp;Texas; or any appraiser that
    Manager chooses from a list of independent appraisers approved
    by the Company from time to time. Once selected, the Appraiser
    shall have a reasonable amount of time to determine such Fair
    Market Value and provide its determination of Fair Market Value,
    including its methodology and formula for calculating Fair
    Market Value, to the Company and Manager. Unless the Company
    gives written notice of a reasonable and good-faith objection to
    the Fair Market Value as stated in such report or the
    methodology or formula used by the Appraiser in determining the
    Fair Market Value before the close of business on the
    15<SUP>th</SUP> day after receipt thereof, the Fair Market Value
    determined by the Appraiser shall become binding on such
    15<SUP>th</SUP> day and shall be the &#147;<I>Final Fair Market
    Value.</I>&#148; If the Company gives written notice to Manager
    before the close of business on such 15<SUP>th</SUP> day of a
    reasonable and good-faith objection to any material aspect(s) of
    the Fair Market Value as stated in such report or the
    methodology or formula used by the Appraiser in determining the
    Fair Market Value, then all aspects of the methodology and
    formula other than those material aspects as to which the
    reasonable and good-faith objection was made shall become
    binding, and the Company and Manager shall discuss the
    objection. If the Company and the Manager agree in writing to a
    revision in the methodology or formula for determining Fair
    Market Value which results in a recalculation of the Fair Market
    Value, then such recalculated Fair Market Value shall be the
    Final Fair Market Value. If the Company and Manager do not
    execute such a written agreement within 15&nbsp;days after
    notice of objection, then the parties shall submit the matter(s)
    objected to (and only such matter(s)) to the appraisal division
    of Pricewaterhouse Coopers LLP or such other appraiser on whom
    the parties shall mutually agree (the &#147;<I>Second
    Appraiser</I>&#148;) to resolve the matter(s) and submit a
    recalculated Fair Market Value, which determination shall be
    binding on Manager and the Company. &#147;Fair Market
    Value&#148; shall be determined by the Appraiser or the Second
    Appraiser, as the case may be, applying customary appraisal
    standards on a consistent basis with previous appraisals under
    this Agreement and shall be equal to the net amount that a
    willing buyer would pay to a willing seller for the Company,
    neither being under any compulsion to buy or sell or grant
    rights, and both having reasonable knowledge of all relevant
    facts. The fees and expenses of any Appraiser and the Second
    Appraiser shall be borne solely by the Company.</TD>

    statement filed pursuant thereto, if: (i), in the good faith and
    reasonable judgment of the Company, such compliance or sales

    stock (including during the effectiveness of any registration

    concludes in its good faith and reasonable judgment that such
    compliance or sales would materially adversely affect the
    success of the offering. If the Company invokes this
    Section&nbsp;5(b), then the Company shall give prompt written
    notice, on a confidential basis, of the postponement to the
    requesting Shareholders. In addition, each Shareholder agrees to
    promptly suspend sales under the registration statement during

    December&nbsp;31, 2005, the Company determines to proceed with
    the preparation and filing of a registration statement under the
    Securities Act in connection with the proposed underwritten
    public offering of shares of the common stock of the Company for
    cash, the Company shall give written notice thereof to each
    Shareholder then holding shares of Company Common Stock acquired
    in connection with the Merger. Upon the written request of any
    such Shareholder given within ten days after the date of any
    such notice from the Company, the Company shall cause all shares
    of Company Common Stock to which any such Shareholder has
    requested registration to be included in the registration
    statement, all to the extent requisite to permit the sale or
    other disposition by such Shareholder of the shares to be so
    registered; <I>provided, however</I>, that nothing shall prevent
    the Company from abandoning or delaying any such registration
    initiated by it. The Company may require that the shares of
    Company Common Stock requested for inclusion by Shareholders
    pursuant to this Section&nbsp;5(c) be included in the
    underwriting on the same terms and conditions as the shares of
    common stock of the Company otherwise being sold to the
    underwriters. If in the discretion of the managing underwriter
    of such public offering the inclusion of all of the shares of
    Company Common Stock originally covered by request for inclusion
    in such registration made by any Shareholders would reduce the
    number of shares of common stock of the Company to be offered by
    the Company or interfere with the successful marketing of the
    shares of common stock of the Company offered by the Company,
    the number of shares owned by any Shareholder and otherwise to
    be included in the underwritten public offering may be reduced
    or eliminated pro rata, in accordance with the original
    requested amounts, among such Shareholders requesting inclusion
    in such registration.</TD>
