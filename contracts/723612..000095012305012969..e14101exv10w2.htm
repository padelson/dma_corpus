Code. No Company Plan provides welfare benefits (including,

to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Debt Financing").
Attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ is a true and complete copy of the equity
commitment letter (the "Equity Financing Commitment" and together with
the Debt Financing Commitments, the "Financing Commitments"), pursuant to
which certain affiliates of Apollo Management V, L.P. ("Apollo") have
committed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to invest
the amount set forth therein to purchase Equity Interests of Buyer
(the "Equity Financing" and together with the Debt Financing, the
"Financing"). None of the Financing Commitments have been amended or modified
prior to the date of this Agreement, and the respective commitments contained
in the Financing Commitments have not been withdrawn or rescinded in
any respect. The Financing Commitments are in full force and effect. There
are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of
the full amount of the Financing, other than as set forth in or contemplated
by the    ##### 

  

   

Financing Commitments. The aggregate proceeds to be disbursed pursuant to the
agreements contemplated by the Financing Commitments, will be sufficient for
Buyer to pay the aggregate Closing Consideration and to pay all related fees
and expenses. The Fee Letter referenced in the Debt Financing Commitments
(which has not been made available to Seller) does not contain any provisions
that directly or indirectly function as conditions to the funding of such
commitments or otherwise make such finding less likely to occur (assuming
payment by Buyer of all fees payable thereunder).  

(h) _Brokers  Fees_. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or
other person, is entitled to any brokers, finders, financial advisors or
other similar fee, expenses or commission in connection with this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated for which Seller or any of its Affiliates
would be liable.  

(i) _No Reliance_. Buyer acknowledges that it has conducted to its
satisfaction an independent investigation of the financial condition,
liabilities, results of operations and projected operations of the Companies
and their Subsidiaries and the nature and condition of their respective
properties and assets and the Business and, in making the determination
to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, has relied solely on the results of its own independent
investigation and the representations and warranties set forth in Section
3.1. Buyer acknowledges that none of Seller, the Companies or their
Subsidiaries nor any other Person has made any representation or warranty,
express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any information
regarding the Companies or their Subsidiaries, the Business or other matters
that is not included in this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, none of Seller, the Companies or their Subsidiaries nor any
other Person has made a representation or warranty to Buyer with respect to
(a) any projections, estimates or budgets for the Business, the Companies or
their Subsidiaries, or (b) any material, documents or information relating to
any of the Companies or their Subsidiaries made available to Buyer or its
Representatives in any data room or otherwise, except as expressly covered by
a representation or warranty set forth in Section 3.1.  

(j) _Disclaimer of Warranties_. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION OF THIS
AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, ACQUIRORS MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES TO
SELLER IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT,
EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN THIS ARTICLE III. ALL OTHER
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE DISCLAIMED
BY BUYER.  

(k) _FSA Approval._ Except as previously disclosed to Seller, neither
Buyer nor any of its Affiliates have actual knowledge of any facts or any
reason that would cause the FSA to withhold or delay its consent to the
proposed acquisition of control (such term having the meaning ascribed
thereto in section 179 of FSMA) of Cims Limited by Buyer and each other person
that is a proposed controller pursuant to section 184 of FSMA.    #####

(A) 1,000 shares of Parent Common Stock, of which 100 shares are issued and
outstanding and (B) 1,000 shares of Parent Preferred Stock, of which no
shares are issued and outstanding. Except as contemplated by this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, as of the date hereof, there are no
outstanding Equity Interests, options, warrants, rights or agreements or
other commitments pursuant to which Parent is or may become obligated
to issue any shares of its Equity Interests. All of the outstanding shares of
Parent Common Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued, have not
been issued in violation of any preemptive rights, rights of first refusal or
other third party rights, and are fully paid and nonassessable. All shares of
Parent Preferred Stock and Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the

issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Other than as set forth above, as of
the date hereof, Parent has no other Equity Interests authorized, reserved for

the Parent Preferred Stock or Parent Common Stock.

advertising was used by Parent or its representatives in connection with the

accuracy of each of Parents representations and warranties set forth in
section 3.2 hereof, no registration of the Parent Preferred Stock, pursuant to
the provisions of the Securities Act or any state securities or "blue sky"
laws, will be required by the offer, sale or issuance of the Parent Preferred
Stock. Parent agrees that neither it, nor anyone acting on its behalf, shall
offer to sell the Parent Preferred Stock or any other securities of Parent so
as to require the registration of the Parent Preferred Stock pursuant to the
provisions of the Securities Act or any state securities or "blue sky" laws,
unless such Parent Preferred Stock or other securities are so
registered.    ##### 

  

 

(o) _Reservation of Parent Common Stock._ Prior to the Closing, Parent
will have available for issuance such number of its authorized but unissued
shares of (i) Parent Common Stock as will be sufficient to permit the
exercise in full of all Parent Warrants and (ii) Parent Preferred Stock as
will be sufficient to permit the issuance of Parent Preferred Shares as
contemplated by this Agreement. All shares of (i) Parent Common Stock
issuable pursuant to the terms of the Parent Warrants, when issued upon
exercise thereof, with payment therefor in accordance with the terms thereof,
and (ii) Parent Preferred Shares, in each case, issuable pursuant to
this Agreement, shall be duly and validly issued and fully paid and

any of the Companies or their Subsidiaries on the Closing Date, including
employees not actively at work due to injury, vacation, military duty,

and compensation to Affected Employees that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than those provided to such persons immediately prior to the
Closing Date whether arising under a Company Plan or any plan sponsored by
Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Companies and their

provide for equity awards or grants, and equity awards or grants or awards

any current or former Affiliate of the Companies or any predecessor, to the
extent previously recognized under the Company Plans), shall be taken into
account for purposes of determining, as applicable, the eligibility for
participation and vesting of any employee under all employee benefit plans
offered by Buyer or a Subsidiary of Buyer to the Affected Employees,

conditions under the applicable medical plan of Buyer or a Subsidiary of
Buyer to the extent such limitation did not apply to the Affected Employee
under the medical employee benefit plan of any of the Companies or their
Subsidiaries or their Affiliates that covered the Affected Employee on
the Closing Date, and (ii) credit each Affected Employee with all deductible
payments and co-payments paid by such employee under the medical employee
benefit plan of the Companies or their Affiliates prior to the Closing Date
during the year in which the Closing occurs for the purpose of determining
the extent to which any such employee has satisfied his or her deductible
and whether he or she has reached the out-of-pocket maximum under any medical
plan of Buyer or a Subsidiary of Buyer for such year.  

(b) The Affected Employees shall not accrue benefits under any Company
Plan not sponsored by the Companies on and after the Closing Date.
Prior    #####

least December 30, 2006, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
provide each Affected Employee with severance benefits that are no less
favorable than those that would have been provided to such Affected Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date under the Cendant Corporation
Severance Pay Plan for Non-Officer Employees or, if applicable, the severance
benefits set forth on Section 4.2(c) of the _Seller Disclosure Schedule_ ,
each as in effect on the Closing Date.  

(d) Buyer shall take all actions necessary to assume and honor the
Company Plans other than the Retained Company Plans. Buyer shall be solely
responsible for all liabilities relating to the amendment, termination or
alleged termination of any Company Plan other than the Retained

termination of employment and whether such termination is for Cause (as
defined in the applicable Retention Letter) of any individual who is party to
a "Retention Letter" listed on Section 3.1(r)(i) of the _Seller Disclosure
Schedule_.  

Section 4.3 _Publicity_. Buyer and Seller agree to communicate with each other
and cooperate with each other prior to any public disclosure of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer and Seller agree that no
public release or announcement concerning the terms of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the prior consent
of Buyer and Seller, except as such release or announcement, upon the advice
of outside counsel, may be required by Law or the rules and regulations of
any stock exchange upon which the securities of Seller are listed, in which
case the party required to make the release or announcement shall allow the
other parties reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in
advance of such issuance.  

Section 4.4 _Confidentiality_   

(a) Buyer and its Representatives (as such term is defined in the

obtained in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby as confidential in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement. The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement are
hereby incorporated by reference and shall continue in full force and effect

their respective Subsidiaries and their books and records, and shall furnish
Buyer with such financial, operating and other data and information with
respect to the Business (including management reports), as Buyer, through its
officers, employees or agents, may reasonably request, including without
limitation, auditors work papers (subject to execution by Buyer of customary
agreements). In exercising its rights hereunder, Buyer shall conduct itself
so as not to unreasonably interfere in the conduct of the business of the
Companies and their Subsidiaries prior to Closing. Buyer acknowledges

including projections, financial or other information relating thereto or
(ii) information if doing so would violate any Company Contract or Law to
which Seller or any of its Affiliates (including the Companies and
their Subsidiaries) is a party or is subject or which would result in a loss
of the ability to successfully assert a claim of privilege (including without
limitation, the attorney-client and work product privileges) or (iii)
consolidated, combined, unitary or similar Tax Return of which Seller or any
of its Affiliates (other than any of the Companies or their Subsidiaries) is
the common parent (other than    ##### 

  

   

schedules relating solely to the Company and their Subsidiaries) or any other

financial position of the Companies and their Subsidiaries as of the dates
thereof and their combined results of operations, changes in combined equity
and cash flows for the periods then ended, in each case, as if such quarter
end was the Companies and their Subsidiaries fiscal year end.

audit and review opinions. Buyer shall reimburse Seller and its Affiliates
for any out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Seller in connection
with this Section 4.5(d) and shall indemnify Seller and its Affiliate for
any Liabilities in connection therewith (except to the extent resulting from
breach by Seller of this Agreement).    #####

or advisable under applicable Laws and regulations to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions
contemplated hereby, including, but not limited to: (i) the satisfaction of
the conditions precedent to the obligations of any of the parties hereto;
(ii) the obtaining of applicable consents, waivers or approvals of any third
parties; (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings,
whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the
performance of the obligations hereunder; and (iv) the execution and delivery
of such instruments, and the taking of such other actions as the other party
hereto may reasonably require in order to carry out the intent of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Seller, the Companies or
any of their respective Affiliates shall be obligated to make any payments or

commercially    ##### 

  

   

reasonable actions as may be necessary or advisable to assist Buyer in
submitting claims for pre-Closing occurrences to which such policies are
responsive; _provided_ that Buyer shall be responsible for any deductibles or
co-payments legally due and owing relating to such claims and Seller shall
not be required to maintain such policies beyond their current terms.

off/tail coverage for the Companies and their Subsidiaries covering any
occurrence, act, omission or event occurring and Liability or
condition existing prior to Closing that were covered prior to the Closing
under Sellers and its Subsidiaries (other than the Companies and their
Subsidiaries) Claims Made Insurance policies. Such run off/tail coverage will
provide coverage for claims made or reported a minimum of six years after the
Closing Date and will be reasonably satisfactory to Buyer in form and
substance.  

(c) Sellers obligations under Section 4.10(a) shall include, without
limitation, Seller assigning or causing the relevant Subsidiary to assign to
Buyer or one or more of its Subsidiaries rights in respect of its historic
Occurrence Based Policies, providing timely written notice of such claims to
the third party insurer (with a copy of any such notice to be given by Seller

summaries, for a period of five years of Closing.

and (iii) collectively, the "Continuing Agreements") all Contracts, written
or oral, between any of the Companies or their Subsidiaries, on the one hand,

further Liabilities or obligations of any of the relevant parties
thereunder.  

(b) Except as set forth on Section 4.11(b) of the _Seller Disclosure
Schedule_ , all inter-company accounts, whether payables or receivables,
between Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than any of the Companies and
their    ##### 

  

   

Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and any of the Companies and their

Seller in its sole discretion) prior to the Closing Date.  

(c) Subject to any necessary consents, Seller shall cause and shall cause
its Subsidiaries (other than the Companies and their Subsidiaries) to cause
all assets and property related exclusively to the Business (other than Cash

by Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Companies and
their Subsidiaries) to be transferred to one of the Companies or one of their
Subsidiaries without any consideration.  

(d) (i) With respect to software currently used by the Companies or their
Subsidiaries and for which licenses for such software were purchased under
any of the "Master License Agreements" set forth in Section 3.1(n)(i)(8) of

licenses purchased thereunder for use by the Companies or their Subsidiaries,
the "Existing Licenses"), Seller will (A) seek, in accordance with Section
4.26 of this Agreement, any necessary consents to assign the Existing
Licenses (but for avoidance of doubt, not to assign the Master Software
Agreements) to the Companies, and (B) use commercially reasonable efforts to
assist the Companies in obtaining agreements for acquisition of new software
and for maintenance renewals to replace such Master Software Agreements; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that Seller makes no representations, warranties or
covenants that pricing or other terms under such replacement agreements will
be comparable to those contained in the Master Software Agreements.  

(ii) With respect to software used by Seller or its Affiliates (other than
the Companies or their Subsidiaries) to provide services under the Master
Transition Services Agreement, and for which the Companies or their
Subsidiaries will have to obtain a replacement license to use such software

Services Agreement, Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to assist
the Companies in obtaining such replacement license agreements;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Seller makes no representations, warranties or covenants
that pricing or other terms under such replacement agreements will be
comparable to those contained in Sellers own agreements with the applicable
vendors of such software.  

(iii) Other than with respect to (A) costs for third party consents for Seller
and its Affiliates (other than the Companies and their Subsidiaries) to
operate such software described in 4.11(d)(i) and 4.1(d)(ii) above under the

obligations shall be subject to the provisions of Section 4.26(c)), the
Companies will be responsible for the costs associated with such replacement
agreements described in Sections 4.11(d)(i)(B) and 4.11(d)(ii).  

Section 4.12 _Debt; Release of Guarantees_.  

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate and shall
use their respective reasonable best efforts to, effective as of the Closing
Date, (i) terminate or cause to be terminated, or cause Buyer or one of its
Affiliates to be substituted in all respects for Seller and any of its
Affiliates or former Affiliates (other than any of the Companies and
their Subsidiaries) (collectively, the "Released Parties") in respect of all
obligations of the Released Parties under, any guarantee of or relating to

Company Lease) of any of the Companies and their Subsidiaries in each case
listed on Section 4.12 of the _Seller Disclosure Schedule_  ("Guarantees")
and (ii) cause Buyer or one of its Affiliates to have Surety Bonds (and
any necessary collateral, indemnity or other agreements associated therewith)
issued on behalf of Buyer or one of its Affiliates in replacement of all
Surety Bonds (and all collateral, indemnity and other agreements associated
therewith) listed on Section 4.12 of the _Seller Disclosure Schedule_ issued
on behalf of the Released Parties for the benefit of any of the Companies
or their Subsidiaries (the "Surety Bonds"). In the case of the failure to do
so by the by the Closing Date, then, Seller and Buyer shall continue to
cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to terminate, or
cause Buyer or one of its Affiliates to be substituted in all respects for
the Released Parties in respect of, all obligations of the Released

renew or extend the term of or (B) increase its obligations under, or
transfer to another third party, any loan, lease, Contract or other
obligation for which any Released Party is or would reasonably be expected
to be liable under such Guarantee and Surety Bond. To the extent that any
Released Party has performance obligations under any such Guarantee or Surety
Bond, Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) perform such obligations
on behalf of such Released Party or (ii) otherwise take such action as
reasonably requested by Seller so as to put such Released Party in the
same position as if Buyer, and not such Released Party, had performed or were
performing such obligations.  

(b) Seller shall take all necessary action to insure that the Companies
and their Subsidiaries have no Indebtedness (other than with respect of
capital leases) immediately prior to and at the Closing except to the extent
otherwise requested by Buyer.    #####

thereto.

applicable Affinity Partner Contract between Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than the Companies and their Subsidiaries), on the one
hand, and the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries, on the other hand. In
furtherance thereof, as soon as practicable but in no event later than six (6)

and the Subsidiaries to remove, strike over or otherwise obliterate all
Cendant Marks from all assets and other materials owned by the Companies and
their Subsidiaries, including, without limitation, any vehicles, business
cards, schedules, stationery, packaging materials, displays, signs,
promotional materials, manuals, forms, websites, email, computer software and
other materials and systems. Any use by the Companies or any of their
Subsidiaries of any of the Cendant Marks as permitted in this Section 4.14(a)
is subject to their compliance with the quality control requirements
and guidelines in effect for the Cendant Marks as of the Closing Date.  

(b) Following the Closing, Seller shall and shall cause its Affiliates

Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and the Companies or any of their
Subsidiaries, on the other hand. In furtherance thereof,    ##### 

  

   

as soon as practicable but in no event later than six (6) months following the
Closing Date, Seller shall cause its Affiliates to remove, strike over or
otherwise obliterate all Company Marks from all assets and other materials
owned by Seller or its Affiliates, including, without limitation, any
vehicles, business cards, schedules, stationery, packaging materials,
displays, signs, promotional materials, manuals, forms, websites, email,
computer software and other materials and systems. Any use by Seller or its
Affiliates of any of the Company Marks as permitted in this Section 4.14(b)
is subject to their compliance with the quality control requirements and
guidelines in effect for the Company Marks as of the Closing Date.  

Section 4.15 _Tax Matters_.  

(a) _Tax Return Preparation_.  

(i) To the extent not filed prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall
prepare (or cause to be prepared) all Tax Returns that are required to be
filed by each of the Companies and their Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax
Periods (each, a "Pre-Closing Period Tax Return"). All such Pre-Closing
Period Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner that is consistent with the
prior practice of the Companies and their Subsidiaries, except as reasonably
approved by Buyer. Buyer shall allow Seller access to any and all data
and information necessary for the preparation of such Pre-Closing Period Tax
Returns and shall cooperate fully with the Seller in the preparation of such
Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns;  _provided_ , that no employee of Buyer, any
Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be required to sign any such Tax
Return without, at the request of such employee, being fully indemnified by
Seller for any liability incurred as a consequence of signing such Tax
Return. With respect to each Pre-Closing Period Tax Return filed after the
Closing Date, no later than thirty days prior to the due date (taking into
account any valid extensions thereof) ("Due Date") for the filing of
such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return, the Seller shall submit, or cause to be
submitted, to the Buyer for its review drafts of such Pre-Closing Period Tax
Return (together with all related work papers). Within ten days following
Buyers receipt of such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return, Buyer shall have the
right to object to such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return (by written notice to
the Seller). If Buyer does not object by written notice to the Seller within
such time period, such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return shall be deemed to have
been accepted and agreed upon, and final and conclusive, for purposes of this
Section 4.15(a)(i). If Buyer objects to such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return,
it shall notify the Seller of such disputed item (or items) (in such written
notice) and the basis for its objection and the Buyer and Seller shall act in
good faith to resolve any such dispute as promptly as practicable. If the
Buyer and Seller have not reached agreement regarding such dispute, the
dispute shall be presented to the Independent Accounting Firm,
whose determination shall be binding upon both Buyer and Seller, _provided_
,  _however_ , that (i) such determination shall be limited to whether the
disputed item is consistent with past practices, if applicable, and (ii) the
Buyer    ##### 

  

  

and Seller shall require the Independent Accounting Firm to make a
determination within ten (10) days but in no event later than five (5) days
prior to the Due Date of such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return. With respect to
each such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return, no later than two (2) days prior to
the Due Date of such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return, (x) the Seller shall
submit to the Buyer final drafts of such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return
and (y) the Seller shall pay to the Buyer an amount equal to the liability
for Taxes that are shown to be due and payable on the face of such Pre-
Closing Period Tax Return. The Buyer shall cause the applicable Company or
Subsidiary (as the case may be) to file each Pre-Closing Period Tax Return
and pay to the applicable Tax authority all amounts shown to be due and
payable on the face of such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return.  

(ii) The Buyer shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) all Tax Returns that
are required to be filed by each of the Companies and their Subsidiaries for
all Straddle Periods (each, a "Straddle Period Tax Return"). All such
Straddle Period Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed in a manner that is
consistent with the prior practice of the Companies and their Subsidiaries,
except as required by applicable Law. With respect to each Straddle Period
Tax Return, no later than thirty days prior to the Due Date for the filing of
such Straddle Period Tax Return, the Buyer shall submit, or cause to
be submitted, to the Seller for its review drafts of such Straddle Period Tax
Return (together with all related work papers), and shall notify Seller of
Buyers calculation of the Taxes of such Straddle Period allocated to the
Interim Period of such Straddle Period (in accordance with this Agreement).
Within ten days following Sellers receipt of such Straddle Period Tax Return
(and the calculation of the Taxes allocated to the Interim Period of the
Straddle Period), Seller shall have the right to object to such
Straddle Period Tax Return or calculation (by written notice to the Buyer).
If Seller does not object by written notice to the Buyer within such time
period, such Straddle Period Tax Return and calculation shall be deemed to
have been accepted and agreed upon, and final and conclusive, for purposes of
this Section 4.15(a)(ii). If Seller objects to such Straddle Period Tax
Return and/or calculation of the Taxes allocated to the Interim Period of
the Straddle Period (in accordance with this Agreement), it shall notify the
Buyer of such disputed item (or items) (in such written notice) and the basis
for its objection and the Seller and Buyer shall act in good faith to resolve
any such dispute as promptly as practicable. If the Seller and Buyer have not
reached agreement regarding such dispute, the dispute shall be presented to
the Independent Accounting Firm, whose determination shall be binding upon
both Seller and Buyer, _provided_ , _however_ , that the Seller and Buyer
shall require the Independent Accounting Firm to make a determination within
ten (10) days but in no event later than five (5) days prior to the Due Date
of such Straddle Period Tax Return. With respect to each Straddle Period Tax
Return, no later than two (2) days prior to the Due Date of such Straddle
Period Tax Return, Seller shall pay to the Buyer an amount equal to the
Sellers portion of the liability for Taxes of such Straddle Period (that are
shown to be due and payable on the face of such Straddle Period Tax Return)
that are allocable to the    ##### 

  

  

Interim Period in accordance with this Agreement. The Buyer shall cause the
applicable Company or Subsidiary (as the case may be) to file each Straddle
Period Tax Return and pay to the applicable Tax authority all amounts shown
to be due and payable on the face of such Straddle Period Tax Return.  

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each party
shall be responsible for its own costs and expenses incurred in connection
with this Section 4.15(a), _provided_ , _however_ , that all costs and
expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be paid fifty percent by
the Seller and fifty percent by the Buyer.  

(b) _Tax Refunds_. The Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to the Seller
(a) all refunds of Taxes paid by the Companies or their Subsidiaries for a
Pre-Closing Tax Period that are received by the Companies or their
Subsidiaries after the Closing, and (b) a portion of all refunds of Taxes
paid by the Companies or their Subsidiaries for any Straddle Period (such
portion to be allocated consistent with the principles set forth in this
Agreement) that are received by the Companies or their Subsidiaries after the
Closing, in each case, (i) net of any Taxes imposed on or attributable to
such refund and (ii) other than refunds attributable to a carryback of
net operating losses attributable to periods beginning after the Closing Date
or the portion of any Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date.  

(c) _Tax Matters Cooperation_. Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates (including in the case of the Buyer, the
Companies and their Subsidiaries) to, cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns of or attributable to any of the Companies or their Subsidiaries
and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other partys request)
the provision of records and information reasonably relevant to any such
audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder. The Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates (including in the case of the Buyer, the
Companies and their Subsidiaries) to, (i) retain all books and records with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to each of the Companies and their
Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning on or before the Closing
Date until expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent
notified by Buyer or Seller, any extensions thereof) of the respective
taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into
with any taxing authority and (ii) to give the other party reasonable written
notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and
records and, if the other party so requests, shall allow the requesting party
to take possession of such books and records.    ##### 

  

 

(d) _Section _ _338(h)(10)_ _Elections._   

(i) Seller and Buyer agree that an election under Section 338 of the Code (or
similar provision of the Law of any state or other Taxing jurisdiction) shall
not be made with respect to any of the Companies or their Subsidiaries in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, Buyer and Seller shall jointly make a timely and effective
election provided for by Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and Section
1.338(h)(10)-1 of the United States Treasury regulations promulgated under
the Code ("Treasury Regulations") and any comparable election under state,
local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the acquisition by Buyer (which, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, qualifies as a "qualified stock purchase"
by Buyer) of the stock of each of the direct and indirect domestic wholly-
owned corporations being acquired pursuant to this Agreement (each,
an "Election" and, collectively, the "Elections"). Buyer and Seller shall,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates (including, in the case of the
Buyer, the Companies and their Subsidiaries) to, cooperate with each other to
take all actions necessary and appropriate, including filing such additional
forms, returns, elections, schedules and other documents as may be required,
to effect and preserve timely Elections in accordance with the provisions of
Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 of the
Treasury Regulations (and any comparable provisions of state, local or
foreign Tax Law) or any successor provisions. Unless required by a final,
non-appealable, decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, Buyer and
Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates (including, in the
case of the Buyer, the Companies and their Subsidiaries) to, report
the acquisition by Buyer of the stock of such domestic corporations
consistently with the Elections made and shall take no position inconsistent
therewith in any Tax Return, any proceeding before any Tax authority or
otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the
event that the Internal Revenue Service or other Taxing authority challenges
Sellers treatment of any acquisition of a wholly-owned domestic
corporate Subsidiary of CMG as a "qualified stock purchase" (within the
meaning of Section 338(d)(3) of the Code), Buyer shall (i) reimburse Seller
for its out of pocket costs in contesting such challenge, or (ii) assume and
control the defense of such challenge at its own costs and expense, and with
participation by Seller.  

(ii) Unless required by a final, non-appealable decision of a court of
competent jurisdiction, Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates (including, in the case of the Buyer, the Companies and
their Subsidiaries) to, (i) be bound by the Elections, the Tax Allocation
Statement and Section 338(h)(10) Allocation Statement (each as finally
determined pursuant to Section 4.15(e)) for purposes of determining any
Taxes, (ii) prepare and file their respective Tax Returns on a
basis consistent with the Elections and such allocation statements and (iii)
take no position inconsistent with the Elections or any such allocation
statements in any Tax Return, any proceeding before any Tax    ##### 

  

  

authority or otherwise. In the event that any of the allocations determined
pursuant to Section 4.15(e) is disputed by any Tax authority, the party
receiving notice of the dispute shall promptly notify the other party
concerning resolution of the dispute. Buyer and its Affiliates shall provide
to Seller information reasonably determined by Buyer to enable Seller to
support the Tax filing position that, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes,
the direct and indirect acquisition of any of the Companies or their
Subsidiaries qualifies as a "qualified stock purchase" (within the meaning of
Section 338 of the Code).  

(e) _Closing Consideration Allocation._   

(i) In connection with the purchase and sale of the Equity of the Companies,
as promptly as possible after Closing, Buyer shall provide to Seller a
statement (a "Tax Allocation Statement") specifying the allocation of the
purchase price for U.S. federal income tax purposes (as adjusted pursuant to
payments made between Buyer and Seller pursuant to this Agreement) among the
assets held (for U.S. federal income tax purposes) by CMG and CIH (solely for
purposes of this Section 4.15(e)(i), without regard to the Elections) and the
covenants of Seller contained in Section 4.16. Within fifteen business days
following the receipt of such Tax Allocation Statement, Seller shall have the
right to object to such statement (by written notice to Buyer). If Seller
does not object by written notice to the Tax Allocation Statement within such
time period, such statement shall be deemed to have been accepted and agreed
upon, and final and conclusive, for all purposes of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such objection shall only be that the Tax
Allocation Statement is materially inconsistent with Schedule 4.15(e)(i). If
Seller objects to a Tax Allocation Statement presented by Buyer, it shall
notify the Buyer of such disputed item (or items) (in such written notice)
and the basis for its objection and Buyer and Seller shall act in good faith
to resolve any such dispute within the thirty day period thereafter. If,
within thirty days of Sellers delivery of a notice of objection to a Tax
Allocation Statement, the parties have not reached an agreement regarding
such allocations, the dispute shall be presented to the Independent
Accounting Firm that will determine which parties proposed allocation is
more consistent with Schedule 4.15(e)(i) and such allocation shall then
become the final "Tax Allocation Statement". The parties shall cause the
Independent Accounting Firm to make a determination within thirty days but in
no event later than five days prior to the Due Date of any Tax Return for
which such allocation would be relevant. The fees and expenses of such
accounting firm shall be paid fifty percent by Seller and fifty percent by
Buyer. In the event any Closing Consideration adjustment occurs pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement, Buyer shall provide Seller a revised Tax
Allocation Statement consistent with Schedule 4.15(e)(i) and the principles
of this Section 4.15(e)(i) shall apply to each such revised statement.    ##### 

  

 

(ii) In connection with an Election, as promptly as practicable after the
Closing, Buyer shall provide to Seller a statement (a "Section 338(h)(10)
Allocation Statement") specifying the proposed manner in which the "aggregate
deemed sales price", as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.338-4,
shall be allocated among the assets of each such Subsidiary for which an
Election is made, which allocations shall be made in accordance with Section
338(b) of the Code and any applicable Treasury Regulations and shall
be consistent with the Tax Allocation Statement determined pursuant to
Section 4.15(e)(i) hereof. Within fifteen business days following the receipt
of such Section 338(h)(10) Allocation Statement, Seller shall have the right
to object that such statement is not consistent with Schedule 4.15(e)(ii) (by
written notice to Buyer). If Seller does not object by written notice to a
Section 338(h)(10) Allocation Statement within such time period, such
statement shall be deemed to have been accepted and agreed upon, and final
and conclusive, for all purposes of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such Section 338(h)(10) Allocation Statement shall be subject to
adjustment upon and as a result of any Closing Consideration adjustment
pursuant to this Agreement. If Seller objects to a Section 338(h)(10)
Allocation Statement presented by Buyer, it shall notify the Buyer of such
disputed item (or items) (in such written notice) and the basis for
its objection and Buyer and Seller shall act in good faith to resolve any
such dispute for the thirty day period thereafter. If, within thirty days of
Sellers delivery of a notice of objection to a Section 338(h)(10) Allocation
Statement, the parties have not reached an agreement regarding such
allocations, the dispute shall be presented to the Independent Accounting
Firm that will determine which of the parties proposed allocations are
more consistent with Schedule 4.15(e)(ii), and such allocation shall become
the final Section 338(h)(10) Allocation Statement. The parties shall endeavor
to cause the accounting firm to make a determination within thirty days but

(a) In the event that any Action is commenced by a third party involving
a claim for which a party required to provide indemnity hereunder (an
"Indemnifying Party") may be liable to a party entitled to indemnification
(an "Indemnified Party") hereunder (an "Asserted Liability"), the Indemnified
Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such
Asserted Liability (the "Claim Notice"); _provided_ that no delay on the part
of the Indemnified Party in giving any such Claim Notice shall relieve the
Indemnifying Party of any indemnification obligation hereunder except to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such delay. The
Indemnifying Party shall have sixty days from its receipt of the Claim Notice
(the "Notice Period") to notify the Indemnified Party whether or not the
Indemnifying Party desires, at the Indemnifying Partys sole cost and expense
and by counsel of its own choosing, to defend against such Asserted
Liability. If the Indemnifying Party undertakes to defend against
such Asserted Liability, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to defend and protect the interests of the Indemnified Party
with respect to such Asserted Liability, (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall
consult with the Indemnified Party prior to any significant decision,
strategy or action in relation thereto, to the extent affecting non-monetary
interests of the Indemnified Party and (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall
not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, consent to
any settlement unless such settlement (x) requires only the payment of money
and (y) provides for a full and unconditional release of the Indemnified
Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any event, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to control, pay or settle any Asserted Liability which
the Indemnifying Party shall have undertaken to defend so long as the
Indemnified Party shall also waive any right to indemnification therefor by
the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party undertakes to defend
against such Asserted Liability, the Indemnified Party shall fully cooperate
with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the investigation, defense
and    ##### 

  

   

settlement thereof. This Section 7.3(a) does not apply to any matter referred
to in Section 7.3(b), (c), (d), (e), or (m).  

(b) With respect to the litigation set forth on Section 7.1(a)(x) of the
_Seller Disclosure Schedule_ , from the date hereof until September 30, 2006,
Seller shall have the exclusive right to control such litigation (it being
understood that (i) Seller shall undertake to defend such litigation and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to defend and protect the interests of
Buyer with respect to such litigation, (ii) during the time set forth in
this Section 7.3(b), Seller shall consult with Buyer prior to any significant
decision, strategy or action in relation to such litigation; and (iii) Seller
shall not, without the prior written consent of Buyer, consent to any
settlement of such litigation). Buyer shall cooperate fully with Seller and
its counsel in the investigation, defense and settlement of such
litigation.  

(c) With respect to the litigation set forth on Section 7.1(a)(x) of the
_Seller Disclosure Schedule_ , following the expiration of the date in
Section 7.3(b), Buyer shall have the exclusive right to control such
litigation (it being understood that (i) Buyer shall undertake to defend such
litigation and shall use its reasonable best efforts to defend and protect
the interests of Seller with respect to such litigation, (ii) during the time
set forth in this Section 7.3(c), Buyer shall consult with Seller prior to
any significant decision, strategy or action in relation to such
litigation, to the extent affecting monetary interests of Seller; and (iii)
Buyer shall not, without the prior written consent of Seller, consent to any
settlement of such litigation). Seller shall cooperate fully with Buyer and
its counsel in the investigation, defense and settlement of
such litigation.  

(d) With respect to the litigation set forth on Sections 7.1(a)(xi) of
the _Seller Disclosure Schedule_ , at all times, Buyer shall have the
exclusive right to control such litigation (it being understood that (i)
Buyer shall consult with Seller prior to any significant decision, strategy
or action in relation to such litigation, to the extent affecting
monetary interests of Seller; and (ii) Buyer shall not, without the prior
written consent of Seller, consent to any monetary settlement of such
litigation). Seller shall cooperate fully with Buyer and its counsel in the
investigation, defense and settlement of such litigation.  

(e) With respect to the Shared Litigation, at all times, Buyer shall have
the exclusive right to control such litigation.  

(f) If the Indemnifying Party does not undertake within the Notice Period
to defend against such Asserted Liability, then the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to control the investigation and defense and may settle or
take any other actions the Indemnified Party deems reasonably advisable
without in any way waiving or otherwise affecting the Indemnified
Partys rights to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement. The Indemnified
Party and the    ##### 

  

   

Indemnifying Party agree to make available to each other, their counsel and
other representatives, all information and documents available to them which
relate to such claim or demand. The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party and the Companies and their respective employees also agree to render
to each other such assistance and cooperation as may reasonably be required
to ensure the proper and adequate defense of such claim or demand.  

(g) In calculating amounts payable to an Indemnified Party, the amount of
any indemnified Losses shall be determined without duplication of any other
Loss for which an indemnification claim has been made under any other
representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement and shall be computed net of
(i) payments recoverable by the Indemnified Party under any insurance policy
with respect to such Losses, (ii) any prior or subsequent recovery by the
Indemnified Party from any Person with respect to such Losses and (iii) any
Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party with respect to such
Losses. To the extent that a Tax benefit is actually realized within three
years following the Due Date of the applicable Tax Return that first takes
into account the deduction, loss or other Tax attribute generated as a result
of the Loss(es) than gave rise to the indemnity payment, then no later than
30 days after the applicable Tax Return has been filed for the applicable
period, the indemnified party shall pay to the indemnifying party
in immediately available funds the amount of the Tax benefit that is actually
realized as a result of the Losses that gave rise to the indemnification
(i.e., the reduction in Taxes that would have been otherwise due and payable
but for the incurrence of the Losses that gave rise to
the indemnification).  

(h) Claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 7.1(a)(i), and Section
7.2(a)(i) shall not be made after the Survival Expiration Date. Claims for
indemnity pursuant to Section 7.1(a)(ii) and Section 7.2(a)(ii) shall not be
made after the expiration of the applicable covenant as determined in
accordance with Section 8.4(b). Claims for indemnification under the other
sub-sections of Sections 7.1 and 7.2 shall not be made after the thirtieth day
following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (taking
into account valid extensions) of the subject matter of the claim that gave
rise to the Losses. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, any timely filed claim for indemnity for which notice
has been given prior to the end of the applicable survival period shall
survive until the claim has been finally resolved.  

(i) To the extent that Seller makes any payment pursuant to this Article
VII in respect of Losses for which Buyer or any of its Affiliates have a
right to recover against a third party (including, without limitation, an
insurance company), Seller shall be subrogated to the right of Buyer or any
of its Affiliates to seek and obtain recovery from such third party; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that if Seller shall be prohibited from such
subrogation, Buyer or its Affiliates, as applicable, shall seek recovery from
such third party on Sellers behalf and pay any such recovery to Seller.  

(j) Subject to Section 8.12, the remedies provided in this Article VII
shall be deemed the sole and exclusive remedies of the parties, from and
after the Closing Date, with respect to this Agreement.    ##### 

  

 

(k) For all Tax purposes, the parties agree to treat indemnity payments
made pursuant to this Agreement and other payments made between the Buyer and
the Seller pursuant to the terms of this Agreement as an adjustment to the
Closing Consideration to the extent permitted by applicable Law and to use
their reasonable best efforts to ensure that, to the extent necessary in
order to secure such treatment under applicable Law, all such payments are
made from the actual selling entity to the actual purchasing entity of the
Shares or Equity Interests to which the indemnity payment relates; _provided_
, _however_ , that if the Internal Revenue Service or any other Tax authority
challenges the treatment of the receipt of any indemnity or other payment
made hereunder as an adjustment to the Closing Consideration, the indemnified
party shall use its reasonable best efforts to uphold the characterization of
any such indemnity payment as an adjustment to the Closing Consideration, and
shall keep the other party reasonably informed of all developments. To the
extent that the treatment of the indemnification payment as an adjustment to
the Closing Consideration is finally determined to be erroneous, any
indemnity payment hereunder shall, subject to Section 7.3(g) and to the final
sentence of this Section 7.3(k), be increased to take into account the amount
of Taxes resulting from the receipt of such indemnification payment. If a
party to this Agreement assigns the benefit of this Agreement, the other
relevant parties shall only be liable to take into account Taxes resulting
from the receipt of an indemnification payment to the extent that those other
parties would have been liable to take into account Taxes of an equivalent
amount if no such assignment had occurred.  

(l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Sections 7.3 (a) and (b) shall not apply to any Tax Claim (as defined
herein).  

(m) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, subject to
the terms of this paragraph (m) and the Grid, Seller agrees to indemnify any
Buyer Indemnified Party from and against any Losses incurred by reason of the
following (the "Shared Losses"): (A) any breach or failure to be true and
correct of the representations and warranties set forth in Section
3.1(i), without giving effect to any materiality or Material Adverse Effect
qualifications therein, which occurs after the date of this Agreement if the
facts and circumstances giving rise to such breach or failure to be true and
correct relate to the Business and constitute a breach or violation
of Section 3.1(p); (B) any breach or failure to be true and correct of the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.1(p), without giving
effect to any materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifications therein,
to the extent relating to the Business and (C) the litigation set forth in
Section 7.3(m) of the _Seller Disclosure Schedule_. Such indemnification
obligations shall be subject to the following:  

(i) Seller and Buyer shall be liable for, and shall indemnify the other to the
extent necessary to give effect to, the allocations reflected in the grid set
forth on Section 7.3(m)(i) of the _Seller Disclosure Schedule_ (the "Grid").
The amount set forth in Bracket F of the Grid represents the maximum amount
to which allocations of liability between Seller and Buyer shall apply and
above which Buyer shall have one hundred percent (100%) of the    ##### 

  

  

liability for Shared Losses (as adjusted pursuant to the following sentence,
the "Grid Cap"). The Grid Cap shall be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis
by the aggregate amount paid or payable by both Buyer and Seller in respect
of Section 7.1(a)(xi) Losses, whether paid prior to or after the Closing
Date. An example of such reduction is set forth in Section 7.3(m)(i) of the
_Seller Disclosure Schedule_.  

(ii) The amounts set forth on the Grid shall be separate from and shall not
be affected by any amounts that may be applied against the Basket or the
Ceiling pursuant to this Article VII.  

(iii) Counsel of record to the Companies and their Subsidiaries ("Counsel of
Record") in any lawsuit that could lead to Shared Losses and for which
indemnity is available hereunder (any such lawsuits, together with any
lawsuit arising from such lawsuits, the "Shared Litigation") shall
communicate and consult with all parties in connection with the defense of
such lawsuit.  

(iv) Seller shall be free to retain at its own expense counsel to monitor the
lawsuit ("Seller Counsel"). Counsel of Record shall communicate and consult
with any Seller Counsel.  

(v) Counsel of Record and Seller Counsel shall make available to each other
and other such counsel and any party confidential oral information and
memoranda or other documents related to the defense of the Shared Litigation
("Defense Materials") to the extent that they deem it prudent and consistent
with the objectives of the joint defense provided for herein.  

(vi) The Defense Materials obtained by counsel for any party shall
remain confidential and shall be protected from disclosure to any third party
except as provided herein.  

(n) Claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 7.3(m) shall not be
made after April 15, 2007. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any timely filed claim for indemnity pursuant to Section
7.3(m) for which notice has been given prior to April 15, 2007 shall survive
until the claim has been finally resolved.  

Section 7.4 _Tax Indemnification Procedures_.  

(a) If a notice of deficiency, proposed adjustment, adjustment,
assessment, audit, examination or other administrative or court proceeding,
suit, dispute or other claim of any of the Companies or their subsidiaries (a
"Tax Claim") shall be delivered or sent to or commenced or initiated against
any of the Companies or their Subsidiaries by any Tax authority with respect
to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Companies or their Subsidiaries for which
Buyer may reasonably be entitled to indemnification from Seller pursuant to
Section 7.1 of this Agreement, Buyer shall promptly notify Seller in    ##### 

  

   

writing of the Tax Claim, and shall include a copy of the relevant Tax Claim
notice and other related information; _provided_ , that the failure to so
notify Seller shall only reduce its indemnity obligations hereunder to the
extent it is actually prejudiced thereby.  

(b) _Tax Claims relating to Pre-Closing Tax Periods_. With respect to Tax
Claims of or relating to Taxes of any of the Companies or their Subsidiaries
for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, Seller may, upon written notice to Buyer,
assume and control the defense of such Tax Claim at its own cost and expense
and with its own counsel and may (i) pursue or forego any and
all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any
Tax authority, or (ii) either pay (A) the Tax claimed and sue for a refund
where applicable Law permits such refund suits or (B) contest, settle or
compromise the Tax Claim in any permissible manner, and Buyer shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates (including the Companies and their Subsidiaries)
to, cooperate with Seller in pursuing such Tax Claim and shall provide to
Seller (and its employees and other agents) applicable powers of attorney. If
Seller elects to assume the defense of any such Tax Claim, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Section 7.4, (i) Seller shall not
enter into any settlement with respect to any such Tax Claim without
Buyers prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) if such settlement could reasonably be expected to
increase the Tax liability of Buyer (or any of its Affiliates including the
Companies or their Subsidiaries) for any Tax period beginning on or after the
Closing date (for this purpose, any reduction of Tax attributes relating to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Interim Period shall be ignored), (ii) Seller
shall keep Buyer reasonably informed of all material developments and events
relating to such Tax Claim (including promptly forwarding copies to Buyer of
any related correspondence and shall use reasonable efforts to provide Buyer
with any opportunity to review and comment on any material correspondence
before Seller sends such correspondence to any Tax authority), and (iii) Buyer
may at its own cost and expense and with its own counsel, participate
(including participation in any relevant meetings and conference calls) in
(but not to control) the defense of such Tax Claim. In connection with any
Tax Claim of or relating to any of the Companies or their Subsidiaries
for any Pre-Closing Tax Period that Seller has not elected to control
pursuant to this Section 7.4, such contest shall be controlled by Buyer and
Seller agrees to cooperate with Buyer and its Affiliates in pursuing such
contest, _provided_ , _however_ , that none of Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including the Companies or their Subsidiaries) shall enter into any
settlement with respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, and  _provided_ , _further_ , that Buyer
and its Affiliates (including the Companies and their Subsidiaries) shall
keep Seller informed of all material developments and events relating to such
Tax Claim (including promptly forwarding copies to Seller of any related
correspondence and shall use reasonable efforts to provide Seller with an
opportunity to review and comment on any material correspondence before Buyer
sends such correspondence to any Tax authority) and Seller, at its own cost
and expense and with its own counsel, shall have the right to participate in
(including in any relevant meetings and conference calls) but not control the
defense of such Tax Claims.    ##### 

  

 

(c) _Tax Claims relating to Straddle Periods_. Buyer and Seller shall
jointly control (at each partys own cost and expense) all proceedings in
connection with any Tax Claim relating to a Straddle Period. The parties
agree to cooperate fully with each other in pursuing any such Tax Claim and
neither Buyer nor Seller shall (or shall permit any of their Affiliates to)
settle a Tax Claim relating to a Straddle Period without the other partys
prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.   

ARTICLE VIII 
 MISCELLANEOUS

AFORESAID ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT BROUGHT IN THE COURTS REFERRED TO IN CLAUSE (I) ABOVE AND HEREBY

applicable in each case, the "Survival Expiration Date").  

(b) All covenants and agreements contained herein which by their terms
are to be performed in whole or in part, or which prohibit actions,
subsequent to the Closing Date, shall survive the Closing in accordance with
their terms. All other covenants and agreements contained herein shall not
survive the Closing and shall thereupon terminate, except that claims for
indemnification in respect of any breach thereof may be made at any time
prior to the Survival Expiration Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a
notice of breach is delivered prior to the end of the applicable survival
period, the claim shall survive until the claim has been finally resolved.
