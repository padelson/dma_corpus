Sellers shall use good faith efforts to jointly resolve such disputes within
30 days after Buyer's receipt of the Sellers' written statement, which

be randomly selected from a hat, and such selected independent public
accounting firm shall be jointly engaged by Buyer and Sellers within 10 days
of selection. The parties agree that the foregoing independent public
accounting firm shall not be one that is regularly engaged by Buyer or the
Sellers. Such independent public accounting firm shall calculate the Net
Working Capital and the other adjustments using the items included in the
Final Report which are not disputed by Buyer and Sellers and shall make its
own determination of any item which is disputed by Buyer and Sellers, but
otherwise in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement; provided,
however, in no event shall any such determination by such firm be higher or
lower than the respective amount therefor proposed by Buyer and Sellers. The
determination of such firm shall be accompanied by a certificate of such firm
that its determination was prepared in accordance with this Agreement with
respect to such dispute. Such firm shall report its conclusions as to such
disputes and its determination of Net Working Capital and the Purchase Price
based thereon pursuant to this Section 2.6 no later than 30 days after it is
engaged by the Sellers and Buyer, which determination shall be conclusive on
all parties to this Agreement and not subject to further dispute or judicial
review.

   
 

2.6.4 The fees and expenses (including any related indemnity obligation to
such independent public accounting firm) of such independent public accounting
firm shall be borne one-half by Buyer and one-half by the Sellers. If, after
adjustment as appropriate with respect to the Purchase Price and/or the Net
Working Capital, Buyer or the Sellers are determined to owe an amount to the
other, the appropriate party shall pay such amount to the other by wire
transfer of immediately available funds within five (5) business days after
receipt of such determination.

5.6 Employee Matters.

  


 

  

5.6.1 Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall offer employment to
substantially all of the Seller Employees who are employed in Virginia and
West Virginia immediately prior to the Adjustment Time (the "Designated
Employees"). Not later than 30 days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall
notify Sellers in writing of any Seller Employees to whom Buyer does not plan
to offer employment in accordance with the previous sentence. Any Designated
Employee to whom Buyer has made an offer of employment and who has accepted
such offer of employment (each, a "Hired Employee") shall be subject, from and
after the Closing, to the policies established from time to time by Buyer with
respect to employment and employee benefits; provided, however, that Buyer
shall offer each such Designated Employee an annualized base salary or hourly
rate of pay that is no less than that paid by any Seller as of the date of
this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to prevent or
restrict in any way the right of the Buyer to terminate, reassign, promote or
demote any of the Hired Employees after the Closing or to change adversely or
favorably the title, powers, duties, responsibilities, functions, locations,
compensation, benefits or terms or conditions of employment of such employees.
Sellers shall terminate the employment of the Hired Employees as of 11:59 p.m.
on the day before the Closing Date. Seller shall be responsible for any
liability arising under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act
of 1988 and other similar statutes or regulations of any jurisdiction with
respect to any termination of employment of any Seller Employee.

  


 

  

5.6.2 Sellers shall pay to the Seller Employees all compensation, including
salaries, commissions, bonuses, deferred compensation, severance, insurance,
pensions profit sharing, vacation, sick pay and other compensation or benefits
to which the Seller Employees are entitled up to the date before the Closing
Date and for any payments that are triggered as a result of the Closing and/or
the termination of such Designated Employees' employment with Sellers
(including severance payments). No Seller shall, without the prior written
consent of Buyer, change the compensation or benefits of any Designated
Employees, other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice.

  


 

  

5.6.3 Sellers shall be responsible for maintenance and distribution of
benefits accrued under any Employee Plan pursuant to the provisions of such
plans. Buyer assumes neither any liability for any such accrued benefits nor
any fiduciary or administrative responsibility to account for or dispose of
any such accrued benefits under any Employee Plan.

  


 

  

5.6.4 All claims and obligations under, pursuant to or in connection with any
welfare, medical, insurance, disability or other employee benefit plans of any
Seller or arising under any Legal Requirement affecting Seller Employees
incurred on or before the Closing, or resulting or arising from events or
occurrences occurring or commencing on or prior to the Closing, shall remain
the responsibility of Sellers, whether or not such employees become Hired
Employees. Buyer shall have and assume no obligation or liability under or in
connection with any such plan.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 34 -  

  

 

 

 

   
 

5.6.5 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.6, Buyer
shall (i) permit the Hired Employees and the Hired Employees' spouses and
dependents to participate in Buyer's employee benefit plans (other than any
defined benefit plans) to the same extent as Buyer's similarly situated
employees and their dependents; (ii) to the extent permitted under Buyer's
employee benefit plans, waive any waiting periods with respect to any of
Buyer's medical, dental or vision insurance employee benefit plans; and (iii)
not subject any Hired Employee to any limitations on benefits for pre-existing
conditions under its employee benefit plans, including any group health and
disability plans.

  


 

  

5.6.6 Effective as of the Closing, Buyer shall assume responsibilities and
obligations for continuation coverage under COBRA (the "COBRA Obligations")
and any state continuation coverage requirements with respect to the Hired
Employees and their beneficiaries solely with respect to COBRA "qualifying
events" that occur after a Seller Employee becomes a Hired Employee. Except as
provided in the immediately preceding sentence, Sellers shall retain
responsibility and liability for COBRA Obligations. Buyer shall provide no
incentive, directly or indirectly, for any Hired Employee to elect COBRA
coverage under any group health plan of Sellers.

  


 

  

5.6.7 Subsequent to Closing, Hired Employees' vested account balances shall be
payable to them from Sellers' 401(k) plan in accordance with its terms. Buyer
shall accept rollovers of cash and of promissory notes that relate to loans
made to Hired Employees from Sellers' 401(k) plan, if any.

  


 

  

5.7 HSR Act Filing. As soon as practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, but in any event no later than fifteen (15) business days after
such execution (subject to extension for a period of up to an additional
fifteen (15) business days, if reasonably necessary for a party to complete
its notification and report if not filed by the expiration of such fifteen
(15) business day period), the Parties will each complete and file, or cause

transactions contemplated hereby, subject only to the conditions specified in
Section 6.1, the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
financing in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement in an amount that will be sufficient to pay the Purchase
Price hereunder at the Closing and shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to consummate such financing.

  


 

  

5.9 Title Commitments and Surveys. Buyer may order at its own expense (i)
commitments for owner's or lender's or leasehold title insurance policies (the
"Title Commitments") on any parcel of Real Property owned or leased by the
Company or any Seller, and (ii) an ALTA survey (the "Surveys") on any parcel
of Owned Real Property for which a title insurance policy is to be obtained
certified to Buyer and the Title Company. Sellers shall cooperate, at Buyer's

Environmental Surveys, including granting Buyer and Buyer's representatives
access to such properties for purposes of obtaining such surveys and reports,

Governmental Authority, or any judicial or administrative proceedings relating
to liability for Taxes.

representation or warranty of such Party to be inaccurate such that such
inaccuracy will result in the conditions of the other party set forth in

5.16 Lack of Consent for Transfer of Franchises. If, notwithstanding
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions stated in Section 6, as of Closing

cable television franchise or a judgment has been entered enjoining or
disapproving the transfer of such cable television franchise to Buyer, such
cable television franchise shall be excluded from the Assets conveyed at

pay the full Purchase Price in accordance with this Agreement. In such case,
at Closing, Sellers and Buyer shall execute and deliver a Management Agreement

pursuant to which Buyer shall manage the applicable System (or portion
thereof) and Seller's performance under the applicable cable television
franchise, subject to the following: (a) Buyer shall bear all expenses

television franchise and the operation thereof and shall receive all revenues

television franchise; (iii) 180 days after the Closing Date; and (iv) the date

termination of the Management Period, the Management Agreement shall terminate
without any liability hereunder for the exclusion of any such cable television
franchise from the Assets conveyed at Closing, and, upon receipt of all
necessary approvals, Sellers shall assign and transfer to Buyer the cable
television franchise by instruments in form and substance identical to those
by which Assets shall have been transferred and assigned to Buyer at Closing.

(30) days following Buyer's receipt of written notice thereof (such 30-day
period, "Buyer's Cure Period") or waived by Sellers;

  


 

  

8.1.4 By Buyer after six (6) months from the date of this Agreement, plus the
unexpired Seller's Cure Period plus one day if any of the conditions set forth
in Section 6.1 hereof to which the obligations of Buyer are subject (other
than the conditions set forth in Section 6.1.6) have not been fulfilled or
waived, and provided that the failure to fulfill such condition is not a
result of a breach of warranty or representation or nonfulfillment of any
covenant or agreement by Buyer contained in this Agreement; or

  


 

  

8.1.5 By the Sellers after six (6) months from the date of this agreement plus
the unexpired Buyer's Cure Period plus one day, if any of the conditions set
forth in Section 6.2 hereof to which the obligations of the Sellers are
subject (other than the conditions set forth in Section 6.2.5) have not been
fulfilled or waived, and provided that the failure to fulfill such condition
is not a result of a breach of warranty or representation or nonfulfillment of
any covenant or agreement by Sellers contained in this Agreement.

  


 

  

8.2 Rights Upon Termination.

  


 

  

8.2.1 In the event of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1.1, Section 8.1.4 or Section 8.1.5 hereof, each Party shall pay the costs
and expenses incurred by it in connection with this Agreement, and no Party
(or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives or
Member) shall be liable to any other Party for any cost, expense, damage or
loss hereunder.

  


 

  

8.2.2 In the event of a termination of this Agreement by Buyer pursuant to
Section 8.1.2 hereof, Buyer shall have the right to pursue any legal or
equitable remedies for breach of contract or otherwise. In the event of any
action to enforce this Agreement, each Seller hereby waives the defense that
there is an adequate remedy at law and shall not require the posting of bond
or other security.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 43 -  

  

 

 

 

   
 

8.2.3 In the event of a termination of this Agreement by Sellers pursuant to
Section 8.1.3, the Buyer shall, (a) within three (3) business days after
termination of this Agreement pay Sellers Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000)
plus Sellers' reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as liquidated damages (the
"Liquidated Damages"), which Liquidated Damages shall be Sellers' sole and
exclusive remedy for any breach or failure to perform by Buyer of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement and, (b) following receipt of an invoice therefor, promptly (in any
event within three (3) business days) pay all of Sellers' reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including reasonable legal fees
and expenses) actually incurred by Sellers on or prior to the termination of
this Agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "Seller Expenses"). The Liquidated Damages and the Seller
Expenses shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Sellers in the event of
such termination and shall be in lieu of any other remedies at law or in
equity to which Sellers might otherwise be entitled, including on account of
punitive damages, and in no event shall Sellers, the Company or the Member
seek to recover any other money damages or seek any other remedy based on a
claim in law or equity with respect to (i) any Loss suffered as a result of
the failure of the Closing to occur, (ii) the termination of this Agreement,
(iii) any liabilities or obligations arising under this Agreement, or (iv) any
claims or actions arising out of or relating to any breach, termination or
failure of or under this Agreement, and upon payment to the Sellers of the
Liquidated Damages and the Seller Expenses, none of Buyer, Shentel nor any of
its Affiliates shall have any further liability or obligation to the Sellers,
the Company or the Member relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, in each case, other than the Liquidated
Damages and Seller Expenses and the last sentence of this Section 8.2.3. The
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the Liquidated Damages to be paid by
Buyer to compensate Sellers for such damages are liquidated damages, and that
any such amounts paid pursuant to this Section 8.2.3 represent liquidated
damages and not a penalty. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, in the event of any dispute regarding the payment of Liquidated
Damages and Seller Expenses, the prevailing party in such dispute shall be
entitled to the reimbursement of reasonable counsel fees, costs and expenses
by the non-prevailing party in addition to any other amounts due from the non-
prevailing party.

  


 

  

8.3 Section 8.2 and Article 10 survive termination of the Agreement.

  


 

  

9. SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; INDEMNIFICATION.

  


 

  

9.1 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All of the Parties'
representations, warranties and covenants (to the extent to be fully performed
before Closing) contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing until
the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date, except for the Core
Representations, which shall survive the Closing until the close of the
ninetieth day following the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations and except for the representation of Sellers in Section 3.22(b)
hereof, which shall not survive the Closing. For purposes of this Agreement
the "Core Representations" shall be those representations and warranties
contained in Section 3.1, Section 3.2, Section 3.3, Section 3.6, Section 3.9,
Section 3.14, Section 4.1 and Section 4.2. The covenants of the Parties
hereunder to be performed in whole or in part after Closing shall survive
until thirty (30) days after the date on which such covenants are performed in
full.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 44 -  

  

 

 

 

   
 

9.2 Indemnification by Sellers. After the Closing, each of the Sellers jointly
and severally agrees to indemnify and hold Buyer, its employees, officers,
directors, stockholders, advisers and representatives (collectively, the
"Buyer Indemnitees") harmless from and against all liability, loss, damage,
claim, injury, interest and penalty and all costs and expenses (including
reasonable counsel fees and costs and expenses of any suit related thereto or
relating to investigating, preparing, defending against or prosecuting any
such suit) of any kind or character (collectively, "Losses") suffered or
incurred by the Buyer Indemnitees arising from (a) any breach of any
representation or warranty of Sellers contained in this Agreement or any
Transaction Document to which any Seller is a party, other than any breach of
Section 3.22(b) hereof; (b) any failure to perform or observe any covenant or
agreement of the Sellers in this Agreement or any Transaction Document to
which any Seller is a party; (c) all liabilities and obligations of Sellers
that are Excluded Liabilities; and (d) unsuccessful claim by Sellers against
Buyer pursuant to this Agreement or any Transaction Document. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parties hereby acknowledge and
agree that the sole and exclusive remedy for any Buyer Indemnitee for any
Losses suffered or incurred by a Buyer Indemnitee with respect to
environmental matters, including Seller Environmental Liabilities, breach of
any Environmental Law, with respect to Hazardous Materials or otherwise, shall
be for a breach of representations and warranties and not for any
indemnification for any Seller Environmental Liabilities.

  


 

  

9.3 Indemnification by Buyer. After the Closing, Buyer agrees to indemnify and
hold Sellers, the Member, the Company and their respective employees,
officers, directors, stockholders, advisers and representatives (collectively,
the "Seller Indemnitees") harmless from and against all Losses suffered or
incurred by the Seller Indemnitees arising from (a) any breach of any
representation or warranty of Buyer contained in this Agreement or any
Transaction Document to which Buyer is a party, (b) any failure to perform or
observe any covenant or agreement of Buyer contained in this Agreement or any
Transaction Document to which Buyer is a party, (c) the Business or operation
of the Systems from and after the Adjustment Time, or (d) any unsuccessful
claim by Buyer against Sellers pursuant to this Agreement or any Transaction
Document.

  


 

  

9.4 Limitations on Indemnification.

  


 

  

9.4.1 Neither the Sellers nor the Buyer, as the case may be, will have an
obligation to indemnify the other Person under Section 9.2(a) or Section
9.3(a), as the case may be, until the aggregate amount of such other party's
Losses exceeds Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($750,000) (the "Basket
Amount"), provided that if the amount of the Losses exceeds the Basket Amount
then Buyer or Sellers, as the case may be, shall be liable for all such Losses
(including the Basket Amount) from and including the first dollar of any
Losses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers shall indemnify Buyer
Indemnified Parties for any Losses of the Buyer Indemnified Party related to a
breach of the Core Representations without giving effect to this Section
9.4.1.

  


 

  

9.4.2 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the aggregate maximum indemnifiable liability of Sellers under Section 9.2(a)
(inclusive of the Core Representations) or of the Buyer under Section 9.3(a),
as the case may be, shall be limited to Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000). For
the avoidance of doubt, the maximum amounts payable under any clause of this
Section 9.4.2 shall be reduced by any amount previously paid under Section 9.2
or Section 9.3, as applicable.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 45 -  

  

 

 

 

   
 

9.5 Procedures. The procedure for indemnification shall be as follows:

  


 

  

9.5.1 The party claiming indemnification (the "Claimant") shall promptly give
notice to the party from whom indemnification is claimed (the "Indemnifying
Party") of any claim, whether between the Parties (a "Direct Claim") or
brought by a third party, specifying (i) to the Claimant's knowledge, the
factual basis for such claim; and (ii) a good faith estimate of the amount of
the claim, if such amount is capable of estimation. If the claim relates to an
action, suit or proceeding filed by a third party against Claimant (a "Third
Party Claim"), such notice shall be given reasonably promptly by Claimant to
the Indemnifying Party after written notice of such Third Party Claim is
received by Claimant; provided, however, that the failure of the Claimant to
give timely notice hereunder shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations under this Article 9 unless, and only to the extent that, the
Indemnifying Party has been prejudiced thereby.

  


 

  

9.5.2 Following receipt of notice from the Claimant of a Direct Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days to make such investigation of
the claim as the Indemnifying Party deems necessary or desirable. For the
purposes of such investigation, the Claimant agrees to make available to the
Indemnifying Party and its authorized representative(s) the information relied
upon by the Claimant to substantiate the claim. If the Claimant and the
Indemnifying Party agree at or prior to the expiration of such 30-day period
(or any mutually agreed upon extension thereof) to the validity and amount of
such claim, the Indemnifying Party shall immediately pay to the Claimant the
full amount of the claim, subject to the terms and in accordance with the
procedures set forth herein, including Section 9.4 and Section 9.6. If the
Claimant and the Indemnifying Party do not agree within such period (or any
mutually agreed upon extension thereof), the Claimant may seek appropriate
legal remedies.

  


 

  

9.5.3 With respect to any Third Party Claim as to which the Claimant is
entitled to indemnification hereunder, the Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to undertake the defense of, or opposition to, such Third Party Claim
with counsel selected by such Indemnifying Party, subject to the Indemnifying
Party's notifying the Claimant, in writing promptly after receipt of the
Claimant's notice of Claim, of its intention to assume such defense or
opposition. The Claimant shall cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Party. If
the Indemnifying Party elects to assume control of the defense of, or
opposition to, any Third Party Claim, the Claimant shall have the right to
participate in the defense of, or opposition to, such claim at its own
expense; provided, however, if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel for the
Claimant, there would be a conflict of interest if the Indemnifying Party's
counsel represented both the Indemnifying Party and the Claimant, the
Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses
of one counsel selected by the Claimant to participate in such defense or
opposition.

  


 

  

9.5.4 In the event the Indemnifying Party (i) does not elect to assume control
or otherwise participate in the defense of, or opposition to, any Third Party
Claim or (ii) is not entitled to assume control of the defense of, or
opposition to, any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be
bound by the results obtained by the Claimant with respect to such claim;
provided, however, the Claimant shall not have the right to consent or
otherwise agree to any monetary or non-monetary settlement or relief,
including injunctive relief or other equitable remedies, without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. In the event that the
Indemnifying Party assumes control of the defense of, or opposition to, any
Third Party Claim, the Claimant shall be bound by the results obtained by the
Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim; provided that the Indemnifying
Party shall not have the right to consent or otherwise agree to any non-
monetary settlement or relief, including injunctive relief or other equitable
remedies, without the prior written consent of the Claimant, which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Indemnifying Party nor the Claimant shall settle or
compromise any such claim or demand unless the Claimant or the Indemnifying
Party, respectively, is given a full and complete release of any and all
Losses by all relevant parties relating thereto.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 46 -  

  

 

 

 

   
 

9.5.5 If a claim, whether a Direct Claim or a Third Party Claim, requires
immediate action, the Parties will work in good faith to reach a decision with
respect thereto as expeditiously as possible.

  


 

  

9.6 Additional Limitations.

  


 

  

9.6.1 The amount of any Losses of any Person subject to indemnification under
this Article 9 shall be reduced by the amount, if any, received by the
Claimant from any third Person (including any insurance provider), less the
amount of any Insurance Costs incurred in connection with collecting any such
amounts (such amount being referred to herein as a "Third Party
Reimbursement"), with respect to the Losses suffered thereby. If, after
receipt by a Claimant of any indemnification payment hereunder, such Claimant
receives a Third Party Reimbursement in respect of the same Losses for which
indemnification was made and such Third Party Reimbursement was not taken into
account in assessing the amount of indemnifiable Losses, then the Claimant
shall accept such Third Party Reimbursement for the account of the
Indemnifying Party and shall turn over all of such Third Party Reimbursement,
less any Insurance Costs incurred in connection with collecting any such
amounts, to the Indemnifying Party up to the amount of the indemnification
paid by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement.

  


 

  

9.6.2 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article 9,
the Parties shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate to make available any insurance coverage or other Third Party
Reimbursements for third party claims subject to the reasonable discretion of
Buyer regarding whether it will separately pursue any such Third Party
Reimbursement. Upon Sellers' or the Company's request, Buyer shall take any
steps necessary to provide Sellers and the Company with the right of
subrogation to pursue any insurance coverage or other Third Party
Reimbursements for third party claims. Nothing contained in this paragraph
shall require any party to maintain, continue or obtain any insurance
coverage.

  


 

  

9.6.3 EXCEPT IN THE EVENT OF A THIRD PARTY CLAIM OR CRIMINAL VIOLATIONS OF
LAW, NO CLAIMS OR CAUSES OF ACTION ARISING UNDER OR RESULTING FROM THIS
AGREEMENT, OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
BY THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE ASSERTED BY ANY PARTY OR ANY OTHER PERSON AGAINST A
PARTY FOR PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, CONTINGENT, INCIDENTAL, SPECULATIVE,
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES THAT ARE NOT REASONABLY FORESEEABLE BY SUCH OTHER PARTY
(INCLUDING LOST PROFITS OR REVENUE) OR FOR DIMINUTION IN VALUE (OTHER THAN AS
TO THE COST TO REPAIR OR REPLACE THE AFFECTED ASSETS DETERMINED AS OF THE
CLOSING DATE ARISING FROM A BREACH BY SELLERS OF THIS AGREEMENT).

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 47 -  

  

 

 

 

   
 

9.7 Materiality. The Parties acknowledge and agree that for purposes of
calculating the amount of Losses caused by the breach of a representation,
warranty or covenant, all "Material Adverse Effect" and "material"
qualifications contained in the representations, warranties and covenants
shall be disregarded.

  


 

  

9.8 Sole Remedy. After the Closing, the indemnification relief afforded by the
provisions of this Article 9 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of a
Claimant for matters arising under this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for the
negotiation, execution, delivery and performance hereof or thereof, whether
for tort, breach of contract or otherwise, except with respect to fraud, and
by agreeing to such provisions, the Parties are deemed to have made an
election of remedies in favor of indemnification in lieu of other remedies.
However, nothing in this Article 9 shall preclude Buyer from seeking the
remedy of specific performance of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.16.

  


 

  

9.9 Claims Unaffected by Investigation. The rights of the Parties and their
Affiliates to indemnification or to assert or recover on any claim shall not
be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge
acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect
to the accuracy of or compliance with, any of the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement. The waiver of any
condition based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or the
performance or compliance with any covenant or agreement, shall not affect the
right to indemnification or other remedy based on such representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements.

  


 

  

10. MISCELLANEOUS.

  


 

  

10.1 Notices

10.10 Severability. It is the desire and intent of the Parties that the
provisions of this Agreement be enforced to the fullest extent permissible
under the Legal Requirements and public policies applied in each jurisdiction
in which enforcement is sought. Accordingly, if any particular provision of
this Agreement shall be adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid, prohibited or unenforceable for any reason, so long as the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party, such provision, as to such
jurisdiction, shall be ineffective, without invalidating the remaining
provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of
this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision
in any other jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party, if such provision
could be more narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or
unenforceable in such jurisdiction, it shall, as to such jurisdiction, be so
narrowly drawn, without invalidating the remaining provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any
other jurisdiction.

  


 

  

10.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts
with the same effect as if the signature on each such counterpart were upon

10.12 No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement constitutes an agreement
solely among the Parties and the Guarantors, and is not intended to and will

10.13 Construction. This Agreement has been negotiated by Buyer and the
Sellers and their respective legal counsel, and legal or equitable principles
that might require the construction of this Agreement or any provision of this
Agreement against the party drafting this Agreement shall not apply in any
construction or interpretation of this Agreement. In this Agreement (a) the
words "hereof," "herein," "hereto," "hereunder," and words of similar import
may refer to this Agreement as a whole and not merely to a specific section,
paragraph, or clause in which the respective word appears, (b) words importing
gender include the other gender as appropriate, (c) any terms defined in this
Agreement may, unless the context otherwise requires, be used in the singular
or the plural depending on the reference, (d) unless otherwise stated,
references to any Section, Article, Schedule or Exhibit are to such Section or
Article of, or Schedule or Exhibit to, this Agreement, (e) the words
"include", "includes", and "including" are deemed in each case to be followed
by the words "without limitation" and (f) the word "shall" denotes a directive
and obligation, and not an option. Any reference to any federal, state, local
or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise.
Disclosure of information included on any disclosure schedule (or portion of
any disclosure schedule) shall be considered disclosures for all other
disclosure schedules (or other portions of other disclosure schedules) to the
extent that it is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure that
such disclosure is applicable to such other disclosure schedules (or other
portions of disclosure schedules). In addition, (a) the fact that any
disclosure on any schedule is not required to be disclosed in order to render
the applicable representation or warranty to which it relates true, or that
the absence of such disclosure on any schedule would not constitute a breach
of such representation or warranty, shall not be deemed or construed to expand
the scope of any representation or warranty hereunder or to establish a
standard of disclosure in respect of any representation or warranty and (b)
disclosure of a particular matter on any schedule shall not be construed to
mean that such matter is material or would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

10.16 Specific Performance. Sellers recognize and agree that Buyer has relied
on this Agreement and expended considerable effort and resources related to
the transactions contemplated hereunder, that the right and benefits conferred
upon Buyer herein are unique, and that damages may not be adequate to
compensate Buyer in the event that the Sellers refuse to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereunder or Sellers fail to perform any obligations
herein in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof. The Parties
therefore agree that, in addition to any and all remedies available to Buyer,
prior to Closing, Buyer shall be entitled, at its option, to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches by Sellers of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States
or any state having jurisdiction, in addition to any other remedy to which
Buyer is entitled at law or in equity. If any action is brought by Buyer to
enforce this Agreement, Sellers shall waive the defense that there is an
adequate remedy at law and the requirement that Buyer post a bond. Any action
between Buyer, on the one hand, and any Seller, on the other hand, with
respect to such matters shall be brought and maintained only in the state or
U.S. Federal courts in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and Buyer and the Sellers
each waives any right to object to any such court as an inconvenient or
improper forum. In the event of any action for specific performance, the
prevailing party in such dispute shall be entitled to the reimbursement of
reasonable counsel fees, costs and expenses by the non-prevailing party. The
parties acknowledge and agree that no Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall
have the right to specific performance or injunctive or equitable relief
against Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer.
