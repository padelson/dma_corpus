Affiliates or any other Person other than as expressly set forth in this
Agreement and other than with respect to Liabilities of those Affiliates of
Sellers which an ITI Entity acquires through a purchase of Equity Securities.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except for the Assumed
Liabilities or as otherwise expressly provided for in this Agreement or by
applicable Law, no ITI Entity shall assume, be liable for, or otherwise become
responsible for (i) any Liability of any nature of Sellers or any of their
Affiliates or (ii) any Liability arising from, or in connection with, the
ownership, holding, use or operation by Sellers of the Business of such
Sellers or the Purchased Assets on or prior to the Closing Date (collectively,
the "Excluded Liabilities"), including without limitation:

 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(i) any intercompany Liability between a Seller, on the one hand, and any
North American Company, on the other hand, to the extent not otherwise
extinguished prior to Closing pursuant to Section 2.6(a);

  

  

(ii) any Liability under, with respect to, or in connection with, any Contract

related in any way to any portion of, the Facilities, the Leased Real Property
or the Purchased Assets, or any other property or assets related to or used by
Sellers, their Affiliates or any predecessor thereof, whether arising from
Releases, acts or omissions or events or conditions in existence or occurring
on or prior to the Closing Date or arising from Releases, acts or omissions of
Sellers or any of their Affiliates, any respective predecessor thereof, or any
of their respective employees, agents, representatives or contractors,
including Liabilities related to any off-site transportation, treatment,
storage or disposal of Hazardous Substances;

  

  

(vi) any Liability in connection with any compensation or benefit obligation

(viii) any Liability in connection with any Proceeding that (A) on the Closing
Date is in progress, pending or threatened against or affecting any North
American Company, the Purchased Assets, the Business of the North American

any Governmental Authority or any other Person or (B) arises prior to, on, or
following the Closing Date against or affecting any Seller or the Purchased
Assets at law or in equity, by or before any Governmental Authority or other
Person, to the extent relating to the period on or prior to the Closing Date;

prior to the Closing Date; and

  

  

(xii) any Liability under, with respect to, or in connection with, any Tax
sharing agreement of Sellers.

  

  

For the avoidance of doubt, Section 2.3 does not address the Liabilities of

entities and only the Equity Securities of such entities are transferred to
the ITI Entities.

  

  

Section 2.4 Purchase Price. The ITI Entities shall pay or deliver the
following to Sellers at the Closing, as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.6 (the
"Purchase Price"):

Escrow Agreement, to be held and disbursed thereafter in accordance with
Section 6.12.

  

  

(b) the sum of (i) One Hundred Five Million Seven Hundred Eighty-Six Thousand
Dollars ($105,786,000) (the "Base Amount") by wire transfer of immediately
available federal funds to a bank account designated by Sellers, less (ii) the
aggregate amount of Sellers' Liabilities (other than Assumed Liabilities) that
are required to be paid to obtain the release of Liens (other than Permitted

Liabilities, which letters Sellers agree to deliver to the ITI Entities at
least three (3) days prior to the Closing Date.

certified tax identification number by furnishing an appropriate Form W-9,
(ii) each Seller's date of acquisition and each Seller's cost basis of each
"Covered Security" and "Noncovered Security," within the meaning of Code

of this Agreement, and (iii) such other forms and documents that the ITI

Section 2.5 Option to Purchase Equity Securities or Assets of Foreign
Entities.

  

  

(a) For the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on the first
anniversary of the Effective Date (the "Option Period"), Ed Fyfe and those
Sellers holding, directly or indirectly, any Equity Securities of the Foreign
Entities (the "Foreign Sellers") hereby grant to the ITI Entities (or any
Affiliate wholly owned directly or indirectly by ITI), to the extent within
the control of Ed Fyfe or the Foreign Sellers, options to elect to purchase
some or all of (i) the Equity Securities of the Foreign Entities held directly
or indirectly by Ed Fyfe and/or the Foreign Sellers and/or (ii) the assets of
the Foreign Entities. Nothing contained in this Section 2.5 shall require the
ITI Entities to acquire any Equity Securities or assets of any Foreign
Entities and such options shall be exercisable in the sole discretion of the
ITI Entities. For the purpose of clarification and not for purposes of
limitation of the rights granted to the ITI Entities in this Section, such
options shall include the right to elect to purchase the Equity Securities or
assets of any Foreign Entity and to elect not to purchase the Equity
Securities or assets of any other Foreign Entity as determined by the ITI
Entities in their sole discretion. During the Option Period, Ed Fyfe and the
Foreign Sellers shall, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
their respective Affiliates to: (a) cooperate in and facilitate discussions
between the ITI Entities and the other holders of the Equity Securities of the
Foreign Entities with respect to the potential acquisition by the ITI Entities
of some or all of the Equity Securities of the Foreign Entities, the
acquisition of some or all of the assets of the Foreign Entities or such other
transactions and agreements regarding ownership and operation of the Foreign
Entities after Closing as shall be advisable or acceptable to the ITI Entities
in their sole discretion; (b) take all reasonable actions (or decline to take
and prevent all actions) as shall be within their power (including, without
limitation, the exercise of all approval and voting rights held directly or
indirectly by Ed Fyfe, the Foreign Sellers or their Affiliates in any Foreign
Entity), to procure full observance and compliance with this Section, and to
secure and maintain for the benefit of the ITI Entities the rights granted to
the ITI Entities in this Section 2.5; and (c) enter into, or cause a Foreign
Entity to enter into, one or more definitive agreements and such other
documents as the ITI Entities shall deem reasonably necessary transferring the
Equity Securities and/or assets of the Foreign Entities.

  

  

(b) Prior to any purchase of the Equity Securities and/or assets of any
Foreign Entity, the ITI Entities shall have completed, and shall be satisfied
with the results of, its due diligence review of such Foreign Entity, in its
sole discretion, and the Parties shall have agreed in good faith on the terms
of the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.5 (including the purchase
price and any requirements for an escrow and a level of working capital or net
assets) as a result of such diligence.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

21  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) If the ITI Entities elect to exercise an option granted in Section 2.5(a)
to purchase the Equity Securities or assets of any Foreign Entity, then the
ITI Entities shall: (i) deliver written notice of such election (each, an
"Election Notice") to the Sellers identifying the applicable Equity Securities
and/or assets of the Foreign Entity (the "Acquired Foreign Entity") with
respect to which such option is exercised, and (ii) the Equity Securities
and/or assets will be transferred to the ITI Entities on a designated date not
more than thirty (30) days after the date of such Election Notice (the
"Acquisition Date") pursuant to separate purchase agreements containing
representations, warranties, covenants, escrows, indemnities and other terms
substantially similar to the terms set forth in this Agreement.

  

  

(d) At Closing, certain Sellers and certain ITI Entities shall enter into a
Standstill Agreement in a form mutually acceptable to the Parties ("Standstill
Agreement") with respect to the obligation of the ITI Entities to provide
products and certain services to the Foreign Entities following the Closing.

  

  

Section 2.6 Working Capital Adjustment.

  

  

(a) "Working Capital" as of a given date means current assets (excluding Cash
and Excluded Assets) less current liabilities (excluding the Excluded
Liabilities), determined in accordance with GAAP consistent with past
practices, and prepared based on the principles set forth in Schedule 2.6(a).
Prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall cause all North American Companies to
settle all intercompany receivables and payables which are owed by and
received by the North American Companies. These intercompany receivables and
payables do not include receivables and payables owned to or by any Foreign
Entities.

  

  

(b) The Parties have agreed to a target Working Capital amount for the North
American Companies equal to $16,500,000 ("Target Working Capital"). Sellers
shall use their best efforts to deliver to the ITI Entities actual
consolidated Working Capital at the close of business on the Closing Date
computed in accordance with the principles set forth on Schedule 2.6(a)
("Closing Working Capital") in an amount as close as possible to the Target
Working Capital. No later than ninety (90) days following the Closing Date,
the ITI Entities shall deliver to Sellers a written report setting forth in
reasonable detail the computation of the Closing Working Capital (the "Closing
Working Capital Report"), prepared by the ITI Entities based on the principles
set forth in Schedule 2.6(a).

  

  

(c) If the Closing Working Capital exceeds an amount equal to the Target
Working Capital, then the ITI Entities shall, together with delivery of the
Closing Working Capital Report, remit payment of the amount of such excess by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the bank account designated by
Sellers. If the Target Working Capital exceeds the Closing Working Capital,
Sellers shall remit payment of the amount of such deficiency to the ITI
Entities within five (5) Business Days following the earlier of: (i) Sellers'
approval of the Closing Working Capital Report, or (ii) issuance of a
determination by the independent accountant in accordance with Section 2.6(g)
below. If the Sellers do not entirely approve the Closing Working Capital but
do agree that the Target Working Capital exceeds the Closing Working Capital,
Sellers shall notwithstanding remit payment of the undisputed amount of such
excess by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the bank account
designated by the ITI Entities.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

22  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) The Sellers or a Representative of the Sellers (which shall be a
nationally recognized public accounting firm) shall have the right, upon
written notice to the ITI Entities within thirty (30) days after receipt of
the Closing Working Capital Report, to review the financial books and records
related to the ITI Entity's Calculation of Closing Working Capital and the
preparation of the Closing Working Capital Report, including all working
papers prepared with respect to the ITI Entities' calculation of the Closing
Working Capital for the purpose of auditing the calculation. Sellers and
Sellers' Representative shall keep confidential such information reviewed as
part of Sellers' exercise of its audit rights, and such information shall not
be used by Sellers for any purpose other than confirming or evaluating the
Closing Working Capital. Sellers' costs of reviewing the books and records
shall be borne by the Sellers.

  

  

(e) If the Sellers disagree with the ITI Entities' computation of the Closing
Working Capital, then, within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Closing
Working Capital report, Sellers shall provide the ITI Entities with written
objections and Sellers' calculation of the Closing Working Capital ("Sellers'
Objections"); provided, however, if the Sellers elect to perform a review
pursuant to Section 2.6(d) above, then Sellers shall provide Sellers'
Objections within sixty (60) days of the ITI Entities making all financial
books and records available to Seller. Within thirty (30) days of the ITI
Entities' receipt of Sellers' Objections, the ITI Entities and Sellers shall
promptly commence good faith negotiations with a view to resolving any such
dispute, which negotiations shall continue for a period of thirty (30) days.
If the ITI Entities and Sellers are unable to resolve all disputes regarding
Closing Working Capital by mutual consent, such dispute shall be referred to
the Independent Accountant

  

  

(f) The ITI Entities and Sellers shall (i) use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the Independent Accountant to render a timely determination within
sixty (60) days following submission of the dispute to the Independent
Accountant, (ii) cooperate with the Independent Accountant, and (iii) provide
the Independent Accountant with the Closing Working Capital Report, Sellers'
Objections and each party's working papers and supporting documentation. The
ITI Entities and Sellers shall instruct the Independent Accountant to base its
determination on Schedule 2.6(a), this Agreement and the information and
documents submitted by each party.

  

  

(g) The determination of the Closing Working Capital by the Independent
Accountant shall be (i) prepared in accordance with GAAP and Schedule 2.6(a),
(ii) rendered in writing and delivered to the ITI Entities and Sellers within
sixty (60) days after submission of such dispute or as soon thereafter as
reasonably practicable as determined by the Independent Accountant, (iii)
final and binding upon the ITI Entities and Sellers, and (iv) enforceable in
any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States, in the same manner
as an arbitration award. The Independent Accountant's fees, costs and expenses
shall be borne equally by the ITI Entities and Sellers.

  

  

(h) Any payment due under this Section 2.6 shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the bank account designated by the payee.

personal property and other Taxes, utility and similar payments arising from
the ownership or use of the Purchased Assets, (ii) the accrued rents and other
payments under Assigned Contracts, and (iii) similar accrued items, all as
relating to a Straddle Period, the applicable ITI Entities shall be
responsible for the pro rata portion thereof based upon the number of days in
such Straddle Period following the Closing Date as a percentage of the total
number of days in such Straddle Period.

  

  

Section 2.8 Allocation of Purchase Price. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Parties shall agree and shall include, as Schedule 2.8, to be attached hereto,
the principles for allocation of the Purchase Price among the Purchased
Assets, including the assets of Fyfe Co. Such allocation shall be in
accordance with section 1060 of the Code. Sellers and the ITI Entities agree
following the Closing Date to promptly finalize the allocation of the Purchase
price among the Purchased Assets and the assets of Fyfe Co, with a separate
valuation for the assets of Fibrwrap Construction Canada, for all Income Tax
purposes (including financial accounting and Tax purposes) in accordance with
the principles set forth on Schedule 2.8. Except with respect to any
subsequent adjustments to the Purchase Price (which shall be allocated in the
same manner for allocating the Purchase Price as provided in such Schedule
2.8), the ITI Entities and Sellers covenant to prepare and file their
respective Tax Returns in a manner consistent with such allocation and not to
take any position in any Tax Return, or examination or other administrative or
judicial Proceeding relating to any Tax Return, or for financial accounting
purposes that is inconsistent with such allocation. The ITI Entities and
Sellers each shall file with their federal Income Tax Returns an appropriate
IRS Form 8594 reflecting such allocation.

  

  

Section 2.9 Closings. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement with respect to the North American Companies (the "Closing") shall
take place at a location or locations mutually satisfactory to the Parties
commencing at 10:00 a.m. local time (i) on a date mutually agreeable to the
ITI Entities and Sellers that is at least three (3) Business Days but not more
than then (10) Business Days after the ITI Entities have notified Sellers of
the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to the obligations of the Parties
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (other than conditions with
respect to actions the respective Parties will take at the Closing itself), or
(ii) on such other date as the ITI Entities and Sellers may mutually agree in

States real property holding corporation within the meaning of Code section
897(c)(2) during the applicable periods specified in Code section
897(c)(1)(A)(ii). None of the assets of the any North American Company (i) are
property required to be treated as being owned by another Person for federal
Income Tax purposes, (ii) constitute "tax-exempt use property" within the
meaning of Code section 168(h)(1); (iii) are tax-exempt bond financed property
within the meaning of Code section 168(f); (iv) are subject to a section 467
rental agreement as defined in Code section 467. No Seller is a foreign person
within the meaning of Code section 1445.

  

  

(g) No ITI Entity will be required to include any item of income in, or
exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for any taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a result of any (i) change
in method of accounting for a taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing
Date under Code section 481(c) (or any corresponding or similar provision of
state, local or foreign Income Tax Law); (ii) "closing agreement" as described
in Code section 7121 (or any corresponding or similar provision of state,
local or foreign Income Tax Law) entered into on or prior to the Closing Date;
or (iii) installment sale made on or prior to the Closing Date, in each case
by the North American Companies.

  

  

(h) Schedule 4.23 accurately sets forth a list of all states, counties, cities
and other taxing jurisdictions (whether foreign or domestic) to which any Tax
is properly payable by a North American Company (other than income Taxes or
other Taxes for less than $1,000). No claim has ever been made by a
Governmental Authority in a jurisdiction where a North American Company does
not file Tax Returns that any North American Company is or may be subject to
taxation by that jurisdiction.

  

  

 

(i) The unpaid Taxes of the North American Companies (i) did not, as of the
end of the most recently completed fiscal year, exceed the reserve for Tax
Liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect
timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the
balance sheets of such entity included in the Financial Statements as of such
date (including in any notes thereto) and (ii) will not exceed that reserve as
adjusted for operations and transactions through the Closing Date in
accordance with the past custom and practice of such entities in filing their
Tax Returns.

 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(j) Schedule 4.23 properly identifies the proper tax status, as corporation or
partnership for federal, state and foreign income tax purposes of Fyfe Co. and
Specialized Fabrics and each such entity has been characterized as such since
its formation. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.23, each North American
Company that is currently properly treated as a partnership for federal income
tax purposes, has in place an effective Code section 754 election. Each North
American Company treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes
provides for an allocation of taxable income and loss in the event of any
purchase of an interest in such Related Entity as contemplated by this
Agreement using the closing of the books method.

  

  

(k) No North American Company has engaged in a "listed transaction" as
defined in Regulations section 1.6011-4(b)(2) or a "reportable transaction"
within the meaning of Code section 6707A.

  

  

(l) No North American Company has distributed stock of another Person, or has
had its stock distributed by another Person, in a transaction that was
purported or intended to be governed in whole or in part by Code section 355
or section 361. There are no elections made by any North American Comapny in
effect pursuant to Code section 338.

  

  

(m) For purposes of this Section 4.23 and Section 7.3, any reference to
Sellers or any North American Company shall include any predecessor thereto.

  

  

Section 4.24 Insurance. Schedule 4.24 sets forth a true and correct list of
the commercial general liability and product liability and all risk property
policies (the "Business Insurance Policies") held or maintained by or for the
benefit of any North American Company. The Business Insurance Policies are
held or maintained as of the date hereof. Schedule 4.24 sets forth, for each
Business Insurance Policy, the type of policy, the name of the insurer, the
amount of coverage, and the effective dates of the policy through which
coverage shall continue by virtue of premiums already paid. To the Knowledge
of Sellers, there is no claim by any North American Company pending under any
Business Insurance Policy as to which coverage has been denied or disputed by
the underwriters of such policies. Each Business Insurance Policy is in full
force and effect and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of, and is
enforceable against, the parties thereto in accordance with its terms. All
premiums with respect to the Business Insurance Policies covering all periods
up to and including the Closing Date have been paid and no notice of
cancellation or termination has been received with respect to any such
policies.

  

  

 

Section 4.25 Accounts Receivable. The accounts receivable of the North
American Companies reflected on the books and Records of the North American
Companies (except to the extent of the allowance for doubtful accounts
reflected on the Financial Statements): (a) are valid and existing; (b)
represent monies due as a result of transactions in the Ordinary Course of
Business, including but not limited, to amounts attributable to goods sold and
delivered or services rendered; (c) are subject to no refunds or other valid
adjustments or to any valid defenses or rights of set-off enforceable by third
parties on or affecting any thereof; and (d) are fully collectible.

 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Section 4.26 Transactions with Affiliates. Schedule 4.26 describes all
intercompany services and other arrangements, if any, provided to or on behalf
of the Business or any portion thereof by a North American Company or any
Affiliate of any North American Company, including services or products
provided to the Foreign Entities. Except as disclosed on Schedule 4.26 and
except with respect to the services and arrangements that are referenced in or
will otherwise be addressed by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents, the Business does not share any facilities or equipment with, or
purchase assets or services from, or provide products or services to, any
other businesses of any North American Company or any Affiliate of a North
American Company.

  

  

Section 4.27 Records. The copies of the Records of the North American
Companies which have been made available to the ITI Entities are correct and
complete copies.

  

  

Section 4.28 Broker's Fee. Neither the ITI Entities nor any of their
respective Affiliates has or shall have any Liability or otherwise suffer or
incur any loss as a result of, or in connection with, any brokerage or
finder's fee or other commission of any Person retained by Sellers or any of
their Affiliates in connection with this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents or any of the transactions contemplated thereby.

  

  

Section 4.29 Disclosure. No representation or warranty by Sellers in this
Agreement or in any Schedule or Exhibit to this Agreement, or in any
statement, list, certificate, agreement or other document prepared by Sellers
and furnished or to be furnished by Sellers in writing to the ITI Entities
pursuant to this Agreement, contains or will contain any untrue statement of
material fact, or omits or will omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements contained therein not
misleading in light of the circumstances under which they were made. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the information set forth in the
Schedules is accurate and complete in all material respects.

  

  

Section 4.30 No Other Representations or Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties in ARTICLE III and this ARTICLE IV, neither
Sellers, Fyfe Members, nor any other Person on behalf of Sellers or Fyfe
Members or any of their respective Affiliates has made any express or implied
representation or warranty either written or oral with respect to the North
American Companies or the Business or with respect to any other information
disclosed to the ITI Entities or their Affiliates or Representatives in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Sellers and Fyfe Members
disclaim any and all other representations and warranties, whether express or
implied.

legally binding obligations of the respective ITI Entities, as applicable,
enforceable in accordance with their terms and conditions, subject to the
effect of any applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium,

Person the right to accelerate (whether after the giving of notice or lapse of

Section 6.4 Antitrust Approvals. The Parties have, prior to the date of this
Agreement filed, or cause to be filed by their respective "ultimate parent
entities," with the FTC and the DOJ the notifications and other information
(if any) required to be filed under the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement and the Transaction Documents. The
ITI Entities and Sellers shall promptly proceed to prepare and file with the
Relevant Competition Authority such additional requests, reports or
notifications as may be required or, in the opinion of the ITI Entities or
Sellers, advisable, in connection with this Agreement. With respect to each of
the above filings, the Parties shall diligently and expeditiously prosecute,
and shall cooperate fully with each other in the prosecution of, such matters
including by permitting counsel for the other to review in advance, and
consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with any such
filings or any proposed written communication with any Relevant Competition
Authority and by providing counsel for the other with copies of all filings
and submissions made by such Party and all correspondence between such Party
(and its advisors) with any Relevant Competition Authority and any other
information supplied by such Party and such Party's Affiliates to a
Governmental Authority or received from such a Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that (a) materials may be redacted before being so provided (i) to
remove (A) references concerning the valuation of Sellers or any of the

avoid disclosure of other competitively sensitive information or to address
reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns, (b) copies of documents
filed by a Party pursuant to Item 4(c) of the Notification and Report Form

other Party, and (c) no Party shall be required to supply the other (or its
counsel) with copies (or in case of oral presentations, a summary) of any
information, documents or materials to the extent that any Law requires such
Party to restrict or prohibit access to any such properties or information.
The ITI Entities shall be solely responsible for payment all fees and expenses
(other than Sellers' and Fyfe Members' legal, accounting, consulting and
internal costs) of filings under the HSR Act and with any other Relevant
Competition Authority; provided, however, if the Closing occurs, Sellers shall
reimburse the ITI Entities for ½ of the filing fee (without regard to any of
the legal, accounting, consulting or preparation fees and expenses incurred by
the ITI Entities) paid by the ITI Entities to the Relevant Competition
Authority, which reimbursement shall be made as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price.

  

  

In the event an administration action or suit is threatened or instituted
challenging the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as violative of
the HSR Act, as amended, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as
amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended or any other federal,
state or foreign law or regulation or decree designed to prohibit, restrict or
regulate actions for the purpose or effect of foreign ownership,
monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, "Antitrust Laws"), the
Parties shall use their reasonable efforts to resolve such administrative
action or suit. The Parties agree to cooperate in good faith and jointly
determine the strategy and coordinate all activities with respect to seeking
any actions, consents, approvals or waivers of any Governmental Authority as
contemplated by this Section 6.4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Party
shall be required take any action with respect to satisfying any Antitrust
Laws which would bind such Party irrespective of whether the Closing occurs.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this Section 6.4 shall require, or be construed to require, a Party
to take or to refrain from taking any action, to agree to any disposition or
restriction with respect to any assets or operations of such Party or any of
its Affiliates, or to cause any of its Affiliates to do or agree to do any of
the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement, nothing in this Section 6.4 shall limit a Party's right to
terminate the Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(c) or Section 10.1(d) so long
as such Party has until such date complied in all material respects with its
obligations under this Section 6.4. Each of the ITI Entities and Sellers agree
to request early expiration or termination of the waiting or notice periods
under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to such transactions
contemplated hereby.

negotiations or submissions of proposals or offers in respect of an
Acquisition Transaction, (iii) furnish or cause to be furnished, to any
Person, any information concerning the Purchased Assets or Equity Securities
of the North American Companies or the Foreign Entities in connection with an
Acquisition Transaction, or (iv) otherwise cooperate in any way with, or
assist or participate in, facilitate or encourage, any effort or attempt by
any other Person to do or seek any of the foregoing.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Sellers and Fyfe Members shall (and shall cause their Representatives to)
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or
negotiations with any Persons (other than the ITI Entities) conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Transaction. Sellers agree not to
release any third party from the confidentiality and standstill provisions of
any agreement to which any Seller is a party.

  

  

Section 6.7 Notification; Disclosed Matters; Indemnification. Sellers shall
give prompt written notice to the ITI Entities of the occurrence, or failure
to occur, of any event of which Sellers' have Knowledge that has caused or
would be reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty of Sellers
or Fyfe Members contained in ARTICLE III or ARTICLE IV to be untrue or
inaccurate as of the Effective Date or any time from the Effective Date to the
Closing determined as if such representation or warranty were made at such
time or on the Closing Date. The disclosures in such written notice shall be
deemed to automatically supplement any Schedule specifically referenced in
such notice and any other Schedule to which the disclosure in such notice is
readily apparent; provided, that such disclosures must include reasonably
detailed information with respect to such disclosure. The disclosures in any
such written notice shall not qualify or cure any breach of or inaccuracy in
any representation or warranty in this Agreement made by Sellers or Fyfe
Members on or as of the Effective Date hereof for purposes of any rights or
remedies of the ITI Entities prior to Closing or for purposes of determining
whether the condition set forth in Section 8.1(a) has been satisfied; however,
if the Closing occurs, the disclosures in any such written notice shall
qualify and cure any breach or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty in
this Agreement (or certificate furnished to the ITI Entities hereunder) for
purposes of ARTICLE IX. Sellers and Fyfe Members shall not be liable under
ARTICLE IX for any breach or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty in
this Agreement if the ITI Entities have Knowledge of a fact, circumstance or
condition and have Knowledge that such fact, circumstance or condition renders
the representation or warranty materially untrue or inaccurate.

  

  

Section 6.8 Transferred Employees; Employee Agreements; 401(k) Plan. 
 

  

  

(a) Prior to Closing, Sellers shall permit the ITI Entities to interview those
Employees of the North American Companies as the ITI Entities may desire to
interview for a position of employment with the ITI Entities as of and
following the Closing. It is understood that the ITI Entities shall not be
obligated to extend offers of employment to any Employees. All employment
interviews and other evaluations (e.g., medical examinations, drug testing and
other processes normally conducted by the ITI Entities in the employment of
new employees) shall be at the sole expense of the ITI Entities. Sellers will
reasonably cooperate with such processes to the extent permitted under
applicable Law. The ITI Entities shall give reasonable notice to Sellers of
their intentions to conduct such interviews or evaluations and the ITI
Entities shall endeavor to conduct such interviews and evaluations so as to
not unreasonably interfere with the North American Companies operations of
their Business prior to the Closing.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Prior to the Closing, the ITI Entities will prepare a list of Employees of
the North American Companies which the ITI Entities desire to hire for
employment with the ITI Entities as of and following the Closing. On or prior
to the Closing Date, (a) the ITI Entities will make offers of employment on an
"at will" basis to, and will hire as of the Closing Date, all of such
Employees who accept the ITI Entities' offer of employment (subject to the ITI
Entities' learning of information that, in their sole discretion, makes such
employment unsuitable), and (b) the Sellers will cause the North American
Subsidiaries to terminate those Employees which the ITI Entities determine
will not continue employment after Closing. Employees of Sellers who accept
such offers of employment from the ITI Entities shall become employees of the
applicable ITI Entity as of the Closing Date (and together with the remaining
employees of the North American Subsidiaries, the "Transferred Employees").
Nothing herein shall require the ITI Entities to employ any Transferred
Employee for any length of time unless otherwise provided in a written
employment agreement.

  

  

(c) Except as expressly set forth in subsection (h) or (i), the ITI Entities
are not assuming any Benefit Plans in which any Employee participates or any
assets or liabilities thereunder. Effective as of the date an Employee becomes
a Transferred Employee, such Transferred Employee shall cease to be covered by
Sellers' Benefit Plans, except to the extent a Transferred Employee elects
continuation coverage in accordance with the requirements of Part 6 of
Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code or of any similar
state law. Sellers shall retain responsibility for all medical benefit claims
with respect to any Employee prior to the date such Employee becomes a
Transferred Employee. For purposes of this subsection, a claim shall be deemed
to have been incurred on the date the medical service giving rise to the claim
is performed. As soon as administratively practicable following the date an
Employee becomes a Transferred Employee, the ITI Entities shall provide
medical and dental coverage, life and accident insurance, and disability or
similar coverage under the ITI Entities' current plans (collectively, "ITI
Welfare Plans"), subject to the terms of such ITI Welfare Plans. Transferred
Employees shall be given credit for years of service with the North American
Companies for purposes of participating in ITI's Benefit Plans.

  

  

(d) Sellers shall provide to the ITI Entities access to employee records of
the North American Companies and, to the extent within the control of Sellers,
the Foreign Entities, as needed for the ITI Entities to comply with this
Section 6.8. Sellers and the ITI Entities shall cooperate with each other and
shall provide to the ITI Entities such documentation, information and
assistance as is reasonably necessary to effect the provisions of this Section
6.8. As soon as practicable following the Closing, Sellers will furnish to the
ITI Entities all employment records and employee data relating to Transferred
Employees, except to the extent the disclosure of such information is
prohibited by applicable Law or would result in any Liability to or Claims
against the Sellers or Fyfe Members.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

(e) Nothing herein shall be deemed to grant to any Employee or union third-
party beneficiary rights or claims of any kind or nature.

  

  

(f) If requested by the ITI Entities in writing, Sellers shall consent to the
designation of the ITI Entities or one or their Affiliates as successor
employer for payroll tax and income tax withholding purposes.

  

  

(g) Sellers will use reasonable commercial efforts to cooperate with the ITI
Entities in the negotiation and execution of New Employment Agreements with Ed
Fyfe, Heath Carr and such other Employees of the North American Companies
identified by the ITI Entities (each a "Key Employee" and collectively, the
"Key Employees"). Sellers shall use best efforts to cause a New Employment
Agreement for each Key Employee will be signed and delivered at Closing.

  

 

  

(h) Prior to Closing, Sellers shall amend the Fibrwrap Construction, Inc.
401(k) Savings Plan to transfer sponsorship of such plan to Fyfe Co., to limit
participation in such plan to eligible employees of FCLP, and, as of the last
day of the payroll period immediately preceding the Closing Date, freeze
participation by each North American Company and all ERISA Affiliates.

  

  

(i) Prior to Closing, Sellers shall amend the Fyfe Co., LLC 401(k) Savings
Plan to limit participation in such plan to eligible employees of Fyfe Co.
and, as of the last day of the payroll period immediately preceding the
Closing Date, freeze participation by each North American Company and all
ERISA Affiliates.

  

  

(j) From and after the Closing, the ITI Entities will initiate and complete
the procedures set forth on Schedule 6.8 (the "Procedures") to correct defects
in the Fibrwrap Construction, Inc. 401(k) Savings Plan and the Fyfe Co., LLC
401(k) Savings Plan (the "Deficiencies"). Sellers and the Fyfe Members agree
to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the ITI Entities and their Affiliates
after the Closing for any penalties, fines or costs (including attorney fees
of outside counsel, but not including internal costs within the ITI Entities
such as overhead costs) relating to the Deficiencies and to any correction
necessary or appropriate to maintain and assure the qualified status of such
plans, including, but not limited to, correcting discrimination testing
failures, plan document failures, and any other qualification defects
reasonably identified by the ITI Entities.

  

  

(k) The ITI Entities shall be responsible for any employment Liabilities
resulting from any ITI Entity terminating the employment of any Transferred
Employee after the Closing Date.

  

  

(l) At the Closing, the Parties shall reduce the Purchase Price by an amount
which will be paid by the ITI Entities to Employees of the North American
Companies after Closing as transactional bonuses (plus any applicable
employment taxes), with the amount and the timing of such payments to be as
directed by Sellers.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 6.9 Nontransferability of Assets. 
 

  

  

(a) To the extent that any Purchased Asset is not capable of being sold,
assigned, transferred, delivered, granted or conveyed or any Assumed Liability
is not capable of being assumed, all as contemplated herein (each, an
"Asset/Liability Transfer"), without the Consent of any Person (other than
Sellers, the ITI Entities or an Affiliate of Sellers or the ITI Entities),
including any Governmental Authority, if the ITI Entities are unable to
acquire the requisite Governmental Approvals to receive any Purchased Asset,
or if such Asset/Liability Transfer or attempted Asset/Liability Transfer
would be invalid, would destroy or would eliminate any Purchased Asset or
would constitute a breach of any Assigned Contract or a violation of any Law,
(i) this Agreement shall not constitute a sale, assignment, transfer,
delivery, grant, conveyance or assumption thereof, or an attempted sale,
assignment, transfer, delivery, grant, conveyance or assumption thereof, in
the absence of such Consent, and (ii) Sellers shall, to the extent
practicable, take all reasonable, lawful and appropriate steps to provide the
ITI Entities (or their Affiliates) the respective benefits and burdens of any
such sale, assignment, transfer, delivery, conveyance, grant or assumption of
the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities in accordance with the terms
hereof and the other applicable Transaction Documents. Each Party shall use
reasonable efforts to obtain any such Consent.

  

  

(b) Each Party undertakes to cooperate in good faith to ensure that it does
such acts and things as may be reasonably necessary to complete the
transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms hereof,
including securing as promptly as practicable all Consents required to assign
any Assigned Contracts, and each Party, on behalf of itself and its applicable
Affiliates, shall execute such Consents or other documents as may be
necessary. At all times after the date hereof, the Parties shall do such acts
and things as may be reasonably required for the purpose of giving to the ITI
Entities in accordance with the terms hereof and the other applicable
Transaction Documents the benefit and burden of the Purchased Assets and the
Assumed Liabilities, including using reasonable efforts in order to obtain the
Consent of any necessary third party to such documents and do such acts and
things as may be reasonably required for such purpose. Each Party shall be
responsible for all costs incurred by it in connection with or otherwise
relating to obtaining a Consent for any Asset/Liability Transfer.

  

  

(c) In the event that as of Closing, a Consent is unable to be obtained, the
ITI Entities are unable to acquire the requisite Governmental Approvals to
receive any Purchased Assets, or an Asset/Liability Transfer would be invalid,
would destroy or eliminate a Purchased Asset or would constitute a breach of
an Assigned Contract or a violation of any Law, Sellers shall continue to be
bound by and perform the applicable Assigned Contract or Assumed Liability
after Closing and, unless prohibited by Law or the terms thereof, the ITI
Entities shall, pay and discharge, to the extent the ITI Entities receive the
benefits of such Contract, the obligations of the North American Companies
thereunder as if such Assigned Contract or Assumed Liability had been
transferred or assumed in accordance with the terms hereof and to the extent
such obligations would have constituted an Assumed Liability if such Assigned
Contract or Assumed Liability had been transferred to or assumed by the ITI
Entities at the Closing. Sellers shall, as consideration for the performance
of such services, promptly pay and remit to the ITI Entities all money, rights
and other consideration received by Sellers in respect of such performance by
the ITI Entities. If and when after Closing, any such Consent shall be
obtained or such Assigned Contract or Assumed Liability shall otherwise become
saleable, assignable, transferable, deliverable, grantable, conveyable or
assumable, as applicable, such Asset/Liability Transfer shall become effective
automatically as of the Closing Date in accordance with ARTICLE II or other
applicable Transaction Documents without further action on the part of
Sellers, the ITI Entities or any of their respective Affiliates, and without
payment of further consideration.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

60

(a) Promptly following the Closing Date, Fyfe Group as the owner of Equity
Securities of Fibrwrap NC and Fibrwrap SE shall take all actions to dissolve

NC and Fibrwrap SE shall continue to be bound by and perform in the Ordinary
Course of Business all Contracts for the provision of products and services to
customers of their Business (the "SE and NC Contracts") for the benefit of the
ITI Entities. As part of the dissolution process and to make provision for
their current outstanding obligations under the SE and NC Contracts, Fyfe
Group shall cause Fibrwrap NC and Fibrwrap SE, to the extent practicable, to
take all reasonable, lawful and appropriate steps to provide the ITI Entities
(or their Affiliates) the respective benefits and burdens of any such
Contracts and such services shall be performed pursuant to the Transitional
Services Agreement. The ITI Entities shall, pay and discharge, to the extent
the ITI Entities receive the benefits of the SE and NC Contracts, the
obligations of the North American Companies thereunder as if such SE and NC
Contracts had been transferred or assumed in accordance with the terms hereof.
Fibrwrap SE and Fibrwrap NC shall, as consideration for the performance of
such services, promptly pay and remit to the ITI Entities all money, rights
and other consideration received by Fibrwrap SE and Fibrwrap NC in respect of
such performance by the ITI Entities.

  

  

(b) Promptly following the completion of the SE and NC Contracts, if so
elected by the ITI Entities, Fyfe Group shall cause Fibrwrap NC and Fibrwrap
SE to transfer and assign to ITI Sub 2 for consideration reasonably agreed
upon by the Parties, the Personal Property, Records and goodwill of the
Business and such additional Contracts of Fibrwrap NC and Fibrwrap SE as shall
be mutually agreed upon by the Parties (including, without limitation,
existing real property lease agreements). Sellers and the Fyfe Members agree
to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the ITI Entities and their Affiliates
after the Closing for any Claims associated with the liquidation and
dissolution of the Business of Fibrwrap NC and Fibrwrap SE.

  

  

(c) Promptly following the completion of the SE and NC Contracts, Fibrwrap NC

Section 6.11 Post Closing Name Changes. Promptly following the Closing Date,
Sellers shall take all actions required to change the name of all North
American Companies (other than Fyfe Co. and Specialized Fabrics) to remove all
references to "Fyfe" and "Fibrwrap;" provided, however, any Seller providing
services pursuant to Section 6.9 or under the Transition Services Agreement
shall be authorized to continue use of such names solely during the term of
the Transition Services Agreement for the purpose of providing such services.

  

  

Section 6.12 Duties With Respect to Withdrawal Liability; Release of Escrow.

  

  

(a) Promptly following the Closing Date, but in no event later than thirty
days after the Closing Date, Sellers shall notify the trustees of the
applicable multi-employer pension funds (the "Trustees") that, as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Sellers no longer have any
obligation to contribute to such funds and Sellers request information on the
amount of any withdrawal liabilities owed by the North American Companies
("Seller Withdrawal Liability"). Upon receipt by Sellers of correspondence
notifying Sellers of the amount of any Seller Withdrawal Liability, Sellers
shall promptly pay any undisputed amount of the Seller Withdrawal Liability.
Sellers shall promptly provide the ITI Entities with copies of all such
correspondence.

the amount of the Escrowed Purchase Price, less (ii) any claims made or
pending against the Escrowed Purchase Price pursuant to ARTICLE IX, less (iii)
the amount, if any, of any Seller Withdrawal Liability which is disputed by
Sellers and/or which has not been paid, or, if Sellers have not then received
notice from the Trustees of the amount of the Seller Withdrawal Liability, an
amount equal to a reasonable estimate of the Seller Withdrawal Liability not
to exceed $5,000,000 (the "Estimated Liability"). After the date of this
initial release of funds from the Escrow Fund, when Sellers receive notice of
the amount of the Seller Withdrawal Liability or resolves any dispute over the
amount with a Trustee, amounts retained as the Estimated Liability shall be
paid to the applicable Trustee and all other amounts (less any claims made or
pending described in (ii) or any other disputed amount of the Seller
Withdrawal Liability) shall be paid out of the Escrowed Purchase Price to
Sellers. Upon the date which is 30 months after the Closing Date, if Sellers
still have not received notice of the amount of the Seller Withdrawal
Liability, the amount of the Estimated Liability shall be paid to Sellers
(less any claims made or pending described in (ii)). Prior to the date that is
18 months after the Closing Date, no amounts will be released from the Escrow
Fund to pay any Seller Withdrawal Liability, which amounts shall be paid by
Sellers directly.

ARTICLE VII

  

Additional Post-Closing Covenants

  

  

The Parties agree as follows with respect to the period following the Closing:

  

  

Section 7.1 General. In case at any time after the Closing any further action
is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each
Party will take such further action (including the execution and delivery of
such further instruments and documents) as the othter Party reasonably may
request, all at the sole cost and expense of the requesting Party (unless the
requesting Party is entitled to indemnification therefor under ARTICLE IX
below and except as otherwise provided herein).

  

  

Section 7.2 Noncompetition; Nonsolicitation; Confidentiality. 
 

  

  

(a) Except to the extent permitted by the Transitional Services Agreement,
each of the Sellers, Fyfe Members and Ed Fyfe agrees that, during the period
beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the fifth anniversary of the
Closing Date (the "Restricted Period"), neither it nor any of its Affiliates,
Fibrwrap NC or Fibrwrap SE shall, directly or indirectly, (i) in any manner
engage in the Business anywhere in the United States, Canada and, as of the
Acquisition Date of any Foreign Entity, any other country where such Acquired
Foreign Entity does business on the Acquisition Date (the "Territory") or (ii)
participate as a stockholder, member, partner, agent or representative or
other independent contractor of, or have any direct or indirect financial
interest in, any enterprise that is engaged, or, to the knowledge of such
Seller or Fyfe Member, plans to engage, in the Business anywhere in the
Territory. For the avoidance of doubt, as of the Closing Date, the Territory
shall only include the United States and Canada, and on the Acquisition Date
of any Acquired Foreign Entity, the Territory shall be expanded to include the
country where such Acquired Foreign Entity does business. Nothing contained in
this Section 7.2(a) shall prohibit any Party from owning any securities of any
Person (other than a natural Person) whose securities are traded on a
recognized securities exchange, so long as such ownership interest does not
exceed five percent (5%) of the Equity Securities of such Person. For purposes
of this Section 7.2, the term "Affiliates" shall not include any partners of
any Bison Party or any Affiliates of such partners.

  

  

 

(b) Sellers and Fyfe Members agree that, during the Restricted Period, neither
they nor any of their Affiliates, Fibrwrap SE or Fibrwrap NC shall: (i) cause,
solicit, induce or encourage any employees to leave employment with an ITI
Entity, provided, however, this prohibition shall not apply to any employee
who responds to a public solicitation not targeted directly at such employee,
an ITI Entity or their Affiliates or the Business; (ii) cause, induce or
encourage any material customer or supplier to terminate or modify any
relationship with an ITI Entity; or (iii) make or otherwise publish statements
that disparage the ITI Entities or any of their Affiliates.

 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(c) From and after the date hereof, Sellers and Fyfe Members and their
Affiliates, and their respective officers and directors shall not directly or
indirectly, and Fyfe Group shall cause Fibrwrap NC and Fibrwrap SE not to
directly or indirectly, (i) disclose, reveal, divulge or communicate to any
Person other than authorized officers, directors, attorneys, accountants and
advisors of the Sellers or Fyfe Members, or (ii) use or otherwise exploit for
its own benefit or for the benefit of anyone other than the ITI Entities, any
Confidential Information (as defined below) except as required to allow the
Foreign Entities to operate their Business after the Closing in the Ordinary
Course of Business. Sellers, Fyfe Members, their Affiliates and their
respective officers, directors and Affiliates shall not have any obligation to
keep confidential any Confidential Information if and to the extent disclosure
thereof is specifically required by Law; provided, however, that in the event
disclosure is required by applicable Law, Sellers and Fyfe Members shall, to
the extent reasonably possible, provide the ITI Entities with prompt notice of
such requirement prior to making any disclosure so that the ITI Entities may
seek an appropriate protective order. For purposes of this Section 7.2(c),
"Confidential Information" means any information with respect to the Business,
the Purchased Assets, the North American Companies and the Foreign Entities,
including methods of operation, customers, customer lists, products, prices,
fees, costs, Technology, inventions, trade secrets, Know-How, Software,
marketing methods, plans, personnel, suppliers, competitors, markets or other
specialized information or proprietary matters. Confidential Information does
not include, and there shall be no obligation hereunder with respect to,
information that (i) is generally available to the public on the date of this
Agreement; (ii) becomes generally available to the public other than as a
result of a disclosure not otherwise permissible hereunder after the date of
this Agreement; (iii) information or techniques that are independently
developed by any Seller, Fyfe Member or any of their Affiliates or
Representatives without the use or application of Confidential Information;
(iv) information that is or becomes available to any Seller or Fyfe Member or
any of their Affiliates from a third party who is under no confidential or
fiduciary obligation to the ITI Entities or any Affiliate of the ITI Entities
with respect to such information; and (vi) information in connection with
submitting proof or evidence in any Proceeding to enforce any Seller's or Fyfe
Member's rights and remedies under this Agreement or any of the Transaction
Documents.

  

  

(d) The Parties acknowledge and agree that the time, scope, and other
provisions of this Section 7.2 have been specifically negotiated by
sophisticated commercial parties and specifically hereby agree that such time,
scope and other provisions are reasonable under the circumstances. The Parties
further agree that if, at any time, despite the express agreement of the
Parties, a court of competent jurisdiction holds that any portion of this
Section 7.2 is unenforceable because any of the restrictions therein are
unreasonable, or for any other reason, such decision shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of any of the other provisions of this Agreement,
and the maximum restrictions of time or scope reasonable under the
circumstances, as determined by such court, will be substituted for any such
restrictions which are held unenforceable.

  

  

Section 7.3 Taxes; Prorations. 
 

  

  

(a) Tax Returns and Audits. Sellers shall cause to be timely paid, before the
same shall become delinquent and before penalties accrue thereon, all Taxes
(i) shown (or required to be shown) to be due on any Tax Return (or amendment
thereto) filed (or required to be filed) by the North American Companies with
respect to taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date or portions of
all taxable periods beginning prior to the Closing Date and ending after the
Closing Date for that portion of such taxable period up to and including the
Closing Date whether such Tax Returns are required to be filed on, before or
after the Closing Date and (ii) that become due from, or payable by, the North
American Companies with respect to such periods. All such Tax Returns shall be
filed or caused to be filed by the North American Companies and shall be
prepared using accounting methods that were used in preparing the relevant Tax
Returns for prior taxable periods.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

 

(b) Tax Convention. Whenever it is necessary for purposes of the Closing, any
indemnification required under this Section 7.3 or any other provision of this
Agreement to determine any liability for Taxes attributable to a taxable
period that begins before the Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date (a
"Straddle Period"), the determination as to the portion of such Taxes payable
for the period ending on the Closing Date, other than any ad valorem or
property Taxes, shall be made by treating the Closing Date as the end of a
short taxable year of Sellers based on an interim closing of the books. In
making this computation, exemptions, allowances, or deductions calculated on
an annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, shall be apportioned
as provided in the Code. All personal property Taxes which are past due upon
any Purchased Assets or the assets of any North American Company prior to the
Closing Date shall be paid by Sellers (or if any Seller has objected to such
Taxes, such Seller shall assume responsibility for such Taxes), together with
any penalty or interest thereon. Current personal property Taxes attributable
to the Purchased Assets or the assets of Fyfe Co. or Specialized Fabrics, for
any Straddle Period shall be prorated and adjusted between Sellers and the ITI
Entities as of the Closing Date on a per diem basis based on the number of
days in the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date ("Pre-
Closing Period") and the number of days of such taxable period beginning on
the day after the Closing Date ("Post-Closing Period"). Sellers shall be
liable for the proportionate amount of such Taxes that is attributable to the
Pre-Closing Period, and the ITI Entities shall be liable for the proportionate
amount of such Taxes that is attributable to the Post-Closing Period. If
current Tax bills are unavailable at the Closing Date, the prior year's Tax
bills shall be used for proration purposes and when the current year's Tax
bills are received, the proration shall be recalculated and the appropriate
payment shall be made forthwith.

  

 

  

(c) Post-Closing Audits and Other Proceedings. From and after the Closing
Date, the Sellers and the ITI Entities shall give prompt notice to each other
of any proposed adjustment by any taxing authority to Taxes of the North
American Companies for any Pre-Closing Periods and any Straddle Period.
Sellers, at their expense, shall have the right to assume control of any
audit, claim for refund or administrative or judicial proceeding involving any
asserted Tax adjustment with respect to any Pre-Closing Period; provided, that
Sellers shall not settle any such Tax Liability without the prior written
consent of the ITI Entities (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld), The ITI Entities, at their expense, shall control all proceedings
taken in connection with any Tax Liability relating to Taxes of the Business
of the North American Companies or the Purchased Assets for any Straddle
Period taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date;
provided that if there is a tax Proceeding in which there is a possibility
that the Sellers may become liable under this Section 7.3 or ARTICLE IX, the
ITI Entities shall not settle any such Tax Liability without the prior written
consent of Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If there
is a settlement or other disposition of the Tax proceeding and the Taxes owed
on account of any Taxes in respect of any Pre-Closing Period or that portion
of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date exceed the Taxes shown on
any such Tax Return for such Tax period, the ITI Entities shall be entitled to
receive from the Sellers, at least ten (10) days in advance of any payment of
any such additional Taxes that they, Fyfe Co. or Specialized Fabrics or any
Affiliate thereof pays to any Governmental Authority in connection with the
settlement or other disposition of such proceeding, the portion of any such
additional Taxes attributable to such Taxes.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Cooperation and Assistance. From time to time after the Closing, each
Party shall permit reasonable access, and shall cause their respective
accountants and other representatives to permit reasonable access to each
other, the information that they or their accountants or other representatives
have within their control and that may be reasonably necessary in connection
with the preparation of any Tax Return relating to the North American
Companies or the examination by any taxing authority or other administrative
or judicial proceeding relating to any Tax Return relating to the North
American Companies. The North American Companies shall retain or cause to be
retained, until the applicable statutes of limitations (including any
extensions) have expired, copies of all Tax Returns relating to the North
American Companies for all taxable periods beginning before the Closing Date,
together with supporting work schedules and other records or information that
may be relevant to such Tax Returns.

  

  

(e) Certain Tax Matters. Prior to Closing, Sellers shall not make or permit to
be made in respect of the North American Companies any change in any election,
annual accounting period, adoption of any accounting method, filing of any
amended Tax Return, entering into of any closing agreement, settlement of any
Tax claim or assessment, surrender of any claim to a refund of Taxes, or take
or permit any other similar action, or omit to take any action relating to the
filing of any Tax Return or the payment of any Tax, if such election, change,
amendment, agreement, settlement, surrender, Consent or other action or
omission would have the effect of increasing the present or future Tax
Liability or decreasing any present or future Tax benefit relating to the ITI
Entities or the Purchased Assets, as the case may be.

  

  

 

(f) Amended Returns. Following the Closing, Sellers shall not amend, cause to
be amended, or permit to be amended, any Tax Return relating to any North

commercially reasonable efforts not to convert such checks into cash),
correspondence, documents or other property that they may receive on or after
the Closing that properly belongs to the other party, including without

exclusive remedy after the Closing for any breach of this Agreement; provided

(a) Subject to the provisions of this ARTICLE IX, Sellers and Fyfe Members
agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the ITI Entities, their
respective Affiliates and their officers, directors, representatives, agents
and employees (the "ITI Indemnified Parties") from and after the Closing,
against any and all Claims to the extent such Claims are based upon, arise out
of or are related to (i) a breach of any representation or warranty of Fyfe
Members or Sellers set forth in this Agreement, (ii) any failure to perform or

employee documentation, terms and conditions of employment and wages and
hours, equal employment opportunity, nondiscrimination, immigration, benefits,

71  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The liability of the Sellers for Claims for indemnification under any
provision of this Agreement shall be on a joint and several basis. The
liability of the Fyfe Members for claims for indemnification under this
Agreement shall be on a several and not joint basis and, as among the Fyfe
Members, a Fyfe Member shall be liable only for its proportionate share of
such Claims pro rata based on its percentage ownership of Fyfe Group as of the
Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentences of this subsection, with
respect to any representation, warranty or covenant which is made by a Fyfe
Member with respect to itself (in the case of a representation or warranty) or
which is to be performed personally by a Fyfe Member or which is within such
Fyfe Member's control (with respect to a covenant), such Fyfe Member shall be
solely responsible for all Claims for indemnification which arise as a result
of its breach of such representation, warranty or covenant. By way of example
and not for purposes of limitation, if a particular Fyfe Member breaches the
representation contained in Section 3.1(a) with respect to itself or breaches
the covenant contained in Section 7.2, such Fyfe Member shall be solely
responsible for all Claims for indemnification in connection with such breach
and the other Fyfe Members and Sellers shall have no liability for such
breach.

  

  

Section 9.3 Indemnification by the ITI Entities. Subject to the provisions of
this ARTICLE IX, the ITI Entities jointly and severally agree to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Sellers, Fyfe Members and their respective Affiliates
and their officers, directors, representatives, agents and employees (the
"Fyfe Indemnified Parties") from and after the Closing, against any and all
Claims to the extent such Claims are based upon, arise out of or are related
to (i) a breach of any representation or warranty of the ITI Entities set
forth in this Agreement, (ii) any failure to perform or comply with any of the
covenants, conditions or agreements of the ITI Entities set forth in this
Agreement, (iii) the Assumed Liabilities, and (iv) the conduct of the Business
and ownership of the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities from and
after the Closing, provided, that the ITI Entities shall not be obligated to
indemnify the Fyfe Indemnified Parties to the extent that Claims under (iv)
occur as a result of the ITI Entities operating the Business in the manner
conducted prior to Closing in reasonable reliance on any representation or
warranty of Sellers or the Fyfe Members in Article IV.

  

  

 

Section 9.4 Certain Limitations on Indemnification. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained anywhere in this Agreement:

apply to the amount of all such Claims, including the full amount of the
Basket. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitation of the Basket shall not

intentional misconduct on the part of a Seller or Fyfe Member; and (C) Claims

(ii) The ITI Entities shall have no obligation to indemnify the Fyfe
Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 9.3 until the Fyfe Indemnified Parties

in the aggregate, and (2) with respect to all Sellers and Fyfe Members other
than the Bison Parties, $30,000,000 in the aggregate;

liability for Claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(ii) where
the breach is by a Fyfe Member of a covenant which is to be performed
personally by such Fyfe Member or which is within the control of such Fyfe
Member, such Claims shall not be subject to any maximum Liability limitation;
and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

73

Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 9.2 with respect to any individual
matter or group of substantially related matters unless the Claims based on,
attributable to or arising from such matter or group of substantially related
matters equals or exceeds $10,000 (the "De Minimis Threshold").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitation of the De Minimis Threshold
shall not apply to Claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 6.8(j) and
Section 6.10(b).

  

  

(ii) The ITI Entities shall not be required to indemnify the Fyfe Indemnified
Parties pursuant to Section 9.3 with respect to any individual matter or group
of substantially related matters unless the Claims based on, attributable to
or arising from such matter or group of substantially related matters equals
or exceeds the De Minimis Threshold.

  

  

(d) Section 4.25 Claims. The ITI Entities shall not compromise an accounts
receivable transferred by Sellers pursuant to this Agreement without Sellers'
prior consent. In connection with any Claim for indemnification, to the extent
that the ITI Entities are indemnified for such Claim with respect to any
uncollected receivable, the ITI Entities shall assign or reconvey the
uncollected receivable to Sellers.

obligation to indemnify shall be interpreted to include obligations under
Sections 9.2 and 9.3 to defend and hold harmless.

PARTY SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO ANY OTHER PARTY FOR SUCH OTHER PARTY'S LOST
PROFITS, LOST OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF BUSINESS REPUTATION OR DIMINUTION IN VALUE,
INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, SPECULATIVE, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL,
INDIRECT OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. THE RESTRICTION SET FORTH IN THE FOREGOING

INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, SPECULATIVE, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL,
INDIRECT OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.

  

  

Section 9.5 Indemnification Procedures. 
 

  

  

(a) If any third party shall notify any Party (the "Indemnified Party") with
respect to any matter (a "Third Party Claim") which may give rise to a Claim
for indemnification against any other Party (the "Indemnifying Party") then
the Indemnified Party shall promptly (and in any event within 15 Business Days
after receiving notice of the Third Party Claim) notify each Indemnifying
Party thereof in writing. The failure to notify the Indemnifying Party
promptly of a Third Party Claim shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from
its indemnification obligation hereunder, except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby.

  

  

(b) Any Indemnifying Party will have the right at any time to assume and
thereafter conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim with counsel of its
choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; provided, however,
that the Indemnifying Party shall not waive any defense, cause of action or
counterclaim or consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
conditioned, delayed or withheld. In the event that the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense as provided in this Section 9.5, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to participate in such defense (including with counsel of
its choice), at its own expense, and the Parties shall reasonably cooperate
with one another in connection with such defense and participation. In the
event that the Indemnified Party shall in good faith determine that the
Indemnifying Party may have a conflict of interest as a result of defenses or
counterclaims that are inconsistent with one or more of those that may be
available to the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party or its counsel
may control the outcome on the defense or counterclaim, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to: (i) Independent counsel at the sole cost of the
Indemnifying Party, subject to the limitations on Claims for indemnification
set forth in Section 9.4; or (ii) with the consent the Indemnifying Party,
shall take over and assume control over the defense, settlement, negotiations
or litigation relating to any such Third Party Claim. In the event the
Indemnified Party does so take over and assume control, the Indemnified Party
shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into a settlement with
respect to such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party. In all cases, the consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

75  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Unless and until an Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the Third
Party Claim as provided in Section 9.5(b) above, however, the Indemnified
Party may defend against the Third Party Claim in any manner it reasonably may
deem appropriate, on behalf of and for the risk of the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period during which the
Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense thereof, subject to the
limitations on Claims for indemnification set forth in Section 9.4.

  

  

(d) In no event will the Indemnified Party consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

  

(e) The Party assuming the defense under this Section 9.5 shall keep the
appropriate Parties reasonably informed regarding the progress and status
thereof.

  

  

(f) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a Claim against any
Indemnifying Party hereunder which does not involve a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly transmit to the Indemnifying Party a written
notice (the "Indemnity Notice") describing in reasonable detail the nature of
the Claim and the basis of the Indemnified Party's request for indemnification
under this Agreement, provided, however, that failure of the Indemnified Party
to give the Indemnity Notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from
Liability hereunder unless and solely to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party did not otherwise learn of such Claim and such failure results in the
forfeiture by the Indemnifying Party of substantial rights and defenses, and
will not in any event relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligations to
the Indemnified Party other than the indemnification obligation provided
herein.

  

  

Section 9.6 Escrow Fund. All liabilities of Fyfe Members and Sellers under
this ARTICLE IX shall first be paid or reimbursed out of the Escrow Fund by
release of the Escrowed Purchase Price to the ITI Entities. After exhaustion
of the Escrow Fund or upon the release of the Escrow Fund in accordance with
the terms of the Escrow Agreement, any claim for indemnification by the ITI
Indemnified Parties shall be satisfied by Fyfe Members and Sellers on a joint
and several basis.

hereby and all appeals and means of appeal therefrom have been exhausted;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

76  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) The ITI Entities may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to
Sellers at any time prior to the Closing (i) if Sellers or the Fyfe Members
have breached any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement, such breach would result in a condition set forth in Section 8.1(a)
or Section 8.1(b) not being met, the ITI Entities have notified Sellers of the
breach in writing, and the breach has continued without cure for a period of
30 days after written notice of breach or is incapable of being cured, or (ii)
if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before September 30,, 2011 (the
"Outside Closing Date"), by reason of the failure of any condition precedent
under Section 8.1 hereof (unless the failure results primarily from the ITI
Entities' materially breaching any representation, warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement); and

  

  

(d) Sellers may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the ITI
Entities at any time prior to the Closing (i) if the ITI Entities have
breached any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement,
such breach would result in the Closing condition set forth in Section 8.2(a),
Section 8.2(b) not being met, Sellers have notified the ITI Entities of the
breach in writing, and the breach has continued without cure for a period of
30 days after written notice of breach or is incapable of being cured, or (ii)
if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before September 30, 2011, by
reason of the failure of any condition precedent under Section 8.2 or Section
8.1(j) hereof (unless the failure results primarily from any Seller or any
Fyfe Member materially breaching any representation, warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement).

  

  

Section 10.2 Termination Fee; Effect of Termination.

  

  

(a) The ITI Entities shall pay to Sellers a termination fee in the amount of
$2,000,000 (the "Financing Termination Fee") in the event that this Agreement
is terminated by Sellers pursuant to Section 10.1(d) and the reason that the
Closing shall not have occurred on or before the Outside Closing Date is the
failure of the condition set forth in Section 8.1(j). All payments under this
Section 10.2(a) shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designated by Sellers. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, if the Closing fails to occur as a result of the failure of
the condition set forth in Section 8.1(j), then the Sellers' and the Fyfe
Members' sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise) against the ITI Entities for any breach, loss or damage
shall be to terminate this Agreement and receive payment of the Financing
Termination Fee in accordance with this Section 10.2(a); and upon payment of
the Financing Termination Fee, no Person shall have any rights or claims
against the ITI Entities under this Agreement or otherwise, whether at law or
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, including, without limitation, any
right to specific performance pursuant to Section 11.14.

  

  

(b) The ITI Entities shall pay to Sellers a fee in the amount of $100,000 in
the event that the Closing has not occurred by August 31, 2011 and the reason
that the Closing shall not have occurred on or before such date is the failure
of the condition set forth in Section 8.1(j).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

77  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(c) Except as set forth in this Section 10.2, if any Party terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1 above, all rights and obligations of the
Parties hereunder shall terminate without any Liability of any Party to any
other Party (except for any Liability of a Party then in breach).
Notwithstanding any other term of this Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreement and the provisions of this Section 10.2 and ARTICLE XI shall survive
any termination of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.

  

  

(d) THE PARTIES REALIZE THAT IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND
IMPRACTICABLE, IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE, TO ASCERTAIN WITH ANY DEGREE OF CERTAINTY
THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES THAT WOULD BE SUFFERED BY SELLERS AND FYFE MEMBERS IN
THE EVENT OF THE ITI ENTITIES FAILURE TO OBTAIN FINANCING SUFFICIENT TO
CONSUMMATE THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. THE PARTIES,
HAVING MADE DILIGENT BUT UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS TO ASCERTAIN THE ACTUAL
COMPENSATORY DAMAGES THE SELLERS AND FYFE MEMBERS WOULD SUFFER IN THE EVENT OF
SUCH DEFAULT, HEREBY AGREE THAT THE REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF SAID DAMAGES IS THE
AMOUNT OF THE FYFE TERMINATION FEE. THE AMOUNT OF THE FINANCING TERMINATION
FEE HAS BEEN DETERMINED BY THE PARTIES TO BE A REASONABLE SUM AS LIQUIDATED
DAMAGES.

  


 

  

  

ARTICLE XI

  

Miscellaneous

  

  

Section 11.1 Press Releases and Public Announcements. Prior to the Closing,
except as required by applicable Law, including the U.S. federal securities
laws, or listing agreement with any securities exchange, no Party shall, nor
shall any Party permit its Affiliates to, make any public announcement in
respect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the
prior written consent of the other Parties, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  


 

  

Section 11.2 Expenses. Except as otherwise set forth herein or in the other
Transaction Documents, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents shall be consummated, all fees,
costs and expenses incurred by or on behalf of a Party or its Affiliate in
connection with this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be borne by such Party
(including all fees of counsel, actuaries, accountants and other consultants
and advisors).

  

  

Section 11.3 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall not confer any
rights or remedies upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, and nothing contained herein, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any third-party
beneficiary right or any other legal or equitable rights, benefits or remedies
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 11.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Confidentiality
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents) constitutes the entire
agreement between the Parties and supersedes any prior understandings,
agreements, or representations by or between the Parties, written or oral, to

78  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 11.5 Succession and Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the Parties named herein and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. No Party may assign either this Agreement or
any of its rights, interest or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other Parties; provided, however, that the ITI Entities may
assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement to any of its
Affiliates upon written notice to Sellers, but such assignment shall not
constitute a release of the ITI Entities, which shall remain responsible for
performing any assigned obligation in the event the assignee fails to perform
such obligation. Any purported assignment or delegation in violation of this
Section 11.5 shall be null and void.

  

  

Section 11.6 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by means of facsimile), each of which shall be deemed
an original but all of which together will constitute one and the same
instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this
Agreement by facsimile, e-mail PDF or other electronic signature shall be
effective as delivery of an originally executed counterpart to this Agreement.

  

  

Section 11.7 Headings. The section headings contained in this Agreement are
inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 11.8 Notices. Any notice, request, demand or other communication
required or permitted under this Agreement (each a "notice" for purposes of
this Section) shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given
to and received by a Person (i) on the day such notice is personally delivered
to such Person, (ii) on the first Business Day after the day on which the
notice is deposited with an internationally recognized overnight courier

Party notice in the manner herein set forth.

  

  

Section 11.9 Governing Law; Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed and interpreted in accordance with the substantive Laws of the State
of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflicts of law
provision that would cause the application of the laws of a jurisdiction other
than Delaware; provided that the transfer of real estate and other assets
shall be governed by the Law that mandatorily applies thereto. Each Party
hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal or
state courts of Delaware (and any court to which an appeal may be taken
therefrom) for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising
out of this Agreement or the subject matter hereof or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby brought by any Party. Each Party irrevocably agrees that
all Claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined
in such federal court and hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert,
by way of motion, as a defense, or otherwise, in any such suit, action or
proceeding any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of
the above-named court, that the suit, action or proceeding is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of the suit, action or proceeding is
improper or that this Agreement or the subject matter hereof may not be
enforced in or by such court. Each Party consents to the service of process in
any suit, action or proceeding by the mailing, by certified mail, return
receipt requested, of copies thereof to such Party at any time at its address
to which notices are to be given pursuant to Section 11.8. Each Party agrees
that its submission to jurisdiction and consent to service of process by mail
is made for the express benefit of the other Parties. Final judgment against
any Party in any such suit, action or proceeding shall be conclusive, and may
be enforced in any other jurisdiction (i) by suit, action or proceeding on the
judgment, a certified or true copy of which shall be conclusive evidence of
the fact and the amount of Liability of the party therein described or (ii) in
any other manner provided by or pursuant to the Laws of such other
jurisdiction.

  

  

Section 11.10 Amendments and Waivers. No amendment of any provision of this
Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by
each of the Parties, and appropriately notarized to the extent required by
applicable law. No waiver by any Party of any provision of this Agreement or
any default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder,
whether intentional or not, shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing
and signed by the Party making such waiver, nor shall such waiver be deemed to
extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or breach of
warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by
virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

80  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 11.11 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or
the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction.

  

  

Section 11.12 Construction. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of
any of the provisions of this Agreement. Any reference to any federal, state
or local or foreign statute or Law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise.
The word "including" shall mean including without limitation.

  

  

Section 11.13 Incorporation of Exhibits and Schedules. The Exhibits and
Schedules identified in this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference
and made a part hereof.

  

  

Section 11.14 Specific Performance. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that
the other Parties would be irreparably injured if any of the provisions of
this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms and
that money damages may not or would not be an adequate remedy in such event.
Therefore, the non-breaching Party will be entitled to specific performance of
this Agreement and injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to specifically enforce the provisions hereof.
